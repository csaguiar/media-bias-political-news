A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati reinstated a 2017 case brought by Alison Taylor, who was issued 15 parking tickets in three years in Saginaw, Michigan, by the same parking enforcement officer, who's described in the suit as the city's ""most prolific issuer of parking tickets."" Taylor argued that marking tires with chalk constituted an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. But a U.S. district judge in Michigan dismissed the suit in 2017, writing that even if chalking a tire is a search, it's a reasonable one, because a piece of chalk isn't an ""information-gathering device"" that could violate Taylor's privacy, like a GPS tracker, for example. Download the NBC News app for breaking news The appeals panel Monday agreed that chalking a tire is a search. But the judges disagreed that it was a reasonable search. U.S. Circuit Judge Bernice Bouie Donald wrote that when drivers pull into parking spaces, ""the city commences its search on vehicles that are parked legally, without probable cause or even so much as 'individualized suspicion of wrongdoing' — the touchstone of the reasonableness standard."" Moreover, overstaying your welcome at a parking space doesn't cause ""injury or ongoing harm to the community,"" she wrote, meaning the city is wrong to argue that parking enforcement is part of its ""community caretaking"" responsibility, potentially justifying a search without a warrant. In fact, she wrote, ""there has been a trespass in this case because the City made intentional physical contact with Taylor's vehicle."" One More Thing: Parking authorities marking car tires with chalk ruled unconstitutional April 23, 2019 01:22 While Saginaw is entitled to regulate public parking, ""the manner in which it chooses to do so is not without constitutional limitation,"" Donald wrote. Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of Southern California, tweeted one suggestion: Take a picture of the car or its tires without ""trespassing"" on it with chalk. Third, and finally, seems easy enough these days for parking enforcers to just take a photo of the car, or even just a close-up photo of the tire, rather than chalk it. That way parking enforcement can learn the placement of the car w/o physically marking it. No 4A issues then. — Orin Kerr (@OrinKerr) April 22, 2019 Monday's ruling sends the lawsuit back to U.S. District Court in Bay City, Michigan. "

Samsung delays Galaxy Fold phone launch over screen problems,www.nbcnews.com,Reuters,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/samsung-delays-galaxy-fold-phone-launch-over-screen-problems-n997321,"Samsung Electronics Co said on Monday it would delay the retail launch of its Galaxy Fold smartphone for an unspecified period of time after reviewers discovered problems with the display, a hit to the reputation of the world's largest handset maker. Last week, reviewers started posting problems with the device on Twitter, but as of Friday the company did not know the root cause of the screen defects, according to Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, who said he was in direct contact with the company.
About 50 units of the $1,980 foldable device had been sent for review to journalists, analysts and bloggers in the United States ahead of a planned April 26 launch, Moorhead said.
The Samsung Galaxy Fold smartphone is seen during a media preview event in London on April 16, 2019. Kelvin Chan / AP file It was not immediately clear how many of the devices were defective. Four units sent to journalists and a YouTube personality contained problems, according to their posts on Twitter.
Samsung declined comment beyond a prepared statement.
""To fully evaluate this feedback and run further internal tests, we have decided to delay the release of the Galaxy Fold. We plan to announce the release date in the coming weeks,"" a Samsung spokesperson said on Monday.
Samsung also postponed media events for the device planned for this week in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
While Samsung has not said how long the delay could be or whether production of the unit has halted completely, some analysts said the delay was minor compared to the massive recall and production halt that the company endured with its Galaxy Note 7 in 2016.
""It's certainly an embarrassment to Samsung's reputation but this won't have much financial impact on them since they created a whole new category of foldables with this product. There is no market share to lose,"" said Moorhead, who added that his test version of the phone was working without any issues.
Instead of plaudits ahead of the phone's planned launch, the South Korean conglomerate has been blighted by a handful of technology journalists reporting breaks, bulges and blinking screens.
Samsung said initial findings showed that the issues could be associated with impact on exposed areas of the hinges. It also said there were instances where substances found inside the device affected the display performance.
Wayne Lam, an analyst with IHS Markit, predicted the issue would likely be resolved within a month.
""We all know that Samsung has a technology that works. It's likely that this glitch is a problem with mass production and the failure is just in the single digit percentage,"" he said.
Samsung has hailed the folding design as the future in a field that has seen few surprises since Apple Inc's iPhone in 2007. Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has also announced a folding handset, the Mate X.
Samsung was initially planning to begin South Korean and European sales of the unit in May and Chinese sales from an undisclosed date.
AT&T, one of Samsung's U.S. launch partners for the Galaxy Fold, said the carrier was working to communicate with customers who pre-ordered the device as soon as possible. AT&T did not disclose the number of pre-orders.

Sacramento Kings coach Luke Walton accused of sexual assault,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sacramento-kings-coach-luke-walton-accused-sexual-assault-n997346,"Luke Walton is being sued by a sports reporter who says the NBA coach sexually assaulted her, according to a court document filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court. The suit, which was first reported by TMZ, alleges that Walton groped and forcibly kissed the reporter, Kelli Tennant, in a Santa Monica hotel room on an unspecified date.
The Sacramento Kings coach, a former Los Angeles Lakers forward who won two championships with the team, previously served as assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors and head coach with the Lakers beginning in 2016.
Though the suit does not specify the date of the alleged assault, it indicates it happened while Walton was an assistant coach for the Warriors, a position he took beginning in the 2014-2015 season.
He was named the Kings new coach April 14.
Mark Baute, Walton's lawyer, said on Tuesday that Tennant's claim is ""baseless.""
""The accuser is an opportunist, not a victim, and her claim is not credible. We intend to prove this in a courtroom,"" Baute said in a statement.
The Kings said it was aware of the accusations.
""We are aware of the report and are gathering additional information. We have no further comment at this time,"" the team said Monday night.
The Lakers said the alleged incident occurred before Walton was the team's coach.
""At no time before or during his employment here was this allegation reported to the Lakers,"" a statement from the team said. ""If it had been, we would have immediately commenced an investigation and notified the NBA.""
The lawsuit alleges that Walton pinned Tennant — a former host of SportsNet LA — on the bed of his hotel room after she dropped off a book she'd written for student-athletes. Walton, who Tennant had known for years and considered a ""trusted mentor and colleague,"" had written the book's forward, according to the complaint, which claims sexual assault and battery.
Walton allegedly groped, forcefully kissed and held down Tennant, the complaint alleges.
""Terrified, Ms. Tennant immediately yelled 'Stop it,' and tried to free herself,"" the document says.
Tennant said Tuesday at a news conference with her lawyers that she was no longer comfortable staying silent.
""Out of nowhere, he got on top of me, and pinned me down to the bed, and held my arms down with all of his weight,"" Tennant said. ""He kissed my neck and my face and chest. And as I asked him to please stop and get off, he laughed at me.""
Walton allegedly continued to kiss her while she was pinned, Tennant said.
""And he continued to laugh at all of my pleas to get off and to stop,"" she said. ""I thought he was going to rape me.""
Tennant told ""certain people"" about the alleged assault, the suit states, but did not publicly report it because of her role as a sports broadcaster who covered the Lakers.
She said Tuesday that she was grateful that Walton was not based in Los Angeles, but that changed in 2016 after he was hired onto the Lakers.
Tennant said that Walton continued to make her uncomfortable at events where they were both attendees, including one for a charity she was on the board of.
""I had to moderate a panel with him and talk about how amazing he was for an hour,"" Tennant said. ""And it literally killed me inside.""
The suit was filed Monday but there is no indication of whether it has yet been served. It does not specify damages.
""By this lawsuit, Ms. Tennant speaks up and says #timesup to the culture of abuse women in the NBA that is demonstrated"" by Walton, the suit says.

Rivals are scrambling to dig up dirt on Pete Buttigieg,www.nbcnews.com,Josh Lederman,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rivals-are-scrambling-dig-dirt-pete-buttigieg-n997031,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Caught off guard by his sudden surge , Pete Buttigieg's rivals are scrambling to find vulnerabilities and lines of attack that can be used against him, five officials with opposing Democratic primary campaigns and Republican political groups tell NBC News. The situation is different than with Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, Democrats who have long been on the national scene and were widely expected to run for president. Potential rivals and GOP campaign groups have spent years hunting for dirt — known in political parlance as ""opposition research"" — that could be deployed against them. Major political groups had entire books of ""oppo"" ready to go by the time those candidates entered the race. Biden is expected to enter formally this week.
In contrast, Buttigieg was on nobody's radar as a serious presidential contender until a few weeks ago . As a millennial who has never held an office higher than mayor of a midsize town, his record is largely unexamined.
Now his competitors are rushing to file a flood of Freedom of Information Act requests, according to officials, collecting everything he's ever said in public or posted on social media, and poring over years-old budgets from South Bend, Indiana, where he's served as mayor since 2012.
One official from a rival Democratic presidential campaign described Buttigieg as ""a 37-year-old kid mayor, who nobody knows anything about.""
Buttigieg on hecklers: At this level you see the good, bad, ugly and peculiar April 17, 2019 01:04 ""He's getting a very significant free pass on a lot of stuff that other candidates aren't getting a free pass on,"" the official said, citing his willingness to take money from lobbyists as an example. ""There's a novelty there. People don't know anything about him, so he can kind of be whatever people want him to be. But if he sustains this, that will come down to earth.""
Until the last few weeks, the only group that had kept close tabs on Buttigieg and actively pushed back on him was the Indiana Republican Party. Officials said the state party took notice when Buttigieg in 2017 ran for Democratic National Committee chair, taking it as a sign that his ambitions extended beyond South Bend, population just over 100,000.
The Indiana GOP began opposing Buttigieg more aggressively in 2018, including criticizing his move that year to block the opening of a crisis pregnancy center that discourages abortion by overruling the municipal council's zoning decision. The state party has also worked to impugn his broader record as mayor, emphasizing high rates of violence and downplaying the significance of his electoral victories in South Bend, a comparatively liberal enclave within conservative-leaning Indiana.
Yet since Buttigieg starting attracting national attention, catapulting into third place in Democratic primary polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the state GOP has been consulting with the Republican National Committee about ways to effectively counter Buttigieg's campaign, officials said.
Officials with rival Democratic campaigns said that while they're still early in the process of digging through his record, they've already identified his likely vulnerabilities. A few issues have already worked their way into national press coverage of Buttigieg, including a re-examination of a fraught episode in which he demoted the city's black police chief, detailed in recent New York Times and NBC News reports .

""Our competitors can run their campaigns how they want,"" said Lis Smith, Buttigieg's top communications adviser. ""We're less interested in politics as usual and more focused on getting Mayor Pete's hopeful message of generational change out there.""
Other potential points of vulnerability include his signature project as mayor, the ""1,000 homes in 1,000 days"" initiative to rid South Bend of abandoned homes, and his years at McKinsey and Co., a business consulting firm that has drawn intense scrutiny from Democrats over some of its business practices. His opponents also plan to hit him on his reluctance to take definitive stances on policy issues like health care and immigration, officials said.
Colin Reed, a Republican strategist who specializes in opposition research, said any campaign competing with Buttigieg would be working expeditiously now to piece together his record as mayor, including every interview he ever gave, unpopular personnel decisions he made and any municipal correspondence in the public record. He said Buttigieg's work at McKinsey could be particularly ripe for ""guilt by association"" attacks given the current focus within the Democratic primary on ""purity and corporate responsibility.""
""In 2020 it was never going to be like 2016, where all the Republicans knew that Hillary Clinton was going to be the nominee and you essentially had four years to build a formidable opposition arsenal against her,"" said Reed, who constructed many of the earliest attacks on Warren as campaign manager for former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. ""There was always going to be a bit of this scramble.""

What Arya's sex scene in 'Game of Thrones' got right about young women and sex,www.nbcnews.com,Mikki Kendall,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/what-arya-s-sex-scene-game-thrones-got-right-about-ncna997306,"If there was ever a primer for depicting first-time sex in speculative fiction in the era of #MeToo, it was broadcast on HBO on Sunday night in a show about dragons and the undead best known for its rape scenes. [Spoilers ahead]
In the second episode of season eight of “Game of Thrones,” we are reminded that young Arya Stark isn’t just a killer of all those who have harmed her family. She’s also a young woman with a crush — on her friend Gendry — who has a chance to act on it before what she assumes will be her death.
 'Game of Thrones' episode two recap: Families reconcile, warriors reconnect and a knight gets her due The show has been foreshadowing that relationship since an infamous scene in episode five of season two, when a then-underage Arya stole peeks at Gendry’s bare chest. While fans may feel like they have seen Maisie Williams (who plays Arya) grow up from a young girl of 14 when she first appeared on the show, the actor is now 22 ( her character is believed to be 18 .)
It’s true that this scene veered heavily away from the standard depictions of teen sexuality: After all, media tropes about the first time young women have sex tend to feature the idea that they are consenting to the approach of a serious boyfriend, that they are being victimized by someone older. (That tracks with some of the available data: In surveys from 2006-10 , 73 percent of adolescent women report that their first intercourse was with someone with whom they were romantically involved, and only 41 percent — a record high — reported that their first sexual experience was “wanted.”)
Another common media trope is that women are somehow set up to be punished for choosing to have sex. In horror movies, the girl that’s shown having sex is probably going to end up dead. And even in ostensibly feminist shows like “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” the lead’s first sexual experience is largely a reaction to trauma, and it turns her love back to evil.
Related NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER Sign up for the THINK weekly newsletter! In “Game of Thrones” and other media in the epic fantasy genre, first-time sex is more likely be depicted as a sexual assault, or the young women will have no agency in choosing her partner (as in a forced marriage). That isn’t totally fantasy, though: Some 18 percent of young women report being sexually assaulted before 18 by another juvenile .
So, for a show that has relied so heavily on sexual violence against women, the scene with Arya and Gendry is refreshing because Arya is assertive and communicative. She asks about his history and explains her reasons for wanting to have sex. Being able to choose when you have sex, with whom you have sex and having a conversation about previous partners isn’t something that is often modeled for young women. Was it the most romantic sex scene ever? Maybe — or maybe not. That’s a question of perspective, but it was arguably one of the healthiest depictions of consent on the show and off it.
Fan reactions have been mixed; some are absolutely on board because they’ve been waiting for this payoff for the last several years. Others have responded with disgust because they see Arya (and, by proxy, Maisie Williams) as eternal children and seeing a young (and young looking) woman having sex, let alone sex on her own terms and as a result of desire, feels jarring. They compare her to their own siblings or children without seeming to recognize that her experience in this moment is one that would be good for their loved ones, too.
But, the average age of the onset of sexual activity in America for young women is 17; Arya was arguably doing exactly what many of the same people complaining about the plot line were doing at the age of 18. And, it’s worth noting that media imagery of what teens “look like” — because they’re so often portrayed on television and in the movies by actors up to 10 or more years older than the characters — makes it easy to forget that teens who don’t look like 25-year-old adults not only exist but are sexually active. It’s far less jarring to viewers to see people in their 20s (or approaching their 30s) “having sex” even if their characters are ostensibly teens.
And, the wild popularity of “Game of Thrones” stems in part from the fact that the most ardent TV viewers are in the 18-to-34 age range — which means that many viewers are now Arya’s age or were when the show started nearly eight years ago. They have grown up with her, and they, too, are now in the position to make real world decisions about sex.
 What the world would look like if we taught girls to rage Given that nearly half of teens are engaging in sexual activity, it’s important that they see characters who look like them making these choices for themselves. For the young viewers who have grown up alongside Arya, seeing sexual agency modeled in a show where so few women have it is incredibly important.
It's good for teens to see that there's no shame in desire, in wanting to connect or in pursuing someone you are interested in as long as they welcome that pursuit. No matter how uncomfortable it might make some people to think about, the reality is that not only are teens having sex, they are learning how to approach it from the media. And if no one is willing to show them what to do in a healthy way, then they have to create their own approaches.
If teens don’t understand consent, then how can they practice it? We may not like seeing it taught on a TV show, but given the statistics on teen sexual violence and the number of men and women who still say their first sexual experiences were unwanted, we clearly aren’t doing enough to teach it anywhere else.

New Zealand rescue helicopter crew found safe after crash,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-zealand-rescue-helicopter-crew-found-safe-after-crash-n997351,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Three crewmen aboard a helicopter that crashed off the New Zealand coast while on a rescue mission were found alive on a remote island Tuesday after they were missing overnight. Rescue Coordination Centre spokesman Mark Dittmer said the men were found shortly before noon in their survival suits walking along a beach on uninhabited Auckland Island, some 311 miles southwest of the town of Invercargill where they'd left from 16 hours earlier.
He said the crew had some injuries and were being flown by helicopter to a hospital in Invercargill. The wreckage of the helicopter was found in the water near a neighboring island.
Dittmer said that while they don't yet know all the details of what happened, it appears the helicopter crashed in the ocean near the islands and that the crew's survival suits, also known as dry suits, helped them survive the frigid and stormy waters. He said it's standard practice for crews to wear such suits while on rescue missions.
The helicopter left Monday evening to evacuate a person aboard a fishing boat who needed urgent medical attention, said rescue center duty manager Kevin Banaghan. On board were a pilot, a crew member and a paramedic.
He said the final contact with the helicopter was at 7:37 p.m. Monday, and it disappeared from radar tracking about 10 minutes later. He said there was no distress call and that the crew didn't activate their emergency beacons, which worried rescuers. He said the water was about 52 degrees at the time, and that the helicopter also contained a life raft.
Rescuers said the person on the fishing boat who prompted the evacuation attempt was also being transported to a hospital.

Mortgage rates are low. Here's how to figure out if you should refinance,www.nbcnews.com,"Michelle Fox, CNBC",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/mortgage-rates-are-low-here-s-how-figure-out-if-ncna997066,"The recent drop in mortgage rates may have you dreaming of buying a new home or refinancing your current house. You’re not alone.
Housing sentiment has surged thanks to those low rates, according to government-sponsored mortgage giant Fannie Mae. Its monthly survey, released Monday, shows that positive sentiment in March jumped to the highest level since June — which was just below the record high.
Mortgage application volume also rose after rates saw their biggest weekly decline at the end of March. Volumes were up 28 percent from a year prior, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.
But if you are among those who may be put off by the application process, or aren’t sure if it is the right move to make — you should still check things out, said Matt Weaver, loan officer and vice president of sales at Cross Country Mortgage, based in Boca Raton, Florida.
“Speak to someone that is a professional in the industry and get preapproved upfront to see where you stand — whether you are looking to buy today, six months from now or a year from now,” he said.
The deep drop in rates came in the week ended March 28. The average rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4.06 percent with an average 0.5 point, according to Freddie Mac. (Like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored mortgage company.)
Rates have since fluctuated slightly. The average 30-year home loan rate is now 4.07 percent, according to Bankrate’s latest survey of the country’s largest mortgage lenders on Monday.
“We did not think that we would see interest rates come back to these numbers,” Weaver said. “We were pretty certain the train had left the station and wasn’t coming back. It’s worth coming out and taking advantage of this.”
Homebuying: Know your number To start, it’s important to know how much you can afford.
For one, you’ll need money for a down payment.
Typically, that is about 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price of the home, depending on the type of mortgage. By putting down a higher amount, you may be able to lower the interest rate on your loan. However, there are also mortgages that allow lower down payments, such as 3% or 5%, and even some with no money down.
Bear in mind that you’ll have to take out private mortgage insurance if your down payment is less than 20 percent on a conventional loan. The annual cost of PMI is approximately 1 percent of your outstanding loan balance and is added to your monthly mortgage payment, according to Chase .
Next, figure how much you can spend on your monthly payment. That includes the principal, interest, property taxes and homeowners insurance.
Getting preapproved for a loan by a reputable bank or mortgage company will allow you to find how much you can borrow and what the best loan is for your situation.
“Meeting with an advisor to fully understand your options and the fundamental process is really critical,” said Lawrence Bailey, head of retail at Chase Home Lending.
The main thing banks look for is the amount of your debt-to-income ratio. It has to be below 43 percent to get a prequalification, according to Chase. They also look at your credit history and your planned down payment.
However, even if you get pre-qualified for a certain amount, you should still take a look at your budget before deciding how much you want to spend. Generally speaking, that means allocating 50 percent of your monthly income on “needs” such as your mortgage and other household expenses, 30 percent on your “wants” and 20 percent on your savings. Of course, it could vary depending on where you live.
Refinancing: When is it worth it? When it comes to whether you should refinance your current mortgage, Chase’s Bailey said he generally uses the “half point rule,” which means the new rate is at least 0.5 point lower than your current one.
However, in reality, it comes down calculating what you’ll be saving every month versus what it’s going to cost you to take out the new loan — and then figure out when you will break even, he explained. If you plan on staying in the house for longer than that time, it could be a good idea to refinance.
Depending on your timetable, you can also look to refinance at a shorter fixed period, such as a 15-year loan or an adjustable-rate loan that has a shorter fixed term before the rate adjusts. Those loans typically have a lower interest rate.
We did not think that we would see interest rates come back to these numbers...It’s worth coming out and taking advantage of this.
Matt Weaver, Crosscountry Mortgage
CrossCountry Mortgage’s Matt Weaver believes it is a “mistake” to only look at the savings you’ll get from the lower rate.
Refinancing can also allow you to pull out cash to do things like pay off some higher-interest debt, such as credit cards, fund a family circumstance, such as a wedding or college, or for home improvement.
Also, if you have an additional line of credit on the house in excess of $15,000 or $20,000 and no clear 24-month plan on how to get rid of that loan, Weaver said it would be worth consolidating it with the new mortgage.
Top real estate agents: How to get top dollar for your home July 13, 2018 02:50 When does an ARM make sense? To get a lower rate than the one on a typical 30-year loan, an adjustable-rate mortgage could be an option. These loans have a fixed-rate period before the rate moves based on the index it is tied to. That means you could wind up with a much higher rate once the fixed period ends.
“It really comes down to how long you plan on being in the home,” said Bailey.
Weaver agrees. He would only look at this option if you had a clear, defined time horizon. There are loans for five-year, seven-year and 10-year fixed periods.
“As long as your exit strategy matches the fixed period than it is worth considering,” he said.

“You have to figure out what the incentive is on why you want to buy the home,” Bailey said. “Are you buying it for the stability to raise your family and will you be there for a while?
“Or is it in investment opportunity?”
Bailey advises figuring out what you want to buy, in which neighborhood — and why. “Let that process play out,” he said, noting that rates will go up and will go down. “The one thing I’ve stopped doing ... is predicting what the rates will do.”
Weaver suggests those who have a short time horizon stay away from buying a home. If you plan on leaving the house in less than 36 months and you have no intention of holding onto it and converting it into a rental property, you should continue to rent, he said.

"Sri Lanka bombings were retaliation for Christchurch shooting, defense minister says",www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sri-lanka-bombing-was-retaliation-christchurch-shooting-defense-minister-says-n997391,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's defense minister said Tuesday that the coordinated Easter Sunday attacks that killed at least 321 people were in retaliation for the recent Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand. ""Extremist group named National Thowheed Jamaath carried out Sunday's terror attacks in response to terror attacks in Christchurch,"" Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said.
The shootings in March in New Zealand killed 50 people and led the country to take swift action to approve new gun control laws.
New Zealand officials classified the alleged gunman in the Christchurch shooting as a ""right-wing extremist terrorist"" who appeared to post a manifesto detailing his white-supremacist worldview and who had donated to a far-right Austrian group .

New Zealand officials said they are not able to confirm the connection.
""New Zealand has not yet seen any intelligence upon which such an assessment might be based,"" the office of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement.

Wijewardene also said the ""weakness"" of Sri Lanka's security apparatus, which had received warnings of an impending attack on the nation's churches, is to blame for failing to prevent the bombings, according to The Associated Press.
""We never expected it to be so big,"" Hemasiri Fernando, the chief of staff to Sri Lanka's president, told NBC News on Monday. ""We never thought it would happen so soon.""
Two days after the attack, the Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility but produced no evidence to support the claim.

Kamala Harris says House should begin impeachment process of Trump,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-says-house-should-begin-impeachment-process-trump-n997386,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., came out in favor of beginning the impeachment process against President Donald Trump on Monday night, joining Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as major 2020 candidates who've called for impeachment proceedings after the release of special report. During a CNN town hall, Harris said she believes ""Congress should take the steps toward impeachment."" But, adding that she's ""also a realist,"" Harris said it was highly unlikely that Senate Republicans would, if the House does vote to impeach Trump, vote to remove him from office.
""I've not seen any evidence to suggest that they will weigh on the facts instead of on partisan adherence to being protective of this president,"" she said. ""And that's what concerns me and what will be the eventual outcome. So we have to be realistic about what might be the end result, but that doesn't mean the process should not take hold.""
Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who announced a Democratic presidential bid on Monday, was asked by reporters before an event Tuesday where he falls on impeachment, considering Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the senator from his home state, was the first of the 2020 contenders to call for proceedings to begin.
“I voted on this over a year ago and I said that proceedings should move forward,” Moulton said, though he added, “It's not the right time to vote on impeachment because we don't have all the facts yet. We don't have the full version of the Mueller report. But we absolutely should move forward on the proceedings so we can have this debate in Congress, and frankly, I think it's long overdue, that's why I voted over a year ago to move forward with this debate.”
Moulton is the fourth Democratic presidential contender to call for proceedings to begin, following Warren, Harris, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.
Impeachment chatter has gained steam among Democrats since a redacted version of Mueller's report was made public last week. In a Friday tweet, Warren called on the House to begin impeachment proceedings. She said during her own CNN town hall on Monday that she did so after reading the entire 400-plus page report.
""The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,"" Warren wrote Friday. ""That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.""
On Sunday, the leaders of key House investigatory committees said that the possibility of impeachment proceedings was still on the table.
""I can foresee that possibly coming,"" House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., told CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" adding that he was ""not there yet"" on impeachment itself.
Then on Monday, House Democratic leaders pledged to pursue investigations into Trump, though they did not commit to launching impeachment proceedings
""We have to save our democracy. This isn’t about Democrats or Republicans. It’s about saving our democracy,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said during a conference call with rank-and-file members, one person on the call told NBC News . “If it is what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the Constitution, if that’s the place the facts take us, that’s the place we have to go.""
Mueller, in his extensive report on Russian election interference, looked into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials and whether the president had obstructed justice. The report concluded that his investigators were unable to establish a Trump-Russia conspiracy and refused to provide a traditional prosecutorial decision on obstruction.
Mueller wrote that his probe had ""established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government"" but that it ultimately ""did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.""
On obstruction, Mueller wrote that if his team ""had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.""
""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,"" he wrote, later saying that Trump's ""efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful because those who surrounded him declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.""
Felon voting rights During the five-hour forum Monday night on CNN, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who has emerged as a front-runner in the crowded Democratic field and has pushed the party to the left in recent years, repeated his call to restore the voting rights of felons — including people like the Boston Marathon bomber, who killed three people and injured hundreds in 2013 with a pair of pressure-cooker bombers and was sentenced to death.
""I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy,"" Sanders said. ""Yes, even for terrible people.""
Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel pounced on Sanders, saying on social media: ""If you had any doubt about how radical the Democrat Party has become, their 2020 frontrunner wants to let terrorists convicted of murdering American citizens vote from prison. It's beyond extreme.""

"Twitter stock jumps 8 percent after earnings report shows increase in users, revenue",www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/twitter-stock-jumps-8-percent-after-earnings-report-shows-increase-n997406,"Twitter stock jumped about 8 percent Tuesday morning after the company released earnings for its first quarter of 2019. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said the company is “taking a more proactive approach” to abuse on its platform by ""reducing the burden on victims and, where possible, taking action before abuse is reported,” according to a statement released by the company.
Twitter now removes 2.5 times more tweets sharing personal information and about 38 percent of abuse tweets taken down each week are detected by machine learning models, he said.
This quarter will be the last for which Twitter will report Monthly Active Users (MAUs), the company announced during its last earnings report. As a replacement, Twitter began to report what it calls monetizable daily active users (mDAUs) last quarter, which it said would better reflect its audience. This metric includes “Twitter users who log in and access Twitter on any given day through Twitter.com or our Twitter applications that are able to show ads,” according to the company.
Twitter reported 134 million average mDAUs for the first quarter, compared to 120 million in the same period last year. In Q4 2018, Twitter said it had 126 million mDAUs.
In the U.S., Twitter reported 28 million average mDAUs for Q1, compared to 26 million the same period last year. Twitter reported 105 million average international mDAUs for the first quarter, compared to 94 million in the same period last year.
The shift to a new metric came after Twitter reported MAUs that fell short of analyst estimates for two straight quarters during its fiscal year 2018. Twitter previously blamed the shortfall in part on a July purge of “locked” accounts that was meant to get rid of bots and fake users, among other factors.
Twitter forecast Q2 revenue between $770 million to $830 million, compared to analyst estimates of $783.9 million to $853.6 million, according to Refinitiv. The company reiterated its announcement from last quarter that it expects cash operating expenses to increase about 20 percent year over year in 2019 as it continues to invest in “health, conversation, revenue product and sales, and platform.”
Twitter’s stock slid on its last earnings report when it provided light guidance for Q1, but it’s still up about 10 percent over the past 12 months. Twitter has been toying with the best way to optimize the experience on the platform for user well-being rather than purely based on engagement metrics.
Dorsey told Rolling Stone in an interview published in January that his team has considered “what happens if we remove the ‘like’ counts from tweets.”
Twitter rolled out a public beta test through a separate app last month where it has tested new features, including hiding some replies by default to de-clutter conversations and hiding engagement options until a user taps on a tweet, TechCrunch reported."
Is 'Jeopardy' winner James Holzhauer making more per episode than host Alex Trebek?,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-making-more-episode-host-alex-trebek-n997421,"“Jeopardy” contestant James Holzhauer may be making the game show’s accountants tremble, according to a media report. Holzhauer, who has been setting records over the past 12 episodes, set a single-show record of $131,127 in winnings, The Atlantic reported. So far, he’s won around $850,000 and is on track to reaching $2.5 million — the record set by Ken Jennings — in half the time. Jennings scored his prize after 74 consecutive wins, and his best one-day tally was $75,000.
Since the average single-show earnings come in around $20,000, the Atlantic looked into how much Holzhauer’s earnings would take out of the show’s budget.
“Typically, for a long-running show the prize budget is determined by way of averages of what has been won in the past,” Bob Boden, former head of programming at Game Show Network, told The Atlantic. “James’ performance, I’m sure, is causing grief for an accountant somewhere.”
Oftentimes, shows take out insurance policies. Usually that’s reserved for shows with rare but high earnings, such as “Who Wants to be a Millionaire?” Boden said he doesn’t think “Jeopardy” has the same policy because it usually awards more modest winnings.
But even with a successful contestant, game shows’ budgets usually allocate more to on-air talent and production crews, said Boden. The Atlantic reported longtime host Alex Trebek’s yearly pay is $10 million.
With Holzhauer averaging roughly $71,000 per show, ""he is currently out-earning even the show’s host on a per-episode basis,"" predicted The Atlantic."
"Surprise medical bills: Two babies, two very different price tags",www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/surprise-medical-bills-two-babies-two-very-different-price-tags-n988926,"MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. — Their stories are identical in almost every way. Layla Parast and Erin Taylor had the same insurance from the same employer and gave birth at the same hospital. ""It was the first pregnancy for both of us,"" Parast said. ""And it was really fun to have someone to go through that with.""
Parast and Taylor both worked at the Santa Monica headquarters of the Rand Corporation, a policy research company. Both women have doctorates and analyze health care issues. Taylor specializes in health insurance.
While they were pregnant with their first kids in 2014, they used their knowledge to shop around together for the right doctors and hospitals.
""The main concern,"" Taylor said, ""actually was finding the hospital that was in our insurance network because we both had the same insurance through our company.""

Despite their expertise and their extensive research, however, one of the women could not steer clear of a persistent glitch in the American health insurance system — the surprise medical bill . Forty percent of Americans say they have received an unexpected and unwelcome bill for health care they thought was covered by their insurance.
Both Parast and Taylor settled on the same hospital, UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, and waited for their delivery dates. Parast went into labor first and had a ""pretty textbook"" delivery.
""When the pain started to get pretty unbearable, they asked me if I wanted an epidural and I said yes, so the anesthesiologist came, gave me an epidural,"" Parast said. ""A few hours later, my son arrived.""
A couple weeks later, Taylor went into labor. Like Parast, she got an epidural at the hospital, but her delivery took much longer.
Erin Taylor with her son Ben. ""It was a particularly painful process in the end,"" Taylor said, ""but [my son] was perfectly healthy, and everything turned out just fine.""
Both women expected their insurance company would be covering the vast majority of the cost of their deliveries. A few weeks later, Parast received a bill from the anesthesiologist for $1,600.
""I remember telling my husband, 'This seems really strange. Why would I get this big bill?'"" Parast said. ""I didn't want to get reminders and have it go to collections if I tried to figure out what was going on, so I just paid it and thought, 'I'll figure this out later.'""
Parast said she warned Taylor to watch out for a similar medical bill in the mail, something Taylor said she was surprised to hear.
""Here's an in-network hospital. Why in the world would we expect an anesthesiologist bill for the epidural?"" Taylor said. ""Both of us actually had the epidural put in, in the middle of the night and who's going to stop and think to ask the particular doctor or anesthesiologist that came into the room, you know, 'Excuse me, are you on my insurance before you do this to me because I don't want to get a big bill in the mail?'""
Taylor said she never got that bill in the mail, even though she went to the same hospital and had the same insurance. Her anesthesiologist was covered. Parast decided to investigate and called the insurance company. She said the woman on the phone told her she chose an out-of-network provider when she was in the hospital.
""I explained, 'I didn't choose anything,'"" Parast said. ""'I was in labor, and this is for getting the epidural.'""
She said the woman on the phone kept repeating the same line over and over — that she chose an out-of-network provider.
For Parast, it took several calls to her insurance company and plenty of frustration but she eventually got her money back , something that doesn't always happen.
What happened to Parast, which was first detailed on the website Health Affairs , can happen more often than patients think even if they plan for it. A recent poll by Kaiser Family Foundation found that four in 10 Americans have received a surprise medical bill.
Layla Parast with her baby Several health policy experts agreed that all parties share the blame in the system: the doctors, insurance companies and hospitals. Doctors can charge much higher prices for out-of-network care if they don't accept insurance. Insurance companies might negotiate service rates that are not competitive enough for doctors and hospitals to conduct their business. That could lead doctors to charge patients those out-of-network rates.
In California, where Parast and Taylor were treated, the state Legislature passed a law in 2016 protecting consumers from surprise medical bills when they go to in-network facilities. It also ensures patients only have to pay their in-network cost sharing amount. That means they only pay the share of costs covered by insurance that patients pay out of pocket.
However, that's not the case in all 50 states . Some states have protections like California's but there's no federal fix just yet. Three bills with bipartisan support are currently circulating in Congress, all aiming to put an end to surprise medical billing through different approaches.
Until federal legislation is passed, patients are left to stick up for themselves and be their own health care advocates. Health policy experts say the best thing a patient can do before receiving care — whether for a planned procedure or in an emergency if possible — is call the insurance company and make sure that the hospital and the doctor are both in-network. If a patient receives a surprise medical bill, he or she should call the insurance company or the doctor or hospital involved to figure it out.
In Parast's case, UCLA Medical Center, where she was treated, said at the time it had private anesthesiologists on staff who may not have participated in the hospital's insurance plans, which meant they could bill patients separately.
Parast's anesthesiologist, Dr. Ronald Wahlig, said his usual practice was to inform patients if he did not take their insurance but that wasn't always possible since childbirth can be unpredictable.
""I also routinely advised patients to contact my office if they had any concerns about their bill, and I frequently extended discounts to patients who were unaware of my out-of-network status,"" Wahlig said.
According to Wahlig, his records indicate Parast did not contact his office for help and that it was a ""rare exception"" when his practice was not able to address a patient with an out-of-network billing issue.
""I had no idea that out-of-network providers could be in an in-network hospital,"" Parast said. ""I thought if you chose an in-network hospital, everyone in the hospital's in network.""
UCLA Medical Center said in a statement that when patients contacted the hospital with billing issues, it worked to address them. ""Since then, UCLA Health has discontinued the practice of allowing private anesthesiologists at our hospitals."" UCLA changed its practice when California changed its law.
If not for her friend and the similar nature of their deliveries, Parast said she wouldn't have known what to do.
""If there had been any kind of difference in, you know, a different hospital, or a different insurance, or anything, I would have maybe thought it was that,"" she said, ""but everything was the same.""
Taylor said, ""That's a failure in the system to protect consumers and help them understand what they're facing or what they might potentially face.""

But Pelosi made clear that doesn't necessarily mean the Democratic leadership will pursue impeachment.
""We don't have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts,"" Pelosi added.
Demonstrating how they will proceed, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., issued a subpoena Monday to former White House counsel Don McGahn for testimony as part the panel's investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the president and others.

That idea? Make a big, explicit legislative push to punish individuals and campaigns trying to take advantage of future foreign interference in U.S. elections.
If a foreign government interfered in a U.S. election, and a particular campaign was eager to receive that help, why not try to pass laws making it harder for that to happen in the future?
Yes, the HR1 bill that House Democrats passed last month calls for a strategy to protect democratic institutions, as well as a commission to study it. But those provisions were buried under the act’s other voting, ethics and campaign-finance measures.
And there’s been little effort to rally around them.
Don’t get us wrong: The impeachment debate is a legitimate one; we’ve covered it here for months.
And sure, the GOP-controlled Senate can stymie any House-passed bill. (Of course, the same is true for impeachment, and the bar is even higher – a two-thirds vote is needed to convict.)
But why aren’t House Democrats trying to call any GOP bluff right now?
If Democrats and Republicans both are concerned about future foreign interference in U.S. elections – and want to prevent it from happening again – why not start there?
The Mueller report made it clear that the United States has 20th century election laws in a 21st century world.
In a world of cyber-threats and misinformation wars, the current laws on the books don’t cut it anymore.
Pelosi: ""We don't have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts” As for the impeachment debate, House Democratic leaders told rank-and-file members on a conference call yesterday that they will pursue aggressive investigations into President Trump – but won’t commit to beginning impeachment proceedings.
Some of the highlights of the call, per NBC’s Leigh Ann Caldwell, Rebecca Shabad and Frank Thorp :
""We have to save our democracy. This isn’t about Democrats or Republicans. It’s about saving our democracy,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, according to a person on the call. “If it is what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the Constitution — if that’s the place the facts take us, that’s the place we have to go.""
But Pelosi added that saving the Democracy doesn't necessarily constitute impeachment.
""We don't have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts, the presentation of facts,"" she said.
Also: Two lawmakers, Reps. Val Demings of Florida and Jared Huffman of California, both spoke up in support of impeachment, according to two sources on the call.
Supreme Court hears the census-citizenship case The other big story we’re watching today: The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments over the Trump administration adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
NPR : “In multiple lawsuits brought by dozens of states, cities and other groups, three federal judges at U.S. district courts have issued rulings blocking the administration's plans for the question. It asks, ‘Is this person a citizen of the United States?’”
More: “All three judges — in New York, California and Maryland — ruled that [Commerce Secretary Wilbur] Ross' decision to include the question violated procedures for adding new census questions under administrative law. The judges in California and Maryland have also ruled that adding the question is unconstitutional because it hurts the government's ability to carry out the constitutional mandate for a once-a-decade head count of every person living in the U.S.”
2020 Vision: Town hall-palooza Last night, five Dem presidential hopefuls participated in CNN town halls in New Hampshire. Here’s a brief summary from NBC’s campaign reporters and correspondents:
Amy Klobuchar , per NBC’s Ali Vitali
Defended pursuing a public option for health care rather than Medicare for All, and she dodged whether anything in the Mueller report was impeachable: “I believe I'm the jury here, so I'm not going to predispose things. I'm not going to say whether it is or isn't. But I will say there are very disturbing things that would lead you to believe there's obstruction of justice.”
Elizabeth Warren , per NBC’s Vitali
Argued that the House should begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, said she supports the Green New Deal, and responded to a question about getting “Hillary’d” in 2020: “One might say you persist. Organize. Build a grassroots movement … and that’s how I’m going to be the first women elected president of the United States.”
Bernie Sanders , per NBC’s Shaquille Brewster
Resisted the push for impeachment, saying Congress should continue investigating. And he maintained that felons, including the Boston Marathon bomber, should be allowed to vote while in prison.
Kamala Harris , per NBC’s Vaughn Hillyard
Said that Congress “should take the steps towards impeachment”; announced she’d sign four different executive actions if Congress doesn’t pass gun legislation in the first 100 days of her presidency; and said the Medicare for All bill she co-sponsored would allow for some supplemental private insurance.
Pete Buttigieg , per NBC’s Josh Lederman
Said that Trump “deserves impeachment” but didn’t say whether Congress should pursue it; he disagreed with Sanders that incarcerated felons should be allowed to vote while in prison; and said that while Sanders and President Trump are “stupendously different,” they’ve both tapped into “anti-establishment energy.”
On the campaign trail today Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Seth Moulton campaign in New Hampshire… Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar hit South Carolina… And Cory Booker stumps in Wisconsin.
Tweet of the day Five candidates held town halls on @CNN last night & @BetoORourke wasn’t one of them. He hasn’t done a national TV town hall as a POTUS candidate (but he’s done dozens & dozens of regular ones).
Much like the TXSEN race, he’s committed to doing his own thing. Could work? 🤷🏼‍♂️

The survey measured support for six Democratic-led initiatives. Here’s how they measure up:
A federal requirement for paid maternity leave (84 percent support ) Increased federal funding for child care (75 percent support) A $15 federal minimum wage (60 percent) Tuition-free college at state and public institutions (57 percent) Single-payer Medicare for All (54 percent). A universal basic income (28 percent) While some opponents of Democrats have decried measures like tuition-free college and Medicare for All proposals as unrealistic or even socialist, those plans remain notably popular in public polling.
Fewer than a third of respondents said that they strongly opposed any of the five proposals with majority support.

Musk claims Tesla will have 1 million robotaxis on roads next year,www.nbcnews.com,"Lora Kolodny, CNBC",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/musk-claims-tesla-will-have-1-million-robotaxis-roads-next-n997416,"Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said that the company should have robotaxis on the roads in 2020. “I feel very confident predicting autonomous robotaxis for Tesla next year,” Musk said on stage at the Tesla Autonomy Investor Day in Palo Alto, California. They won’t be “in all jurisdictions, because we won’t have regulatory approval everywhere, but I am confident we will have at least regulatory approval somewhere, literally next year,” he said.
Musk based his optimism on the amount of data his company is able to gather from Tesla vehicles already on the road today, which it then uses to improve its software.
All Tesla cars being produced today have the hardware on board that’s required for full self-driving, Musk said, promising that, “all you need to do is improve the software.”
Musk also predicted that in two years, Tesla will be making cars with no steering wheels or pedals.
While Tesla will have over 1 million robotaxis on the road next year, said Musk, while adding that he expected the company to be “operating robotaxis next year with no one in them.”
He did also warn investors, “Sometimes I am not on time, but I get it done.”
In the past, Elon Musk’s forecasts for Tesla have missed the mark. Tesla was two years late with the launch of the Model X, its first all-electric SUV. And it was two years late in delivering semi-autonomous features to eager drivers. When Tesla began to discuss its ambitions in self-driving technology in 2016, Musk said they would conduct a hands-free trip across the U.S. by late 2017. They have yet to complete that mission.
Currently, Tesla offers Autopilot — an advanced driver assistance system — as a standard feature in its cars. According to the company’s website, Autopilot can automatically hold a car in its lane and accelerate or brake automatically, for example, in response to pedestrians or other cars in its way. Tesla can improve Autopilot with new features (or bug fixes) over time via over-the-air updates, as well.
In addition, Tesla sells a “Full Self-Driving,” or FSD, package for its vehicles for $5,000 or more if the software is installed after the vehicle is initially purchased.
FSD features today include “Summon,” which lets a driver call their Tesla to roll out from a parking spot to where they are standing (with no driver on board). And FSD lets drivers “Navigate on Autopilot,” automatically driving their car from a highway on-ramp to an off-ramp, making necessary lane changes along the way.
Later this year, Tesla’s website says, cars with FSD should be able to read and respond properly to traffic lights and stop signs, and drive automatically on city streets.
Even with FSD, Tesla’s cars are not considered “driverless,” meaning that they don’t meet the SAE Level 4 standard used to denote a car that could handle every aspect of driving in some conditions without any human intervention.
Tesla also cautions its drivers, “Current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.” In other words, while tempting, drivers aren’t supposed to zone out, or drive hands-free even if they have Full Self-Driving."
Trump vows to 'reciprocate' against the EU after Harley-Davidson reports 26.7 percent profit drop,www.nbcnews.com,"Emma Newburger, CNBC",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/trump-vows-reciprocate-against-eu-after-harley-davidson-reports-26-n997456," appeared to reverse course on Harley-Davidson on Tuesday, pledging to reciprocate against “unfair” European Union tariffs that the company partially blamed for its 26.7 percent drop in first-quarter profit. Trump, who called for a boycott against the motorcycle company last year amid a spat over steel, said in a tweet that the EU tariffs have forced the company to move U.S. jobs overseas. “So unfair to U.S. We will Reciprocate!” he said in a tweet, citing comments by Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo.
Harley announced last year that it would move production of its motorcycles destined for the EU to overseas facilities from the U.S. to avoid EU tariffs imposed in retaliation against Trump’s duties on aluminum and steel imports. In response, Trump called for a boycott of the company, and threatened higher taxes as retaliation.
The White House and Harley didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The company is holding a conference call with analysts and the press at 9 a.m. ET.
Harley said falling demand, higher costs from U.S. tariffs on raw materials and European taxes on imports of its motorcycles hurt its earnings, which released before the markets opened Tuesday.
The company posted adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share, higher than the 65 cents per share forecast by Refinitiv. Its revenue from motorcycles and related products fell 12.3 percent to $1.19 billion.
Excluding the impact of tariffs and restructuring costs, the company said its net income fell to $127.9 million, or 80 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $174.76 million, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier.
Its shares jumped by about 3 percent on the better-than-expected earnings.
Harley has struggled with a drop in sales in the U.S. amid fears that younger buyers are less interested in motorcycles than previous generations. Last quarter, the company’s shares tanked after it released earnings that missed analysts’ expectations.
The company has been trying to get more people excited about riding motorcycles again. In November, it started to preview its LiveWire electric motorcycle in the U.S. and Europe in an attempt to attract more riders overall, including younger ones.
Harley also unveiled a 10-year plan in 2017 to attract 2 million new riders by 2027. In addition to investing in electric bikes, it has set up schools across the country to teach people how to ride."

Trump threatens crackdown on high visa overstay countries,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-threatens-crackdown-high-visa-overstay-countries-n997451,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering suspending or limiting entry to the U.S. for individuals from countries with high rates of short-term visa overstays — a proposal vaguely reminiscent of the controversial travel bans pursued during his first year in office. In a memo signed Monday, Trump directs officials to examine new ways to minimize the number of people overstaying their business and tourist visas as part of a renewed focus on immigration as the 2020 campaign kicks into high gear.
And it says the administration is considering developing ""admission bonds"" — people entering the country would pay a fee that would be reimbursed when they leave — in an effort to improve compliance.
""We have laws that need to be followed to keep Americans safe and to protect the integrity of a system where, right now, there are millions of people who are waiting in line to come to America to seek the American Dream,"" Trump said in a statement.
More people are in the U.S. who overstay their visas than cross the border illegally, according to the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies. Some of the countries with high overstay rates include Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Liberia, the Solomon Islands, Benin and Burkina Faso. Officials say 20 countries have rates over 10 percent.
The memo gives the secretaries of state and homeland security 120 days to come up with recommendations, including potentially limiting how long visas last.
The idea of restricting travel from high overstay countries is part of a long list of proposals being tossed around by officials as they try to appease a president who has been seething over the influx of migrants at the border as he tries to make good on his 2016 campaign promises and energize his base going into 2020.
The ideas have ranged from the extreme — including Trump's threat to completely shut down the southern border and resume the widely denounced practice of separating children from parents — to more subtle tweaks to the legal immigration system.
Plans are also in the works to have border patrol agents, instead of asylum officers, conduct initial interviews to determine whether migrants seeking asylum have a ""credible fear"" of returning to their homelands. And the administration has been weighing targeting the remittance payments people living in the country illegally send home to their families and moving forward with plans to punish immigrants in the country legally for using public benefits, such as food stamps.

"Deep inside Earth, scientists find weird blobs and mountains taller than Mount Everest",www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/deep-inside-earth-scientists-find-weird-blobs-mountains-taller-mount-ncna997111,"“We live on a hunk of rock and metal that circles a humdrum star,” Carl Sagan declared in 1996, in one of the astronomer's last interviews. It’s a simplistic description of Earth, but for a long time many scientists would have gone along with it. There’s no way to explore our planet’s interior directly; the deepest hole ever drilled, the Kola Deep borehole in the Russian Arctic, reaches only 0.2 percent the way to the center. So even the best scientific maps didn’t look much better than your middle-school textbook cartoon showing an outer crust, an inner core and a thick layer called the mantle in between.
But that picture is changing. Researchers such as Barbara Romanowicz at the University of California, Berkeley are using seismic (earthquake) waves to scan our planet’s innards, much like doctors use ultrasound to peer inside patients. What they’re seeing is full of complex detail — not a bland mineral hunk, but a rich and dynamic inner landscape.
The mantle appears to be layered like an onion, with major transitions 250 miles and 410 miles down. At the 410-mile level, researchers recently identified a tremendous interior mountain range , with peaks perhaps even taller than Mount Everest. “Recently, we’ve discovered another change at about 1,000 kilometers [600 miles] depth,” Romanowicz says.
 Immense crater may have been found deep under Greenland's ice sheet The layers are riven by rising plumes of hot rock. And beneath the plumes, two strange blobs roughly the size of Australia bob atop the core, one beneath Africa and one under the Pacific Ocean.
“More and more, we’re understanding it’s not the standard cartoon picture,” Romanowicz says. “For geodynamicists, it’s a complete revolution.”
Baffled by the blobs The mantle blobs are of special interest because of their impact on life on the surface. Recent work by Maria Tsekhmistrenko, a seismologist at the University of Oxford, confirms the blobs as a source of the hot mantle plumes — and those plumes can trigger devastating supervolcanic eruptions when they surface.
Her research has found detailed connections between the African blob and the La Reunion mantle plume (currently under Reunion Island, east of Madagascar) that unleashed a wave of eruptions in what is now India 67 million years ago, delivering a one-two punch with the big asteroid impact to kill off the dinosaurs.
Other plumes led to massive volcanoes that created Iceland and which continue to drive the rumbling activity beneath Yellowstone . “There’s a high correlation between these events, climate changes and mass extinctions over the past few hundred million years,” Tsekhmistrenko says.
Smoke rises from Hawaii's Kilauea volcano on May 6, 2018. USGS/Anadolu Agency / Getty Images The nature of the mantle blobs is a persistent mystery, however, largely because the seismic waves studied by Tsekhmistrenko and her colleagues reveal our planet’s inner structure only indirectly. Waves move faster or slower depending on the temperature and composition of the material they pass through. The waves can then be detected by instruments that measure ground motion at the surface, and analyzed to interpret the structures the waves passed through.
Unfortunately, this approach cannot easily distinguish warm, dense material from cooler, lighter stuff. That leaves a lot of room for interpretation.
Sanne Cottaar, a University of Cambridge geophysicist who has mapped the blobs extensively, thinks they’re masses of high-density rock that sank to the bottom of the mantle early in Earth’s history . “They sit on top of the hotter core and will thus heat up over time. The heat then makes them less dense,” she said in an email.
The blobs act like a lid on a pot — until heat from the stove causes what’s inside to boil and spill out, sometimes catastrophically.
Living on an onion planet That conclusion jibes with Romanowicz’s emerging view of the inner Earth as a series of overlapping, onion-like layers. Scientists used to picture the mantle as a single unit, slowly churning under the influence of heat from the core. A tidy, up-and-down circulation tugged at the crust, they concluded, moving continents and reshaping oceans.
“There is more and more a kind of understanding in the community that it's not just that simple,” Romanowicz says. Instead, each layer of the onion seems to have its own history and evolution. The 410-mile transition is associated with an abrupt change in the structure of the rocks in the mantle. At the 600-mile zone studied by Romanowicz, rising mantle plumes seem to bend and deflect, as if they’ve run into a wall: “That one’s yet to be understood.”
The layers below the mantle show crazy complexity, too. The outer core is a molten iron alloy that flows as readily as water in the ocean. “It also circulates at speeds similar to the ocean and is very turbulent,” Cottaar says.
That turbulence is crucial, since it generates the planet-swaddling magnetic field that protects Earth from solar storms and cosmic radiation . Less pleasantly, it can cause sudden hiccups in the field , or even complete reversals.
At the very center of Earth is the inner core, a 760-mile-wide ball of iron. Seismic studies show that it consists of iron crystals that are kept solid by tremendous pressure even though it is hotter than the surface of the sun. It’s the youngest major structure inside the planet, having begun freezing out of the liquid part of the core less than a billion years ago. Adding to the weirdness, the inner core rotates slightly faster than the rest of the planet .
“There are many, many questions remaining about the structure of the inner core,” Romanowicz says.
Back to Earth’s beginnings The ultimate goal is to connect all of Earth’s onion layers to the way our planet formed , which in turn will help explain how it became the life-friendly world it is today. David J. Stevenson, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology, traces the story back to a moment 4.5 billion years ago when Earth was struck by a planetary body the size of Mars.
The debris kicked up by that collision is thought to have made the moon, but it also remade our planet.
“The giant impact may have melted or stirred part of the deep Earth. The resulting separation of liquid from solid, and core material from mantle material, set up the state that has evolved to what we see,” Stevenson says. Core, mantle blobs and layering may all derive from that early state.
Romanowicz wants to explore more of our planet’s inner history by building the Pacific Array , an ocean-based network of motion detectors that would provide a new way to watch seismic waves passing through Earth’s insides. “It’s something that some of us have been working on for 30 years,” she says. “We need it to illuminate the lower mantle.”
For Stevenson, the ultimate dream is to explore downward in the style of Jules Verne. At one point, he even floated the idea of building a probe that could travel all the way to the core . “It was a tongue-in-cheek idea, but it sure would be nice to have something to sample the mantle properly,” he says. “I subscribe to the view that you don't know a place until you go there. ‘You’ being a robot, of course.”

Obscure group blamed for Sri Lanka bombings went 'from zero to 60' in single attack,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sri-lanka-bombings-were-blamed-obscure-local-group-could-it-n997431,"The international links of the little-known Islamist group blamed in a series of Easter Sunday suicide bombings in Sri Lanka were under the spotlight Tuesday amid questions about whether it was singlehandedly capable of orchestrating such a complex attack. Sri Lanka's government pointed the finger at National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) for the near-simultaneous blasts at churches and hotels that killed at least 321 people in the predominantly Buddhist island nation off the southern tip of India.
But the group wasn't on the radar of many Western terrorism and security experts prior to being accused Monday of orchestrating the attacks. While it had been linked to the vandalism of Buddhist statues, the NTJ had never previously been implicated in any deaths.
There is also no history of tension between Christians and Muslims in Sri Lanka, with both minorities having been persecuted.
Related News News 'He's never gonna be a teenager': Sri Lanka bomb kills 5th-grader from D.C. On Tuesday, the Islamic State group issued a claim of responsibility for the attack but produced no evidence of its involvement.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne previously said all of the bombers were Sri Lankans, but authorities said they strongly suspected foreign links.
Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardene told Parliament on Tuesday he believed the bombings were in retaliation to the shooting attacks on two mosques in New Zealand last month , without providing evidence or explaining where the information came from. The office of New Zealand's prime minister responded by saying it hasn't ""seen any intelligence upon which such an assessment might be based.""
ISIS claims responsibility for Easter terrorist attacks that killed at least 321 April 23, 2019 01:29 The defense minister added that the NTJ had support from another local group, Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim.
Champa Patel, the head of the Asia-Pacific program at Chatham House, a London think tank, questioned whether the Sri Lankan groups could have acted alone.
""It’s hard to believe that any of these small groups would have been able to put an attack of such complexity that would require careful logistical planning, months of preparation, without support from foreign interests,"" Patel said.
The Tamil Tigers, a powerful rebel army known for using suicide bombers during the 26-year civil war that ended in 2009, had little history of targeting Christians.
Related News News Photos: Sri Lankans mourn bombing victims during funerals Anti-Muslim bigotry fed by Buddhist nationalists has swept the country recently, but there is no history of Islamist militancy. Sri Lanka's small Christian community has seen only scattered incidents of harassment.
Around 70 percent of the country's population of 22 million are Buddhist. Muslims make up only 9.7 percent of the population while Christians are another 7.6 percent, according to the country's 2012 census.
The fact that Christians and tourists were targeted — as opposed to Buddhists — also potentially suggests an international terrorism dimension to the attack, according to Patel.
Military officials guard St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo after Sunday's explosion. Dinuka Liyanawatte / Reuters ""Whoever the attackers are, if they were feeling disenfranchised or stigmatized, you would assume they would attack the majority community,"" Patel added.
Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, said that overseas groups may have provided information on planning mass-scale attacks to the NTJ, which had local knowledge.
""This is a group that has gone from zero to 60 in its first attack,"" said Pape, who has studied every suicide attack in Sri Lanka since 1987 and is the author of ""Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism.""
He added: ""To recruit seven to 10 suicide bombers, that takes years of effort. That is reason alone to doubt it could have done so much damage by itself.""
Bombed church hosts mass funeral for Sri Lanka attack victims April 23, 2019 00:59 The Tamil Tigers launched more than 130 suicide bomb attacks during the country's civil war, making them the leading militant group in such assaults at the time. They killed a Sri Lankan prime minister and a former Indian prime minister, among others, including bystanders.
On Monday, Sri Lanka's government admitted that international intelligence agencies had informed its security agencies April 4 that churches and tourist destinations were being targeted. Five days later, police were given the names of suspects behind the plot.
""We never expected it to be so big,"" Hemasiri Fernando, the chief of staff to Sri Lanka's president, told NBC News. ""We never thought it would happen so soon.""

"After Mueller report, Twitter bots pushed 'Russiagate hoax' narrative",www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/after-mueller-report-twitter-bots-pushed-russiagate-hoax-narrative-n997441,"A network of more than 5,000 pro-Trump Twitter bots railed against the “Russiagate hoax” shortly after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report last week, according to data gathered by a prominent disinformation researcher and analyzed by NBC News. The network illustrates the ongoing challenge Twitter faces in persistent efforts to manipulate its platform. These bots, however, did not appear to come from Russia. Instead, the bots had ties to a social media operation that previously pushed messages backing the government of Saudi Arabia and were connected to a person who claimed to be a private social media consultant, according to internet domain and account registration records. The bots, which were created last November and December, were pulled down by Twitter on Sunday night for breaking the social network’s rules against “manipulation,” the company said.
As social media platforms continue to prepare for the 2020 election, efforts to spread disinformation and sow discord remain an ongoing issue. And while operations sponsored by foreign countries are still a threat, the rise of for-profit trolling operations, which may include the new bot network, have added a new element for companies to counter.
“The landscape has changed,” said Clint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who focuses on global disinformation campaigns. “Since 2016, everybody’s doing this. It’s trolling as a service. And since there are no consequences, the least sophisticated of all the actors are doing this.”
Almost all of the since-removed accounts, most of which only posted about 30 times each, attacked the press and lamented how the “Russiagate hoax” affected Trump’s presidency. Many of the accounts copied verbatim tweets from other pro-Trump accounts without attributing those tweets to the original poster.
A screenshot of a tweet from an account, since suspended, that was part of a bot network, according to researchers. Twitter The thousands of accounts are tied together by their frequent interactions — including likes, retweets and copied tweets — with a recently rebranded account called @TheGlobus, which posed as a news organization. Thousands of the accounts appeared to exist solely to “like” articles from @TheGlobus on Twitter, many only “liking” tweets from @TheGlobus and no other account.
Until its rebrand last month, @TheGlobus went by the username @ArabianVeritas and mostly posted positive news, policy initiatives and memes about Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
It is unclear whether the accounts had any official connections to the government of Saudi Arabia.
“Whether this is a government or a pro-Saudi influence firm, it shows how easy it is to do and that there’s no cost or consequences for it,” Watts said. “These are made to influence Americans or Western audiences.”
Arabian Veritas called itself “an initiative that aims to spread the truth about Saudi Arabia and the Middle East through social media engagement” on its abandoned Instagram account. Despite rebranding as a news organization — though it shows no evidence of employing journalists and its website is broken — the account remained a “verified user” on Twitter.
Pro-Trump bots blasted the 'Russiagate hoax' after release of Mueller report April 24, 2019 04:04 The domain name for Arabian Veritas was registered to the name of Salah Faya, who listed himself as an “e-Services and e-Government Expert” and “software solutions consultant” for a ”confidential” firm in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on his Facebook page at the time of Arabian Veritas’ creation.
Saudi Arabia and contractors close to it have conducted extensive influence campaigns on Twitter in recent years to push positive news about the government and attack its enemies. One ally and former strategist of bin Salman, Saud al-Qahtani, is known as the “Minister of the Flies” for hiring bot and troll armies that tend to swarm on detractors. It does not appear that al-Qahtani had any connections to the bot network that Twitter removed on Sunday.
In October, bots backing the Saudi Arabian government flooded Twitter with messages railing against Jamal Khashoggi, who had been assassinated a few days earlier in Turkey’s Saudi consulate by Saudi government agents. Twitter removed the botnet that same week.
Faya did not respond to requests for comment. “The Globus” and “Arabian Veritas” accounts also did not respond when asked for information.
Twitter suspended @TheGlobus on Monday night.
Russia still poses threat to U.S. elections especially through social media Feb. 2, 2019 07:17 ""We suspended a network of accounts and others associated with it for engaging in platform manipulation — a violation of the Twitter Rules,” a Twitter spokesperson told NBC News. “While our investigations are ongoing, in cases such as this, attribution is difficult. If we do have reasonable evidence to support state-backed activity, we will disclose the accounts as part of our information operations archive .""
The accounts did not go to great lengths to hide that they were automated. Most copied their biographies from other Twitter users. Some even used stock photos, replete with stock photo watermarks, as profile pictures.
Josh Russell, an independent misinformation researcher who has previously identified large bot networks, first spotted the accounts on Saturday. He called the network “weird,” and added that they sat dormant between their creation and last week.
“The bots were not directly retweeting the pro-Trump accounts,” Russell said. “I think they were probably attempting to generally boost the visibility of those partisan talking points on Twitter in places like search results.”
Watts, who is also an NBC News contributor, called this method of propaganda “influence seeding,” and said the quality of the post doesn’t much matter to those who run these kind of botnets for political influence operations.
“Strategically, it doesn’t matter if no one believes that one account,” Watts said. “This sort of network changes the volume of accounts for what trends and makes sure 'Russiagate' and negative tweets about it trend higher.”

Your summer vacation could be collateral damage in Trump's hard line on Iran,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/your-summer-vacation-could-be-collateral-damage-trump-s-hard-n997526,"America’s summer vacations could be collateral damage in President Donald Trump’s hard-line policy on Iran. After Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced this week that countries importing Iranian oil under a current waiver program would be subject to U.S. sanctions as of May 2, petroleum analysts said gas prices would most likely continue to climb.
“This could affect how much Americans pay at the pump by the end of this week,"" said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. ""At the onset, it could be just a few cents a gallon, but we’re just entering this tunnel of potential here.”
The average price of gasoline has already been on the upswing, and at a national average of $2.84 is 23 cents higher than it was a month ago. The average has already hit more than $4 a gallon in California, according to the AAA.
“We are seeing very expensive gas prices for this time of year across the country,” Jeanette Casselano, AAA spokeswoman, said in an April 15 release. “Motorists are seeing prices increase as gasoline stocks decreased substantially by 7.7 million [barrels] amid summer-like demand readings.”
Pompeo said that sanctions had weakened Iran’s economy in making the case for the discontinuation of the waivers, which had been extended to China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. Experts say this could take roughly 1 million barrels of oil a day off the global market, a loss magnified by political conflicts in Venezuela and Libya that are crimping those countries’ oil production.
“With the canceling of waivers against buying from Iran, the Trump administration will exert pressure not only on Iran but also OPEC,” said John Hall, chairman of U.K.-based Alfa Energy Group. “In the short term, there will be some fluctuations in the oil price and for that reason the U.S. and other countries could be paying more for gasoline in the summer months to come,” he said.
The Trump administration said it had plans to replace the Iranian oil. Pompeo said de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, had committed to making sure the global oil market has enough supply. “Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference,” Trump tweeted on Monday morning.
But energy market experts expressed skepticism, pointing out that “enough” could be subjective in nature. Markets weighed in with a similar sentiment, sending the key benchmark price of Brent crude up by around 3 percent, to more than $74 a barrel.
“I think the price implications of this are significant and, frankly, whatever the Saudis tell the administration, they obviously have a short-term fiscal interest in maybe having a price that’s closer to $80 than $60,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He also said the promise to replace Iranian oil on the global market could be constrained by production capacity.
Unless other countries are willing and able to make up the difference, or the White House reintroduces the waiver program, summertime road-trippers might find their plans stalled. DeHaan predicted prices could rise as high as another 15 cents a gallon, which would bring the national average to around $3.
“If there’s no increase from any country, we’re going to have very little breathing room this summer in terms of oil supply. It’s going to put pressure on gas prices for most of the summer,” he said.

Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort is now in federal prison,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/former-trump-campaign-chair-paul-manafort-now-federal-prison-n997511,"WASHINGTON — Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort is now in federal prison. Manafort, who was convicted and pleaded guilty in 2018 to multiple charges of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, is serving his 7.5 year sentence at a facility outside Scranton, Pennsylvania, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Manafort is being held at the United States Penitentiary Canaan in Waymart, Pennsylvania, with an expected release date of Dec. 25, 2024, according to the website. He has been in federal custody since June 2018, and was previously held in two Virginia jails. Canaan has a high-security prison and a minimum-security camp . A spokesperson for USP Canaan told NBC News that Manafort was admitted to the high-security prison. The Washington Post reported that Manafort is in the minimum-security camp.
The political operative was sentenced in separate federal court cases in Virginia and D.C. in March, receiving a total sentence of seven-and-a-half years, minus credit for nine months of time served. Federal prisoners must serve at least 85 percent of their sentences before they are eligible for supervised release.
The U.S. Penitentiary in Canaan, Pennsylvania, in 2013. Michael J. Mullen / Scranton Times-Tribune via AP file Hours after Manafort's second sentencing, the Manhattan district attorney announced that Manafort had been indicted by a grand jury in New York on 16 counts related to residential mortgage fraud , continuing his legal troubles, this time in state court.
Shortly after the second federal sentencing, President Donald Trump said that he'd given no thought to a pardon, although he felt ""very badly"" for his former associate.

Manafort agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation in the D.C. case in September and pleaded guilty to two counts: one count of conspiracy against the U.S. and another count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. He had previously been convicted on eight felony fraud counts in his Virginia case .
In January, special counsel Robert Mueller's team told a judge that Manafort should no longer get credit for cooperating , saying Manafort had lied to investigators about a $125,000 payment he received in 2017, his conversations with a former associate who's been accused of being a Russian intelligence operative, contacts with administration officials, and an unspecified ongoing investigation.

White House tells official who gave Kushner security clearance: Don't comply with subpoena,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-tells-official-who-gave-kushner-security-clearance-don-n997476,"The White House has told Carl Kline, the former security specialist who approved Jared Kushner’s security clearance over the objections of career staffers, not to comply with a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee, according to a letter obtained by NBC News. Kline was supposed to appear before committee staff Tuesday to face questions related to his handling of White House security clearances .
But in a letter to Kline's attorney Robert Driscoll dated Monday, White House Deputy Counsel Michael Purpura said Kline should not appear for an interview if the committee does not allow a member of the White House counsel staff to attend.
White House whistleblower speaks out on security clearance controversy April 2, 2019 01:24 Driscoll sent his own letter to the committee, saying that Kline risked jeopardizing his job at the Pentagon if he defied the White House. ""This decision is not made lightly and does not come from any ill will or deliberate defiance on my part or that of my client,"" Driscoll wrote to congressional staffers.
""With two masters from two equal branches of government, we will follow the instructions of the one that employs him,"" Driscoll added.
Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he plans to speak with his members about scheduling a vote to hold Kline in contempt for defying the subpoena.
“The White House and Mr. Kline now stand in open defiance of a duly authorized congressional subpoena with no assertion of any privilege of any kind by President Trump,"" Cummings said in a statement.
""Based on these actions, it appears that the president believes that the Constitution does not apply to his White House, that he may order officials at will to violate their legal obligations, and that he may obstruct attempts by Congress to conduct oversight.""
Cummings noted that the White House wrote to his committee last Thursday threatening to order Kline to skip the scheduled deposition unless the White House counsel was allowed to participate. Four days later, Cummings said, the committee responded by explaining that it has for many years prohibited agency lawyers from participating in depositions.
NBC News reported in January that two White House security specialists recommended that Kushner not receive a top secret security clearance after they reviewed his clearance application and deemed it to be ""unfavorable."" But according to sources familiar with the matter, Kline took the unusual step of overruling career staff to approve Kushner's top secret clearance.
After Kushner was approved by Kline, his application went to the CIA for an even higher level of clearance known as “sensitive compartmented information,"" or SCI, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But officers reviewing the decision at the CIA balked. One called over to the WH security division wondering how Kushner had even obtained a top secret clearance, the two sources said.
The sources say the CIA has not granted Kushner clearance to review SCI material. That would mean Kushner lacks access to key intelligence unless President Donald Trump decides to override the rules, which is the president's' prerogative.
Kline also approved security clearance applications of 25 others working for the Executive Office of the President over the objections of career personnel, according to an interview the House Committee staff conducted with White House security specialist Tricia Newbold and other sources familiar with the matter.
Kline has also been accused by Newbold of discrimination against her because of her height. Newbold, who has a rare form of dwarfism, charges that Kline repeatedly moved files out of her reach.
In an interview with NBC News this month, Newbold said, ""It was definitely humiliating ... but it didn't stop me from doing what was right.""

Former CEO of major drug distribution company first to face criminal charges in opioid crisis,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-ceo-major-drug-distribution-company-first-face-criminal-charges-n997571,"In a national first in the fight against the opioid crisis, a major drug distribution company, its former chief executive and another top executive have been criminally charged in New York. Rochester Drug Co-Operative, one of the top 10 largest drug distributors in the United States, was charged Tuesday with conspiracy to violate narcotics laws, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., and willfully failing to file suspicious order reports.
Laurence Doud III, the company's former chief executive, and William Pietruszewski, the company’s former chief compliance officer, are individually charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Pietruszewski is also charged with willfully failing to file suspicious order reports with the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA.
First major drug distributor criminally charged in deadly opioid crisis April 23, 2019 01:59 Both Doud, 75, and Pietruszewski, 53, face life in prison. Doud will appear in court Tuesday, and Pietruszewski pleaded guilty last Friday, Geoffrey S. Berman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said.
The U.S. attorney's office also filed a lawsuit against Rochester Drug Co-Operative on Tuesday seeking ""penalties and injunctive relief.""
""This prosecution is the first of its kind: Executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and the distributor itself have been charged with drug trafficking, trafficking the same drugs that are fueling the opioid epidemic that is ravaging this country,"" Berman said. ""Our office will do everything in its power to combat this epidemic, from street-level dealers to the executives who illegally distribute drugs from their boardrooms.”

Between 2012 and 2016, Rochester Drug Co-Operative is accused of distributing tens of millions of doses of oxycodone, fentanyl and other opioids to pharmacies that its own compliance department found had no legitimate need for them.
Prosecutors said Rochester Drug Co-Operative went against the DEA and its own policies and distributed drugs to pharmacies that were ""filling controlled substances prescriptions issued by practitioners acting outside the scope of their medical practice, under investigation by law enforcement, or on RDC’s 'watch list.'""
Rochester Drug Co-Operative "" distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies even after identifying 'red flags,'"" a statement from the U.S. attorney said. And at Doud's direction, the company took on pharmacies that had been terminated by other distributors.
Rochester Drug Co-Operative’s own employees ""described some of the company’s customers as 'very suspicious,' and even characterized particular pharmacies as a 'DEA investigation in the making' or 'like a stick of dynamite waiting for [the] DEA to light the fuse,'"" the statement said.
And executives at Rochester Drug Co-Operative purposefully kept suspicions of pharmacies' illegal activity from the DEA, fearing investigations into the pharmacies and potentially losing customers, according to a criminal complaint.
The company identified about 8,300 ""potentially suspicious 'orders of interest,' including thousands of oxycodone orders,"" between 2012 and 2016, but only reported four, the U.S. attorney said.
In that time, Rochester Drug Co-Operative’s sales of oxycodone tablets grew almost nine-fold, from 4.7 million to 42.2 million, prosecutors said. Their fentanyl sales grew from approximately 63,000 dosages in 2012 to more than 1.3 million in 2016.
In that same time, Doud's compensation ballooned to $1.5 million a year.
""Doud cared more about profits than the laws intended to protect human life,"" Berman said.
Rochester Drug Co-Operative announced it has entered into a plea agreement in the criminal case and a settlement in the civil case. The company has agreed to admit to the accusations, submit to supervision by an independent monitor, reform its compliance program and pay a $20 million fine.
“We made mistakes ... and RDC understands that these mistakes, directed by former management, have serious consequences,"" Jeff Eller, a spokesperson for Rochester Drug Co-Operative, said in a statement. ""We accept responsibility for those mistakes. We can do better, we are doing better, and we will do better.”
""One element of the opioid epidemic is a dramatic increase in the volume of prescriptions for opioids and all narcotics,"" Eller said. ""From 2012 to 2017, we did not have adequate systems in place nor were our compliance team and practices rigorous enough to provide adequate controls and oversight over the increased demand for narcotic drug products from pharmacies.”
A new management team was put in place at Rochester Drug Co-Operative in 2017, and ""began making significant changes with a focus on implementing a world-class compliance program,"" the company's statement said.

New IRA reportedly apologizes for killing journalist Lyra McKee,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-ira-reportedly-claims-northern-ireland-killing-lyra-mckee-n997426,"A dissident Irish republican group called the New IRA has reportedly claimed responsibility for killing journalist Lyra McKee during a riot last week in Northern Ireland. The paramilitary organization said Monday that one of its volunteers had shot McKee by mistake while aiming at police ""enemy forces"" in the city of Londonderry, which is also known as Derry.
According to a statement sent to The Irish News , the group said it offered its ""full and sincere apologies"" to McKee's family and friends.
The newspaper said the statement was sent using a recognized code word, but its veracity has not been independently confirmed by NBC News.
The apology was widely rejected, with people across the region's polarized political spectrum coming together to condemn McKee's shooting.
Journalist and author Lyra McKee in 2017. Jess Lowe / via AFP - Getty Images On Tuesday, a 57-year-old woman was arrested in connection with the shooting and held in the Northern Irish capital of Belfast under terrorism laws, police said. Two teenagers previously held have been released without charge.
""Lyra was killed by shots that were fired indiscriminately … in a residential area, at a time when there were large numbers of local people on the street, including children,"" Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy told reporters Saturday.
""The brutal nature of the attack has sent shockwaves around the world,"" Murphy added. ""The gunman showed no thought for who may have been killed or injured when he fired these shots.""
At just 29, McKee was regarded as a gifted investigative journalist, not only covering the legacy of her homeland's violent past but also talking about growing up as a gay person in Belfast.
Video shows fatal shooting of journalist in Northern Ireland April 19, 2019 01:15 Her death is the latest sign that, while the conflict that plagued Northern Ireland for decades has calmed, it has far from vanished.
The New IRA is the most recent paramilitary organization to use the name of the Irish Republican Army, after the original incarnation that fought for Irish independence starting in 1919. Authorities believe the New IRA to be the country's largest active dissident organization.
It was formed in 2012 out of smaller splinter groups including the Real IRA, which was behind the 1998 Omagh bombing and classified as a terrorist organization by the State Department.
The British government considers any organization with IRA in its name as a terrorist group.
The New IRA aims to continue the decades-long struggle to unite Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Irish Republic, which is a separate country.
This sectarian divide — between mainly Catholic ""republicans,"" mainly protestant ""loyalists"" and British authorities — resulted in a three-decade conflict called ""the Troubles,"" which claimed 3,000 lives. It ended with a 1998 peace deal.
The New IRA rejects this agreement.
As well as being linked to several murders in recent years, the group claimed responsibility for sending four parcel bombs to Glasgow University, London's Waterloo Station and buildings around two airports in the British capital.
The group did apologize for McKee's death this week, but in the same breath also blamed British police for an ""incursion"" that ""provoked rioting"" in Londonderry's mainly Catholic neighborhood of Creggan.
Mourners gather around a floral memorial for Lyra McKee in Londonderry on Saturday. Paul Faith / AFP - Getty Images It added that ""we have instructed our volunteers to take the utmost care in future when engaging the enemy, and put in place measures to help ensure this.""
While largely forgotten in mainland Britain, the Northern Irish issue has crept back into headlines in recent years thanks to Brexit .
Until now, both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic have been part of the European Union. This means their border can be all but invisible, thanks to the E.U.'s trade regulations allowing members to operate almost like a single country.
In fact, erasing the symbolic border was a key tenet of the Good Friday Agreement, the name of the 1998 peace deal that ended ""the Troubles."" After Brexit, Britain, including Northern Ireland, might lose these shared regulations that allow this border to remain invisible.
Many fear that returning to a ""hard border"" — perhaps dotted with guard posts and personnel — will become a target for attacks by paramilitaries seeking to stir up unrest.
Even now, Britain's domestic counterintelligence agency, MI5, puts almost one quarter of its resources toward ""Northern Ireland-related terrorism,"" according to government figures.
While not at the level of the 1970s, last year alone there were 16 paramilitary shootings, 15 bombings and 159 people arrested under terror laws in Northern Ireland, police said.

United Airlines employee accused of using racial slurs to scold passenger,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/united-airlines-employee-accused-using-racial-slurs-scold-passenger-n997496,"A United Airlines employee has been criminally charged and will likely be fired after she was accused of using racial slurs to scold a black passenger at Houston's airport, according to police. Carmella Davano was cited for using profane and abusive language in a public place after Cacilie Hughes and witnesses told police that the United Airlines employee told her to ""stop making monkey faces"" and ""stop making monkey shines,"" Houston Police spokesman Kese Smith said.
Witnesses also told police that Davano was saying she thought Hughes was on drugs, Smith said.
A statement from Jasmine Rand, who is representing Hughes along with civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, said Davano also directly called Hughes a monkey.
Hughes had gotten off the plane to see whether bags were being unloaded onto the tarmac after her flight to George Bush Intercontinental Airport when Davano started yelling at her to come back inside, Smith said.
Cacilie Hughes Kristine Canterbury Hughes, who is an actress and the vice president of the nonprofit organization Big Sister Little Sister Mentoring Program, was returning home from a speaking engagement in Michigan on women's empowerment when the incident happened, Rand's statement said.
Hughes called police after nearby United Airlines employees refused to, the statement said.
""I’m still in shock. I can’t believe this happened,"" Hughes said in the statement.
""Tears streamed down my face as she humiliated me,"" Hughes said, adding she felt ""afraid.""
Davano told officers that she did tell Hughes to ""stop making monkey shines,"" but she denied telling her to ""stop making monkey faces,"" Smith said. Witnesses backed up both of Hughes' accusations, said Smith, and some bystanders had attempted to stop Davano, Rand said.
Rand noted that two racial discrimination lawsuits were filed against United Airlines last year.
In one instance, Nigerian Queen Obioma said she and her children were kicked off a flight after a ""white passenger said she smelled too ‘pungent’ to sit beside him,"" the statement said. In the other instance, former NBA player Eric Murdock said after a seat dispute, he was asked if he planned to ""lead a boycott"" and was met by authorities when he de-boarded.
And in 2017, David Dao, a Vietnamese-American doctor said he suffered a concussion, missing teeth, and a broken nose after he was forcibly dragged off a United Airlines flight .
""Unfortunately, the racism experienced by Cacilie was not an isolated incident with United Airlines, but part of a companywide pattern of racial discrimination,"" said a statement from Rand and Crump. ""Racial slurs like ‘shining monkey’ should be relics of history, not resurrected to fuel the fire of racism faced by so many African Americans in today’s society and condoned on United Airlines flights.”
A statement from United Airlines said the company was taking steps to begin a termination process for Davano.
""This incident is deeply offensive and does not reflect the fundamental values of our company and our 90,000 employees,"" the statement said. ""That is why we took immediate action to remove this individual from the job. Since then, we have been following all of the required procedures under this individual's union contract and are actively pursuing termination.""
The misdemeanor charge against Davano has been filed in Houston Municipal Court. She could not be reached for comment.

Netanyahu wants to thank Trump by naming new Golan Heights settlement after him,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netanyahu-wants-thank-trump-naming-new-golan-heights-settlement-after-n997546,"The Trump name could soon find itself gracing a new planned community in a hotly contested location — the Golan Heights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced via video Tuesday that he intends to introduce a resolution to have a new Jewish community named after President Donald Trump in gratitude for his decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the area.
Netanyahu plans to name Golan Heights settlement after Trump April 23, 2019 00:29 “I’m here on the beautiful Golan Heights,” Netanyahu said, arm around his wife. “All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Therefore after the Passover holiday I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J. Trump.”
NBC News has reached out to the White House for comment on Netanyahu’s declaration.
Last month, Trump broke with years of precedent and signaled a major shift in U.S. policy when he said it was time to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the strategic territory that the Jewish state captured from Syria in 1967.
""After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel's Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!"" Trump tweeted.
President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walk through a colonnade at the White House on March 25, 2019. Drew Angerer / Getty Images Minutes later, Netanyahu tweeted his appreciation. ""At a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Thank you President Trump!""
At the time, Netanyahu was in the midst of a heated re-election battle , which ended in victory for the longtime Israeli leader.
Israel's neighbors immediately condemned Trump's abrupt declaration . The Syrian government called it ""irresponsible"" and a threat to international peace and stability, while Iran's foreign ministry warned it would plunge the region into a new crisis.
The Golan Heights is a 700-square-mile area overlooking the Jordan Rift Valley that is home to about 47,000 people, the majority of whom are Druze and Syrians — not Israelis.
Israel annexed it in 1981, but most of the international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the area.

REPORT: THURSDAY ANNOUNCEMENT...,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-set-announce-presidential-run-thursday-video-n997596,"Former Vice President Joe Biden will announce his presidential bid Thursday morning with an online video, two sources close to Biden with direct knowledge of the planning confirmed to NBC News. Biden will then appear in Pittsburgh on Monday for an event at a local union hall, NBC News has learned. Biden will then embark on a tour of the four early voting states — Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — in the following weeks.
The former vice president finds himself atop of many early primary polls. The RealClearPolitics polling average has him at just above 29 percent, with Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in second place at about 22 percent.
Biden to announce 2020 presidential run on Thursday April 23, 2019 02:07 News that Biden is set to announce on Thursday comes after months of suspense over whether he would join the primary field, although it appeared to be all but certain in recent weeks. Even the date of his announcement video appeared to be in flux, as other outlets reported it would be released on Wednesday.
""My intention from the beginning was, if I were to run, (I) would be the last person to announce,"" Biden said last last week. ""We’ll find out whether I can win in a primary.""
This will be Biden's third run for the White House. Both prior campaigns — in the 1988 and 2008 election cycles — ended well before the Democratic primary process had played out. After that 2008 bid, Barack Obama tapped Biden as his running mate, and Biden went on to serve as Obama's vice president for eight years after a more than three-decade career in the Senate representing Delaware.
Since President Donald Trump unexpectedly won in 2016, Biden has been a sharp critic of the president's foreign policy and political rhetoric and campaigned across the country for Democrats in the 2018 midterms. But Biden is faced with a leftward push among some of his Democratic primary competitors that he has been reluctant to join.
Biden's lengthy record in Washington has already come under intense scrutiny ahead of his expected bid. He authored the Violence Against Women Act, helped pass an assault weapons ban and came out in favor of same-sex marriage before Obama, but he also voted in favor of authorizing the Iraq War, was a lead author of a contentious 1994 crime bill and, as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, presided over Justice Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court — which included handling Anita Hill's testimony that Thomas sexually harassed her, which he denied.
Then, just weeks before the anticipated launch of his campaign, Biden was criticized for what a former Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor described as unwelcome physical contact at a 2014 campaign event. Soon after, other women described similar interactions.
Responding to those statements, Biden acknowledged in an online video this month that ""social norms are changing"" and what he viewed as ""gestures of support and encouragement"" sometimes made people uncomfortable. He vowed to ""be more mindful and respectful of people's personal space.""

His sister recently did the same when she moved to Spain. Like many other young Argentines, the siblings hold European passports by descent, and they are returning to the home countries of their grandparents — far from Argentina's sizzling inflation, high unemployment and sharp currency depreciation. ""My country's situation prompted me to take this decision,"" Ruiz said as he finished packing his bags for his trip to Dublin surrounded by photos of his family and friends on the wall. ""It was a constant frustration to live constantly on the edge, barely making it to the end of the month."" Ruiz studied gastronomy and was employed as a cafe manager in Argentina's capital. But even when he worked extra shifts, he couldn't manage to save money, and for months he had been living with his mother to save on rent. Outside his room, family members left him and his sister farewell messages on a chalkboard. ""I love you and I'll miss you,"" his mother wrote. Others said: ""The best is yet to come,"" and ""Carpe diem,"" Latin for seize the day. It's not the first time Argentines have sought shelter in Europe in times of economic uncertainty. Hundreds of thousands emigrated to the old continent to escape hyperinflation in the early 1990s and an economic meltdown in 2001 and 2002. Now, Argentines are losing purchasing power to a nearly 50% annual inflation rate — one of the world's worst. Many have also protests President Mauricio Macri's decision to cut subsidies, leading to a spike in the costs of utilities and public transportation. Last year, the Argentine peso lost more than half its value to the U.S. dollar following a run on the local currency, causing the government to seek a record $56 billion bailout loan with the International Monetary Fund to try to come out of the recession. ""As a result of the economic crisis and the devaluation, more young professionals are thinking about a future in Europe,"" said Alejandro Servide, director of professionals and recruitment process outsourcing at Argentina's branch of Randstad, the world's second-largest staffing company. As part of the austerity measures aimed at balancing the budget, Macri's administration has laid off thousands of government workers and slashed funding for dance, science and other programs. Hundreds recently protested outside the headquarters of the National Scientific and Technical Research Council, Argentina's main agency for science and technology. ""The science sector is suffering because these budget cuts ordered by Macri endanger the continuity of scientific activity,"" said Alberto Kornblihtt, a molecular biologist. ""This is undoubtedly contributing to a brain drain that we've suffered at other times (of crisis) in our country."" There are no official statistics available on how many Argentines have moved to Europe. Argentina's immigration directorate said it is nearly impossible to keep track of the number because Argentines leaving the country don't have to provide information on their destination or how long they'll stay. But academics, research groups and consulting firms agree there has been a rise in the number of people leaving, especially among young, educated Argentines — just as there was during the nation's worst crisis 17 years ago. Back then, millions were plunged into poverty, more than 20 percent of the population became unemployed and many reportedly went hungry in a country that is one world's biggest producers of beef, soy and wheat. ""When Argentina goes through these profound crises, people search for options, and just like it happened in 2001-2002 when nearly 800,000 Argentines went abroad, today we're living through perhaps the initial phase,"" said Ariel Gonzalez, executive secretary of the Center for International Studies at the Catholic University of Argentina. ""That means that there's a sector of society — the middle and high class professionals — who are eyeing a Plan B, which is that if the crisis deepens, one of the options would be to go abroad."" Servide said Randstad Argentina carries out about 160 daily interviews for surveys. One of the questions they ask is whether if given the chance, they would be interested in living abroad. ""About 80 percent tell you yes,"" he said. Manuel Miglioranza, a 26-year-old lawyer, is moving next month to Toulouse, France. Although he doesn't have dual Argentine-French nationality, he's going to take French lessons and find a job through a temporary work permit allowed through a treaty between the two nations. ""The economic situation in Argentina is not helping. You can't progress unless you work for the state or you have dollars,"" he said. ""I know many people who are leaving."" Millions of Europeans flooded into Argentina in the 19th century to escape war and poverty back home, which has been a source of pride for the country. ""Argentina gave peace to those who were escaping war, freedom to those escaping religious persecution, and bread and work to those escaping hunger,"" said Horacio Garcia, director of Argentina's National Migration Directorate. ""Of the last six presidents, four of them were first-generation sons of immigrants,"" Garcia noted. ""Their fathers came to Argentina with a cardboard suitcase, and they saw that their children in a short amount of time became presidents of the nation. That hardly happens anywhere else in the world."" By the 20th century, a strong workforce along with export earnings from agricultural products and beef had helped turn Argentina into one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Argentines were also among ""the most Europeanized and educated people in Latin America,"" Gabriela Nouzeilles and Graciela Montaldo write in their anthology ""The Argentina Reader: History, Culture and Politics."" ""Their literacy rate (about 90 percent) was the highest by far. Until 1945, the country boasted the highest per capita income on the continent, the most extensive urbanization, the largest middle class, as well as the best newspapers, universities, and publishing houses."" But political mismanagement and lower prices for agricultural products that form the country's economic backbone have for decades led to cyclical booms and busts. The Spanish government recently launched an initiative that allows a limited number of descendants of Spaniards living in Argentina without a Spanish passport to seek a special three-month work visa. Once they find a job, they can request Spanish nationality and bring their families. There were 76,328 Argentines officially registered by mid-2018 in Spain. ""There are many, many Argentines living here. We're like pigeons — everywhere,"" quipped Paz Pucheu, an Argentine now living in Spain. The 25-year-old radio and television announcer went to Barcelona in 2017 when ""things got really complicated"" in Argentina. She began working at a restaurant and eventually landed a job at a local radio station. ""Like other Latin American countries, Argentina was a Spanish colony. With friends now we joke around that we're colonizing our colonizers,"" she said. Associated Press"
What Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's baby says about race,www.nbcnews.com,Reuters,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/what-harry-meghan-s-baby-says-about-race-n997461,"LONDON — Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle, an American actress of African-American heritage, was a historic moment for Britain's royal family. Some say the imminent birth of their baby is, if anything, even more significant. Due in the coming weeks, the baby will be seventh-in-line to the throne and, it is believed, the first person of mixed race in such a senior position in the history of British royalty.
""I think this baby is going to be hugely important historically because it's going to break new ground,"" royal biographer Claudia Joseph told Reuters.
""Whether it's a girl or a boy, it will be the first Afro-American baby to be born into the royal family.""
With a black mother and white father, Meghan's ethnicity has never been far away from discussions about her relationship with Queen Elizabeth's grandson — scrutiny that has often been unwelcome.
Related World news World news FROM 2017: Royal love story exposes Britain's 'quiet and unique brand of racism' In late 2016 when he first announced they were dating, Harry issued a rare rebuke to the press, condemning the racial undertones of articles. One commentator had written how Meghan would bring ""rich and exotic DNA"" to the Windsors.
Michelle Ebanks, head of the company that publishes ""Essence,"" a U.S. magazine for African-American women, sees the positive.
""Every time we can break a barrier and be, as black people, somewhere were we’re not expected to be that is to be celebrated.
""Because we should not be in a box. Not in a box, not outside a box - there is no box! So, to be royalty should be normal,"" Ebanks told Reuters.
Could Prince Harry and Meghan Markle be moving to Africa? April 22, 2019 02:11 But Kehinde Andrews, a sociology professor at England's Birmingham City University who writes on race issues, is less sure that the royal baby indicates any improvement in racial equality.
""Unfortunately, because racism is so bad and so historic and so entrenched, we tend to look at things, any things,"" he said.
""So any symbol that could possibly be good we tend to over-celebrate: Barack Obama becoming president, the film 'Black Panther' got people excited, anytime we have someone which ... looks like a similar progress — unfortunately we get carried away.
""But I think when we sit back and actively analyze what's happened and what's changed we realize that this is nothing, means nothing at all.""
For Ingrid Seward, editor of ""Majesty"" magazine, the new baby will be a small but important step in the royal family's evolution.
""In order for the monarchy to survive it has to evolve and this is another way of it evolving and becoming more in tune with the multiracial society in which we now live.""
Royal biographer Robert Jobson said Meghan's ethnicity resonated with many young Britons.
""I was at the wedding reporting for American television and there were little black girls dressed up as princesses in their princesses dress with little tiaras,"" he said.
""Now even though they would have been excited to be at a royal wedding or even talk about a princess, I don't think that those little girls would have ever dreamed that they could be part of this story.""
Meet Michael Curry, the bishop who spoke at the royal wedding May 22, 2018 04:47 However, those like Jobson whose job it is to cover the royals on a daily basis have found themselves accused of racism on social media by supporters of Meghan, often for reporting critical comments made about her by members of her own family.
Valentine Low, who covers the royal family for the Times of London, wrote in February that some U.S. networks gave the impression that Britain's media was racist and sexist.
""The problem is that in some quarters, particularly in the U.S., any negative coverage is seen as racist,"" he wrote.
""Anything less than unqualified adulation comes under a barrage of abuse on social media.""
But some British journalists say Meghan has been treated differently from other members of the House of Windsor, citing a difference in attitude towards Kate, the wife of Harry's elder brother Prince William.
Broadcaster Afua Hirsch, author of ""Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging"", said ethnicity played a part.
""I would like to see more honesty and introspection in journalists who have repeated some of these tropes about Meghan Markle, and a willingness to at least look at the fact that her treatment has been different,"" she told Reuters.
Meghan herself has said she avoids newspapers and Twitter, but asked about the focus on her ethnicity when her engagement was announced, she said such coverage had been ""disheartening.""
""At the end of the day I'm really just proud of who I am and where I come from,"" she said."
Supreme Court appears likely to allow citizenship question in 2020 census,www.nbcnews.com,Pete Williams,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-appears-likely-allow-citizenship-question-2020-census-n997651,"The Supreme Court seemed willing Tuesday to let the Trump administration add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census form that goes to every U.S. household, despite claims from populous states that it would actually make the count less accurate. Both the government and the challengers agree that adding the question would reduce the census response rate, especially in immigrant communities. But the court's conservative majority seemed prepared to rule that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross acted within his authority to add it because no method is guaranteed to produce an accurate count.
Ross told Congress that the question was added at his direction after he received a letter from the Justice Department saying the citizenship data was needed to properly enforce federal voting laws. Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the court Tuesday that not including the question, and trying to extrapolate the number of citizens and noncitizens by using other government databases, would produce an inaccurate result.
Breaking down the 2020 census citizenship question debate April 23, 2019 02:34 Since it is impossible to say with certainty which method would produce the fewest errors, Ross did not violate the law by opting to include the citizenship question, Francisco said.
""There's always going to be a trade-off"" between information gained and the accuracy of the overall count, he said.
Justice Samuel Alito suggested that he did not think Ross abused his discretion by ordering the question to be added. Both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch said citizenship questions have been included in the census for most of American history.
A federal judge in New York ruled that Ross's explanation was a pretext because he actually asked the Justice Department to send a letter requesting the data. Some of the Supreme Court's more liberal justices were clearly troubled by that fact.
""There needs to be a reason to add the question, and I don't see any reason,"" Justice Elena Kagan said. ""It did seem the secretary was shopping for a need.""
A census is required by the Constitution every 10 years, and the results determine the size of the U.S. House of Representatives delegation for each state. Many programs also use the data to calculate the share of federal funds they give to local governments.
Lawyers for 18 states, several of the nation's largest cities and immigrant rights groups told the court that the citizenship question would make immigrants reluctant to respond to census takers.
Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties Union said experience from past surveys shows that noncitizens respond inaccurately to the census about a third of the time.
""Adding the question doesn't help enforcing the Voting Rights Act because people so often lie,"" Ho said.
Led by New York, the states opposing the addition of the citizenship question also said Ross' directive sidestepped the Census Bureau's longstanding procedures for testing changes to the questionnaire in order to evaluate whether they would lead to an undercount.
Because the citizenship question would depress minority responses, the challengers said, including it on the form would actually produce a less accurate count than leaving it off and using Social Security and IRS data to supplement the information gathered from the census form.
President Donald Trump weighed in on the issue in early April.
""Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!""
The Supreme Court will decide the case by late June.

Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post via Getty Images file Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 23, 2019, 4:26 PM UTC By Allan Smith White House senior adviser Jared Kushner said Tuesday that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation was worse for the country than Russian electoral interference, which he downplayed as ""a couple of Facebook ads."" Speaking at the Time 100 Summit, Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, was asked repeatedly about Mueller's report, a redacted version of which was released last week. ""You look at what Russia did, buying some Facebook ads to try to sow dissent and do it, and it’s a terrible thing,"" Kushner said. ""But I think the investigations and all of the speculation that’s happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple of Facebook ads."" ""I mean I spent about — I think they said they spent about $160,000 — I spent $160,000 on Facebook every three hours during the campaign,"" he continued. ""So if you look at the magnitude of what they did and what they accomplished, I think the ensuing investigations have been way more harmful to our country."" Shortly after the interview, Trump tweeted praise for Kushner's appearance. ""Great interview by Jared,"" Trump wrote. ""Nice to have extraordinarily smart people serving our Country!"" According to Mueller's redacted report, which covered Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and whether Trump obstructed justice, Russian Facebook ads reached as many as 126 million people. Mueller cited Facebook for that statistic. Mueller wrote that the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked online disinformation firm, began targeting the U.S. as early as 2014 with its social media trolling efforts, which the special counsel wrote were ""designed to attract U.S. audiences."" ""These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists,"" he wrote. ""Over time, these social media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences."" ""By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton,"" he added. ""The IRA made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political rallies."" Mueller's investigation did not identify any evidence that U.S. citizens ""knowingly or intentionally coordinated"" with the Russians who controlled that effort, which included Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. Kushner said Tuesday that when the revelations about Russia's election interference surfaced, the Trump campaign didn't see those efforts as effective. ""You can look at it Monday morning quarterback and say, ‘Maybe you should have looked at those times,’"" Kushner said. ""But I personally think that what happened was is, all these people thought Trump was going to lose. They all predicted Trump was going to lose. They were wrong. The American electorate in this great democratic system chose the opposite. And then I think that instead of saying, ‘Oh wait, we got it wrong,’ they said. ‘Well, maybe it was Russia.’"" Kushner was referred to multiple times in Mueller's report with regard to leads involving a possible Trump-Russia conspiracy — something the special counsel said investigators ultimately could not prove. Mueller wrote that his probe ""established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government"" but ultimately ""did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities."" The report detailed Kushner's meeting with former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russian ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak after the 2016 election, and a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting he attended with the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, at which a Kremlin-connected lawyer was supposed to provide damaging information on Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, but ultimately did not.

Walgreens to raise tobacco buying age to 21 in September amid FDA pressure,www.nbcnews.com,"Angelica LaVito, CNBC",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/walgreens-raise-tobacco-buying-age-21-september-amid-fda-pressure-n997506,"Walgreens is increasing the age to buy tobacco at its drugstores to 21 later this year as the retailer faces possible sanctions from the Food and Drug Administration for allegedly selling to minors. The FDA put Walgreens “on notice” in February, accusing the pharmacy chain of violating rules that prohibit selling cigarettes and other tobacco products to underage buyers. Walgreens, the FDA noted, is currently the top violator among pharmacies that sell tobacco products. Some 22 percent of Walgreens locations inspected by the agency caught employees illegally selling tobacco products to minors, the FDA said.
Walgreens has tightened its policies in response. Starting Sept. 1, it will require customers to be at least 21 years old in order to buy tobacco products.
“We’ve seen positive results from other recent efforts to strengthen our policies related to tobacco sales, and believe this next step can be even more impactful to reduce its use among teens and young adults,” Richard Ashworth, Walgreens president of operations, said in a statement.
A dozen states have already raised the minimum buying age and a handful of others are exploring similar action. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last week said he would introduce federal legislation sometime next month, marking the strongest support yet in Congress for what’s been dubbed “T21.”"
Acting DHS chief: Family separations 'not worth it' from enforcement perspective,www.nbcnews.com,Dareh Gregorian,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/acting-dhs-chief-family-separations-not-worth-it-enforcement-perspective-n997626,"Acting Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan said separating migrant families at the U.S. southern border is ""not on the table,"" and the policy was ""not worth it"" from an enforcement perspective. In his first network interview as acting DHS secretary to broadcast, McAleenan told NBC News' Lester Holt on Tuesday, ""We're not pursuing that approach.""
McAleenan's predecessor, Kirstjen Nielsen, was forced out of the job earlier this month, in part because she'd refused to reinstate the policy of separating children from their families at the border, U.S. officials have told NBC News . Nielsen had implemented the policy last year, but it was blocked by the courts.
Migrant family separations 'not worth it,' acting DHS secretary says April 23, 2019 03:44 Asked if he thought the policy had been effective, McAleenan hedged.
""So prosecuting violations of the law does have a consequence and it does deter behavior. But it did not work if you lose the public trust,"" he said, adding that from an ""enforcement perspective, it’s not worth it.""
Of the children separated from their families at the border, McAleenan claimed ""they were always intended to be reunited,"" which is a ""part of this story that I think had been lost.""
""But again we're not pursuing that approach,"" he continued in an interview from DHS's offices in the World Trade Center. ""Really a better system, as I've said many times, would allow us to detain families together during fair and expeditious immigration proceedings and getting actual immigration results from courts, so that’s what’s missing from the current situation.""
McAleenan insisted the family separation policy wasn't coming back.
""I think the president has been clear that family separation is not on the table and again this was a zero tolerance prosecution initiative that was targeted at adults violating the law. It did have the impact of several 2,000-plus families being separated during that prosecution,"" he said.
He said a judge’s order to reunite the families last year just sped up a process that was already in place.
""These processes were going to reunite parents and children after the prosecution, after the immigration proceeding, and really what the ... court order did is it mandated that happen more quickly,"" McAleenan said.
""And, really, it was done very effectively. Border patrol agents kept very careful records between the relationships between parents and children, and those connections were made very expeditiously by Health and Human Services working with the Department of Homeland Security,"" he said.
DHS’s acting inspector general John Kelly had a different take in a report he issued in October that found ""DHS was not fully prepared to implement the administration's zero-tolerance policy or to deal with some of its after-effects."" The report also found that Customs and Border Protection, which had been led by McAleenan, ""lacked the ability to reliably track children separated from their parents, and in some cases failed to adequately inform parents about the separation policy.""
In the interview, McAleenan also pushed back on reports by CNN and The New York Times that President Donald Trump had told him he should close the southern border and would pardon him if he faced any legal challenges.
""I'm not going to do anything that violates the law ever. I'm a law enforcement official,"" McAleenan said. ""I've been asked to serve in this role, and I'll carry that out, with full focus on my legal duties. That said, I've never been asked, never been suggested to do, anything unlawful by the president or anyone else. And I wouldn't do it.""
He acknowledged: ""It's challenging when you have people filling in new roles.""
""But the good thing about DHS is we've got a tremendous reservoir of career leadership, a lot of executive talent. These are folks that I've come up with through the ranks that I know very well. I know what their capabilities and qualities are,"" he said.
""Everybody's focused on keeping our momentum and making sure we carry out all of our various missions effectively.""
Asked if he was concerned about the job's turnover rate — McAleenan is the fourth DHS secretary in Trump's two years in office — he said, ""I'm getting tremendous support from the White House.""
""I intend to keep that support by, by taking the steps we need to address the situations we're facing,"" he said.

Lucy Liu to get star on Hollywood Walk of Fame,www.nbcnews.com,Charles Lam,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/lucy-liu-get-star-hollywood-walk-fame-n997566,"Actress Lucy Liu is finally getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ana Martinez, producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, confirmed to NBC News that Liu’s star is scheduled to be unveiled May 1 . The date is about three weeks before the premiere of the seventh and final season of CBS' “Elementary ,” which stars Liu.
The chamber of commerce first announced Liu’s induction in June 2018 , without a ceremony date.
The 50-year-old star rose to fame in the '90s on the Fox legal comedy-drama ""Ally McBeal,"" which Liu was a series regular in for three seasons, appearing in four seasons total. Her work on ""Ally McBeal"" earned her Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nominations.
Liu, whose credits include ""Charlie's Angels,"" the ""Kill Bill"" franchise, and NBC's ""Southland,"" has appeared in television shows and films across multiple genres, including animation. She has also directed episodes of ""Elementary"" and ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.""
In 2000, Liu became the first Asian American woman to host ""Saturday Night Live.""
Related Opinion Opinion CBS' 'Elementary' succeeds because it's about so much more than the genius of Sherlock Holmes Liu’s star will be placed next to that of actress Anna May Wong, a Hollywood pioneer who found silent film success in 1920s.
Martinez said Wong was ""the first Chinese American actress to grace Hollywood’s film screens.""
""When we place Walk of Fame stars, we love to juxtapose Hollywood’s golden age icons with the role models who represent the exciting shifts taking place in the film industry whenever we can,"" she said.
Born in Los Angeles’ Chinatown, Wong was “fully Americanized” but was offered roles that “were highly troped Asian roles that reinforced stereotypes,” Rob Buscher, a film and media scholar, told NBC News in 2017 .
Wong left the U.S. to work in Europe in the late 1920s and spent the early ’30s traveling between the two. Wong received her star in 1960.
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce receives about 300 nominations for the Walk of Fame each year . A committee selects approximately 30 names for inclusion from that group. The organization nominating the honoree, which must have the honoree’s consent, is responsible for paying the $50,000 required to create and install the star. The money also goes to maintain the Walk of Fame.

Deputy on leave for homophobic comment over teen's suicide,www.nbcnews.com,Gwen Aviles,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/deputy-leave-homophobic-comment-over-teen-s-suicide-n997556,"An Alabama deputy has been placed on administrative leave for writing a homophobic comment on a Facebook post about a gay teen who died by suicide. Nigel Shelby died by suicide after being bullied for being gay. GoFundMe Madison County Deputy Jeff Graves wrote that he is “seriously offended” by the LGBTQ movement in response to a WZDX-TV Facebook post about the death of 15-year-old Nigel Shelby, who was a freshman at Huntsville High School in Alabama. Shelby was being bullied over his sexuality, his mother told NBC News.
""He would tell me that kids would say things to him that would hurt his feelings,"" Camika Shelby said in a phone interview Tuesday. ""I didn't think it was as deep as things I'm hearing now.""
The deputy also mocked the LGBTQ community in the comment by redefining its commonly used acronym as “Liberty Guns Bible Trump BBQ"" and stating ""That’s my kind of LGBTQ movement,” according to local NBC affiliate WAFF .
The Madison County Sheriff's Office told NBC News on Tuesday it had received complaints of a social media post allegedly made Sunday by one of its employees.
""The sheriff's office holds all its employees to high standards and the public can be assured that a thorough and complete audit will be conducted and appropriate action will be taken,"" a sheriff's office spokesman said.
Graves, who did not immediately return a request for comment, has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the audit.
The deputy’s redefinition of ""LGBTQ"" is similar to one used by Belle’s Smokin’ BBQ, a Kentucky restaurant that came under fire over the weekend for selling T-shirts that read: ""I support LGBTQ: Liberty, Guns, Bible, Trump, BBQ.""
A Kentucky barbecue food truck is getting a lot of heat after advertising its T-shirts on social media.
Belle's Smokin' BBQ took a play on the acronym LGBTQ and changed it to Liberty, Guns, Bible, Trump and BBQ.
What do you think? https://t.co/pQ1YkaEO0z
— WNDU (@WNDU) April 19, 2019 Nigel Shelby's mother said she is saddened and shocked by the death of her only child.
""The night before it actually happened, we had a conversation before I went to bed because I had to be at work at 3 a.m. the next day,"" Camika Shelby said. ""He told me he loved me and he wanted me to have a good day at work.""
She said she hopes to bring awareness to the dangers of bullying and the effects it can have on children like her son, who was struggling with his identity.
""If they're going through stuff already and you have other kids who are making them feel bad about themselves, it has an even bigger impact than if they weren't struggling with those things,"" Camika Shelby said.
Young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer are five times as likely to have attempted suicide compared to their straight peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among young people, research shows. Black youth, like Shelby, are especially vulnerable and take their lives at nearly twice the rate of their white counterparts, according to a 2018 CDC study .
 Michigan adoption agency reverses LGBTQ policy Nearly 74 percent of LGBTQ youth nationwide report not feeling safe at school, according to the Center for Social Equity. And in Alabama, there are no nondiscrimination laws and policies covering LGBTQ students.
Nadia M. Richardson, a Huntsville High School alumna and the founder of the mental health advocacy organization No More Martyrs, said that Shelby’s death underscores that suicide among black youth is on the rise.
“We have so much to understand and so much work to do,” Richardson said in a recent Facebook post. “Racism, sexism, homophobia, classism; all of that plays a part. Bullying is a byproduct of a world ill-equipped to include that which is deemed different.”
 New hope rises for would-be LGBTQ parents in New York Advocacy groups, including the Trevor Project, which provides crisis intervention services to LGBTQ youth, has said that just one supportive person can decrease an LGBTQ youth’s risk of suicide by 30 percent.
Amit Paley, the executive director of the Trevor Project, noted that his organization often hears from “LGBTQ young people who have thoughts of suicide, or feel unsafe or unloved at school or home — just for being who they are.”

Michigan adoption agency reverses LGBTQ policy,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/michigan-adoption-agency-reverses-lgbtq-policy-n997491,"LANSING, Mich. — A major faith-based foster care and adoption contractor for the state of Michigan said Monday it will place children in LGBTQ homes, reversing course following a recent legal settlement. Grand Rapids-based Bethany Christian Services is responsible for about 8 percent of Michigan’s more than 13,000 foster care and adoption cases involving children from troubled households.
“We are disappointed with how this settlement agreement has been implemented by the state government. Nonetheless, Bethany will continue operations in Michigan, in compliance with our legal contract requirements,” the nonprofit said in a statement, confirming a policy change that was first reported by WGVU-FM.
Related NBC OUT NBC OUT Philadelphia can exclude foster agency that won't work with gays, court rules Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, announced the settlement last month with same-sex couples who had sued in 2017. It prevents faith-based agencies from refusing to place children in LGBTQ households for religious reasons if it has accepted them for referral from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
Lansing-based St. Vincent Catholic Charities challenged the deal in federal court last week, alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Of the faith-based agencies known to not serve LGBTQ couples or individuals in Michigan, Bethany does the most work for the state. The nonprofit was handling 1,159 cases as of February. Catholic Charities had 404 cases, or 3 percent, while St. Vincent had 80, or less than 1 percent.
State human services department spokesman Bob Wheaton said the agency was pleased it will “be able to continue its long-standing partnership with Bethany in providing services to children and families.”
Nessel tweeted over the weekend that having more adoption agencies not discriminate results in “more children adopted into loving, nurturing ‘forever’ homes. Thank you to Bethany Christian Services.”
As a private attorney, Nessel — who is a lesbian — successfully fought to overturn Michigan’s ban on gay marriage.
Related feature feature New hope rises for would-be LGBTQ parents in New York On April 11, Bethany’s national board of directors voted to change the policy. It applies only in Michigan, not to its operations in other states. The policy change also does not impact private adoptions, according to Bethany.
A 2015 Republican-enacted law says child-placement agencies are not required to provide any services that conflict with their sincerely held religious beliefs. But Nessel’s settlement says the law does not apply if agencies are under contract with the state.
In its lawsuit , St. Vincent said it fears the state will not renew its contract in October because of the local nonprofit’s religious beliefs and practices.
“If St. Vincent is unable to receive referrals from or contract with the State, it will be forced to close its foster care and adoption programs, ending a decades-old religious ministry and reducing the number of agencies available to serve families and children in need,” the agency said in the complaint.

Brothers in Jussie Smollett case file defamation suit against actor's legal team,www.nbcnews.com,Minyvonne Burke,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/brothers-jussie-smollett-case-file-defamation-suit-against-actor-s-n997531,"The two brothers who Chicago police say were paid by Jussie Smollett to attack him in a staged hate crime to bolster his career filed a federal lawsuit against the ""Empire"" actor's attorneys claiming they made defamatory comments. In the 16-page suit filed Tuesday in the Northern District of Illinois, Ola and Abel Osundairo accuse lawyers Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian of making ""public defamatory statements"" against them after Chicago prosecutors dropped charges against Smollett.
The suit also claims that Smollett staged the attack because he ""wanted his employer and the public to notice and appreciate him as a successful Black, openly gay actor.""
“We will no longer sit back and allow these lies to continue,"" the brothers said in a statement their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, read at a news conference.
According to the complaint, shortly after the charges were dismissed, Glandian said during television interviews and on a podcast that Smollett was innocent and that Ola and Abel Osundairo ""criminally attacked"" the actor. The lawsuit said she also falsely accused the brothers of wearing whiteface during the Jan. 29 assault and implied that Abel Osundairo had a brief homosexual relationship with Smollett.
Geragos, according to the suit, ""falsely stated that he could not think of anyone else who committed the hate crime.""
Ola and Bola Osundairo via Strategia Consulting LLC Smollett, who is black and gay, told police that his attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs before beating him, tying a noose around his neck, and pouring what he said was bleach on him.
Ola and Abel Osundairo were arrested in February after an image taken from a surveillance camera showed them walking away from the area where Smollett said he was attacked by two masked men .
Days after the brothers' arrest, they were released by police as the probe shifted into whether the actor orchestrated the assault on himself.
Smollett, 36, was labeled a suspect in the investigation and arrested in February. The following month, he was indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly making a false report in the assault police called a hoax.
According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid the brothers — who have ties to the show ""Empire"" — $3,500 via a check to attack him because he was unhappy with his salary on the Fox TV show.
Prosecutor details how Smollett investigation unfolded Feb. 21, 2019 14:52 The charges against Smollett were dropped weeks later by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, but the lawsuit states the actor's legal team continued to accuse the Osundairo brothers of lying .
""We want to end these malicious attacks and ensure that those responsible for continuing to destroy the reputation of the Chicago Police Department, city of Chicago and that of brothers are held accountable,"" Ola and Abel Osundairo's attorney said at the news conference.
Geragos and Glandian released a joint statement Tuesday afternoon calling the lawsuit ""ridiculous"" and said they know it will be dismissed because it ""lacks any legal footing.""
""At first we thought this comical legal document was a parody,"" they said. ""Instead this so-called lawsuit by the brothers is more of their lawyer driven nonsense, and a desperate attempt for them to stay relevant and further profit from an attack they admit they perpetrated.""
Schmidt said that her clients know what they did was wrong, but did not take part in defrauding the Chicago Police Department.
“They were asked to do something by a friend that they trusted and at the end of the day, that friend betrayed them,” she said.
As a result of Geragos and Glandian's remarks, the Osundairo brothers ""have suffered significant emotional distress and feel unsafe and alienated in their local Chicago community,"" the lawsuit states. They are seeking unspecified damages.

'Human error' may have led to tiger attack on Kansas zookeeper,www.nbcnews.com,David K. Li,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/human-error-may-have-led-tiger-attack-kansas-zookeeper-n997621,"The Topeka Zoo blamed ""human error"" for the almost-fatal mauling of a zookeeper by a tiger over the weekend, officials said Tuesday. The zoo identified the victim of Saturday's attack as longtime employee Kristyn Hayden-Ortega, who has been with them since 2001, director Brendan Wiley said.
The 7-year-old male tiger, named Sanjiv, attacked Hayden-Ortega in his outdoor habitat.
""The process that we are really looking at, that we are trying to correct is, 'How can we minimize the potential for human error?'"" Wiley said. ""We need to find that way and minimize the possibility of human error creating an event like this.""
Wiley declined to elaborate on exactly what error played a role in the attack on Hayden-Ortega.
But earlier in his meeting with reporters, Wiley said the zoo has found no problems with the tiger enclosure — designed to keep animals safely apart from their human keepers.
Sanjiv, a Sumatran tiger at the Topeka Zoo in Topeka, Kansas in November, 2018. Topeka Capital-Journal via AP file The zoo hasn't interviewed Hayden-Ortega yet and will wait until she's further along in her recovery, according to Wiley. She was recently moved out of the intensive care unit .
""We think we understand the sequence of events. We need her to confirm that,"" Wiley said.
""We were 100 percent confident in the infrastructure of that facility when we put tigers back in later that same day. We have no question about the integrity of the space or the environment.""
The zoo has said there are no plans to euthanize Sanjiv, who was back on display Sunday.
Zoo employees saved Hayden-Ortega from further injury or death by showing Sanjiv his food bucket and calling his name, which lured the big cat safely away.
But had Sanjiv kept attacking Hayden-Ortega, the zoo had a 30.06-caliber hunting rifle aimed at him and was ready to fire.
""If that tiger would have taken one more turn back toward Kristyn, it would have been lethal force used to stop that aggression,"" Wiley said.
Shanna Simpson, an animal care supervisor at the zoo, said, ""Kristyn is an amazing zookeeper.""
""She is a very important member of our zookeeper staff. She's a leader. She is one of our most experienced keepers. She helps teach the less-experienced keepers.""

Wall Street heads toward record close after a slew of companies report strong earnings,www.nbcnews.com,"Fred Imbert, CNBC",04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/wall-street-heads-toward-record-close-after-slew-companies-report-n997676,"The S&P 500 headed for a record close on Tuesday as Wall Street cheered stronger-than-expected quarterly profits from some of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies. This is the busiest week of the corporate earnings season. Once the dust settles, more than 140 S&P 500 companies will have released their calendar first-quarter results. So far, the results have largely topped expectations. More than 78 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported have surpassed analyst expectations, according to FactSet data.
The broad index traded 0.8 percent higher at 2,932.09, above an all-time closing high of 2,930.75 set on Sept. 20.
Tuesday’s move toward an all-time closing high comes less than six months after a sharp decline in late December, which led the S&P 500 to its worst annual performance since 2008. But stocks quickly turned around as the Federal Reserve reversed course on monetary policy while the tone around U.S.-China trade talks improved.
“These market levels are justified,” said Kevin Barry, chief investment officer at Captrust Advisors. “The fourth-quarter sell-off actually prevented a recession because policymakers responded extremely quickly. Both President Xi and President Trump cooled off the rhetoric and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell came out and reversed course.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite also traded higher, gaining 155 points and 1.2 percent, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was also headed for a record close.
Dow members Coca-Cola and United Technologies reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Their shares rose 1.7 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.
Twitter shares jumped 16.3 percent on its stronger-than-expected results. The social media company said its monthly active users totaled 330 million, more than a FactSet estimate of 318 million.
Defense giant Lockheed Martin also rallied more than 6 percent after its earnings easily topped expectations. The company reported strong operating margins across all its major businesses, which include aeronautics and missiles.
“Among the key companies that have reported, most of them have beaten expectations,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. “That means we’re probably going to escape an earnings recession. That will be key for the market to rally from here.”
Wall Street also kept an eye on oil prices as they hit their highest level this year amid intensifying concern about global supplies. It comes after the U.S. announced a further clampdown on Iran’s oil exports."

Chanel Lewis sentenced to life in prison for death of New York City jogger,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chanel-lewis-sentenced-life-prison-death-new-york-city-jogger-n997686,"A man convicted of murder in the 2016 death of a New York City runner was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday. Chanel Lewis was convicted earlier this month of killing Karina Vetrano in a case that stirred urban fears, helped change the state's DNA-investigation rules and raised questions about race and police procedures.
""While there is no denying that Karina Vetrano's death is tragic and that her family and friends suffered a great loss, every aspect of this case — from the police investigation to jury deliberations —was propelled by a desire to convict at all costs,"" the Legal Aid Society, which represents Lewis, said in a statement. ""This was done without any concern for Mr. Lewis's constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. We will appeal this case to the Appellate Division to secure Mr. Lewis the justice that he deserves.""
The body of Karina Vetrano, 30, was found in a Queens marsh after she went for a run on August 2, 2016. She had been sexually assaulted, the NYPD said. WNBC On Monday, the judge denied a defense motion to set aside the guilty verdict after hearing arguments about alleged juror misconduct.
Phil Vetrano found his 30-year-old daughter's body, sexually abused and strangled, in a park where they often went for runs together.
The attack redoubled the wariness of women who run alone, and it baffled investigators for a time. Lewis was arrested six months later.
Authorities said his DNA was found on Vetrano's neck and cellphone and in a mixture of DNA under her fingernails. His own phone contained downloaded photos of the crime scene and searches for information about the case, police said.
And Lewis recorded a confession, saying he was upset at someone else — a neighbor of his who played loud music — and ""lost it"" when he saw Vetrano.
""One thing led to another,"" he said in the confession. ""Hitting her and stuff like that.""
Phillip and Catherine Vetrano, parents of Karina Vetrano, arrive to court in New York on March 20, 2019. Chanel Lewis is accused of killing their daughter. Seth Wenig / AP Lewis said he strangled Vetrano but didn't sexually abuse her.
Lewis' defense said that the DNA evidence hadn't been gathered properly and that the confession was coerced and didn't match Vetrano's injuries or some other facts.
Before Lewis' arrest, the investigation prompted police prosecutors to seek state permission to use a technique known as familial DNA searching — looking for people similar enough to be closely related to whoever left DNA at the crime scene, in hopes they will lead to a suspect.
The state Commission on Forensic Science ultimately agreed in June 2017 to allow familial DNA searching in murder, rape and some other cases. The decision came over the objections of civil libertarians who said the practice entangles law-abiding people in investigations because of their family ties.
By the time the commission gave its approval, Lewis had already been arrested.

"Transgender adults have higher risk of poor health, U.S. study finds",www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-adults-have-higher-risk-poor-health-u-s-study-n997591,"Transgender adults may be more likely to have unhealthy habits and medical issues that negatively impact their quality of life than people whose gender identity matches what it says on their birth certificates, a U.S. study suggests. Researchers examined survey data from 3,075 transgender adults as well as 719,567 adults who are cisgender, meaning their gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth.
Compared to cisgender Americans, transgender individuals were more likely to be sedentary, current smokers, and uninsured, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.
 Michigan adoption agency reverses LGBTQ policy Transgender people were also 30 percent more likely to report being in “fair” or “poor” health over the past month than cisgender adults, as well as 66 percent more likely to report experiencing severe mental distress.
“The U.S. has made a lot of progress over the last several years toward acceptance and celebration of natural human diversity in gender identity and expression,” study author Kellan Baker said by email. But between 2014 and 2017 - the period when the survey was done - attitudes shifted and treatment of transgender often got worse, said Baker, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.
“This study shows that being a transgender person in the U.S. today - being transgender in a society that you know doesn’t fully accept you - is hard,” Baker added. “It affects your health in negative ways, and that’s why issues such as nondiscrimination protections for transgender people are public health issues.”
An estimated 0.55 percent of the people in the survey identified as transgender, which suggests there may be about 1.27 million transgender adults in the U.S.
Survey participants were asked if they considered themselves transgender and were given four options to categorize their identities: trans male (people who identify as male but were assigned female at birth); trans female (individuals who identify as female but were assigned male at birth); gender non-conforming; or not transgender.
Overall, about 19 percent of transgender respondents were current smokers, compared with roughly 16 percent of cisgender people.
About 35 percent of transgender individuals were inactive, compared with nearly 26 percent of cisgender adults.
And, almost 80 percent of transgender participants had health insurance, compared with 85 percent of other people in the study.
Transgender adults also reported more days in the previous month when they felt physically and mentally unhealthy or felt unable to do all of their usual daily activities.
 Gender 'X': Nevada to allow nonbinary people to self-identify on IDs The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how gender identity might directly impact health. Another limitation is that researchers lacked data on how differences within the transgender population such as gender, race and sexual orientation might influence the results.
“I think the take-home message for transgender adults here is clear, which is that transgender adults face additional mental and physical health disparities when compared to cisgender individuals,” said Xiang Cai, a researcher at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City who wasn’t involved in the study.
Cai attributes the higher risks for poor health in trans people to “multiple levels of transgender-specific stigmas.”
“However, I think it is important to note that adults in the transgender community are capable and resilient,” Cai said by email.
The study also didn’t look at whether transgender individuals had gender-affirming surgery or were able to make their outward appearance match their gender identity, Cai said.
“Gender-affirmation treatments may be associated with higher levels of quality of life among those who desire them regardless of age,” Cai noted.

Judge temporarily blocks release of Robert Kraft spa video,www.nbcnews.com,Janelle Griffith,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-temporarily-blocks-release-robert-kraft-spa-video-n997631,"New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft scored a procedural victory Tuesday as a judge temporarily barred the release of surveillance videos of him allegedly engaging in sex acts at a Florida spa. Judge Leonard Hanser of Palm Beach County accepted arguments by Kraft's attorneys that releasing the video could harm his chances for a fair trial on misdemeanor prostitution charges.
The judge ruled Tuesday that the video should not be handed to the media as a public record until a jury is seated, a plea agreement is reached or the state of Florida drops the case.
“This case has drawn extraordinary media attention and it is not because of the nature of the alleged crime,” the ruling states. “Rather, it is because Defendant is who he is.”
Police say the video shows Kraft and other customers engaged in sexual acts with masseuses at the spa.
Lawyers for several media organizations, including NBC News, had filed a motion to argue for the release of the video.
Kraft, 77, pleaded not guilty in February to two counts of soliciting a prostitute at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida. Authorities allege he paid for a sex act at the spa on Jan. 19 and again the next morning, hours before the Patriots won the AFC Championship that sent them to the Super Bowl, according to court documents.
Kraft has fought against the release of video. His attorneys filed a motion for a protective order claiming that releasing the evidence would invade his privacy and jeopardize his right to a fair trial.
Kraft was one of several men charged with solicitation after police secretly installed cameras at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in what authorities initially said was a monthslong investigation into human trafficking. Investigators have since said that there was no evidence of human trafficking at the spa.
Kraft released a statement addressing the charges against him in late March, a month after his arrest.
“Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing,"" he said in part. ""The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being. I have extraordinary respect for women.""

Trump tweet about impeachment confuses political conclusions with legal ones,www.nbcnews.com,Steve Vladeck,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-tweet-about-impeachment-confuses-political-conclusions-legal-ones-ncna997641,"It seems increasingly likely, notwithstanding (or perhaps because of) special counsel Robert Mueller’s report , that there will never be widespread agreement about whether President Donald Trump engaged in any criminal activity arising out of Russian interference in the 2016 election — and the subsequent investigation into that interference. Perhaps with that in mind, the tweeter-in-chief took to social media on Monday to declare that “Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment. There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you can’t impeach.” Fortunately for the president, he’s not taking my constitutional law class. If he were, he’d be in serious danger of failing. Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment. There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you can’t impeach. It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President! Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2019 The first sentence of Trump’s tweet is (somewhat) accurate; Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” But there are two critical reasons why it does not follow from this text that Congress “can’t impeach” if “[t]here were no crimes.”
The first reason is the historical understanding of the Constitution’s text. The term “other high crimes and misdemeanors” was understood by the Constitution’s drafters to not refer only to criminal activity. In pre-revolutionary England, the term was used to refer to various forms of official misconduct, including maladministration, that did not (and could not) carry criminal consequences. The Constitution’s drafting history similarly reflects the Founders’ view that the remedy was not limited to those crimes Congress had elsewhere proscribed.
As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65, impeachable offenses arose from “the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust.”
As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 , impeachable offenses arose from “the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust.” And James Madison himself, during a crucial debate in the middle of the First Congress, invoked as an example of an impeachable offense a president who wantonly dismissed government officers for no good reason. As the Congressional Research Service (CRS) found in a 2015 report , “[m]any of the impeachments approved by the House of Representatives have included conduct that did not involve criminal activity. Less than a third have specifically invoked a criminal statute or used the term ‘crime.’”
These historical precedents aside, the idea that a government officer can be impeached for non-criminal misconduct also comports with the broader purposes of impeachment. As the CRS report concluded, “[t]he purpose of impeachment is not to inflict personal punishment for criminal activity.... Instead, impeachment is a ‘remedial’ tool; it serves to effectively ‘maintain constitutional government’ by removing individuals unfit for office.”
Thus, impeachment carries no criminal consequences; the remedy is complete upon the officer’s removal. (As a result, double jeopardy does not apply to subsequent criminal trials in cases in which criminal conduct is the basis for impeachment.) It would make little sense, structurally, to require proof of a crime for a process that is not intended to impose punishment, and the result of which carries no criminal consequences.
The second reason why criminal conduct is not, and never has been, a prerequisite to impeachment is because of how the Constitution structures the impeachment procedure. As the Constitution sets out in Article I, Sections 2 and 3 , the House of Representatives has “the sole power of impeachment,” and the Senate has “the sole power to try all impeachments.” The implication of these provisions, as the Supreme Court held in 1993 in Nixon v. United States (not that Nixon), is that disputes over the propriety of impeachments are non-justiciable “political questions.”
Ron Fein: We already have all of the information we need to impeach Trump Sept. 13, 2018 02:52 In other words, the federal courts have no role to play in reviewing lawsuits challenging impeachments. Whether an officer’s conduct rises to the level of “other high crimes and misdemeanors” is, therefore, entirely up to the House and the Senate. If a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate agree on the grounds for impeachment and removal, that is the end of the matter, so far as the Constitution is concerned.
Then-congressman (and now Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman) Lindsey Graham was thus entirely correct in 1999, when he argued that “[y]ou don’t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic. If this body determines that your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your role [then impeachment is permissible because it] is not about punishment, impeachment is about cleansing the office.”
 Why can't Democrats pack the Supreme Court? This doesn’t mean that Congress should remove government officers willy-nilly. Ever since the 1805 impeachment (but failed removal) of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase, Congress has understood that partisan political disagreements, no matter how severe, should not alone provide a basis for impeachment. But even that understanding is a norm, not a rule, and there is plenty of daylight between impeachment for pure partisan disagreement and impeachment for misconduct in office that is not necessarily criminal.
Whether Trump broke any criminal laws is therefore formally irrelevant to whether the House of Representatives has the constitutional authority to impeach him. The House certainly can impeach the president — or any other government officer — for non-criminal misconduct. The harder question is whether the House should do so. But the one point on which we all should be able to agree is that the Constitution commits resolution of that question entirely to our elected representatives in Congress — and not to the president’s Twitter feed or the absence of criminal charges against him.

The Nasdaq Composite Index also hit a record, closing at 8,120, surpassing its Aug. 29 high of 8,109. The markets roared back after a strong week of corporate earnings. The S&P contains just over 500 of the country’s largest publicly traded corporations, and three-quarters of the companies that reported earnings this week beat analyst expectations. The market turnaround comes after the S&P hit recession-era levels in December, capping off its worst year since 2008. To date, the index has gained 17 percent for 2019, with the Nasdaq up 22 percent. Leading the charge on Tuesday was tech heavyweight Twitter, which reported earnings and user growth that outpaced investor predictions. Shares spiked by more than 15 percent after the social platform released its quarterly results. Analysts credited a more cautious monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and improved relations between the U.S. and China for the volte-face.

Administration officials also won't be at the annual black-tie event, which takes place Saturday night, a White House official confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday.
""Instead, Saturday evening President Trump will travel to Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he will hold a campaign rally,"" the official said.
Politico first reported the boycott , which comes as Trump on Tuesday derided MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" as ""Morning Psycho""; blasted CNN as ""a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster""; asked whether The New York Times would ""get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness"" for its coverage; and praised Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" as ""by far the best of the morning political shows on television.""
....Dumb and Sick. A really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse. CNN has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster. In fact, it rewarded Chris Cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot, despite his massive failure in the morning. Only on CNN!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019 Sorry to say but @foxandfriends is by far the best of the morning political shows on television. It rightfully has BY FAR the highest ratings, not even close. Morning Psycho (Joe), who helped get me elected in 2016 by having me on (free) all the time, has nosedived, too Angry...
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019 I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019 Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019 This is the third consecutive year that the president will skip thenearly 100-year-old event. Trump said this month that he would not attend the dinner, telling reporters that it was “negative” and “boring.""
The association's president, Olivier Knox, did not address the White House boycott in a statement Tuesday.
""We’re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, presen, and future,"" Knox said, repeating the statement he made when Trump announced he would not attend.
The dinner, which celebrates the First Amendment and raises scholarship money for budding journalists, is no stranger to controversy; last year, comedian Michelle Wolf drew criticism for ridiculing White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, as well as other administration officials, in her monologue.
Wolf, a former correspondent on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” compared Sanders to a ruthless figure in the dystopian show “The Handmaid’s Tale.” She added that Sanders “burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye,” referring to her make-up.
Others, including many fellow comics , defended Wolf's act, which also ribbed Democrats and the media, saying she spoke truth to power and spared no one.
The correspondents' association, however, issued a statement saying the comedian’s monologue “was not in the spirit” of its mission. Wolf has since said she does not regret her performance.
In response to the backlash, the association announced in November that it would break with the tradition of having a comedian host the event and roast the Washington elite. Instead, the biographer Ron Chernow, author of comprehensive tomes about Alexander Hamilton, George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant, will be the featured speaker.

How to stay in touch with your long-distance friends,www.nbcnews.com,Sarah DiGiulio,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/how-stay-touch-your-long-distance-friends-ncna995951,"Staying close with a friend who moves far away is difficult by definition. We become close with our friends in the first place because we mutually let one another into our lives, and we’re there for one another when we need support. That’s the difference between knowing classmates, neighbors, and coworkers and being friends with them, explains Mahzad Hojjat, PhD , Professor of Psychology at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and co-editor of the book ""The Psychology of Friendship"". ""We do not become close unless we learn about deeper aspects of their lives and become part of their world (and vice versa).""
When one of us moves away, both being in one another’s lives and being able to be there for one another becomes more difficult in a lot of ways because of that lack of proximity — whether it’s being there to celebrate your friend’s birthday, going to hear a band you both love, or watching his dog when he needs to leave town unexpectedly.
Missing those events doesn’t mean you don’t care. But it narrows what would have been an opportunity to share in our friend’s experience, Hojjat tells NBC News BETTER.
Virtual lines of communication — the telephone, FaceTime, Facebook — all help keep us connected in those moments when we can’t be together, but they’re usually not the same as physically being there. “You don’t know exactly how your friend reacted,” Hojjat explains. “And retelling after the fact rarely captures the intensity of emotions that individuals experience in the moment.”
Interactions with others is what creates intimacy, along with how many cultural dimensions you share, adds Robin Dunbar, PhD , Emeritus Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at University of Oxford, who studies the behavioral, cognitive and neuroendocrinological mechanisms of social bonding.
Close friendships are one's ‘shoulders to cry on'. And one around the corner is more valuable than one 100 miles away.
Robin Dunbar, PhD, Emeritus Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at University of Oxford
By dimensions, he’s talking about things like language, living near one another, hobbies, interests, world views (political, religious, and others) and sense of humor. You build those shared connections to begin with by spending time together, Dunbar explains. And by nature some of those ties will become more difficult to maintain (or will just be plain lost) when there’s more physical distance between you and a friend.
“Close friendships are one’s ‘shoulders to cry on,’” he says. “And one around the corner is more valuable than one 100 miles away.”
That doesn’t necessarily mean, however, that long-distance friendships can’t work. But you’re probably going to need to find some new strategies for staying close, rather than relying on what keeps you close with friends who live nearby. Here are some tips:
1. Figure out what your friend needs from you People are different. Personalities are different . And friendships are all different. When it comes to maintaining a long-distance friendship (where certain aspects of a relationship will change), you’re going to need to figure out the aspects that are the important ones that can’t change.
Some friends are going to take it personally if you forget a birthday or anniversary. For some friends, an annual visit may go a lot farther than monthly phone dates. “Part of being a friend is figuring out what that friend really needs from you,” April Bleske-Rechek, PhD , Professor of Psychology at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, tells NBC BETTER.

Set parameters about how you’ll stay in touch Once you figure out what each of you needs, make a plan about how you’ll meet those needs, Bleske-Rechek says. Maybe you decide driving time will be your time to catch-up on the phone, and it’s OK if one of you needs to hang up before a natural pause in the conversation. If you have a ten-minute drive, you give each other the ten minutes because that works for both of you.
Some friends simply don’t have time (or can’t make time) to schedule hour-long phone dates because of the combination of work, family and other personal responsibilities, adds Irene Levine, PhD , psychologist and author of ""Best Friends Forever: Surviving a Breakup With Your Best Friend"". ""Both friends need to be sensitive to each other’s needs and desires. The long-distance friendship may take another shape than it did [when it wasn’t long-distance].""
Happiness expert: Here's how to live a happier life June 4, 2018 02:53 3. Remind your friends that you think about them There’s a lot to be said for the random, 3 p.m. text on a Wednesday to let a friend know you just drove past the coffee shop you both love and you miss her. It lets your friend know you’re thinking about him or her, Bleske-Rechek says. “I wish you were here. I wish I could spend some time with you today.”
4. Remind your friends why they’re special, and why their friendship is special to you “Emphasize that person’s unique assets and the way that they’re not easily replaced for you,” Bleske-Rechek says. It’s an affirmation of that person’s value to you. We need it in romantic relationships, and we need it when it comes to platonic friendships, too, she says.
Related It Happened to Me It Happened to Me How to cope when a friend breaks up with you 5. Talk about the future Evolutionary psychology research tells us that foreshadowing the future (a fancy way of saying “talking about it”) is an important part of what motivates us to put time and effort into our relationships. If we expect someone isn’t going to be part of our future, why waste your energy maintaining ties?
We can apply that to friends who live far away by talking about how you intend to keep that person in your life, Bleske-Rechek says. Talk about an event in the future you know you will both be attending or look forward to an upcoming milestone together (“I can’t believe we’ll both be 50 by this time next year!”), she suggests. “It helps show you’re committed to that friendship.”
6. Pay attention to the details Caring about the little things that matter to us is part of what makes a friend a friend. And it’s a lot easier to know what those little things are if you’re close enough to see them for yourself — your BFF can’t stand his new haircut or she’s really dreading an upcoming work retreat.
Make an extra effort to remember those details when you do talk about them on the phone or virtually, so you can ask your friend about them the next time you converse. Even if it’s way after the fact, staying interested in the details shows that you care, Bleske-Rechek says.
7. Share things about yourself “ Intimacy in friendship is about people letting each other into their lives in a deep way,” Hojjat says. What’s “new” with you is about more than just the photos you posted on Instagram from your vacation last month. Talk about what you’re struggling with. Talk about what you’re excited about. Talk about the things that are on your mind.
“Self-disclosure is an important aspect of intimacy in friendship,” Hojjat says.
Can internet best friends be real-life friends? April 18, 2019 02:33 8. Set aside time to actually spend time together, too Making time to go away together for a few days or spending a few days living with a friend who has moved away is a really good way to boost closeness again, Bleske-Rechek says.
If you visit a friend in their new environment you get to see they day-to-day routine. You get an intimate snapshot of that crazy tennis game or what dinnertime at her house looks like, which makes subsequent phone check-ins and texts more meaningful. Both of you making time to get away together is valuable, too, Bleske-Rechek adds. You both get to leave other commitments behind and just focus on the friendship and things you love to do (exploring a new city, wine tasting , attending a yoga retreat, or what intrigues you).
9. Be there when it matters Distance makes it more costly to maintain a friendship, both in terms of time and money, but part of what will allow you to maintain that bond is knowing when it matters to show up (in person or virtually), and showing up, Hojjat says. “If it is important to your friend, it should be important to you as well.”

"Kohl's to accept Amazon returns in all of its stores across the country, starting in July",www.nbcnews.com,"Lauren Thomas, CNBC",04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kohl-s-accept-amazon-returns-all-its-stores-across-country-n997771,"Kohl’s on Tuesday announced it will start accepting returns for items purchased on Amazon at all of its stores across the country, starting in July. Its shares surged nearly 10 percent by afternoon trading on the news.
This marks an extension of a partnership between Kohl’s and Amazon that dates to the spring of 2017, when Kohl’s began selling Amazon gadgets — like its smart-home products — at some stores, and started handling Amazon returns at about 80 locations. That more recently grew to 100 Kohl’s stores, the retailer said Tuesday, and it will now roll out to more than 1,150 locations across the U.S.
“Amazon and Kohl’s have a shared passion in providing outstanding customer service, and this unique partnership combines Kohl’s strong nationwide store footprint and omnichannel capabilities with Amazon’s reach and customer loyalty,” Kohl’s CEO Michelle Gass said. She added, this is part of the company’s bigger plan to “drive traffic” to stores and “bring more relevance” to shoppers.
With this service, Kohl’s says it’s accepting “eligible” Amazon items — without a box or label — at no additional cost for the customer. It says it then packages the items and sends them back to one of Amazon’s return centers.
Meanwhile, Kohl’s recently said it’s selling Amazon products in more than 200 stores, now. That’s after Amazon announced in March that it planned to shutter all of its pop-up shops across the country. But Kohl’s continues to sell items from Amazon like the Fire TV and Echo Dot.
Whole Foods plans to cut prices as supermarket competition heats up April 2, 2019 01:09 “Growth in this partnership ... illustrates to us that stores are needed, even as online shopping becomes increasingly pervasive,” Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said in a research note. “We believe Kohl’s is being strategic in the execution of its omni-channel strategy by leveraging its strength (the scale of its physical store portfolio) and the strength of its partner (Amazon’s highly-loyal customer base and innovative products).”
Kohl’s is testing other ways to drive traffic to its stores, too, beyond collaborating with Amazon. It’s been dividing some of its stores to make room for tenants like grocery chain Aldi and gym operator Planet Fitness. The hope for Kohl’s is that people who take frequent trips to pick up groceries or workout will stop in and buy something.
Analysts say this is one advantage Kohl’s has over its department store chain rivals, like Macy’s and J.C. Penney . The company has more flexibility with its real estate since its stores are typically situated in strip malls, or are stand-alone, instead of being at traditional, enclosed shopping malls.
There’s some early reported evidence that Kohl’s tie-up with Amazon is paying off. Data from Earnest Research found that sales at Kohl’s stores in Chicago — a market where Kohl’s initially started testing accepting Amazon returns in 2017 — outpaced sales nationwide last year. The firm also found that the percentage of “new customers” at Kohl’s — which it defines as those people who didn’t shop at Kohl’s during the prior year — was up 9% in the Chicago area in 2018, compared with growth of 1% nationwide.
Kohl’s stock has climbed about 22% over the past 12 months, bringing the company’s market cap to about $11.9 billion.

SUBSCRIBE April 23, 2019, 7:27 PM UTC / Updated April 23, 2019, 8:26 PM UTC By David K. Li A 24-year-old Wisconsin man stepped forward to claim a $768 million Powerball prize on Tuesday and said he just ""felt lucky"" the day he bought the ticket that changed his life. Manuel Franco, who lives in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, pocketed the third-largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history. He bought the winning ticket, a quick pick, at a Speedway gas station in New Berlin on March 27, the day of the drawing. He opted for the $477 million cash option. After state and federal taxes, Franco will net $326 million, Wisconsin lottery officials said. ""I pretty much felt lucky"" on that March 27, Franco told reporters. ""It's a weird, lucky feeling. It's not natural, not normal at all."" Winner of $768 million Powerball jackpot comes forward April 23, 2019 01:00 Franco recalled that he felt so good about his $10 Powerball purchase that he looked right up at the security camera just to mark the moment. ""I honestly felt so lucky that I did look at the camera, and I really wanted to wink at it, because I just had that lucky feeling,"" said Franco, who wore a plain black T-shirt and blue jeans to his big day before the cameras Tuesday. Franco said he didn't check his tickets until the day after the draw. He first saw that he had won a $4 prize, and ""I was super excited about that."" The last ticket he checked in his bundle was the life-altering one. ""I looked at it one number at a time. I saw that first number (matched). ... I see that second number (matching), and my heart started to pump and whatnot,"" Franco recalled. His eyes went to the final number to see that it matched before they went back to see that the three other numbers matched, as well. ""I screamed for about 5 or 10 minutes. Good thing my neighbors didn't hear,"" he recalled. Manuel Franco, the winner of a Powerball lottery ticket in Wisconsin worth an estimated $768 million. NBC News Franco said he's hired a team of lawyers and financial advisers, and he promised not to blow his windfall on luxury items. He said he wants to travel, pay for college tuition of family members, and donate to charity. ""I'm not sure what the next chapter is going to bring for my life,"" he said. ""It feels like a dream, and it feels honestly like, any moment, I'm going to wake up and I'm just going to be back in my room, in my bed."" Franco's prize is the third largest behind a world record $1.6 billion Powerball jackpot shared by winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016, and a $1.5 billion Mega Millions prize won in South Carolina in October. Powerball is played in 44 states, as well as Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Within an hour of Franco's news conference, two Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Rep. Gary Tauchen, introduced legislation that would allow lottery winners to remain anonymous if they so desired. ""The government shouldn't force lottery winners to come forward publicly if they don't want to,"" Vos said in a statement. ""Just because you win the lottery, it shouldn't mean you lose your right to privacy."" Even though Mega Millions and Powerball cross state lines, privacy standards are set by each state. For example, South Carolina allows winners to remain anonymous, so the winner of last year's massive prize is still a secret. Franco said that in the days after winning, he was constantly looking over his shoulder. ""I honestly thought there was always somebody behind me every single day,"" Franco said. ""It is really hard to live your life knowing that you have the ticket that everyone wants."" But he added: ""Realistically, it wasn't that for me. There was nobody behind me. I just felt that way.""

Pete Buttigieg headed for Fox News town hall,www.nbcnews.com,Claire Atkinson,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/pete-buttigieg-headed-fox-news-town-hall-n997726,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate who is gaining in popularity, will appear on Fox News to try to connect with the network's right-leaning viewership. The cable news channel confirmed Tuesday that Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, will be the guest at a town hall hosted by Chris Wallace, who anchors “Fox News Sunday.”
Buttigieg’s appearance, slated for May 19 in Claremont, New Hampshire, follows a Fox News town hall with Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is scheduled for May 8 in Milwaukee.
“We’ve said from the beginning of this campaign that Pete will talk to every audience and meet voters where they are,"" Lis Smith, a communications adviser to Buttigieg, said in a statement. ""For Democrats to win back the White House, we can’t just retreat to our safe spaces, we need to aggressively make our case everywhere — that’s exactly what Pete is doing.”
Buttigieg has already shown a willingness to embrace Fox News despite some efforts from Democratic groups and activist organizations to stonewall the channel over its perceived ties to the Trump administration.
Buttigieg appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" in March and told Wallace in an interview that while he stood for progressive values, he had worked to gain support from Republicans and independents in South Bend.
Fox News is still discussing possible events with other Democratic presidential candidates, including Julián Castro , the former mayor of San Antonio and HUD secretary, and Reps. Eric Swalwell of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio.
The Democratic National Committee has said it will not partner with Fox News to broadcast a candidate debate, but it does not take issue with candidates choosing to appear on the channel by themselves.
“While the DNC does not believe that FOX is equipped to be a partner for a 2020 debate because of concerns of fairness at the highest levels within their organization, the DNC believes that we must reach all voters, including their audience,"" a DNC spokesperson said in an email. ""Therefore, candidates should do what they need to do in order to engage these voters directly.”
A Fox News spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company is happy that the DNC sees the upside in candidates' appearances.
“We’re pleased that the DNC agrees with FOX News that successful Democratic presidential candidates must engage directly with our large, diverse audience through televised town halls with top-notch journalists Bret Baier, Martha MacCallum and Chris Wallace,"" the spokesperson said.
The Fox News town hall with Sanders led to criticism from , who suggested that the event was stuffed with Sanders supporters.

New Haven police shooting: Bodycams improperly used after woman shot near Yale,www.nbcnews.com,Erik Ortiz,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-haven-police-shooting-bodycams-improperly-used-shooting-near-yale-n997201,"HAMDEN, Conn. — One of two officers who opened fire on an unarmed black couple inside a car in New Haven, Connecticut, should have turned his body camera on sooner, while the other officer failed to turn his on at all, state police said Tuesday. In releasing video and audio from the April 16 shooting, in which a 22-year-old female passenger was wounded by police gunfire, Connecticut State Police Commissioner James Rovella said that ""in a perfect world without the stressors"" the bodycams would have been properly employed.
Rovella confirmed during a news conference that investigators ""did not find a gun"" on the driver, Paul Witherspoon III. While bodycam video from one of the officers showed Witherspoon getting out of his car and appearing to surrender, Rovella said, the video was being sent for forensic enhancements as part of the investigation.
The release of the video and 911 audio follows days of protests by residents in New Haven and neighboring Hamden as well as students from nearby Yale, who demanded that the video be made public.
New Haven police shooting: Bodycam video raising new questions April 23, 2019 01:17 ""This is unheard of that we're putting it out so quickly,"" Rovella said. ""What's important is transparency and trust.""
The shooting occurred just after 4:15 a.m. April 16 on a residential street less than a mile from Yale's campus, according to state police.
At the time, police in Hamden, a majority white town of 60,900 bordering New Haven to the north, were investigating reports of an armed robbery at a gas station.
A Yale police officer who had been patrolling the campus joined a Hamden officer ""based on a 911 call reporting that a person driving the vehicle had a gun,"" Yale said in a news release last week .
In a 911 call placed at the gas station, the caller told dispatch that a ""regular customer driving a red car ... pulled a gun at the guy who delivered the paper"" and that it was ""clear he was asking for money outside.""
The driver was later identified as Witherspoon, 21. His passenger, Stephanie Washington, was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, university officials said. An updated condition was not immediately provided Tuesday.
State Police Trooper Josue Dorelus said during a news conference last week that officers opened fire when the driver ""exited the vehicle in an abrupt manner"" and turned toward them. However, no weapon was found at the scene, officials said.
Footage from the scene after an officer-involved shooting occurred in New Haven, Conn., on April 16, 2019. Larry Mingrone / via Facebook Before the bodycam video was released, surveillance video from the street captured only part of the incident. It appeared to show Hamden police Officer Devin Eaton parking his SUV to the rear of the red Honda Civic and exiting with his gun drawn. At that moment, the driver was exiting the vehicle. The officer fired as he crossed to the passenger's side and continued to fire his weapon before running from the car.
In another surveillance video from the scene , the Yale officer, Terrance Pollock, appeared to step out of his car with his weapon drawn. He then retreated away from his vehicle, which was left in drive and began rolling forward.
Rovella on Tuesday called the scene ""chaotic"" and said Pollock's body camera and dashboard camera were not turned on.
Pollock suffered a non-life-threatening injury in the shooting and was believed to have been hit by a ""projectile"" from Eaton, Rovella added.
Eaton's body camera was clicked on only after the shooting began. A recall function was used to retrieve video from a few seconds before the record button was hit, Rovella said. The audio did not kick in until after Eaton had already run from Witherspoon's car. He could be heard shouting, ""Shots fired.""
Rovella said the lack of sufficient video and audio was ""inconsistent"" with state policies and procedures.
According to the state's Police Officer Standards and Training Council guidelines , officers should generally activate their cameras ""at the inception of the interaction with the public,"" including during vehicular pursuits.
Witherspoon's attorney, Michael Dolan, said earlier Tuesday that the surveillance video ""supports our claim that he wasn't doing anything wrong and that the police officers acted inappropriately and it would appear with at least reckless abandon.""
The entire incident lasted about five or six seconds. New Haven police arrived at the scene after the shots were fired.
Witherspoon was detained and released, and he had not been charged with any crime, Rovella said Tuesday. Rodney Williams, an uncle, said that the initial robbery report was an exaggerated claim based on heated words Witherspoon had with a newspaper delivery worker at the gas station and that his nephew wasn't armed.
The Connecticut State's Attorney's Office is investigating the shooting along with state police. An investigation could be completed in two to three months, Rovella said.
Eaton has been placed on paid administrative leave. He was an officer in New Haven before joining the Hamden police force less than three years ago.
Pollock, a 16-year veteran of the Yale department, was also placed on paid leave.
Both officers are black.
Neither Hamden town officials nor Yale immediately responded to requests for comment Tuesday about the body cameras.
At a community listening forum in Hamden on Monday night, residents, social activists and faith leaders demanded the release of the bodycam video, called for the officers involved to be fired and demanded an independent investigation.
""It's nothing but the grace of God that my nephew's here,"" Williams said.
He added that just because his nephew wasn't shot doesn't mean he isn't haunted by what happened.
""He's traumatized for the rest of his life,"" he added.
Hamden resident James Atwell, who is black, said the policing culture in town must change.
""I can see who they were protecting, but who were they serving?"" he asked before bringing the focus back to Washington.
""She almost lost her life,"" he added. ""She didn't deserve that.""

Want to go to the movies? There's an airplane for that,www.nbcnews.com,Daniel Arkin,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/airplane-mode/want-go-movies-there-s-airplane-n997481,"Jon Nickel-D'Andrea, an ad salesman who lives in Seattle, hasn't been to a multiplex in over a year. He'd be hard-pressed to tell you the name of the last movie he saw in a brick-and-mortar theater. But that's not to say Nickel-D'Andrea is out of the loop on recent releases. In the last year, he watched ""a couple dozen"" movies on long flights, from some of the most recent crop of Oscar contenders to obscure foreign-language titles.
""It doesn't make sense for my husband and I to spend 40 or 50 bucks to go to a theater — the price of tickets, 12 dollars for soda and popcorn, plus driving and parking and all that,"" he said. ""But movies on a plane? What better way to spend a 16-hour flight? There's no excuse. There's nowhere else for me to go.""
Nickel-D'Andrea, who also blogs for the travel site No Mas Coach, isn't the first American consumer to savor the pleasures of the in-flight flick. But in a world of rising movie ticket prices and overwhelming on-demand video options, some consumers have embraced binge-watching at 30,000 feet.
For some of the roughly 48 percent of American adults who fly commercial, the sky is a perfectly acceptable alternative to the multiplex, and in-flight entertainment has become a valuable cottage industry projected to be worth more than $7 billion by 2023, according to market research published by the firm MarketsandMarkets . Add the fact that the vast majority of movies are free (excluding the entry cost of airfare, of course), and consumers see a good deal.
Absolutely smashed the plane movie marathon. Vice, Spider-verse, Stan and Ollie, A Star is Born. Seven and a half hours of bliss.
— Martin Saunders 🤦🏻‍♂️ (@martinsaunders) April 22, 2019 I never have the time to see movies so it was awesome to be able to watch #AStarIsBorn on the plane. Bit bummed about the ending. Anyone else see it? What did you think? #inflightentertainment
— Veronica De La Cruz (@VeronicaDLCruz) April 17, 2019 The major airlines, for their part, have been happy to feed the appetite.
Delta, JetBlue and other leading carriers have revved up their investments in in-flight content, licensing a growing slate of blockbusters, award winners and family-friendly fare from Hollywood studios such as Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount soon after they play in traditional theaters, sometimes more quickly than the major streaming services.
Alaska Airlines, for instance, recently doubled its movie lineup, jumping from 137 titles last year to 415 as of this month, according to David Scotland, the company’s product manager of in-flight entertainment.
The experience occasionally resembles couch-bound Netflix-surfing: some flyers idly scroll through page after page of titles sorted by genre, and some airlines bundle films by theme, not unlike the algorithmic picks on streaming platforms. American Airlines, for instance, plans to roll out a curated list of movies celebrating Pride Month in June.
""We certainly see a lot of people gravitate toward what I would call comfort content,"" including romances and comedies from the 1990s and early 2000s, said Lally Meck, the head of entertainment and connectivity partnerships at United Airlines.
The content arms race comes as some consumers are turned off by the expense of a night at their local theater. After all, the average national ticket price crept to an all-time high of $9.11 last year. In major markets such as Los Angeles or New York, a ticket costs as much as $16.50, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners.
Other flyers simply don't have time to catch movies during their initial run in theaters. David Leebron, the president of Rice University in Houston for the last 15 years, has an understandably busy schedule. That's why United Airlines has lately become his personal cinematheque.
In the last year, he has plowed through indie comedies, acclaimed documentaries like ""Three Identical Strangers,"" and some foreign-language oddities, such as the 2007 Uruguayan film ""The Pope's Toilet.""
""The ability to watch some really interesting movies that may not get to the theater in Houston, or that I just don't get a chance to see during their theatrical run, that's something I love,"" Leebron said.
INDIE FIX Much like Leebron, Arizona-based optometrist Ryan Wiggins relies on British Airways to get his fix of art house or offbeat fare that otherwise might be limited to select cinemas in the major metropolitan markets.
Wiggins, 37, who flies to Europe several times a year, recently took in the indie royalty dramas ""The Favourite"" and ""Mary Queen of Scots."" (The latter film was released in select theaters by Focus Features, a division of Universal Pictures, which like NBC News is owned by Comcast.)
Since the boutique art-house theater in Scottsdale, where Wiggins lives, shuttered a few years ago, British Airways has given him a chance to discover lesser-known titles, such as ""City of Gold,"" a 2016 documentary about the late Los Angeles Times food critic Jonathan Gold, and the French crime drama ""Au revoir là-haut.”
“The Wife,” last year’s Glenn Close-fronted literary drama, received a limited theatrical release last August and took in a modest $9 million at the domestic box office. But it has since become a virtually ubiquitous in-flight movie, drawing more attention to a relatively niche project that might have gotten lost in the superhero shuffle.
I find it impossible to believe that anyone who actually saw The Wife did not see it on an airplane
— Ej Dickson (@ejdickson) February 25, 2019 Am I finally going to watch THE WIFE on this airplane?
— Rebecca Pahle (@RebeccaPahle) February 16, 2019 Frequent flyers tend to develop their own rituals around in-flight movie-watching. Wiggins watches films simultaneously with his partner, making sure to hit both play buttons at the same time. ""We'll coordinate, we'll talk about it afterwards, we'll do little reviews together,"" he said.
Jason Ma, an actor and writer who splits his time between Los Angeles and New York, keeps a running list on his iPhone's Notes app of movies he wants to see during long flights — the in-flight edition of the Netflix streaming queue.
""I'll think, 'Well, I have a flight in a week from now, I might as well see what American Airlines is offering. They change up their list of movies every month, so I'm always cognizant to check before I board,"" Ma said.
Ma, who said that planes have become his ""main outlet for watching movies,"" still makes a point of going to the theater to pay for what he described as ""special movies that needed to get my money,"" such as last year's ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""Black Panther.”
THE IMPERFECTIONS Of course, flyers see some downsides to in-flight binge-watching. Wiggins, the optometrist, said he was sometimes frustrated by loud announcements on the public address system that pause videos or cut into the soundtrack. Ma, for his part, said he found the pre-roll advertisements repetitive and annoying.
Related specials specials Airplane Mode: Fear and loathing on the modern runway In-flight movies — whether they’re playing on seatback monitors or beamed to personal mobile devices — are unlikely to become popular with devoted cineastes (or Steven Spielberg , for that matter) who prize the large-scale visuals and premium sound quality of a conventional theater or sophisticated home entertainment system. Some fans would argue that effects-driven spectacles — “Black Panther,” the latest “Avengers” — deserve to be seen on a massive IMAX screen or in 3D.
But for the most part, the flyers who spoke to NBC News described themselves as casual moviegoers for whom in-flight entertainment was a welcome diversion and efficient way to pass the time as they traverse the globe.
“I think what we’re seeing today on airlines, even if the conditions aren’t ideal, is a set of choices that enable us to get reacquainted with what’s really wonderful about movies,” Leebron said. That’s especially true of flyers whose phones aren’t equipped with Wi-Fi, freeing them from the usual earthbound distractions.
Nickel-D'Andrea, the ad sales specialist, said that in-flight movies have essentially displaced Netflix and Hulu in his media diet — and he's looking forward to finally sitting down to watch some tried-and-true American classics.
""'Lawrence of Arabia' is up next, I'll watch that on my flight,"" he said. ""You know, I recently watched 'Gone with the Wind' on a flight. When are you going to sit down for a four-hour movie? I don't think I would've sat down to watch it at home.""

SUBSCRIBE April 23, 2019, 7:57 PM UTC By Doha Madani Henry Bloch, who along with his brother co-founded the tax preparation company H&R Block, has died. He was 96. In 1955, Bloch and his brother Richard founded the company, which thrived in what was once a niche industry, helping average Americans navigate a complicated tax system. His four children released a statement that was posted to a memorial website Tuesday. ""Although most people knew Henry Bloch as a tremendous entrepreneur and philanthropist, we will remember him as a devoted father, grandfather and great-grandfather,"" the statement said. ""Our Dad was passionate about his family and his community, and he will long be remembered for his benevolence, humility and fortitude."" Jeff Jones, president and chief executive of H&R Block Inc., said in a news release Tuesday that the company's co-founder embodied the spirit of American entrepreneurship and philanthropy. ""In so many ways, he was ahead of his time and a model for today's entrepreneur,"" Jones said. ""His vision lives on through our H&R Block associates and the many philanthropic organizations that he supported."" Bloch, whose father was a prominent lawyer, was born in 1922 and grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, with his two brothers, Richard and Leon. After graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in mathematics, Bloch joined the Army Air Corps. He went on to join U.S. troops in Germany during World War II, flying 32 missions — three of them over Berlin — as a navigator on B-17 bombers. Departing the Air Corps with the Air Medal and three Oak Leaf Clusters, Bloch went home to Kansas City in 1945 where he founded a bookkeeping service with his brothers. Bloch and Richard, his younger brother, founded H&R Block a decade later when response to their $5 federal and state income tax preparations began to overwhelm the rest of their services. H&R Block expanded outside Kansas City as the Internal Revenue Service began discontinuing free tax returns across the country, according to the company's website. The company now boasts 12,000 offices nationwide. A hometown hero, Bloch was known for his philanthropy throughout Kansas City. He and his wife, Marion, established the Marion and Henry Bloch Family Foundation in 2011. The following year, Bloch donated to the University of Missouri-Kansas City, which built a home for the Henry W. Bloch School of Management's graduate and executive programs. Bloch noted how much he enjoyed philanthropy, according to the company's website, and ""in the process I have learned that true success is not measured in what you get, but in what you give back,"" he said. In a 2016 interview with the Kansas City Star, Bloch admitted that he didn't do his own taxes . ""Today, I couldn't fill out the simplest tax form. It's gotten so complex, and I'm so old,"" he said.

"USC soccer coach, another parent to plead guilty in college admissions scandal",www.nbcnews.com,David K. Li,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/usc-soccer-coach-another-parent-plead-guilty-college-admissions-scandal-n997551,"Two more defendants in the college admissions scandal — a former University of Southern California soccer coach and a parent — have agreed to plead guilty and help with the investigation, according to federal prosecutors and court documents filed Tuesday. One-time USC assistant coach Laura Janke, 36, will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering while former insurance title executive Toby MacFarlane, 56, is set to admit to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, prosecutors in Boston announced.
Janke helped MacFarlane falsely pass off his daughter as a soccer star and his 5-foot-5 son as a 6-foot-1 basketball recruit, so they could get into USC, prosecutors said. MacFarlane paid $450,000 into funds controlled by ring leader Rick Singer and Jenke in exchange for their help with the college admissions.
MacFarlane’s daughter graduated from USC in 2018 without ever playing soccer while his son was admitted to USC but withdrew from the school without ever playing basketball.
William ""Rick"" Singer leaves federal court after being charged in a nationwide college admissions cheating scam in Boston on March 12, 2019. Brian Snyder / Reuters The scandal, which federal agents have dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues,"" has netted 50 defendants connected to Singer's scheme.
He and his co-conspirators faked college applications, portraying children of their wealthy clients as elite athletes, so they'd gain special admission to universities, prosecutors said.
Janke and MacFarlane would be the 19th and 20th defendants to plead guilty. They face up to 20 years behind bars.
But according to a plea agreement filed with the court Tuesday, prosecutors are recommending 15 months behind bars for MacFarlane and 27 months to 33 months for Janke.
Actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman are also among the parents who allegedly paid for Singer's services. Huffman has already pleaded guilty.
“Full House” star Loughlin, her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, and 15 other defendants filed court papers Monday asking a judge to suspend all “substantive motions” until a June 3 pretrial hearing.
Their defense lawyers want prosecutors to turn over more of their evidence before the case can go forward.

"Trump meets with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, discusses 'health of public conversation'",www.nbcnews.com,Dylan Byers,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-meets-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-discusses-health-public-conversation-n997796," met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday just hours after claiming the company had treated him poorly. The 30-minute, closed-door meeting, which was confirmed by representatives from both the White House and Twitter, focused on ""the health of the public conversation"" on social media and ways to respond to the opioid crisis, according to a Twitter spokesperson.
Trump has been both a prolific user of Twitter and a vocal critic, suggesting at times, and without evidence, that Silicon Valley's social media giants have a bias against conservatives.
The meeting, which also included other Twitter executives and senior White House personnel, was prompted by an invitation from the White House.
Earlier on Tuesday, Trump tweeted out a Quote: from Maria Bartiromo's show on Fox Business Network in which Daniel Ives, equity research managing director at investment firm Wedbush Securities, touted the president's positive impact on the company. Early on Tuesday, Twitter reported strong earnings and user growth, sending share prices up by more than 15 percent by the end of the day.
Trump also wrote that Twitter was ""very discriminatory"" and claimed it had made it harder for people to ""sign on."" In a subsequent tweet, Trump claimed his follower count would be higher if Twitter were not ""playing their political games.""
Great meeting this afternoon at the @WhiteHouse with @Jack from @Twitter . Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform, and the world of social media in general. Look forward to keeping an open dialogue! pic.twitter.com/QnZi579eFb
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019 ""No wonder Congress wants to get involved — and they should,"" Trump wrote.
After the meeting on Tuesday afternoon, Trump tweeted a photo of himself in the Oval Office with Dorsey.
""Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform, and the world of social media in general,"" he wrote. ""Look forward to keeping an open dialogue!""
Trump's complaints add to repeated charges from conservatives who have claimed that Twitter has discriminated against them for their political views. In recent years, the platform began to take a more aggressive approach to abuse and hate speech while also removing accounts deemed to be inauthentic or dedicated to spreading misinformation.
While there is no evidence that Twitter has removed accounts in an attempt to limit the president's reach, the company's crackdown on fake accounts has hit Trump and other accounts that have sizable followings. In July, a massive purge of fake Twitter accounts cut about 300,000 followers from the president's account. The president currently has almost 60 million followers.
In October, the president questioned Twitter's motives for removing accounts and making it harder to create new accounts.
Complaints from conservatives have added to growing political pressure on Twitter and other social media companies, which have been forced to send representatives to numerous hearings to explain their actions. At many of these hearings, Republicans have pressed social media companies on their alleged biases.
During a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing , Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, compared tech's power to that of historic U.S. monopolies. ""And if we have tech companies using the power of monopoly to sanction political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues,"" Cruz said.
CORRECTION (April 23, 2019, 5:48 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a Quote: about the president's impact on Twitter. It was Wedbush Securities Managing Director Daniel Ives, not Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo.

Hillary Clinton: Congress could have 'obligation' to bring impeachment charges,www.nbcnews.com,Allan Smith,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-congress-could-have-obligation-bring-impeachment-charges-n997746,"Hillary Clinton believes the only thing that prevented President Donald Trump from being indicted as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is the fact that he's president. Clinton addressed the portion of Mueller's nearly 450-page report that dealt with whether Trump obstructed justice. She said that if ""any other person ... engaged in those acts"" described in the report, they ""would certainly have been indicted.""
But because of the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel memo that states a sitting president cannot be indicted, Clinton said Mueller punted the issue to Congress — something she said Mueller made clear he was doing.
""If you read that part of the report, it could not be clearer,"" she said, adding, ""But we do have checks and balances in America, and there is this thing called the Congress. I mean, you could not be more explicit than, 'Please, look at this, you might conclude that this does not rise to an impeachable offense, that's your job, but I'm giving this to you.'""
The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee also said the evidence presented in the Mueller report and collected through congressional investigations might very well warrant impeachment proceedings against Trump, but cautioned that Democrats must be careful not to do so ""for partisan political purposes.""
As prominent 2020 Democratic contenders like Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California have come out in favor of the House starting the impeachment process, Clinton said Tuesday that such proceedings ""should be something undertaken in a really serious, diligent way based on evidence, not on partisan advantage.""
""So you don't put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table and say you're going to get there no matter what, which is what happened in '99,"" Clinton said at the Time 100 Summit, referring to the impeachment proceedings against her husband, former President Bill Clinton. ""Instead, you say, 'We are going to proceed with the seriousness that this demands.'""
Clinton said the House Judiciary Committee, where the process would begin, might decide to launch an inquiry after a ""careful analysis"" of the information coming from Mueller and congressional investigations. She said their responsibility would not be to ""prejudge the outcome"" but ""examine the evidence as objectively as possible and then to draw up conclusions.""
""And if at that point they believe that high crimes and misdemeanors have been committed, then I think it is the obligation of the Congress to put forward articles of impeachment,"" she said, adding that she thought House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""understands that kind of sweep and care that has to be taken so it doesn't immediately look as though you have some preordained outcome without having to do the hard work that I remember so well from my experience all those years ago.""
Pelosi, D-Calif., has not ruled out the possibility of impeachment, but does not yet favor it, instead telling rank-and-file members on Monday that fact-finding could continue without embarking on impeachment proceedings. While Warren and Harris are in favor of such proceedings, some other 2020 candidates are openly against the idea.
Trump tweeted Monday, ""Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment,"" claiming the report showed there ""were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you can’t impeach.""
Speaking earlier Tuesday at the Time 100 Summit , White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is also Trump's son-in-law, said the Russian efforts amounted to ""a couple of Facebook ads"" and said the probe itself was much worse for the country than Russia's election meddling was.
""You look at what Russia did, buying some Facebook ads to try to sow dissent and do it, and it’s a terrible thing,"" Kushner said. ""But I think the investigations and all of the speculation that’s happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.""
But Clinton said the Russian efforts described in the report ""is the main story,"" one that ""needs to be told and retold over and over again.""
""There’s still so much more that we should know and that we should act upon,"" she said. ""And obviously that’s what the Congress is trying to figure out, what to do right now.""

Communities take steps to foster Latino census participation despite citizenship question,www.nbcnews.com,Stephen Nuño-Pérez,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/communities-take-steps-foster-latino-census-participation-despite-citizenship-question-n997721,"The Supreme Court is debating the Trump administration’s addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census. But communities with a high number of Hispanic and immigrant families are not waiting for a decision and are putting money and resources into ambitious, targeted campaigns to ensure families fill out the census forms. In Arizona, Coconino County treasurer Sarah Benatar says a census task force has been making community outreach plans for the past year.
“From congressional seats to funding that trickles down to the local level in housing, education and transportation, these decisions are based off of census formulas,” Benatar said. Those public services need to be provided by local communities regardless of the numbers, she explains, so if there is an undercount, the local and state governments lose federal funding.
We refuse to stand idly by as this administration tries to silence our immigrant communities with an untested citizenship question on #Census2020 .
I’m standing with @CHIRLA today to ensure that EVERYONE who calls our country home is fairly and accurately counted. pic.twitter.com/ZB4iupC9DZ
— Rep. Jimmy Gomez (@RepJimmyGomez) April 22, 2019 The stakes for an accurate count are high for jurisdictions with immigrant and Latino communities. The keyword that emerges often when discussing the census with public officials and community organizations is trust. Benatar said the county has been making plans for coordination with churches, teachers, libraries, nonprofits and health clinics to educate residents about the census.
In Arizona, Benatar said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been conducting raids in Flagstaff and nearby Sedona . Though most Latinos are born in the U.S. , Hispanics who have family members who are not citizens may be wary of providing family information to the government.
“I’ll use myself as an example. My mom was on a temporary status here, she got her citizenship in 2002. We didn’t open the doors for people we didn’t know,"" Benatar said. ""You get this form in the mail asking all these questions, and as an immigrant you ask if this is going to impact my status.”
Related News News Kate del Castillo returns to 'La Reina del Sur 2': Onscreen and off, more badass than ever According to a group of researchers , the addition of the citizenship question would reduce the number of Latinos counted by 6 million people (12 percent) and result in ""substantial undercounts in states with large immigrant populations."" According to a survey by Matt Barreto, political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, only 35 percent of immigrants and 31 percent of Hispanics said they would trust the Trump administration to protect citizenship information.
In Los Angeles, community organizations built around immigrant rights have become a powerful force in California politics, and they're taking their clout and aiming it at the census.
Diane Colin, the director of civic engagement for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), highlighted the exponential growth they've had in reaching out to local residents. “Since 2004, we have been doing a voter contact program focusing on low propensity Latino voters,"" she said. ""In 2004, we talked to 1,200 low propensity voters in the San Fernando Valley —in 2018 we talked to 243,000 voters in 34 different counties throughout California.”
CHIRLA is building on this outreach as it kicks off its ""Contamos Contigo"" (""We Count on You"") campaign. Part of the strategy, Colin says, is to prevent the need for census workers to come to immigrant households by encouraging immigrants to complete the census online or over the phone.
Colin says CHIRLA is ready to deploy a call center with advocates willing to stay on the line with immigrants as they call in to complete their census forms. “We will stay on the phone with them on the three way in case they need a (Spanish-language) translator,” she said.
Colin says that the variety of services that CHIRLA now provides, from legal to advocacy, allows it to come into contact with the immigrant community more than 2.7 million times in a year. This infrastructure will be the foundation for the group's census campaign.
CHIRLA Executive Director Angelica Salas said that with almost half of the workers in California being an immigrant or the children of immigrants, the importance of the census for California is profound.
At the state level, the director for the California Complete Count Committee (CCCC) says that the state has revised its timeline to ensure success.
“The 2020 census may be the most difficult census count yet, from a new online process to a citizenship question. There are many roadblocks to overcome,"" Ditas Katague, the director of the CCCC 2020 program, said. ""We’ve started our census outreach and engagement efforts early and are committing more resources than any other state to reach Californians statewide.”
Diana Crofts-Pelayo, communications chief of CCCC, says that the state has committed more than 100 million dollars for the effort, with another 54 million dollars being discussed in the Legislature to tackle ""undercount"" issues.
The state’s Department of Finance Demographic Research Unit has created a metric for targeting “hard to count” communities by developing an index compiled through various agencies on where to focus their attention, Crofts-Pelayo says.
National groups worry the citizenship question will depress census participation at a time when Hispanics have seen strong demographic gains.
Arturo Vargas, CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) Educational Fund, released a statement on the eve of Tuesday's Supreme Court oral arguments over the citizenship lawsuit. “The 2020 census, which is taking place at a time of unprecedented and widespread fear , will be the first in the nation’s history in which Latinos make up the nation’s second largest population group. An undercount of the Latino population due to the unlawful inclusion of this untested and ill-intentioned question would mean a failed census for the country.”
José Calderon, president of the Hispanic Federation, a national advocacy group, told NBC News earlier this month that their message is that the community should say ""presente,"" which means present.
""Power rests in our hands completely — no one can stop you from doing it [filling the census].""

SUBSCRIBE April 23, 2019, 9:50 PM UTC By Associated Press FALLS CHURCH, Va. — A gas company's faulty equipment is the most likely cause of an explosion at a suburban Maryland apartment complex that killed seven people in 2016, according to a federal report issued Tuesday . The explosion and fire at the Flower Branch apartments in Silver Spring caused a partial building collapse and sent 68 people, including three firefighters, to the hospital. The National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, has been investigating the cause of the explosion for nearly three years, and officials there called it one of their most difficult cases because so much evidence was destroyed. At a meeting Tuesday, the board unanimously adopted the findings of its investigators, who determined that a faulty regulator that had been left unconnected to a vent pipe inside a basement meter room most likely caused the explosion. Fire and rescue crews and investigators work at the site of an explosion and fire that destroyed a building in the Flower Branch Apartments complex in Silver Spring, Maryland, on Aug. 11, 2016. T.J. Kirkpatrick / Getty Images file Washington Gas, the company responsible for maintaining the equipment that the NTSB blames for the explosion, has disputed the board's findings. President and Chief Executive Adrian Chapman said in a statement Tuesday that the utility was saddened by the incident and remained committed to safety. ""However, we disagree with their findings as we don't believe the evidence indicates failure of our equipment that night. We also do not believe the NTSB sufficiently investigated the other potential causes of the explosion,"" Chapman said. The board's findings do not point a finger just at Washington Gas. The board also found that multiple communication gaps and missed opportunities to correct the leak might have prevented the explosion. NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said that people around the complex smelled natural gas six times in the weeks and months before the explosion but that nobody called the gas company to report a possible leak. Most glaringly, a resident called 911 to report the smell of natural gas on July 25, about two weeks before the explosion. Firefighters responded and could not detect natural gas. But they were thwarted from conducting a thorough investigation because they could not gain access to the meter room from which the leak likely emanated. The locks had recently been changed, and firefighters did not have access to the correct key, even though local code requires that firefighters have such access. Because no leak was detected, firefighters did not call Washington Gas. Neither did the 911 dispatcher. Sumwalt: Pipelines provide heating and cooking fuel to millions of homes and businesses throughout the nation. But when pipelines fail, the results can be tragic—as they were the night of the explosion and fire in Silver Spring. — NTSB_Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) April 23, 2019 The NTSB is recommending that 911 dispatchers automatically call the gas company any time a person calls to report the smell of natural gas, rather than rely on the public to make the call. ""We missed a very good opportunity to possibly have stopped this whole thing,"" NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said. Among the other recommendations: to onstall regulators outside rather than inside so any venting occurs safely into the atmosphere and to expedite phaseout of mercury-based regulators like those that were in place at the apartment complex. Most of those regulators, which date to the 1940s and the 1950s, have been targeted for phaseout because of environmental concerns over mercury. But NTSB staff said the age of the equipment increased the likelihood that they would fail and cause gas leaks. The NTSB took the lead in the investigation because it has jurisdiction over gas pipeline accidents."
911 call by Andrew Freund's dad released as police continue search for missing child,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/911-call-andrew-freund-s-dad-released-police-continue-search-n997741,"CHICAGO — A father frantically hunted in his house, garage and the surrounding neighborhood in suburban Chicago, looking for his 5-year-old son who was not home when he returned after a doctor's appointment , according to a recording of a 911 call released Tuesday. In the 911 call last Thursday morning, Andrew Freund Sr. said his son, Andrew ""AJ"" Freund, was missing from his home in Crystal Lake.
""We've checked closets, the basement, the garage, everywhere,"" Freund told the dispatcher, adding that he had scoured the park, a nearby school and a ""local gas station down here where we sometimes take him to buy treats."" But that there was no sign of the boy.
Police were still searching for AJ in a park in the heavily wooded Chicago suburb Tuesday. They said they planned to use sonar to search local ponds, and that an Illinois State Police plane would search the area to guide officers searching the ground in the community about 50 miles northwest of Chicago.
The department also said detectives were asking neighbors to hand over home surveillance video in the hopes that they might provide clues about the boy's location.
Andrew Freund, Jr., 5, went missing from his home in Crystal Lake, Illinois. Crystal Lake Police Department The department did not say anything about the boy's mother, JoAnn Cunningham, who they have said is refusing to cooperate with detectives. Nor has it said anything further about the detectives' belief that the boy was not abducted, had not wandered or that its focus had changed since Monday when it said the investigation was 'focusing on the residence and the individuals that may have seen or had contact with AJ last.""
According to media reports, Cunningham was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday hoping to regain custody of her younger son who was taken into Illinois Department of Children and Family Services custody after his older brother disappeared.
The Northwest Herald reported Tuesday that the day the boy disappeared, Cunningham was arrested on an outstanding traffic warrant just after she and Andrew Freund Sr. went to Crystal Park Police Department to speak with investigators about their son. The paper said she was also scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday on the traffic case.

By Suzanne Gamboa, Daniella Silva and Cal Perry SUNLAND PARK, N.M. — In this small town where thoroughbreds race and a statue of Jesus looms over the community, a few members of an armed group attempting to act as border enforcers have worn out their welcome. The group has been detaining migrants in what it says is an attempt to help immigration authorities, against the wishes of the police chief, the mayor and other officials and advocates. On Tuesday afternoon, officials with the Union Pacific railroad company determined that they owned the land where about three people were camped and told them they had 30 minutes to vacate the property. Members of the group told NBC News they were moving a quarter-mile away to try to find private property. Sunland Park Police Chief Javier Guerra said earlier Tuesday he had warned the head of the militia group two months ago against detaining migrants or pointing weapons at them. “I made it very clear to them what I expected of them and then I left,” he said. In an interview with NBC News and one other reporter, Guerra said that the group’s leader, Larry Hopkins, had a handgun when he first spoke to him. Hopkins has since been arrested and is facing a charge of felon in possession of a firearm. Guerra had learned of the presence of the group, United Constitutional Patriots, which he said has been only four or five people, through the Border Patrol. The three people on the Union Pacific land on Tuesday sought to distance themselves from the United Constitutional Patriots, saying they were “citizen journalists” documenting the border crisis. The chief said they seemed to be heeding his warning until he saw a video last Thursday posted by the group of members detaining a large group of immigrants. Some of the members were carrying weapons and others were barking orders for the migrants not to move. “They went against what I originally had asked them not to do, so I went out there and I spoke to them and at that moment they admitted that they had been stopping people,” Guerra said. Some of the groups’s members have captured video of their activities or those of Border Patrol and posted the video on social media. Videos posted by members often describe the events as a side of ongoing immigration that isn’t being shown by news media. Guerra said the city developed an operational plan Monday should the situation with remaining members escalate.

Paul Ratje / AFP – Getty Images file The city of Sunland Park put up signs Monday for a portion of the land in the area that it owns. Guerra said the decision to put up the signs came three weeks ago. The city also had the Roman Catholic diocese that owns land around Mount Cristo Rey do the same. He said the city would be meeting with Border Patrol and the railroad police to discuss its operational plan. Sunland Park Police Chief Javier Guerra Suzanne Gamboa / NBC News Guerra said the people in the group he spoke with told him they stopped the migrants by yelling “stop, stop, sit, sit” in Spanish. He said he left to avoid any altercation. By that time the New Mexico attorney general and FBI were also in contact with the police department. Guerra said Hopkins had told him he was a “general” of the group when they first met. On the day Hopkins was arrested, Guerra said he went with his officers to the camp since he had a relationship with the group. He exchanged pleasantries and was offered breakfast. He said he told Hopkins he needed to talk to him and Hopkins responded, “Am I in trouble?” He said Hopkins agreed to ride with him back to the police station where FBI was waiting for him and made the arrest. ‘These are just people’ Dusk waned Monday as Edgar Perez, walked with his wife and 5-month-old son in their neighborhood not far from where the private citizens, some armed, had been stopping and holding immigrants. An immigrant born in Juarez, Mexico, who arrived legally as a young child, Perez, 36, said he is more worried about poverty in his city than he is with the migrants traversing the desert scrubland at the border. “These are just people trying to cross here,” Perez said. “Most of the people that do come through, you don’t see the rapists and killers and murderers and these bad hombres that they call them.” “It’s heavily policed by immigration,” he said. “There’s people on horseback, on ATVs all the time.” Perez, who works in insurance, recently moved back to the area after living in larger cities like Phoenix and Detroit. “If it was risky to be here, I wouldn’t have brought my family here,” he said. Sunland Park, a city of 17,000, is wedged into a corner between Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas. Quieter and smaller than its neighbors, Sunland Park is best known for its racetrack, home of the Sunland Derby, an official Kentucky Derby prep race. Sunland Park is known for its racetrack. Suzanne Gamboa / NBC News Locally, it is the site of pilgrimages for the faithful to a 29-foot statue of Jesus with outstretched arms that looms from atop Mount Cristo Rey over the place along the border where migrants collide with Americans intent on stopping what they see as an “invasion.” Under the statue’s gaze, the militia group United Constitutional Patriots set up camp to carry out its private immigration enforcement operations. The Border Patrol has been in recent months issuing cries of desperation, saying it is unable and unequipped to handle the increased flow of families arriving to this area of the border and claiming asylum and pushing the nation’s immigration system to its breaking point. The administration shifted 750 agents from other jobs and parts of the border to help process immigrants who are arriving at the border, turning themselves over to Border Patrol and requesting asylum. But it has also blocked migrants from crossing the border at legal ports of entry to request asylum, shifting migrants to illegal crossings outside of the ports, adding to the migrant numbers for Border Patrol to handle. Diana Casillas, 23, rents a trailer near the border. Speaking in Spanish, she told NBC News she would like to see more security “because you don’t know what kind of people are coming in.” When asked if she agreed with building a wall, she said she didn’t think it would do anything. “They would still be coming through.” Diana Casillas, 23, in front of a mobile home she rents near the border. She said migrants who have crossed do pass by here and she’s nervous because she doesn’t know who may be among them, but she said migrants can get in regardless of a proposed wall. Suzanne Gamboa / NBC News For the most part, she has seen a few people crossing at a time, coming through different areas. The United Constitutional Patriots After a complaint by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico about the group’s activities, the federal government arrested and charged the leader of the United Constitutional Patriots, Hopkins, 69, on felony possession of firearms and ammunition in his home in 2017. In an affidavit filed Saturday in support of Hopkins’ arrest, an FBI agent said the agency had received reports on its public tip line of “alleged militia extremist activity” in Oct. 2017 in Flora Vista, New Mexico. The reports said the United Constitutional Patriots had their home “base” at Hopkins’s residence and were supported by about 20 members “armed with AK-47 rifles and other firearms,” according to the criminal complaint. “Witnesses reported seeing members of the United Constitutional Patriots bearing firearms at Hopkins’ residence,” the complaint said. “Hopkins also allegedly made the statement that the United Constitutional Patriots were training to assassinate George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, because of these individuals’ support of Antifa,” the complaint said. Kelly O’Connell, Hopkins’ lawyer, denies that allegation as “categorically false,” adding, “There was no plan to do any of that.” In Nov. 2018, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that tracks anti-government and extremist groups, wrote that Hopkins (going by his alias Johnny Horton Jr.), was a believer in conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated rumors about the so-called caravan of migrants and refugees that came to the border that fall. Striker, who goes by an alias to protect his identity, the leader of Constitutional Patriots New Mexico Border Ops militia Team, smokes a cigarette outside the team’s camper near the US-Mexico border in Anapra, New Mexico, on March 20. Paul Ratje / AFP – Getty Images file Hopkins said at the time that he had gathered a team of “patriots” to travel to the southern border to stop the migrants, according to the SPLC. “Our information comes from the very top,” Hopkins told the SPLC. “I’m not telling you where, but it comes out of very high agencies.” And online, the United Constitutional Patriots produces a radio show that has peddled conspiracy theories such as QAnon and accusing migrants of associating with terrorist group ISIS, according to the Daily Beast. In the radio show, Hopkins also urges members to head to the border. At the end of February, Hopkins wrote in a post on his Facebook page that the group was headed to the border to try to stop a different caravan, calling for “boots on the ground” and donations. ACLU of New Mexico executive director Peter Simonson said the civil rights group hopes to see the charges against Hopkins expand in coming days. Simonson said the ACLU and other local immigration advocates had thought the militia members were a “rag tag group” out for weekend excursions carrying out their frustrations over the current immigration problems. “And then we found out they were actually detaining people at gunpoint … they absolutely described themselves as actively detaining people under some fantasy theory about citizen arrests,” Simonson said. Simonson compared the militia members’ activities to kidnapping that can be traced back to “the mouth of the president who has spared no opportunity to spout hateful rhetoric and stir up racist feelings and intolerance about people coming across our southern border.” He said the activities should have been allowed to take place, that law enforcement and Border Patrol should have been directing the members to “cease and desist.” A spokesperson for the group told NBC News they were acting as “a patriot group” and the “eyes and ears of Border Patrol.” Customs and Border Protection has said it “does not endorse private groups or organizations taking enforcement matters into their own hands.” Suzanne Gamboa and Cal Perry reported from Sunland Park, New Mexico, and Daniella Silva reported from New York.

Border Patrol finds abandoned toddler with phone number on his shoes at border,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/border-patrol-finds-abandoned-toddler-phone-number-his-shoes-border-n997711,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Border Patrol agents found a 3-year-old migrant alone in a cornfield at the border between Mexico and Texas on Tuesday morning, according to Customs and Border Protection officials. The boy, who was crying when agents found him in the Rio Grande Valley near Brownsville, Texas, was identified only by a phone number and his name written on his shoes, the officials said.
The agents have taken the boy to a U.S. border station and are trying to find his parents using the number on his shoes, the officials said. So far, they have been unsuccessful and are in the process of transferring the boy to the care of Health and Human Services.
A U.S. border agent carries a three-year-old boy who U.S. Customs and Border Protection says was found in a cornfield in the Rio Grande Valley near Brownsville, Texas, on April 23, 2019. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Rudy Karish, the chief Border Patrol agent in the Rio Grande Valley, said he believes the boy was left by smugglers. Karish said he believes the boy was with a larger group. When the group was encountered by agents, the adults ran away and left the boy alone.

The boy watched movies at the border station and appears to be in good spirits, Karish said.
The incident marks a flashpoint in the rising number of families and children crossing the border in recent months . In March, a total of 8,975 children traveling without their parents, but most often in groups, were apprehended at the southern border. The number of families crossing has also climbed, with 53,077 parents and children crossing the border together last month.

The journey into the Rio Grande Valley of Texas has long been an arduous but popular one, with immigrants risking dangerous waters to float or swim across the river from Mexico to Texas.
Border agents are still looking for the boy's parents or anyone who may be able to provide more information.

Stakes high as Supreme Court takes on LGBTQ employment cases,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/stakes-high-supreme-court-takes-lgbtq-employment-cases-n997816,"The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear the rights cases of three LGBTQ workers. At stake is whether sex discrimination, covered by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , also prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Stakeholders and advocates on both sides of the issue welcomed the high court’s decision in the hopes that the contentious legal question would soon be decided in their favor.
“The growing legal consensus is that our nation’s civil rights laws do protect LGBTQ people against discrimination under sex nondiscrimination laws,” Sarah Warbelow, legal director for LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said. “The Supreme Court has an opportunity to clarify this area of law to ensure protections for LGBTQ people in many important areas of life.”
Related Politics Politics Supreme Court to rule whether civil rights law bans discrimination against LGBTQ employees Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal group that filed a petition asking the high court to hear one of the three cases, said lower court rulings have overstepped their bounds and “redefined” the term “sex” in Title VII “to conflict with the word’s well-understood meaning since the law’s enactment in 1964.""
“Neither government agencies nor the courts have authority to rewrite federal law by replacing ‘sex’ with ‘gender identity’— a change with widespread consequences for everyone,” John Bursch, the organization’s vice president of appellate advocacy, said in a statement .
THE CASES Two cases deal with sexual orientation and one case deals with gender identity. The two involving sexual orientation — Bostock v. Clayton and Altitude v. Zarda — will be consolidated.
Katie Eyer, a law professor at Rutgers University, told NBC News that the split in the lower court rulings played a role in prompting the Supreme Court to review the cases.
“It’s a very important issue and one on which the lower courts have been divided,” she said.
William Allen Moore and Donald Zarda's first jump together in Texas. Courtesy of William Moore In Zarda v. Altitude Express, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed last February that the late Donald Zarda , a skydiving instructor, was unlawfully fired from Altitude Express for being gay. With the 10-3 decision, the 2nd Circuit joined the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , which in April ruled that Indiana educator Kimberly Hively had been fired due to her sexual orientation and was protected by Title VII.
By contrast, in Bostock v. Clayton County, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case of Gerald Lynn Bostock, who claimed he was fired from his job because of his sexual orientation. In May 2018, Bostock’s attorneys filed a petition with the Supreme Court to request that it take up his case.
The case of R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, raises the issue of Title VII’s applicability to transgender employees. The case involves Aimee Stephens , a transgender woman who was fired from a Detroit funeral home after she informed her employer that she was beginning her gender transition.
Aimee Stephens and her wife Donna, right. Courtesy ACLU In March 2018, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Stephens and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, ruling that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects transgender workers and that an employer’s religious beliefs cannot be used to justify discrimination.
“What happened to me was wrong, it was hurtful, and it harmed my family,” Stephens said in a statement Monday after the announcement. “I hope the Supreme Court will see that firing me because I’m transgender was discrimination.”
Melissa Zarda, who took on her brother Donald Zarda’s court case after he died unexpectedly in 2016 at the age of 43, said she will continue the battle her late brother started.
“I couldn't believe you could be fired for being gay,” she said following Monday’s announcement. “I just want to continue to support my brother by fighting for him in this case.”
Related NBC OUT NBC OUT Plaintiff at center of landmark gay-rights case never got to witness his victory The Trump administration has made its position clear on the scope of Title VII. Under the current administration, the Department of Justice submitted an amicus brief in the Zarda case opposing the extension of Title VII discrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation, and another in Stephens’ case siding with the the funeral home. In the latter case, the federal government is pitted against itself, since the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a defendant in the case.
The Supreme Court will hear the cases next term, which begins in October.
DISCRIMINATION & PROTECTIONS Research shows that LGBTQ people are much more likely to experience discrimination at work than their heterosexual and cisgender peers. A 2017 Harvard study found more than one in five lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans report experiencing employment-related discrimination.
The 2015 US Transgender Survey , which specifically focused on trans individuals, found one-third of transgender respondents “reported being fired, denied a promotion, or experiencing some other form of mistreatment related to their gender identity or expression.”
Related NBC OUT NBC OUT Transgender adults have higher risk of poor health, U.S. study finds Currently 28 states have no protections for LGBTQ people in employment, housing or public accommodations, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. A brief the organization released last month found there are an estimated 8.1 million LGBTQ workers, 16 and older, living in the United States, and about half of these workers — 4.1 million — live in states without protections against LGBTQ employment discrimination.
To address the legal patchwork left by state law and court rulings, Democrats in Congress have reintroduced the Equality Act this legislative session. The act would modify existing civil rights legislation to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in employment, housing, public accommodations, jury service, education, federal programs and credit.
THE STAKES A Supreme Court ruling against the LGBTQ workers involved in the cases would be “disastrous” and would relegate “LGBTQ people around the country to a second-class citizen status,” according to James Esseks, director of the LGBT and HIV Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which is counsel for the Zarda estate and Stephens.
“The LGBTQ community has fought too long and too hard to go back now, and we are counting on the justices not to reverse that hard-won progress,” he added. “The potential consequence here is widespread changes in the civil rights protections that LGBTQ people currently have.”
Esseks said the ramifications of the Supreme Court ruling will not be limited to employment. If Title VII fails to protect LGBTQ employees, then the reasoning could be extended to other federal statutes, he said.
For example, LGBTQ students, perhaps most famously Gavin Grimm , have brought their sex discrimination claims before the court, arguing that to be denied access to sex-specific facilities such as locker rooms and restrooms constitutes sex discrimination. The same logic applies to housing and health care, where LGBTQ plaintiffs have claimed sex discrimination under the 1968 Fair Housing Act and sued insurance providers that failed to cover transgender-related health care.
Related NBC OUT NBC OUT Deputy on leave for homophobic comment over teen's suicide The Alliance Defending Freedom, in its petition filed to the Supreme Court in the Aimee Stephens case, argued that having sex discrimination laws cover transgender individuals “impedes women’s advancement” and would mandate that women-only spaces be “opened to males who identify as women.”
“Substituting ‘gender identity’ for ‘sex’ in nondiscrimination laws also threatens freedom of conscience,” the petition continued. “Statutes interpreted that way have the effect, for instance, of forcing doctors to participate in — or employers to pay for — surgical efforts to alter sex in violation of their deeply held beliefs.”
Despite the court’s 5-4 conservative majority and the “politically charged” nature of the issue, Eyer of Rutgers Law School said she is optimistic the justices will side with the LGBTQ plaintiffs.
“On the law, these are cases both gay and transgender plaintiffs should win,” she said.
“Justice Kennedy,” she added, “was fairly reliably able to see the logic of anti-LGBT discrimination claims,” Eyers continued. For LGBTQ advocates, she added, “It would have been ideal if he were on the court when these cases were decided.”
While there is a chance the justices could issue a narrow ruling as they did in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case , Eyers said she believes there is a “pretty good likelihood they will resolve it.”
Eyers said a decision in favor of LGBTQ workers would constitute a “real win for equality on the ground, where it matters most.” If the court rules the other way, she said the best hope for advocates of LGBTQ workers’ rights would be that the loss would “help to push forward legislative efforts,” like the Equality Act.
Regardless of the outcome, Warbelow of Human Rights Campaign argued, “It’s critical that Congress pass the Equality Act to address the significant gaps in federal civil rights laws and improve protections for everyone.”

Woman dies in over-the-rim fall inside Grand Canyon National Park - NBC News,www.nbcnews.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-dies-over-rim-fall-inside-grand-canyon-national-park-n997866,"A woman fell to her death at Grand Canyon National Park on Tuesday. She is the second person to die after falling over the canyon's rim inside the park this year, the park said. Park rangers responded just after 1 p.m. to a report that someone needed help at a rocky point west of Pipe Creek Vista, but “before a rescue effort could be undertaken, the person fell,” the park said in a statement.
The National Park Service on Wednesday identified the woman as Cynthia Ackley, 69, of Peoria, Arizona. Officials had previously said the woman was 70. Her body was recovered approximately 200 feet below the rim, park officials have said.
It’s the third falling death in the Grand Canyon area in recent weeks, although one of those deaths occurred at Grand Canyon West, which is on the Hualapai reservation outside the national park.
Messages left with numbers that might be associated with Ackley’s family were not immediately returned Wednesday.

On April 3, a 67-year-old man fell over the rim east of Yavapai Geology Museum within park boundaries, which was the first over-the-edge death in the park this year. His body was found around 400 feet below the rim, the park has said .
A man from Hong Kong visiting the Hualapai reservation outside the park fell March 28 while trying to take pictures, officials have said.
On March 26, a person died inside the park near the South Rim, but that was not a fall, and the death is still under investigation, Grand Canyon National Park spokeswoman Vanessa Ceja said.
Tuesday's accident was the fifth death inside the park this year, Ceja said. Last year, 17 people died inside Grand Canyon National Park, she said.
The majority of deaths in Grand Canyon National Park are heat-related, Ceja said.
""It's also a very drastic environment for a lot of people,"" said Ceja, who noted that the park encourages visitors to be aware of their actions.
The park said in a statement Tuesday that visitors should stay on designated trails and walkways, always keep a safe distance from the edge of the rim and stay behind railings and fences at overlooks.
Tuesday’s death is being considered an accident, Ceja said.
Grand Canyon National Park is one of the most-visited of the national parks, and in 2018 there were more than 6 million recreational visits.
