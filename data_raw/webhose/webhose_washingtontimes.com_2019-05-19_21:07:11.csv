Federal prosecutors charged a Massachusetts state judge Thursday with obstruction of justice and perjury, accusing her of helping an illegal immigrant escape deportation authorities last year by letting the man sneak out of her courtroom.
An officer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been waiting to arrest the migrant, but Judge Shelley M. Richmond Joseph made the officer leave her courtroom, promising that if the migrant was released from custody it would be through the building lobby.
Instead, the judge released the migrant and had a courtroom deputy take the man out by a back door, releasing him into the community to avoid ICE, according to a 19-page indictment lodged in federal district court in Massachusetts.
“This case is about the rule of law,” said U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling, who said Judge Joseph intentionally interfered with the enforcement of a federal law. “We cannot pick and choose the federal laws we follow, or use our personal views to justify violating the law. Everyone in the justice system — not just judges, but law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and defense counsel — should be held to a higher standard.”
The indictment doesn’t name the migrant whom ICE was targeting, but does say he had been deported before, in 2003 and 2007.
A transcript of the court proceedings shows Judge Joseph conspiring with the migrant’s defense team to thwart ICE.
“I’m not gonna allow them to come in here,” Judge Joseph said at one part of the proceedings.
The judge also took the proceedings off the record for nearly a minute and stopped an electronic recording in the middle of a discussion about ICE’s presence. Federal prosecutors said the break in recording violated state courtroom rules.
It’s not clear what transpired during the gap, but once back on the record Judge Joseph sided with the defense lawyers who disputed whether ICE had the right man as the target.
The indictment says ICE made the match through the man’s fingerprints after he was arrested by police in Newton, Massachusetts, on March 30, 2018.
At that time, ICE lodged a detainer and when the man appeared in court an officer showed up, as per usual practice, prepared to take the migrant into custody should he be released from the state’s custody.
The Newton courthouse’s policy specifically said that Homeland Security officers were allowed to be in the building to perform their duties and explicitly approved officers entering the court’s cellblock to take custody of people once they were processed by the court.
“The actions of the judge in this incident are a detriment to the rule of law and highly offensive to the law enforcement officers of ICE who swear an oath to uphold our nation’s immigration laws,” said Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE’s deportation operations in Boston.
Thursday’s indictment also charges the courtroom deputy, Wesley MacGregor.
Between them, the two are accused of conspiracy to obstruct justice, aiding and abetting, obstruction of a federal proceeding and perjury.

"Facebook bans Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones - Washington Times",amp.washingtontimes.com,Andrew Blake,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/2/facebook-bans-louis-farrakhan-alex-jones-reports/,"Special 4' Minister Louis Farrakhan speaks during the Saviours’ Day annual convention at the U.I.C. Pavilion in Chicago, Sunday, Feb. 24, 2013. (AP Photo/Paul Beaty) ** FILE ** more > Facebook bans high-profile users including Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones By Andrew Blake - The Washington Times - Thursday, May 2, 2019
Facebook on Thursday said the site was banning several high-profile users for violating the social network’s rules against dangerous individuals and organizations, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and Infowars publisher Alex Jones .
Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Jones are among a handful of users who are having their personal accounts purged by the platform, the company confirmed. Others pages being removed include the official Infowars account and the profiles belonging to Paul Nehlen , a far-right politician, Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson and right-wing agitators Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer .
“We’ve always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,” said a Facebook spokesperson. “The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.”
The decision applies to both Facebook ’s flagship social network and Instagram, its photo-sharing app, the company confirmed.
Facebook ’s community standards consider dangerous individuals and organizations as those associated with terrorist activity, organized hate, mass murder, human trafficking and organized violent or criminal activity. They are prohibited from the platform along with “content that expresses support or praise for groups, leaders or individuals involved in these activities.”
The social network describes a “hate organization” as a group of three or more people acting “under a name, sign or symbol and that has an ideology, statement, or physical actions that attack individuals based on characteristics, including race, religious affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, gender, sex, sexual orientation serious disease or disability.”
Mr. Farrakhan , 85, has been frequently accused of anti-Semitism by watchdogs including the Anti-Defamation League during his decades leading the Nation of Islam, and Mr. Jones , 45, has been previously banned from other platforms for violating their rules against hate and harassment.
The Nation of Islam did not immediately return a request for comment.
Facebook last year removed pages associated with Infowars, a website run by Mr. Jones , but allowed him to maintain a personal account.
“We’re not victims here, but people need to know — this has been a dirty, hard war for a while,” Mr. Jones said, reacting to being outright banned from Facebook ’s during a live episode of The Alex Jones Show.
“They didn’t just ban me, they defamed us,” he said.
Mr. Watson , whom Mr. Jones has called a top editor for Infowars, said on Twitter that he was banned by Facebook without being given any reason and appealed for President Trump’s administration to “take the issue of social media censorship seriously.”
“They’re now just banning people for wrongthink,” Mr. Watson tweeted. “There’s no pretense of enforcing rules.”
Mr. Nehlen , Mr. Yiannopoulos and Ms. Loomer were all previously banned from Twitter for similarly violating that platform’s policies.
“Censorship doesn’t stop at the fringes,” Mr. Yiannopoulos , a former Breitbart News editor, said in an email to The Washington Times. “You’re next.”
Neither Mr. Nehlen , a Republican from Wisconsin, nor Ms. Loomer , a New York-based activist, immediately returned messages seeking comment.
Media Matters for America, a nonprofit watchdog group, called Facebook ’s decision “a step in the right direction.”
“The majority of the newly banned figures — Yiannopoulos , Loomer , Watson , Jones , and Nehlen — owed their influence to the massive reach they were allowed to cultivate through Facebook and Instagram, using their accounts to post content that dehumanized entire communities, promoted hateful conspiracy theories and radicalized audiences — all while they profited from directing people to their own websites,” said Cristina López G., deputy director for extremism at Media Matters.
“By cutting them off from this resource, Facebook will help limit the forces driving the spread of radical and often violent far-right ideology,” she said.
Facebook bans users regardless of ideology and has a thorough process for determining who to designate as dangerous, a company spokesperson told The Washington Times. Factors taken into consideration include whether they’ve called for or carried out acts of violence against people based on race, ethnicity or nationality; whether they personally identify with a hateful ideology; whether they use hate speech or slurs; and whether they’ve been disciplined previously for violating the platform’s hate speech policies, the spokesperson said.
Traditionally all Facebook users have been prohibited from endorsing anybody banned from the site for violating its policies against dangerous individuals, but the platform will not censor praise for any of the recently banned accounts unless those people have called for violence or belong to an organized hate group, the spokesperson said.
Facebook will remove any social networking pages, groups, events and accounts associated with Mr. Farrakhan , Mr. Jones , Mr. Yiannopoulos , Mr. Nehlen , Ms. Loomer , Mr. Watson and Infowars, however, and all representations of them with be effectively purged from its platforms.
Boasting billions of users between its social network, Instagram and WhatsApp messaging service, Facebook has faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill as recently as last month by lawmakers considering regulating the company.
Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said during an April 10 hearing that concerns about social networks censoring users “raises real antitrust issues.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, has made breaking-up Facebook ’s monopoly part of her 2020 campaign, meanwhile.

MAGA hat fight at Texas State University leads to 4 arrests - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,Jessica Chasmar,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/3/maga-hat-fight-at-texas-state-university-leads-to-/,"Special 3' The MAGA hat worn by President Trump’s supporters has triggered angry confrontations and political violence across the U.S. with alarming frequency. (Associated Press/File) more > MAGA hat fight at Texas State University leads to 4 arrests By Jessica Chasmar - The Washington Times - Friday, May 3, 2019
Four Texas State University students were arrested Wednesday following an altercation with another student who was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat during a demonstration on campus.
Campus Reform first reported that Tyler M., a freshman, was in an area on campus where counter-protesters were demonstrating in anticipation of a protest by conservative biker group Texas Nomads SAR, which never showed.
Tyler said he was engaging in conversation with some of the counter-protesters when one of them grabbed the pro-President Trump hat off his head, threw it on the ground and kicked it. Video posted by Campus Reform showed part of the exchange as a female student is seen kicking a MAGA hat on the ground as a police officer is trying to speak to her.
“Again, none of our conservative people were ever instigating anything,” Tyler M. told Campus Reform . “I can guarantee that. No one was ever yelling or shouting over people. We were all very patient.”
Campus Police Chief Laurie Clouse released a statement Thursday confirming that the arrests were made after one student stole a hat off another student’s head and fled.
“Police officers quickly interceded and directed the student to drop the stolen property,” the statement read. “The student refused multiple directives and was then detained with the intention of being given a ticket for theft. The student was later arrested after providing a false identity to the police.”
Police said two additional students were arrested during the incident after interfering with the officers’ duties. A fourth student was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct outside the police department where the students had been escorted.
Tyler, who did not provide Campus Reform his last name due to fear of retaliation, was not one of the students arrested.
The video Tyler took of the incident showed him following officers escorting the first two women in handcuffs to the campus police station. A third demonstrator was handcuffed inside the police station after confronting the officers. The fourth arrest was not captured by Tyler’s video.
In her statement, Chief Clouse defended the officers’ actions.
“Although the investigation is ongoing, the initial review indicates that the officers involved acted appropriately with the goal of preventing further escalation,” she wrote. “When a theft occurred in plain view, they were right to act. I understand it’s difficult to watch the arrests on social media, however, the officers were there to protect all of our students. We expect our students to obey the law.”

NEW YORK — U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer is calling on the Centers for Disease Control to declare an emergency and unlock special funding to stem a potentially deadly drug-resistant fungus that’s been spreading at health care facilities.
Schumer , the Senate Democratic Leader, says declaring an emergency over the Candida Auris fungus could make his home state of New York eligible for potentially millions of dollars in public health crisis response funding.
More than half of the 613 confirmed cases in the U.S. have been in New York. Illinois has had 156 confirmed cases of the fungus. New Jersey has had 106.
The CDC has declared public health emergencies over Zika, Ebola and H1N1. Schumer says the extra funding could be used to boost testing for Candida Auris and raise public awareness.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — North Carolina’s governor has vowed to take a hard look at how to keep guns away from universities and schools after a fatal shooting at a campus.
Gov. Roy Cooper , a Democrat, addressed reporters near the University of North Carolina-Charlotte campus hours after a gunman killed two and wounded four others.
He said students shouldn’t fear for their lives, nor parents fear for their children’s safety when they go off to school. He said: “This violence has to stop.”
He didn’t provide specifics other than to say he planned to review everything involved in the shooting and work on ways to prevent others from happening.

Sean Hannity says his sources are telling him that a “devastating” report will soon drop regarding alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the 2016 presidential election.
The Fox News host’s comments came Wednesday evening during an interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Republican was mum on details regarding Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz ’s work for the Justice Department, but he did say those who “love the rule of law” will be “very upset.”
“We now have two sources that told the FBI and the DOJ, the upper echelon, not the rank and file, I always make the distinction,” Mr. Hannity said . “I am told in both cases that with the [former British spy Christopher Steele] dossier, that [Department of Justice lawyer Bruce] Ohr warned them it was unverified — Hillary paid for it, Steele hated Trump. Also, now, we have the emails before the first application went in. It sounds like a premeditated conspiracy to commit fraud on a FISA court. I’m also hearing: Horowitz is done and it’s devastating.
“I can’t tell you what he found, but I can tell you that if you care about the rule of law you’re going to be very upset about how the DOJ and the FBI behaved themselves during the 2016 election,” he said. “If you hate Trump, you won’t care. If you love the rule of law, you’ll be very upset.”
Mr. Horowitz announced the investigation into alleged FISA abuse in March 2018.

DALLAS — A Dallas man previously arrested in the death of an 81-year-old woman has been charged with killing at least 11 more elderly women whose jewelry and other valuables he stole, authorities said Thursday.
Kim Leach, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County district attorney’s office, said 46-year-old Billy Chemirmir was indicted Tuesday on six more counts of capital murder in the deaths of women ranging in age from 76 to 94.
Chemirmir , a Kenyan citizen who was living in the U.S. illegally, also is charged in nearby Collin County with two counts of attempted capital murder for similar attacks there, according to county court records.
A Collin County grand jury also returned five capital murder indictments against Chemirmir on Tuesday.
Chemirmir has been in custody since March 2018 in the death of the 81-year-old Dallas woman, Lu Thi Harris. Police in Plano were investigating Chemirmir in connection with suspicious death and suspicious person calls at a senior apartment complex in that Dallas suburb and found evidence linking him to Harris’ death in Dallas, authorities said. Plano is in Collin County.
The break in the case came when Chemirmir forced his way into the Plano apartment of a 91-year-old woman that March, telling her to “go to bed. Don’t fight me,” according to an arrest affidavit filed in Collin County. The woman was smothered with a pillow into unconsciousness and robbed. However, paramedics revived her and she told investigators that her attacker had stolen a box containing her jewelry. Police identified Chemirmir from a license plate number and were able to find and tail him days later, when they watched him throw a jewelry box into a trash bin. They traced the box to Harris, according to the affidavit.
Plano police Chief Gregory Rushin said at the time that Chemirmir used his health care experience “to his advantage in targeting and exploiting seniors, some of the most vulnerable people in our community.”
Police said then that investigators were reviewing about 750 unattended deaths of elderly women for possible links.
Chemirmir ’s attorney, Phillip Hayes, said Thursday that this week’s charges were a surprise and that he hadn’t had time to review them yet.
“These cases came out of the blue and I don’t have any information on them yet,” he said.
But he noted that Chemirmir “has denied it since Day 1” that he played any role in Harris’ death. “They have circumstantial evidence that puts him in the area but that’s as far as the evidence goes,” Hayes said.
In addition to the murder charges, Chemirmir is being held on a charge of being in the country illegally.

A federal judge has ordered portions of special counsel Robert Mueller ’s report to be unredacted and made public in the criminal case against former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn .
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan issued the limited order Thursday. Portions of the report relating to Flynn are redacted and would be made public under the order.
It is the first time a federal judge has ordered the Justice Department to make public portions of the report the agency had kept secret.
Mueller officially concluded his investigation in March. Attorney General William P. Barr released a redacted version of Mueller ’s report in April.
Flynn is awaiting sentence after admitting to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.

ATLANTA — A billionaire technology investor and philanthropist says he will provide grants to wipe out the student debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse College - an estimated $40 million.
Robert F. Smith, this year’s commencement speaker, made the announcement Sunday morning while addressing nearly 400 graduating seniors of the all-male historically black college in Atlanta. Smith is the Founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners , a private equity firm that invests in software, data, and technology-driven companies.
“On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we’re gonna put a little fuel in your bus,” Smith told the graduates. “This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans.”
The announcement elicited stunned looks from faculty and students alike, before the graduates broke into the biggest cheers of the morning. Morehouse said it is the single largest gift to the college .
Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $1.5 million gift to the school. The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $40 million.
Smith said he expected the recipients to “pay it forward” and said he hoped that “every class has the same opportunity going forward.”
In the weeks before graduating from Morehouse on Sunday, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchum drew up a spreadsheet to calculate how long it would take him to pay back his $200,000 in student loans - 25 years at half his monthly salary, per his calculations.
In an instant, that number vanished. Mitchum, sitting in the crowd, wept.
“I can delete that spreadsheet,” he said in an interview after the commencement. “I don’t have to live off of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I was shocked. My heart dropped. We all cried. In the moment it was like a burden had been taken off.”
His mother, Tina Mitchum, was also shocked. Eight family members, including Mitchum’s 76-year-old grandmother, took turns over four years co-signing on the loans that got him across the finish line.
“It takes a village,” she said. “It now means he can start paying it forward and start closing this gap a lot sooner, giving back to the college and thinking about a succession plan” for his younger siblings.
Morehouse College president David A. Thomas said the gift would have a profound effect on the students’ futures.
“Many of my students are interested in going into teaching, for example, but leave with an amount of student debt that makes that untenable,” Thomas said in an interview. “In some ways, it was a liberation gift for these young men that just opened up their choices.”
