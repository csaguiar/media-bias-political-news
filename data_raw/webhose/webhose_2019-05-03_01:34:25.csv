Moroccan Migrant Slit Italian’s Throat Because “He Looked Happy”,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/moroccan-migrant-slit-italians-throat-because-he-look-happy.html,"“I thought he should suffer like me”
Paul Joseph Watson PrisonPlanet.com April 3, 2019
A 27-year-old Moroccan migrant confessed to the murder of 33-year-old Italian Stefano Leo, saying that he killed Leo because “he looked happy”.
Said Mechaout slit Leo’s throat during a brutal attack on 23 February of this year in Turin.
He later told authorities that Leo’s pleasant demeanor had been the only trigger needed for the murder.
“I am the murderer of Stefano Leo. I have to turn myself in,” said Mechaout. “I feel hunted by the Carabinieri. I don’t want to commit other crimes. Among all the people who were passing, I chose to kill this young man because he looked happy. And I chose to kill his happiness.” A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Leo (pictured above) probably “looked happy” because he had recently returned from spending two years with a Hare Krishna community in Australia and described himself as a “pacifist”.
The killer said he decided to kill someone that morning and emphasized that he specifically targeted Leo because of his smiling face.
“I decided I would have to kill someone,” said Mechaout. “I went to buy a set of knives, then threw away all but the sharpest. Then I went to Murazzi and waited. When I saw that guy I decided I couldn’t bear his happy look.”
“I saw him, he looked at me and I thought that he should suffer like me. I cut his throat with my knife,” he added.
Quite how Mechaout was ‘suffering’ is unknown. Perhaps he took Leo’s smiling face as a racist microaggression.
Around 8% of all illegal immigrants living in Italy are Moroccan. More Moroccans have arrived in Europe since the “refugee” wave accelerated four years ago.
Last year, two female Scandinavian hikers were raped and beheaded by ISIS followers in Morocco. One of the girls had previously posted a video on her Facebook page protesting against “Islamophobia”.

'Shameful' Australian Senator Who Blamed Christchurch Attacks on Muslim Migration Will Put up Candidates for His New Right-wing Party,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/fraser-anning-australian-lawmaker-christchurch-muslim-immigration-1384386,"The Australian senator who blamed the New Zealand mosque attacks on Muslim migration has set up a new party that will put up candidates for election.
The independent lawmaker for Queensland, Fraser Anning, was censured on Wednesday by his country’s upper house for his comments, which were condemned as “inflammatory and divisive,” Australia's ABC News reported.
He had been criticized globally for his comment after the attacks that left 50 dead. Anning said that it was caused by ""the immigration program that allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.""
Senator Fraser Anning sits in the Senate at Parliament House, in Canberra, Australia, on April 3. Anning has been censured by the country’s upper house for his comments on the Christchurch mosque attacks, which he blamed on Muslim immigration. Tracey Nearmy/Getty Images On Wednesday, the leaders of the major parties in the Senate, the Liberal Party's Mathias Cormann and Labor's Penny Wong, were united in their condemnation of the senator, who was criticized from all sides for more than an hour.
Cormann told the upper house Anning’s comments were “ugly and divisive,” and “were dangerous and unacceptable from anyone, let alone a member of this place.""
Wong said, ""While those injured were being treated, this senator sought to further fan the flames of division. How pathetic. How shameful.""
But an unapologetic Anning told the Senate that the censure motion against him “was a blatant attack on free speech,” adding that it was also “an exercise in left-wing virtue signaling of the worst kind.”
He said he had condemned the shooting and the shooter “in the strongest possible terms,” and that “contributing causes” included an immigration program “that allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand.”
Later, the senator said that his party, called Fraser Anning's Conservative Party, had been registered with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and that he planned to run candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives in elections in May, The Australian reported.
""This has been a long process but it is a great relief that ‘Fraser Anning’s Conservative National Party’ is now officially registered. Today my colleagues had their say, now the Australian people can have theirs,” Anning told the newspaper.
Anning’s censure does not mean that he will be removed from office, which can only happen if a lawmaker is found to be a dual citizen, bankrupt, hold other offices, or convicted, ABC News reported.
More than 1.4 million people have signed a petition calling for his removal. In August 2018, the Queensland senator had caused controversy when he said that ""the final solution to the immigration problem is a popular vote,” which many said was a deliberate reference to the Nazi policy of exterminating the Jewish people.
Tweeting for the first time since March 15, which was the day of the attacks, Anning doubled down on his position, saying, “I stand by my comments on Muslim immigration. Despite all the left-wing hysteria today, no one actually argued against what I said, because it is 100% true. Countries that had increased Muslim immigration had increased crime and terrorism.""

Steve Watson Prison Planet.com April 3, 2019
Senator Rand Paul thanked President Trump Tuesday after The Department of Defense announced it is “suspending” deliveries of F-35 fighter jet parts and manuals to Turkey.
“Thank you @realDonaldTrump. No weapons for haters of America!” Paul tweeted, adding that “Weapons and Aid should be contingent on behavior.”
The Senator also noted that the “Same should go for Saudi Arabia!” Thank you ⁦ @realDonaldTrump ⁩. No weapons for haters of America! Weapons and Aid should be contingent on behavior. Same should go for Saudi Arabia! https://t.co/kqSE5TORUJ

Paul has long campaigned for the US to stem sales of arms to regimes at odds with US foreign policy, particularly Saudi Arabia.
Paul has often found himself at odds with Trump over the issue over the past two years.
In an earlier tweet Tuesday, Senator Paul also vowed that he will “continue fighting for an end to U.S. involvement in the war on Yemen,” with a link to an article from the American Conservative concerning the US Saudi military coalition that has been waging war in the country for almost five years. I will continue fighting for an end to U.S. involvement in the war on Yemen! https://t.co/AJlHygUcFF

The Trump administration’s decision to stop supplying military parts to Turkey, a NATO member, comes following the Middle Eastern country’s decision to purchase a Russian air defense system .
“The United States has been clear that Turkey’s acquisition of the S-400 is unacceptable,” said acting Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers Jr.
“[U]ntil they forgo delivery of the S-400, the United States has suspended deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey’s F-35 operational capability. Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk.” Summers added.
Turkey’s government has defended the country’s right to purchase Russian made, military equipment, with foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu arguing that “it is contrary to international laws for a third country to oppose an agreement between two countries.”

Woman Accuses Biden of Inappropriate Behavior at Sexual Assault Event,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/woman-accuses-biden-of-inappropriate-behavior-at-sexual-assault-event.html,"Breitbart April 3, 2019
Two more women have come forward to accuse former Vice President Joe Biden of inappropriately touching them in an article for the New York Times.
Former college student and sexual assault survivor Caitlyn Caruso told the Times that Biden rested his hand on her thigh at an event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada and hugged her “just a little bit too long.”
Biden attended an event in 2016 at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas with Lady Gaga, who performed her Oscar-nominated song about sexual assault, “Til it Happens to You.”
Biden told the students in his speech that he was committed to changing the culture of sexual assault, particularly on college campuses, recalling that his father taught him the worst sin was abuse of power.
“The worst sin they could commit was to abuse power, whether it was economic power, political power, or physical power, this is the God’s truth,” Biden said.
He said that his father also told him that the cardinal sin was raising an abusive hand to a defenseless woman or child. A d v e r t i s e m e n t This article was posted: Wednesday, April 3, 2019 at 5:43 am Share this article"
Martin Shkreli is Being Tortured in Prison,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/martin-shkreli-is-being-tortured-in-prison.html,"Information Liberation April 3, 2019
Though our media these days loves to complain about alleged injustices in our justice system, they’re absolutely giddy that Martin Shkreli is reportedly being locked up in solitary confinement.
From New York Daily News :
“Pharmo Bro” Martin Shkreli won’t be doing much shot-calling anymore.
He was reportedly tossed into solitary confinement following a report last month that claimed he was still running his business from behind bars, according to a Forbes report Monday.
The Wall Street Journal described in early March how Shkreli used a contraband cell phone to make decisions at Phoenixus AG, including firing his handpicked chief executive, Kevin Mulleady. Shkreli later allegedly agreed to make it a suspension.
His alleged infraction is trying to run his business from prison.
What a menace to society!
What next, is he going to file his own taxes?!
Solitary confinement is a form of torture. While no one generally cares about murderers or violent criminals being subject to it, putting non-violent criminals in solitary confinement is sickening.
The only reason Shkreli was locked up in the first place is because our overlords wanted some pleb to use as a scapegoat to atone for the sins of Big Pharma.
Shkreli was hounded for raising the price of a rare drug (which insurance companies had to pay for) in order to fund research on developing a better drug. He gave away the drug at a discount or for free to people who couldn’t afford it.
[Embed begins at 1:48:20 with Shkreli giving his side of the story.]
He ran a small company, considering the industry, and this affected relatively few people.
Meanwhile, the Sackler family reportedly knowingly lied about the addictiveness of their drug Oxycontin to get millions of Americans hooked on synthetic heroin for profit. ""The Sackler family, who made tens of billions of dollars by getting Americans hooked on OxyContin, also looked to profit off treating the addicts they created.""
Can left and right unite in putting these people in jail for what they've done? https://t.co/BGJYTYwZct
They made billions of dollars in the process and yet they’re all sitting pretty and are reportedly exploring bankruptcy in order to keep themselves from having to pay off the millions of families whose lives they’ve ruined .
As 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said last week on the Jimmy Dore show, this family belongs in jail. This is why Yang is great #YangGang pic.twitter.com/YMtKM670HG
While Martin Shkreli is being tortured in prison through solitary confinement the Sacklers are living free. This article was posted: Wednesday, April 3, 2019 at 5:09 am Share this article"

Oops.
So bottom line is you have no scientific qualifications yourself?
Actually science, in many instances, is a popular vote. Do you need Quote: s by SCIENTISTS, who concede as much?"

What I would require is a systemic study demonstrating that the notion ""science is a popular vote (which means everyone, including non-scientists)"" that has been published in a peer reviewed journal and itself accepted by a consensus of the scientific community. Your cherry-picked Quote: s are meaningless and likely refer to scientific consensus, an altogether different concept. Good luck with that.
I have no scientific qualification but I am not so foolish as to defy the scientific consensus either."

Whatever we don’t know we can shunt Mudda nacha didit into it.
See how that works?
And then naturalism begs the pertinent questions to begin with.
Is science performed by objective robots? If it’s not; If it’s performed by humans who are subjective and who bring a priori commitments into the equation then it is by and large a”popular vote.” If it wasn’t, then scientific theories would be immutable facts. There’d be no paradigm shifts. Subsequent discoveries would never counter or dismantle previously PEER REVIEWED research “conclusions.”
incidentally ""peer review,"" reviews the methodological approach. And no one can claim a purely objective methodological approach.
So it seems what you are talking about is an idealistic construct, a purely objective scientific methodology that NEVER begs the question and accounts for all variables and the complex interactions of all the variables. That doesn’t exist! So to claim “science is not a popular vote” is naive, uninformed and simplistic.
It’s quite obvious you have no scientific qualifications. You regurgitate catch phrases without actually knowing what they entail and the reality behind them."
