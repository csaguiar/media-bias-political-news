Trump displays his knowledge of history during Mt. Vernon visit | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-displays-his-knowledge-history-during-mt-vernon-visit,"George Washington bust in The Karen Buchwald Wright Reading Room. Courtesy the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association Trump displays his knowledge of history during Mt. Vernon visit 04/10/19 10:09 AM By Steve Benen To hear Donald Trump tell it, he’s a fan of history , though we’re occasionally reminded that this may not be altogether true. Politico published this gem this morning.
President Donald Trump had some advice for George Washington.
During a guided tour of Mount Vernon last April with French president Emmanuel Macron, Trump learned that Washington was one of the major real-estate speculators of his era. So, he couldn’t understand why America’s first president didn’t name his historic Virginia compound or any of the other property he acquired after himself.
“If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it,” Trump said, according to three sources briefed on the exchange. “You’ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.”
Leave it to Donald Trump to visit Mt. Vernon and focus his attention on the limited reach of George Washington’s brand .
Of course, smart or not, Washington didn’t name his home after himself, though he appears to be remembered anyway. The nation’s capital city is named after him; there’s a state named after him; his face is on American currency; a prominent university is named after him (I went to GW); and there’s a giant obelisk in his honor near the White House.
Politico ’s report added that Trump’s disinterest in Washington made it difficult for the tour guide – who later described the experience as “truly bizarre” – to “sustain Trump’s interest” for 45 minutes. The French president and his wife, meanwhile, “were far more knowledgeable about the history of the property than the president.”
Alas, this was not an isolated incident. Whatever strengths the Republican may bring to the presidency, knowledge of history isn’t among them.
It was, for example, just two weeks into his presidency when Trump declared , “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who has done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.”
Soon after, on Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, Trump tweeted out a fake Quote: : from the 16th president.
Trump later butchered some basic details about Andrew Jackson, whose picture currently hangs in the Oval Office, and just last week, he reflected on the Civil War during remarks to the National Republican Congressional Committee:
“I said to somebody that’s been here a long time, you people would know better than anybody, some of you that have been here, ‘Has [partisan division] ever been this bad?’ And they said, ‘Well,’ they said, ‘Yes, it was.’ They said, ‘During the Clinton impeachment hearings it was worse.’ They said, ‘There was another time in the 1880s when it was worse.’
“A couple of people were shot, you know. Even new people wouldn’t do that. And the Civil War, who could forget? I would say the Civil War was bad.
“And by the way, speaking of the Civil War, where is Doug Collins? You’re another warrior? Where’s Doug Collins? Where the hell is Doug? Man, he’s up there fighting….”
As the nation’s first amateur president, Trump has a strong incentive to take history even more seriously, since he needs some kind of guide. Unfortunately, he’s taken the opposite course.

'America deserves better': Former GOP governor to take on Trump | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/america-deserves-better-former-gop-governor-take-trump,"By Steve Benen Two months after launching a presidential exploratory committee, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld made a rather audacious announcement yesterday: he kicked off a Republican primary challenge against the sitting president of his own party, Donald Trump.
“America deserves better,” Weld’s campaign announcement video said, before showing video clips of Trump mocking John McCain, imitating a disabled reporter, praising Wikileaks and the notorious “Access Hollywood” tape where he was caught on audio making inappropriate comments about women.
“It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag. It is time to return to the principles of Lincoln – equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. There is no greater cause on earth than to preserve what truly makes America great. I am ready to lead that fight,” Weld said in a statement.
By any fair measure, the former governor has traveled a non-traditional political path. In the 1990s, Weld was a popular two-term Republican governor of one of the nation’s bluest states, before being tapped by a Democratic president to serve as an ambassador. Weld’s nomination was blocked, and ultimately killed, by a senator from his own party – North Carolina’s Jesse Helms – who concluded he wasn’t far enough to the right.
More recently, Weld abandoned the GOP altogether and ran in 2016 as the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee. After Donald Trump’s election, the former governor rejoined the Republican Party, and yesterday, the 73-year-old candidate decided to launch a quixotic challenge against a sitting president who enjoys strong support from his party’s far-right base.
“I’m here because I think our country is in grave peril,” Weld said in February after launching an exploratory committee. “I cannot sit quietly on the sidelines any longer.”
One need not be a political expert to know Trump will be the overwhelming favorite in the race for the GOP nomination – to the extent that there will even be an actual “race” – but I’m nevertheless interested in the possibility of a sitting president having to deal with an intra-party rival.
Because the historical pattern paints an interesting picture.
In the modern presidential primary era – beginning with the 1972 election cycle – there have been eight presidents: Ford, Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, Clinton, W. Bush, Obama, and Trump. Of those eight, three lost after a single term in the White House: Ford, Carter, and H.W. Bush.
And while every cycle has its own unique quirks and qualities, Ford, Carter, and H.W. Bush each have one important thing in common: they each faced a credible primary challenge as part of their re-election campaigns, before going on to lose in the general election. Every incumbent president who didn’t face an intra-party rival went on to win a second term.
All of this comes with plenty of caveats. We are, after all, talking about a fairly modest sample size. For that matter, there’s a correlation/causation question that’s far from clear.
That said, we’ve known for months that Donald Trump’s political operation has worried about a primary challenge, and now it has one.

Trump's lawyers scramble to keep his tax returns hidden from view | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-lawyers-scramble-keep-his-tax-returns-hidden-view,"The Rachel Maddow Show, 4/15/19, 9:06 PM ET Trump hires new legal team to fight release of tax returns Rachel Maddow reports that even as Donald Trump has hired new lawyers to fight to keep Trump’s tax returns away from public view, subpoenas to financial institutions from Congress, looking into Donald Trump’s finances are multiplying faster than Trump’s share tweet email save Embed Last week, Donald Trump hired a new group of lawyers to do one very specific thing: keep the president’s tax returns secret. Yesterday, those attorneys sent a letter to the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, urging administration officials to look past the letter of the law .
President Trump’s personal lawyer on Monday urged the Treasury Department not to hand over Mr. Trump’s tax returns to House Democrats, warning that releasing the documents to lawmakers he accused of having a “radical view of unchecked congressional power” would turn the Internal Revenue Service into a political weapon. […]
Mr. Trump’s lawyer, William S. Consovoy, said on Monday that the legal rationale behind [House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal’s] dismissal of the Treasury Department’s concerns was wrong.
As regular readers know , Richard Neal, exercising his authority under the law, formally told the Treasury Department two weeks ago that he’s demanding access to the president’s tax returns. The Massachusetts Democrat did so under a law that says the Treasury “shall furnish” the tax materials in response to a formal request from one of a handful of congressional lawmakers, including himself.
Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a written statement last week, “How many lawyers and how much time does it take for [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin] to understand that ‘shall’ means ‘shall’?”
And yet, yesterday, Trump’s new private attorney told the Treasury that those pointing to the letter of the law are not making “a serious legal argument.”
The correspondence added that “no one actually believes” Richard Neal is interested in legitimate congressional oversight. To bolster the point, the president’s lawyer pointed to … wait for it … quotes from congressional Republicans.
What’s more, in case the keep-the-tax-returns-secret legal team wasn’t busy enough yesterday, Politico noted that the attorneys sent a separate letter to Trump’s accounting firm.
President Donald Trump’s attorneys are warning of potential legal action if an accounting firm turns over a decade of the president’s financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee.
Trump attorneys William S. Consovoy and Stefan Passantino are urging Mazars USA not to comply with a subpoena that Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) issued on Monday for Trump’s financial documents, calling it a politically motivated scheme to take down the president.
It’s not every day we see a president’s legal team urge private entities not to comply with federal subpoenas. (The correspondence from Consovoy and Passantino was, by the way, very much on brand: it used the Republicans’ deliberately wrong grammar, complaining about “the Democrat Party.”)
I won’t pretend to know how this will play out in the coming weeks and months, but it’s nevertheless worth pausing to appreciate the desperation with which the president and his team are fighting to make sure Trump’s tax returns are hidden from view. Explore: "

Barr's credibility faces new questions ahead of Mueller report's release | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/barrs-credibility-faces-new-questions-ahead-mueller-reports-release,"U.S. Attorney General nominee William Barr testifies at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee January 15, 2019 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Barr’s credibility faces new questions ahead of Mueller report’s release 04/16/19 10:15 AM By Steve Benen It’s been 25 days since Special Counsel Robert Mueller delivered his findings to Attorney General Bill Barr, and pretty much all we know about that final report comes from Donald Trump’s handpicked AG. Barr’s characterization of the document – he included some fragments, but no complete sentences from Mueller’s report – have served as the basis for Republican celebrations, a White House victory lap, and taunts from skeptics of the Russia scandal.
With a redacted version of the report scheduled to be released in about 48 hours, we’ll get a better sense of whether those pro-Trump cheers had merit, but in the meantime, there’s a question that lingers over the debate: why exactly are so many so quick to take Barr’s assessment at face value?
The president’s allied attorney general has faced a series of legitimate questions about his credibility, stemming from years of controversies , his unsolicited memo criticizing the Mueller investigation, and more recently, his willingness to endorse a Trump conspiracy theory .
Yesterday, a new area of concern came to light. NYU law professor Ryan Goodman wrote at Just Security:
On Friday the thirteenth October 1989, by happenstance the same day as the “Black Friday” market crash, news leaked of a legal memo authored by William Barr. He was then serving as head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). It is highly uncommon for any OLC memo to make headlines. This one did because it was issued in “unusual secrecy” and concluded that the FBI could forcibly abduct people in other countries without the consent of the foreign state. The headline also noted the implication of the legal opinion at that moment in time. It appeared to pave the way for abducting Panama’s leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega.
Members of Congress asked to see the full legal opinion. Barr refused, but said he would provide an account that “summarizes the principal conclusions.” Sound familiar?
Goodman’s piece is worth reading in its entirety, but to briefly summarize, Barr wrote a summary of an important document for lawmakers, and a few years later, it became obvious that his account omitted key conclusions from the original document.
In effect, Barr took a major legal report, used his discretion to remove relevant portions, and told lawmakers what he wanted them to know.
Three decades later, Barr has the Mueller report, which he’s already been accused of mischaracterizing for political reasons, and we’re waiting for his office to complete a redaction process before sharing the findings with the public.
Maybe the history is irrelevant. Maybe the attorney general will handle this in a perfectly responsible manner, the redactions will be minor and defensible, and the questions about his independence and credibility will be answered in a satisfying way.
But given the circumstances, it’s difficult to blame skeptics for having doubts.

* Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) yesterday unveiled a new public-land-use plan that includes, among other things, an executive order that would impose “a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases, including for drilling offshore and on public lands.”
* Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), meanwhile, unveiled elements of his tax plan yesterday, including an expansion of existing Earned Income Tax Credit.
* A new national poll from Emerson found Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) leading the Democratic presidential field with 29%, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden (D-Del.) at 24%. A month ago, Emerson found the two men tied at 26%. No other candidate reached double digits, though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) came close.
* Speaking of Sanders, the Vermont senator released a decade’s worth of tax returns yesterday. Around the same time, Beto O’Rourke did the same thing .
* With the North Carolina Republican Party facing turmoil and scandal, Dallas Woodhouse is stepping down in June as the state GOP chair.
* There’s a very interesting new Mason-Dixon poll out of Alabama, where Sen. Doug Jones (D) has a 45% approval rating, though 50% of voters are prepared to replace him during his re-election bid next year. That said, the top choice among Alabama Republicans for that Senate race is none other than former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore (R).
* The Democratic presidential candidates’ fundraising totals from the first quarter continue to come in, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) reporting a $2.25 million haul, while former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D) raised $1.1 million over the first three months.
* And in South Carolina, Kamala Harris has picked up an endorsement from one of the state’s leading Democrats: former state Rep. Bakari Sellers, the former vice chair of the state party, is backing the Californian and will campaign with her this weekend.

Senate Republican on ACA: 'You got to look at it as positive' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/senate-republican-aca-you-got-look-it-positive,"By Steve Benen As far as Donald Trump is concerned, Senate Republicans should take the lead on crafting the GOP’s alternative to the Affordable Care Act. Evidently, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee isn’t eager to help in the endeavor.
Even Republicans who furiously fought the creation of the law and won elections with the mantra of repeal and replace speak favorably of President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.
“Quite obviously, more people have health insurance than would otherwise have it, so you got to look at it as positive,” Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a recent interview.
At a certain level, comments like these may seem so anodyne, they’re hardly notable. Any responsible assessment of the Affordable Care Act and its effects would conclude that it obviously deserves to be seen in a positive light.
But in Republican politics over the last decade, rhetoric like Grassley’s has been verboten. The only acceptable labels for “Obamacare” in GOP circles are words like “failure,” “disaster,” and attacks not suitable for publication on family websites like this one. To concede that the Affordable Care Act has helped millions, and has had a positive impact on the country, is to betray the Republican Party’s goals and principles.
Indeed, Iowa’s senior senator is an observer of particular relevance. Those who followed the debate over health-care reform closely may recall that by the fall of 2009, “ no Republican received more TLC from Barack Obama ” than Chuck Grassley. The Democratic president and his team reached out to him constantly, hoping that he was the kind of senator who would work in good faith towards bipartisan solutions.
He was not. While Grassley claimed to be serious about bipartisan solutions on health care reform, he was also, at the same time, making fundraising appeals urging donors to send him cash to help him “defeat Obama-care.” Grassley proceeded to talk up “ death panel ” garbage and tout Glenn Beck’s book .
By August 2009, Grassley told MSNBC that he was negotiating with the White House on a health care compromise, which Grassley was prepared to vote against, even if it included everything he asked for .
In the years that followed, the conservative Iowan did what hundreds of other GOP lawmakers did: Grassley voted to repeal the reform law – in whole or in part – several times.
And yet, here we are.
The Washington Post ’s Aaron Blake recently added , “It is worth taking stock of this moment. What we are seeing here is the marking of a willful GOP capitulation to Obamacare. Republicans are essentially admitting it is here to stay, barring unforeseen changes. They are trying to dress it up and put a good face on it for Trump, given that he apparently is not willing to concede the point. But it appears their long-emphasized push to get rid of this allegedly destructive law is effectively over.”
I agree with 95% of this. GOP policymakers in Congress and the White House will occasionally go through the motions, condemning the ACA more out of habit than conviction, realizing that they will never come up with an alternative that can both gain the necessary political support and meet the public’s needs and expectations.
But there is one related detail to keep in mind: there’s still that ridiculous lawsuit hanging over the ACA like a sword. A Republican judge in Texas has already used the case to begin the process of destroying “Obamacare” in its entirety, and Donald Trump’s White House recently agreed that the federal courts should do what elected officials could not: tear down the existing American health care system.
The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case in July, and whatever the outcome, the case may yet send the ACA to the U.S. Supreme Court for a third time.
When it comes to the legislative fight, Republicans have all but thrown in the towel, as Chuck Grassley’s comments help demonstrate. When it comes to the electoral fight, GOP officials are now running around telling anyone who’ll listen how much they love the Affordable Care Act’s core elements.
But when it comes to the legal fight, Republicans still have a Hail Mary pass in mind, and much of the party still hopes it will successfully take health security from tens of millions of Americans.
