Venezuela- All you need to know about the crisis in nine charts,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46999668,"2. GDP is falling
Venezuela once boasted Latin America's richest economy - boosted by the biggest oil reserves on the planet.
But under former president Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013, and current President Maduro, corruption, mismanagement and high levels of debt have seen the country's economy collapse.
President Chávez took advantage of the oil boom in the 2000s to borrow heavily and government spending soared.
Then, during President Maduro's first term in office, the Venezuelan economy went into freefall.
Many blame him and his socialist government for worsening the country's decline.
President Maduro blames ""imperialists"" - the likes of the US and Europe - for waging ""economic war"" against Venezuela and imposing sanctions on many members of his government.
Plummeting oil prices in 2016 compounded the oil-dependant country's crisis. 3. People don't have enough food...
Venezuelans are going hungry.
Of those questioned for the country's annual living conditions survey (Encovi 2017), eight out of 10 said they were eating less because they did not have enough food at home.
Six out of 10 said they had gone to bed hungry because they did not have the money to buy food.
And this is taking its toll on the nation's health.
Most people (64.3%) said they had lost weight in 2017 - 11.4kg on average, with the poorest losing most.
Other key findings of the study included: Traditional meals were decreasing in size and quality Nine out of 10 people couldn't afford their daily food 8.2 million had two meals a day or fewer Sources of iron, vitamins and other nutrients were lacking from people's diet Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some Venezuelans have turned to charity for food
As a result, Venezuelans are turning to forgotten vegetables and foodstuffs that were once considered a ""poor people's food"".
The yuca - or cassava - root vegetable, for example, is versatile, cheap and a traditional substitute for potatoes.
It can be boiled or fried - which fast food chain McDonald's used to its advantage in 2015, changing their Venezuelan menu from potato fries to yuca fries. 4. ...they also don't have enough medicine
Venezuela has suffered a huge rise in the number of malaria cases in recent years - in stark contrast to neighbouring countries in Latin America, where numbers are falling.
Having been the first country certified to have eliminated the disease in 1961, Venezuela now has cases in at least 10 out of 24 states.
Canadian NGO Icaso has said leaked government reports show the spread includes the hard-to-eradicate form of malaria - plasmodium vivax.
The Venezuelan Health Observatory has reported widespread shortages of antimalarial drugs - for all strains.
Jose Felix Oletta, infectious disease specialist and former health minister, says projections for 2018 suggest an increase of 50% in the number of cases on 2017.
""At this pace, we will have more than one million cases in one year,"" he told Icaso. ""These were numbers Venezuela had at the beginning of the 20th Century. Malaria is out of control in Venezuela.""
Measles and diphtheria have also returned with a vengeance. 5. Oil output is on the decline
Venezuela holds the world's largest supply of crude oil, and petroleum products make up the vast majority of the country's exports.
Production held virtually steady from 2002 - just before the national strike - to 2008, when global oil prices peaked. Figures from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) show the country earned bout $60bn from oil that year.
But the collapse in oil prices towards the end of 2014 - a year after Mr Chávez died from cancer - decimated the country's already-struggling oil-dependant economy.
The country hit crisis levels the following year, with GDP shrinking by almost 6% and inflation soaring.
Oil output has been declining since.
Venezuela is heavily reliant on the US for its oil revenue - sending 41% of its oil exports there.
On 29 January, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA, saying proceeds of the purchase of Venezuelan oil would now be withheld from Mr Maduro's government.
But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the company could avoid sanctions by recognising opposition leader Mr Guaidó. 6. Many Venezuelans are leaving
Three million Venezuelans have left their home country since 2014, according to the UN.
The majority of those leaving have crossed into neighbouring Colombia, some then move on to Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Others have gone south to Brazil.
Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez has disputed the UN's figures, saying they are inflated by ""enemy countries"" trying to justify a military intervention. 7. Countries are split over who to support
The US, more than a dozen Latin American countries, and Canada have already backed Mr Guaidó - leader of Venezuela's elected National Congress - undermining President Maduro, who began a second term in office just a fortnight ago.
On Monday, the UK, France, Germany, Spain and other European countries officially recognised Mr Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela.
It comes after President Nicolás Maduro rejected the EU's Sunday deadline to call snap elections.
Russia has condemned foreign support for Mr Guaidó, saying it violates international law and is a ""direct path to bloodshed"". China and Turkey also back Mr Maduro. By Dominic Bailey, David Brown, Daniele Palumbo, Lucy Rodgers, Olesya Volkova, Sean Willmott. Related Topics"
Government borrowing lowest for 17 years - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48036184," Government borrowing last year fell to its lowest annual level in 17 years, official figures show.
Borrowing for the 2018-19 financial year was £24.7bn, £17.2bn less than in the previous financial year, the Office for National Statistics said.
Despite the drop, the amount was still higher than the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast last month.
Economists believe the reduction should give the government freedom to ease the austerity measures of the last decade.
The figures showed tax receipts continued to grow strongly in March, but higher government spending accounted for the wider-than-expected deficit, mostly down to the purchases of goods and services.
The Chancellor of Exchequer, Philip Hammond wants to reduce borrowing to the equivalent of 2% of UK economic output. Borrowing last year was equivalent to 1.2%, giving the chancellor some extra spending room.
Scrap austerity? Mr Hammond, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday reiterated that by the financial year 2020-21 the government would have around of £27bn to use on a range of options.
But he added: ""Until we have resolved the Brexit issue I don't think it makes sense to to plump for one option or another.""
Samuel Tombs, UK economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The chancellor still should be able to scrap the further austerity measures planned for 2020-21 in the Budget later this year and meet his target.""
John McDonnell MP, Shadow Chancellor said: ""So much for the deficit being eliminated - something the Tories told us they would achieve by 2015. Four years on and the Government has added another £1.7 billion to the deficit in March alone.
""Nine hard years of austerity have held down growth, and shifted deficits onto the shoulders of local councillors, NHS managers, and head teachers.""

Japan sterilisation law victims get compensation and apology - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48036732," Demonstrators march in support of forced sterilisation victims in May 2018 Tens of thousands of victims of forced sterilisation in Japan are now entitled to compensation.
Under a eugenics law which was in effect from 1948 to 1996, people were made to undergo operations to prevent them having children deemed ""inferior"".
Many of the victims had physical or cognitive disabilities, mental illness, or behavioural problems.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has issued an apology for the ""great suffering"" they experienced.
Under a new law that was passed on Wednesday, surviving victims will each receive 3.2 million yen ($28,600; £22,100). Many were children or teenagers when they were operated on.
They now have five years to apply for compensation, which will need to be approved by a board of experts.
Woman sues Japan over forced sterilisation 'I was sterilised against my will' America's legacy of sterilisation ""During the period the law was in effect, many people were subjected to operations that made them unable to have children based on their having a disability or another chronic illness, causing them great suffering,"" Mr Abe said in a statement.
""As the government that carried out this law, after deep reflection, I would like to apologise from the bottom of my heart.""
About 20 victims of the law are currently suing the government over it. The first judgement in one of these cases is due at the end of May.
One unnamed woman, who is suing for 11m yen ($98,300; £76,000), was sterilised in 1972 at the age of 15 after being diagnosed with ""hereditary feeble-mindedness"".
""We've had agonising days,"" her sister told a press conference last January. ""We stood up to make this society brighter.""
What was the sterilisation law? The Eugenics Protection Law came into force in 1948, as Japan struggled to rebuild itself after World War Two.
It sought to prevent people with physical and cognitive disabilities from being able to have children, as well as those with mental illnesses. People with certain diseases were also sterilised - such as those with leprosy, a now-curable condition known as Hansen's disease.
It's believed that at least 25,000 people were sterilised in the 48 years the law was in place and, while few records remain of the time, it's thought that at least 16,500 of those did not give consent.
Sterilisations peaked in the 1960s and 1970s, and continued until the final operation in 1993. The law was finally revoked in 1996."
Microsoft Paint: Fans rejoice as art app saved 'for now' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48036912,"Image copyright Pat Hines Image caption A scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, digitally rendered in Paint by artist Pat Hines Fans of low-fidelity art app Microsoft Paint are rejoicing after it was confirmed it would remain a part of the Windows operation system ""for now"".
In 2017, Microsoft had said that Paint would be deprecated but it survived .
Confusion returned in recent weeks as users questioned whether Paint would be part of the next Window 10 update, which launches in May.
A Microsoft developer confirmed that Paint would be included - to the relief of many.
Sydney-based digital artist Miranda Lorikeet , known as ""Lazy Bones"", uses Paint for her work and is sponsored by Microsoft.
She told BBC News she was surprised to hear that uncertainty over the program's survival had been raised again.
""The way I discovered it was when I was like six or seven when I was mucking around on the computer,"" she said.
""It's a crappy tool at the end of the day, it's not good, and I think I like using something that is genuinely a rubbish tool to make artwork.""
Image copyright @LAZYBONES Image caption A Microsoft Paint artwork by Miranda Lorikeet It is possible that Microsoft will change Windows 10 so that Paint has to be downloaded separately, rather than being included as a standard app.
This would be unfortunate, added Ms Lorikeet, who praised the ""accessible"" nature of the program.
Other fans expressed their fondness for the program on social media.
Skip Twitter post by @jared_jeronimo I love MS Paint! It was all I had when it came to digital art.
If I didn't have it I would have never gotten as good as I am now.
I am happy it is around for other people to discover their artistic skills.

Despite its basic suite of digital paint tools, Paint has attracted interest from patient artists ever since it was launched in the very first version of Microsoft Windows in 1985.
Massachusetts-based illustrator Pat Hines , who goes by the name of ""Captain Redblood"", is among those who have harnessed the app to produce astoundingly detailed artworks.
In 2017, he released an e-book with illustrations painstakingly produced in Paint .
""I use it pretty much every day,"" he told BBC News, adding that his illustrations can take anywhere from 15 to 40 hours to complete. He uses a $7 (£5.41) mouse and $200 computer running an old version of Paint.
""The limitations are kind of what dictates my aesthetic with it, it's why I chose it as my primary medium.
""If I had my way with it it would just be included on every computer.""
Yet another aficionado is Concha Garcia Zaera, an 88-year-old Spanish woman who regularly updates her Instagram account with charming digital artworks, all produced in Paint."

Huawei: Why UK is at odds with its cyber-allies - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Leo Kelion Technology Desk Editor,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48035802,"Image copyright EPA After months of uncertainty, the UK appears set to allow Huawei's telecoms equipment to be part of the country's 5G networks - with some limitations.
The move would put the UK at odds with the US, which has been pressing other nations to ban use of the Chinese firm's kit on security grounds.
It could also cause tensions with Australia, which last year blocked its networks from using Huawei's 5G gear.
The country also barred another Chinese firm, ZTE.
While Theresa May is reportedly willing to give Huawei the green light, this would not mean the prime minister's cyber-advisers have disregarded the threat of a future Chinese cyber-attack.
That concern still preoccupies many security officials' minds, since much of our critical infrastructure - from power stations to automated transport - is likely to be dependent on the next-generation communications technology.
Rather, there is a belief that restricting Huawei's equipment to certain parts of the UK's network means that the risk can be managed.
At the heart of the matter, there seems to be a critical disagreement: Canberra and Washington believe that there are fundamental differences between 5G and 4G, which mean an outright ban is the wiser choice.
What is 5G and what will it mean for you? To make sense of all this, it is worth exploring first why Australia came to its conclusion.
Image copyright Huawei Image caption Telecom networks are preparing to spend huge sums to install 5G equipment But it is worth saying up front that, for its part, Huawei has denied it would ever compromise a client's network because it had been ordered to do so by Beijing.
It has said that it has been ""targeted by a sustained campaign of ill-informed accusations that its involvement in 5G infrastructure somehow poses a threat"".
Why did Australia ban Huawei? Australia concluded in August that it was impossible to ""mitigate"" the national security risks involved in allowing Huawei to form any part of its 5G network, because next-generation networks would operate in a different way to their predecessors.
UK to let Huawei help build 5G network 'Shoddy' Huawei work risks Westminster ban Huawei: The world's most controversial company The reason for this, it added, was that the relationship between two distinct bits of the network would change.
The first part - ""the core"" - it said was where the ""most sensitive functions occur"", including device authentication, voice and data-routing and billing.
The second - ""the edge"" - referred to equipment including antennae and base stations that is used to capture the radio signals emitted by wireless devices and send them into the core.
The key phrase in a ministerial statement then explained: ""The distinction between the core and the edge will disappear over time.""
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption One potential problem with 5G tech may have more to do with castles than you’d expect One of the country's spy chiefs, Mike Burgess, later expanded on this, saying that as 5G technologies matured, the expectation was that the distinction between the edge and core ""collapses"" because ""sensitive functions"" would begin to move outside of the protected part.
Part of the reason for this, he explained, would be to take advantage of the lower latencies 5G offers - the lag between issuing a command and getting a response. This, for example, could help make it safe to direct surgical robots or remote-controlled vehicles from afar.
Image copyright Lowy Institute Image caption Mike Burgess has confirmed Australia's restrictions amount to a 5G ban on Huawei But, Mr Burgess added, the consequences could be dire if the 5G kit was then compromised and used to mount an attack.
""Elements of the power grid may not work, water supply [and] sewage pumps may not work - it has the potential to impact our country greatly,"" explained the director general of the Australian Signals Directorate.
And Huawei was considered a company that could be ""subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law"".
In other words, the fear was that it could be compelled to facilitate a Beijing-mounted cyber-attack.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What could happen if the UK's 5G networks suffered a major cyber-attack? So why would the UK want to use Huawei? The Australians' argument never convinced many senior figures involved in the UK's telecoms industry.
While they accept there are issues with using Huawei's kit in the core, they believe it would still be relatively safe to use its radio access network (Ran) equipment - which allows individual devices to wirelessly connect to mobile data networks via radio signals transmitted over the airwaves.
Huawei's Ran gear is seen to be more advanced than that of its competitors - Nokia and Ericsson - at doing things like maximising the amount of data that can be handled at once. The Chinese firm also has a reputation for being more willing to provide customised solutions.
But critically, there is also a belief that there is no reason for the distinction between the core and Ran to disappear over time, so long as the networks involved continue to respect standards that define a border between the two.
""One of the key features of 5G is the ability to... distribute [the core] more broadly across the overall network infrastructure,"" explained Vodafone UK's chief technology officer Scott Petty.
""However, that core network is still protected from the radio base stations by security gateways and capabilities.""
There has, however, been some reluctance to openly contradict the Australians.
Image caption Dr Ian Levy helps oversee checks of Huawei's equipment as part of efforts to ensure it is safe to use in 5G network When BBC Panorama spoke to the technical director of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre earlier this year, he sought to suggest both views could be right.
""From a purely technical point of view, geography matters in 5G,"" Dr Ian Levy explained.
""Because you have these very, very quick turnaround communications, you are limited about where certain things can physically be - limited by the speed of light.
""UK and Australia have very different geographies - so our laydowns will be very different to Australia's laydowns. So, we may have exactly the same technical understanding, but come to very different conclusions.""
How does the US come into this? Washington has been leading the campaign against Huawei, both in terms of making the case about the supposed security threat it poses, but also pursuing legal cases alleging the firm has engaged in systemic intellectual property theft and fraud - claims that Huawei denies.
Earlier this month, one of President Trump's top cyber-security officials made it clear that the US believes it is not safe to use Huawei kit in any part of a 5G network.
""We view there to be no relevant distinction between the core and the edge of a 5G network,"" said the US State Department's Ambassador Robert Strayer.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Robert Strayer has led the US's efforts to convince its allies not to use Huawei equipment in their 5G networks ""That distinction had existed in 4G networks because you basically had a smart core - where the intelligence and the software ran - and the edge was dumb, because it was just for the transmission of data to the core.
""In a 5G network, much of the smart computing capacity... will move to the edge.""
When the BBC asked him whether geographic differences might mean this would not be an issue for the UK, he made clear this was not a consideration.
""Due to the configuration of 5G networks with computing at the edge and reliance on those networks for the provision of critical services, untrusted equipment should not be allowed in any part of the network,"" he answered.
What might the consequences be for this split? The UK, Australia and US are three members of an intelligence-sharing pact called the Five Eyes alliance.
The other two members are New Zealand - which has also barred one of its networks from using Huawei's 5G equipment while it continues to evaluates the risks involved - and Canada, which is still on the fence.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Spencer Kelly visited Huawei's giant theme park-like campus near Shenzhen A decision by the UK to allow at least partial use of Huawei's kit could encourage New Zealand and Canada to do likewise, as well as sending a wider signal out to other countries that there is no reason for an outright ban.
But Washington has warned there could be repercussions.
""It would be very difficult for the United States to share information the way that we have in the past if we are having to rely on unsecure networks,"" Mr Strayer told the BBC.
""[As Secretary of State] Pompeo has said - if the risk exceeds the threshold for the United States, we simply won't be able to share that information any longer.""
Some experts are not convinced, however, that the US would really stop sharing intelligence.
""I am surprised at some of the rhetoric from the US,"" commented Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University.
""If sensitive information is being passed across any public network, you have to assume someone is attempting to intercept it. Hence, you layer on your own security to a level appropriate to the sensitivity of the data being transmitted.
""The greater concern with 5G is the potential for disruption of the network, not necessarily espionage.""
A formal UK decision on Huawei is still not expected until after the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport shares the results of its own review into the matter with the country's National Security Council.
In the meantime, Huawei is not taking anything for granted.
""We welcome reports that the UK government is moving towards allowing Huawei to help build the UK's 5G networks,"" said a spokesman for the firm.
""While we await a formal government announcement, we will continue to work co-operatively with the government, Ofcom and the industry and their evidence-based approach to network security."""

Some 148 homes were evacuated around the town of Sokndal, where fires have been burning since Tuesday.
Police say the fires are still out of control and warn that heavy winds could help them to spread.
April is very early for forest fires in Norway, and experts have warned of a dramatic increase across the continent.
This month alone, wildfires have broken out in Sweden, Germany and the UK.
Fires in Europe ""are way above the average"" for this time of year, an official at the EU's European Forest Fire Information System (Effis) told the BBC.
""The season is drastically worse than those of the last decade.""
The official added that a ""very dry winter in most of Europe"" and persistent drought had contributed to the rise in forest fires, and that the ""long term forecast is not promising for an improvement"".
'No fire control' Image copyright Reuters Image caption Firefighters aided by helicopters worked on Wednesday to damp down the forest fires Police in south-west Norway are still unsure what started the fires, which have burned some 7.5 sq km (2.9 square miles) of land near Sokndal, 100km (62 miles) south-east of the coastal city of Stavanger.
As well as evacuating residents, rescue services spent the night soaking land in surrounding areas in an effort to stop the fire from spreading.
But they fear that expected winds of nine to 11 metres per second could cause the fire to move into neighbouring districts.
""The wind is still a challenge and will become an even greater challenge if it increases. It's still burning heavily, and there is no fire control,"" said south-west police official Toralf Skarland.
Police said there had been no reports of casualties but warned people to avoid the area.
Image copyright Norway Police handout Image caption This police map highlights in red where the fire is burning, while the green section shows evacuated areas The Red Cross, which helped with the evacuation effort, told the BBC the blaze was close to farms, huts and small villages.
Fires were also burning around the town of Lyngdal in the neighbouring area, it said.
Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries Why are there UK wildfires in February? In pictures: Fighting the Swedish wildfires Other wildfires Forest fires have broken out in several parts of northern Europe this month amid hot temperatures.
Dozens of people were evacuated from their homes when a blaze broke out in southern Sweden on Tuesday, but by Wednesday morning it was under control.
In Germany, crews battled fires over the Easter weekend and Germany's weather service warned Germans on Wednesday to expect a drought this year at least as severe as in 2018 if the current dry weather continued.
""The starting conditions for vegetation in 2019 are in many areas of Germany clearly worse than last year,"" said agriculture meteorologist Udo Busch.
A huge wildfire broke out in Moray, Scotland this week, which officials said would ""take days"" to put out.
Two fires also spread across moorland in West Yorkshire.
What about southern Europe? The spate of forest fires in northern Europe contrasts with storms and torrential rain in the south.
A woman drowned when the car she was in was swept away by a flood in Tuscany on Tuesday, and a French tourist died in storms off Sardinia earlier this week."
Boeing uncertain how 737 crashes will hit profits - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48038026," Boeing has said it still does not know how the crisis over the safety of its 737 Max 8 jets will affect its profits.
In its latest set of results, Boeing said that uncertainty over when the plane would be allowed to fly again meant it could not forecast profits for this year.
A fall in 737 deliveries has already led to a $1bn drop in revenues.
In March, a Max 8 belonging to Ethiopian Airlines crashed, killing all 157 passengers and crew.
It was the second crash involving a Max 8 jet in five months. The two disasters prompted aviation regulators round the world to ground the aircraft.
""Due to the uncertainty of the timing and conditions surrounding return to service of the 737 Max fleet, new guidance [on profits] will be issued at a future date,"" Boeing said in its first quarter results.
Can Boeing rebuild trust in the 737 Max? Pilot explains Boeing's anti-stall system Boeing is temporarily cutting production of the 737 airliner from 52 planes a month to 42 from this month.
Despite the drop in production Boeing has not laid off staff and is maintaining order levels with many suppliers, all of which is keeping costs high. Meanwhile, some 50 deliveries of new 737 Max planes have been withdrawn.
The worldwide fleet of 737 Max planes totalled 387 aircraft at the time of the grounding.
Boeing is developing new software for the jet's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), an anti-stall system which has come under scrutiny since the crashes.
It said last week it was making ""steady progress"" on the path to certifying a software update which had been put through 135 test and production flights.
Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said: ""We have great confidence in the update of the software and with the test flights that have occurred. I have personally been on two of those flights and I have seen the confidence that the team has in the system.""
Boeing said on Wednesday it expects a certification flight with the US Federal Aviation Administration in the ""near term"".
Boeing's commercial aircraft division managed to offset the impact of the Max 8 groundings by increasing production of its 787 planes from 12 a month to 14. Even so, the division still saw a 9% fall in revenue to $11.8bn from $12.9bn.
Boeing's net earnings in the first three months of the year were 13% lower at $2.15bn, reflecting a one-third drop in deliveries of the Max 8."

Authorities in Tanzania have advised people in southern coastal regions to move to safer ground.
Residents have been told to expect damage to their houses and farms.
Cyclone Idai made landfall near the Mozambican port city of Beira on 14 March, packing winds of up to 177 km/h and bringing torrential rain which caused extensive flooding. Cyclone Idai: What the aftermath looks like
More than 700 people were killed in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe and at least three million were left in need of humanitarian assistance.
Tanzania’s Lindi, Mtwara and Ruvuma regions have been listed as the most prone to the weather, which is predicted to hit the country on Thursday.
Authorities have urged people who live in mud houses to seek shelter where they would be safe.
The storm is forecast to also affect Mozambique’s northern Cabo Delgado province.
Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers have been put on alert in Tanzania and Mozambique. And the organisation has alerted communities in northern Mozambique most likely to suffer from flooding and landslides.
Authorities in the island nation of Comoros have closed airports for at least 24 hours as a precautionary measure against the cyclone expected there on Wednesday, reports privately-owned Comores Infos news website.
Schools have also also been closed, it adds.

The boys then lent the officers their bikes, leading to two men being arrested and charged with theft.
Police said a dumper truck was loaded into the back of a van on Carisbrooke Way on Monday.
Sgt Matt Bailey said: ""The public support during this incident was fantastic and led directly to the capture, arrest and charging of these two individuals.
""I would like to thank all of them for their help, but especially the two boys who lent me their bicycles.
""It was great to know how much they wanted us to succeed in catching up with the suspects.""
The two boys have been invited to spend a day with the force's response team. Related Topics"
Easyjet bans nuts on all flights to protect passengers - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48041464," Easyjet has banned the sale of nuts on flights to help protect passengers with allergies.
The airline will also ban passengers from eating nut products if somebody on board has an allergy to them.
Nut policy among airlines differs. British Airways and Ryanair, ask passengers to refrain from eating peanuts if a fellow passenger has an allergy.
At present there are no rules governing the serving of nuts during flights.
A proposed UK passenger charter, which could include rules for protecting allergy sufferers, is currently under consultation.
The plans are part of the government's Aviation 2050 strategy .
German carrier Lufthansa is among firms with a rule against serving peanuts on its planes. However, like most airlines, it says it cannot guarantee a nut-free environment.
Outlining the new policy, Easyjet said: ""We recommend that passengers inform us of their allergy at the time of booking which enables us to pass this information onto the cabin crew operating the flight.""
Passengers can also notify the airline during the online booking process.
Image caption Peanuts put Josie at risk of an anaphylactic shock An overarching policy for airlines is supported by 11 year-old Josie, who would like to see nuts banned by all operators.
Josie, from Wolviston in Stockton-on-Tees, worries about going on holiday due to her life-threatening nut allergy.
She carries an EpiPen with her on flights but says they only delay an anaphylactic reaction by a few minutes.
""You cannot do anything if you are 30,000 feet in the air,"" she said.

James Byrd Jr: Killer to be executed for notorious hate crime - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48040916,"Image copyright Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AFP Image caption John William King is seen as the ringleader of the trio that attacked James Byrd Jr One of three men convicted for the murder in 1998 of James Byrd Jr, one of modern America's worst hate crimes, has been executed in Texas.
Byrd, a black man, was beaten, chained to a truck and dragged for miles by three white men.
His murder prompted Congress to pass hate crime legislation in 2009.
John William King, 44, an avowed white supremacist, is the second man to be executed over the killing. He had filed multiple appeals in the case.
On Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole voted unanimously to deny King a commutation or a 120-day reprieve.
Last October, the US Supreme Court declined to take up his appeal.
King was pronounced dead on Wednesday at 19:08 local time (23:08 GMT) at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville.
Image copyright F Carter Smith/Getty Images Prosecutors depicted King, a self-professed racist with a criminal record, as the ringleader of the group of men who attacked Byrd.
Lawrence Russell Brewer, the other white supremacist who took part in Byrd's killing, was executed in 2011 , although King had been sentenced earlier.
The third man, Shawn Allen Berry, was spared the death sentence and is serving a life term as he did not share the white supremacist beliefs of Brewer and King.
He will be up for parole in 2038, US media report.
The lingering effects of white supremacy Spike in US hate crimes third year in a row The murder that changed America In the early hours of 7 June 1998, in Jasper, Texas, Byrd, 49, encountered Brewer, King and Berry on the way home from a party.
The three men assaulted Byrd, then chained him by his ankles to the back of a pickup truck and dragged him for several miles until he was dismembered.
Police found parts of Byrd's body in front of a black church just outside the city; the rest was located over a mile away.
Authorities followed a blood trail of evidence - including a lighter engraved with ""KKK"" and King's nickname, Possum - placing the three men at the scene of the crime.
Image copyright PAul Buck/AFP/Getty Images Image caption John William King seen escorted into the Jasper County Courthouse in 1999 During King's trial, prosecutors showed evidence detailing his hatred of black people, including a letter he attempted to send Brewer in jail glorifying their murder, US media reported.
""Regardless of the outcome of this, we have made history and shall die proudly remembered if need be... Much Aryan love, respect, and honour, my brother in arms.""
King had spoken of starting a race war and of initiating members of a white supremacist gang he belonged to by having them kidnap and murder black people, court documents showed.
He was convicted by a jury that deliberated for just over two hours.
The case sparked nationwide horror and outrage, and in 2001, Texas passed the James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Act to toughen punishments for such crimes.
Congress followed, enacting the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 to strengthen laws against crimes motivated by a person's race, colour, religion, sexual orientation, gender, disability or national origin.
King has repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to appeal his case at the state and federal level. He has maintained he is innocent, blaming Berry alone for the murder, and arguing that his lawyers did not properly defend him.
Jasper's former sheriff, Billy Rowles, told KFDM News that King's execution would finally provide closure for the community.
""It's time... Most of the people in Jasper will believe this is the end of it."""
'Exhilarating' implant turns thoughts to speech - BBC News,www.bbc.com,James Gallagher Health,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48037592,"Image copyright Alamy Image caption Electrodes read the electrical activity in the brain Scientists have developed a brain implant that can read people's minds and turn their thoughts to speech.
The team at the University of California, San Francisco says the technology is ""exhilarating"".
They add that their findings, published in the journal Nature , could help people when disease robs them of their ability to talk.
Experts said the findings were compelling and offered hope of restoring speech.
How does it work? The mind-reading technology works in two stages.
First an electrode is implanted in the brain to pick up the electrical signals that manoeuvre the lips, tongue, voice box and jaw.
Then powerful computing is used to simulate how the movements in the mouth and throat would form different sounds.
This results in synthesised speech coming out of a ""virtual vocal tract"".
Why do it like that? You might think it would be easier to scour the brain for the pattern of electrical signals that code for each word.
However, attempts to do so have only had limited success.
Instead it was focusing on the shape of the mouth and the sounds it would produce that allowed the scientists to achieve a world first.
The profoundly deaf girl who found her voice after brain surgery Parkinson's Disease course uses shouting to help patients Prof Edward Chang, one of the researchers, said: ""For the first time, this study demonstrates that we can generate entire spoken sentences based on an individual's brain activity.
""This is an exhilarating proof of principle that, with technology that is already within reach, we should be able to build a device that is clinically viable in patients with speech loss.""
How good is it? It is not perfect.
If you listen to this recording of synthesised speech:
 Listen to speech decoded from brain activity You can tell it is not crystal clear (the recording says ""the proof you are seeking is not available in books"").
The system is better with prolonged sounds like the ""sh"" in ship than with abrupt sounds such as the ""buh"" sound in ""books"".
In experiments with five people, who read hundreds of sentences, listeners were able to discern what was being spoken up to 70% of the time when they were given a list of words to choose from.
Who could it help? Many diseases can lead to the loss of speech including:
motor neurone disease brain injuries throat cancer some strokes neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis The team say it could work in some of these diseases.
However, the technology relies on the parts of the brain which control the lips, tongue, voice box and jaw working correctly. So patients with some types of stroke would not be able to benefit.
""This is not a solution for everyone who cannot communicate,"" says Prof Chang.
There is also the more distant prospect of helping people who have never spoken, including some children with cerebral palsy, to learn to speak with such a device, say the researchers.
What do people have to think? Image copyright Getty Images The participants in the study were told not to make any specific mouth movements.
Prof Chang said: ""There were just asked to do the very simple thing of reading some sentences.
""So it's a very natural act that the brain translates into movements itself.""
Can unscrupulous people read my private thoughts? At the moment it is too hard.
Prof Chang said: ""We and others actually have tried to look at whether it's actually possible to decode just thoughts alone.
""And it turns out, it's a very, very difficult and challenging problem.
""That's only one reason why, of many, we really focus on what people are actually trying to say.""
However, some scientists have argued there is an ethical debate to be had about brain-machine interface technologies that read the mind.
What do the experts say? A commentary, published alongside the research, said the results were ""compelling"".
It added: ""We can hope that individuals with speech impairments will regain the ability to freely speak their minds and reconnect with the world around them.""
Prof Sophie Scott, from University College London, said: ""This is very interesting work from a great lab but it must be noted that it is at very early stages and is not close to clinical applications yet.""

US Border Patrol agents discovered the boy in the Rio Grande Valley near Brownsville, Texas on Tuesday morning.
His name and phone number were written on his shoes, according to officials.
""We believe the boy was with a larger group that ran when they encountered agents,"" the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tweeted.
He was taken to Fort Brown border station, where he was supervised by agents while efforts were made to find his family, officials say.
Border agents say they were unable to locate his relatives and he ""does not speak well enough"" to tell them who they are. The agony over an American dream
He has been taken to a processing facility in Texas, where he remains under the care of child workers.
In a statement, CBP told the BBC the boy was ""abandoned by smugglers"" who ""entered the United States illegally"".
Startled by border agents attempting to intercept them, the group fled, leaving the boy on his own in an overgrown field, the agency says.
""Agents requested the assistance of a Border Patrol K-9 team in an attempt to search the field and, in the process, they located a child who was alone and crying,"" the statement says. Image copyright US Customs and Border Protection Image caption A US Border Patrol agent carries the three-year-old boy in his arms
He underwent a medical examination at a local hospital and was found to be in a ""good condition"" with no injuries.

On Monday, Mexico detained nearly 400 Central American migrants who were travelling towards the US border, according to officials.
The migrants, said to be part of a 3,000-strong caravan, were arrested during a raid in Chiapas state.
US President Donald Trump said the remainder ""must be apprehended"" and threatened to close a section of the border if they were not. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five numbers that explain US border crisis What are the latest migration figures?
In total, 207,475 people have been apprehended on the south-west US border between January and the end of March this year, official US Border Patrol figures show .
Of that total, 53,077 of them were families and 8,975 were unaccompanied children in March, the agency says.
The total number of apprehensions rose sharply between February and March, from 66,884 to 92,607, according to the latest figures.
In March, CBP said encounters of family units and unaccompanied children along the southwest border rose to numbers not seen since 2014.
""We are currently experiencing a system-wide emergency in our processing and holding facilities,"" CBP deputy commissioner, Robert Perez, said in a statement.
""The humanitarian crisis created by a massive influx of family groups and unaccompanied children in recent months has forced CBP to reallocate resources away from law enforcement, trade and travel missions to process and provide care for those in our custody."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to close the US-Mexico border How is Trump dealing with it?
Mr Trump has taken a hard line on migration across the US-Mexico border since taking office in 2017.
Building a ""big, beautiful"" wall to stop the flow of migrants was one of his main 2016 presidential campaign pledges, blaming Mexico for ""bringing drugs, bringing crime, their rapists"".
His plans reached an impasse last year after Congress refused to give Mr Trump the $5.7bn (£4.5bn) he wanted to build the wall, leading to a government shutdown.
But in February, Mr Trump managed to circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency, allowing him to reroute funds from the military to the wall.
As president, Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to shut down the border if Mexico does not do more to stop undocumented migrants making the crossing. Related Topics"

An Indian intelligence warning from the beginning of the month about planned attacks was not properly shared by the authorities, parliament heard.
President Maithripala Sirisena has moved to sack the defence secretary and inspector general of police.
Eight of the nine attackers have been identified as Sri Lankan citizens.
What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? The government is investigating whether the Islamic State (IS) group was involved in the attacks which targeted churches and high-end hotels.
It has emerged that one of the attackers once studied in the UK and Australia before returning to Sri Lanka.
How did the authorities get it wrong? ""We have to take responsibility because unfortunately if the sharing of the intelligence information had been given to the right people, I think that at least this could have been avoided or even minimised,"" said Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene.
Lakshman Kiriella, the leader of parliament, said senior officials had deliberately withheld intelligence about possible attacks.

He said the Indian tip-off had been received on 4 April but, Reuters news agency says, both the president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reportedly did not receive it.
President Sirisena replaced Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando and took steps to sack the Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara.
What do we know about the attackers? The whereabouts of Islamist preacher Zahran Hashim, who is suspected of being the bombers' ringleader, remain unclear.
A man believed to be him appears in an IS video but police do not know whether he detonated one of the suicide bombs or is still at large.
His sister told the BBC: ""I came to know about his actions only through the media. Even for a moment, I never thought that he would do such a thing.
""I strongly deplore what he has done. Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care what happens to him any more.""

One of the attackers, named as Abdul Latif Jamil Mohammed, had spent time studying in the UK.
A senior Whitehall official told the BBC that he visited south-east England in 2006-7 to study but did not complete a full university degree.
From privilege to terror Analysis by the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner
The announcement that most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and ""middle class"" is not as surprising as it sounds.
Although poverty and lack of opportunities have steered many down a path to terrorism, there are also numerous examples of individuals abandoning a relatively comfortable lifestyle for a violent cause.
Ziad Jarrah, one of the 9/11 attackers who hijacked United Airlines flight 93, came from a privileged Lebanese family. More recently, there have been cases of British jihadists who have worked for the NHS, including doctors.
The late IS executioner Mohammed Emwazi, aka ""Jihadi John"", attended the University of Westminster in London. And the original co-founder of al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, chose to leave behind a luxurious life in Jeddah to go and fight the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s.
Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) but Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks ""could not have been done just locally"".
NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings.
The worshipper who blocked a bomber The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? IS said online that it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"".
It provided no evidence for the claim other than images on social media of the suspected attackers.
What action are security forces taking? Police have now detained around 60 suspects in connection with the attack. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks.
 Funerals continued on Wednesday The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo.
An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be ""out there"" following the attack.
One of the targeted hotels, the Kingsbury, has now reopened.
The country remains tense with police still looking for suspects and possible further explosives.
Cautioning about ""ongoing terrorist plots in the country"", US envoy to Sri Lanka Alaina Teplitz told reporters that terrorists could ""strike without warning"".
Who were the victims? The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims.
Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services.
Some 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 11 Indian nationals.

Last week the social media giant announced a series of far-right Facebook pages would be removed.
One of those it named - Jack Renshaw, 23, from Skelmersdale in Lancashire - is awaiting sentencing after admitting a terrorist plot to murder a Labour MP.
But his personal profile remained live until the BBC raised it with the firm.
Those banned from Facebook last week - in an announcement that received significant publicity - include the British National Party, the former BNP leader Nick Griffin, and the National Front.

""Individuals and organisations who spread hate, or attack or call for the exclusion of others on the basis of who they are, have no place on Facebook,"" the company said.
But Renshaw's account, which was linked to other extreme right figures, remained active.
The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill Renshaw pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to preparing to murder his local MP , Rosie Cooper, with a machete and threatening to kill a female detective.
He will be sentenced next month, but is already serving time after being convicted last year of sexually grooming adolescent boys and stirring up racial hatred in speeches.
Before being arrested he used Facebook to declare himself a ""Nazi terrorist"".
At one stage fellow activists created a ""unity group"" for Renshaw in which he stated - in a reference to Thomas Mair, the man who killed MP Jo Cox - that he was going to ""Mair"" others.
Facebook only removed Renshaw's account - bearing his picture and which featured in his trial - hours after the BBC contacted the company to say it was still active.
MPs on Wednesday challenged Facebook for not doing enough to remove videos of the Christchurch mosque attacks and was asked why so much neo-Nazi content is available."

What's behind the rise of anti-abortion 'heartbeat bills'? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Ritu Prasad Bbc News,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47940659,"Image copyright The Washington Post via Getty Images Image caption A group of students hold heart balloons to show support for the 'Heartbeat Bill' during the March for Life, the world's largest annual pro-life demonstration, in Washington DC A slew of states have introduced new anti-abortion legislation that would ban the procedure as soon as a foetal heartbeat can be detected. What's behind the push - and the backlash - for these bills and what exactly do they mean for women?
In the first months of this year, nearly 30 states introduced some form of an abortion ban in their legislature. Fifteen have specifically been working with so-called ""heartbeat bills"", that would ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy.
Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute - a group that researches sexual and reproductive health - says it's a huge increase, up from seven last year.
What are these bills - and why now? ""Heartbeat bills"", as the term implies, seek to make abortion illegal as soon as a foetus' heartbeat is detectable. In most cases, this is at the six-week mark of a pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant.
For context, morning sickness generally happens around the nine-week mark, according to Mayo Clinic , and one study found about only half of women experienced pregnancy symptoms by the end of the fifth week of pregnancy.
""We have never seen so much action around six-week abortion bans,"" Ms Nash says. ""But we now have seen a shift in the composition of the US Supreme Court.""
Image copyright Tom Williams/Getty Images Image caption Anti-abortion activists outside the Supreme Court President Donald Trump has thus far successfully placed two conservative Supreme Court justices - moving the nation's top court further to the right, and, Ms Nash says, making it seem more amenable to revoking abortion rights.
""Because of this, we are seeing state legislatures looking to ban abortion as a way to kickstart litigation that would come before the [Supreme] court, and the court could then roll back abortion rights.""
Progressive legislators are also responding - in January, New York signed into law a bill safeguarding abortion rights after 24 weeks in certain cases, reigniting discussions about the controversial procedure.
Why are people talking about NY's abortion law? How US abortion debate got to this point What US ruling may mean for Roe v Wade Ms Nash notes that a conservative shift at the state level was apparent in 2010 as well, but under the Obama administration, there was still a federal safety net for abortion rights.
A brief history of US abortion The US movement against abortion began in the 1800s, spearheaded by physicians who saw non-medical professionals providing abortion services as both a threat to their industry and harmful to women's health.
By 1900, every state had banned abortions entirely - with exceptions granted only at the discretion of a licensed physician.
The issue arose again in the 1960s, when women began advocating for reproductive rights. Colorado changed its anti-abortion law in 1967, followed soon after by California and New York.
Amid these efforts to return the choice to women, the anti-abortion movement as we currently see it was born, led largely by Catholics and other conservative religious groups. The oldest such group in the US, the National Right to Life, was founded in 1968.
Most funding for the movement still comes from religious conservatives - including wealthy donors like the vocally pro-life DeVos family.
In 1973, the Supreme Court issued the landmark Roe v Wade ruling legalising abortion in all 50 states.
Roe v Wade protects a woman's right to an abortion only until viability - that is, the point at which a foetus is able to live outside the womb, generally at the start of the third trimester, 28 weeks into a pregnancy.
Image copyright SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images What does the anti-abortion movement want? The movement in recent years has grown increasingly diverse, advocates say, and as a result, not everyone within it has the same vision of how to move forward.
For Karen Swallow Prior, a professor at the evangelical Liberty University who is a proponent of banning abortion outright, these foetal heartbeat bills are ""a good faith effort"" to restrict abortion.
While Prof Prior supports the legislation, she says that such a dramatic step is unlikely to result in any lasting political change - but it does spark potentially constructive debates.
""What I like about these heartbeat bills is the name alone allows us to think about the unborn children in a different way than we're used to talking about in political discourse.""
Prof Prior says those supporting abortion rights - the ""pro-choice"" camp - argue that most abortions occur within the first trimester, but also say some women do not realise they are pregnant until 20 weeks in, so these heartbeat bills have the added effect of ""encouraging women to be more aware and conscious of what's going on in their bodies"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi ""These bills and the pro-life [anti-abortion] movement are not about punishing women for having sex, they are about preserving a human life that already exists,"" Prof Prior says. She emphasised it was not a religiously motivated viewpoint, but one based on science and human rights.
It's worth noting, however, that the science and medical community remains just as embroiled in the debate over when a foetus is alive.
Kyle Eisenhuth, the 21-year-old president of the pro-life group at Liberty, echoes the same argument.
""I'm a devout Christian, so that's part of it, but I really think science is on the side of the pro-life movement,"" he says. ""Just because we have that faith doesn't change how a baby has a heartbeat at 18-21 days.""
Mr Eisenhuth says that he believes progressive retaliation to Mr Trump has had the biggest impact on jump-starting these bills.
""More than anything else, when New York passed their bill on abortion, I think that inspired a lot more activism.""
In addition to these six-week bans, pro-life activists have fought for restrictions on abortion methods, rationales (such as sex or race or abnormality) and trigger bans that would end abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned.
According to the Guttmacher Institute , 18 states have laws that would restrict abortion in the absence of the federal law, while 10 have laws that would protect abortion in the same scenario.

Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, founder of New Wave Feminists, says her organisation wants to make abortion ""unthinkable"".
""We're arguing about autonomy - which is more important, the woman's or the child's? As a pro-life feminist, I believe we have to take into account both.""
She is not opposed to the heartbeat bills, but says her own activism focuses on women's empowerment.
""We know statistically it's a decision made on financial constraints, lack of access to healthcare, things like that,"" she says. ""Let's get to the real root as to why women feel they have to have an abortion in the first place.""
Image Copyright newwavefeminists newwavefeminists Report Image Copyright newwavefeminists newwavefeminists Report Ms Herndon-De La Rosa says she had to fight to continue her own education when she became pregnant at 16.
In her view, abortions ""help society not adequately meet the needs of women"" by promoting the idea that women cannot have children and be successful in other aspects of their lives.
What about the other side? Reverend Marie Alford-Harkey says the right to have an abortion goes hand in hand with the right to follow one's own values and morals.
Rev Alford-Harkey, who is a Christian pastor and the president and CEO of the Religious Institute, a national multi-faith organisation working for sexual, gender, and reproductive justice, says the notion of reproductive justice, a term created by black women in the 1990s, is behind her pro-choice views.
""It's the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, to have children, to not have children, to parent in safe and sustainable communities,"" Rev Alford-Harkey explains.
""Justice is a very Christian concept, and this particular framework grew out of communities that were not being served.""
Rev Alford-Harkey recently began working as an abortion doula, accompanying women into the exam rooms, speaking with them before, after and sometimes even during the procedure.
""I've been asked once or twice if I think God would forgive them and I say, I don't think there's anything for God to forgive. What I think is a sin is that we've taught people that God won't forgive them for doing what's best for their own bodies, their own lives.""
Women fear abortion rights under threat On the battle lines over US abortion Rev Alford-Harkey says viewing abortion as an issue rather than focusing on the human needs has exacerbated the problems.
""What is most resonant for me is the great variety of people I've seen [as a doula] - from a woman who I'm pretty certain was being abused by the person who impregnated her, to a woman who was barely out of high school and knew she couldn't care for a child, to a woman who had three children and knew she couldn't care for another.""
Image copyright The Washington Post via Getty Images Image caption An abortion doula speaks with a patient at a clinic in Virginia ""Part of the problem here is there's not equal access to all of the things that people need to be healthy and whole.""
This belief in ensuring equal access and choice for everyone, rooted in Christianity for Rev Alford-Harkey, is why she says there is ""absolutely no good to come of a six-week ban"".
""It's just removing access for people who are already on the margins,"" she says.
But the reverend adds that seeing religious communities speak out about their values has made her more hopeful.
""What's changing with Trump is progressive people with faith are becoming more visible in advocating for our values.
""Instead of just framing the debate of religion versus access to abortion, there's now a more nuanced conversation happening that recognises that there is not one 'religious' position.""

Charity 'Sunshine' Tillemann-Dick: Opera singer with transplanted lungs dies - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48043765,"Image copyright Facebook, courtesy of Charity Tillemann-Dick Image caption Charity Tilleman-Dick performed on stages across the world Charity ""Sunshine"" Tillemann-Dick, a venerated American opera singer who survived two double lung transplants, has died at age 35.
Tillemann-Dick was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension in 2004, forcing her to undergo two emergency lung transplants needed to save her life.
Despite her illness Tillemann-Dick pursued a renowned career, performing her soprano work across the world.
Her family announced her death on her Facebook page on Wednesday.
""This morning, life's curtain closed on one of its consummate heroines,"" the post said.
""Our beloved Charity passed peacefully with her husband, mother, and siblings at her side and sunshine on her face.""
A cause of death was not immediately clear.
Tillemann-Dick lived in Baltimore, Maryland with her husband Yonatan Doron.
She performed across the US, Europe and Asia. Her opera roles included Titania in A Midsummer's Night Dream, Gilda in Rigoletto and Violetta in La Traviata.
The singer took the stage at storied theatres worldwide, including the Rose Theater at Lincoln Center in New York, the John F Kennedy Center in Washington DC and the Palace of the Arts in Budapest.

Though she loved to sing from an early age, cherishing family trips to the symphony and opera, Tillemann-Dick initially thought she might pursue a career in politics.
She would be following in the footsteps of her grandfather, Tom Lantos, a Holocaust survivor who served as a Democrat in the House of Representatives for almost 30 years, and an older brother, Tomicah Tillemann, who worked as a speech writer for Hillary Clinton.
""That's kind of our family trade I suppose,"" Tillemann-Dick said of politics in an interview with BBC World Service in 2013.
But after graduating from college and spending time on a few political campaigns, she made the choice to return to music.
Soprano Who Had Two Lung Transplants Genes found for deadly heart condition Obituary: Andrea Levy ""I decided I could never forgive myself if I didn't try my hand at music"", she told the BBC.
Tillemann-Dick began an intensive training programme at the renowned Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, Hungary.
The diagnosis At age 20 she was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, a rare disease marked by extreme pressure on the heart with no apparent cause.
The condition had caused Tillemann-Dick's heart to swell three and a half times beyond its normal size.
The diagnosis provided an explanation for her recent fainting spells and shortness of breath, and carried a life expectancy of two to five years.
Tillemann-Dick had said that one of her doctors told her she should stop singing for her condition.
Hoping to avoid a lung transplant, Tillemann-Dick was prescribed Flolan, a liquid medication delivered directly to the heart through a tube in her chest.
Image copyright Facebook, courtesy of Charity Tillemann-Dick Image caption Tillemann-Dick lived with her husband in Baltimore The pump, along with the necessary ice packs and auxiliary equipment, weighed about 4lbs (2kg), Tillemann-Dick told the BBC.
Not wanting to draw attention to her condition as she continued to audition and perform, Tillemann-Dick said she would strap her medication to her thigh.
""Sopranos are unpredictable enough, without critical illness,"" she said,
In 2009, five years after the initial diagnosis, Tillemann-Dick received her first double lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
Though the transplant was life-saving, Tilleman-Dick said she was very concerned about the surgery, particularly its impact on her voice.
""I had spent a lifetime training my body and my lungs and my voice to work in sync and I knew I would lose all of that,"" she told the BBC.
The brutal surgery put Tillemann-Dick in a coma for over a month, unable to breathe on her own for almost two months.
Eating, walking and talking came next before Tillemann-Dick finally tried to sing again.
The first song she tried, she said, was Smile - made famous by Nat King Cole.
A career beset by illness The average lung transplant lasts for about five years, but Tillemann-Dick's body began to reject the transplanted organs just months after surgery.
As she awaited another donor match, doctors told her family that Tillemann-Dick was unlikely to survive, according to the Washington Post .
But as she waited, Tillemann-Dick continued to sing.
In 2011, still without functioning lungs, she debuted at Lincoln Center's Rose Theater. As she sang, Tilleman-Dick had an oxygen tank and wheelchair waiting in the wings.
""I could barely breathe but I could still sing"", she told the BBC. ""It was a miracle.""
In January 2012, she underwent her second double-lung transplant, from a middle-aged Honduran American woman.
Tillemann-Dick became close friends with her donor's daughter, Esperanza Tufani.
Image copyright Facebook, courtesy Charity Tillemann-Dick Image caption Tillemann-Dick's debut album, American Grace, reached number one on the traditional classical charts on Billboard upon release Second Act Apparently undeterred by her illness, Tillemann-Dick continued to pursue her career, singing with a new pair of lungs.
Her debut album, American Grace, reached no 1 on Billboard's traditional classical charts upon its release in 2014.
Tillemann-Dick's dedication to music was perhaps matched by her advocacy work.
She was a national spokeswoman for the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, working to raise awareness, increase federal research funding and promote preventative medicine.
Tillemann-Dick also shared her inspiring story with audiences across the US, including at numerous TED Talks.
""It was so many miracles that paved this most unexpected of paths"", she said to the BBC.
In 2015, Tillemann-Dick was confronted with another health problem.
She was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive skin cancer, thought to be a result of the anti-rejection drugs she had taken for her lungs.
Treatment required chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, including a particular procedure that required cutting a nerve on her face, affecting muscle movement on the right side of her mouth, the Washington Post reported .
""Life is full of death. Music, full of sorrow"", Tillemann-Dick wrote in her 2017 book, The Encore: A Memoir in Three Acts.
""Great artists have always amplified both."""

How much screen time is too much for babies and young children?
The World Health Organization has advised parents that under-twos should not spend any time passively watching screens.
Children aged two to four should not spend more than an hour a day watching programmes or playing computer games, it also says.
But are such guidelines helpful? BBC Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes asked parents about their experiences.

The electric car and battery maker said it would return to profit in the third quarter.
It ended March with $2.2bn in cash, a reduction of $1.5bn in three months, largely down to it repaying a $920m bond.
The firm said it still plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.
""As the impact of higher deliveries and cost reduction take full effect, we expect to return to profitability"" in the third quarter ""and significantly reduce our loss"" in the second quarter, the company said in a statement .
""Given the less than glowing trend for profitability in car manufacturing, it's perhaps no surprise the company has sought to turn attention back to technology and other potential sources of revenue,"" said Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Yesterday, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said he expected the firm to have self-driving ""robotaxis"" on the road by 2020.
The entrepreneur made the pledge as he announced an improved microchip for its driverless vehicles.
Mr Musk told investors he expected regulators to approve ride-hailing in some areas for autonomous vehicles.
He added: ""I feel very confident in predicting autonomous robotaxis next year."""
"Measles: 500,000 UK children missed jab - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48039524," Jilly Moss's one-year-old daughter contracted measles weeks before she was due to be vaccinated The mum of a baby who had measles so severely that ""her eyes were swollen shut for four days"", says ""parents should know what can happen to vulnerable babies"".
Jilly Moss's daughter Alba spent eight days seriously ill in hospital.
She was not old enough to have had the first dose of the MMR vaccine.
More than half a million children in the UK missed out on the vaccine between 2010 and 2017, the children's charity Unicef says.
Globally, 169 million children did not receive the first dose of the measles vaccine over the same seven-year period.
There have been more than 110,000 measles cases worldwide in the first three months of 2019 - a rise of 300% compared to last year, World Health Organization figures show.
It comes as NHS chief Simon Stevens warned that people rejecting vaccines was a ""growing public health time bomb"".
'Absolutely terrifying' Alba, who is now one and over the worst, was unwell for a couple of weeks with a high temperature and rash, before it spread and covered her entire body.
At one point, after deteriorating in hospital in south London, Jilly did not think her daughter would survive.
""It was absolutely terrifying to watch her go through that and be so helpless.
""She didn't know what was going on and it was heartbreaking to see,"" she says.
Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs, eyes and brain. In one in 25,000 cases, brain complications can be fatal.
Image copyright JILLY MOSS Image caption Alba Moss developed a rash with measles that covered her whole body Babies and children with weakened immune systems are most at risk of complications - more common ones include diarrhoea and vomiting, lung infections and fits caused by a fever.
Millions of lives worldwide have been saved by the measles vaccinations given to young children - but too many are still dying, Unicef says.
Health experts say children should have two doses of the vaccine to fully protect against the disease.
In many countries, including the UK, the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella (or German measles).
the first dose is given to babies around their first birthday the second dose before starting school, when three to four years old Global problem But, according to Unicef, a mixture of complacency, misinformation, scepticism about immunisations, and a lack of access to jabs has led to inadequate vaccination rates globally.
It estimates that between 2010 and 2017:
The US topped the list for the number of unvaccinated children in high-income countries, with 2,593,000 missing the first dose of the vaccine The comparable figure for France was 600,000 The UK came third, with 527,000 children not getting their first dose of the vaccine over the seven-year period In Nigeria, four million children under one did not get the first dose of the vaccine The figures are based on Unicef and World Health Organization estimates of the number of children immunised against diseases in 194 countries in 2017.
Figures for the second dose of the measles vaccine ""were even more alarming"", Unicef said.
It found 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had not introduced a second dose, putting more than 17 million infants a year at a greater risk of getting measles as a child.
In 2017, 85% of children worldwide were vaccinated with the first dose but only 67% with the second dose of the measles vaccine, Unicef says.
 ""My daughter's life was destroyed by measles"" 'Wake-up call' Henrietta Fore, executive director at Unicef, said: ""The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children.
""If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries alike.""
Prof Beate Kampmann, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the figures as a ""wake-up call.""
She said: ""One thing is certain though: A single person with measles will be able to infect 90 other people who are not immune.
""Measles is highly infectious, even before the typical rash appears, so you cannot simply 'keep away'.
""We must protect children and communities against this potentially very serious but entirely preventable infectious disease - and the only way to do that is through vaccination.""
Anti-vaccine views wrong - chief doctor Measles cases hit record high in Europe Global measles resurging, WHO warns Measles - the disease that returned from the past Public Health England said though the overall risk to the public in England was low, unimmunised people were in danger of catching the disease while outbreaks continued in Europe.
 Why has there been a measles outbreak in Europe? Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease so far this year, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people.
Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, while a spike in case numbers has been reported in the US and Thailand.
In Greater Manchester, more cases have been recorded this year than in the whole of the previous two years combined .
NHS chief Simon Stevens has warned that ""vaccination deniers"" have been gaining traction on social media , leading to the spread of misleading information.
The Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, has called for new legislation to force social media companies to remove content promoting false information about vaccines."
Kim Jong-un to meet Vladimir Putin for Vladivostok summit - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48047279,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Putin and Kim toast at the summit in Vladivostok Russian President Vladimir Putin has said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs international security guarantees if he is to end his nuclear programme.
Such guarantees would need to be offered within a multinational framework, he added, following talks near Vladivostok in Russia's far east.
Mr Kim praised the summit as a ""very meaningful one-on-one exchange"".
Mr Putin said North Korea's leader was ""fairly open"" and had ""talked freely on all issues that were on the agenda"".
The meeting followed the breakdown of talks between the US and North Korea in February, when Mr Kim met US President Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi.
Those talks reportedly stalled over North Korea's demand for full economic sanctions relief in return for some denuclearisation commitments - a deal the US was not willing to make.
What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Speaking after the talks on Thursday, Mr Putin said he wanted to see full denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula.
But he said this could only be achieved through respect for international law.
""We need to restore the power of international law, to return to a state where international law, not the law of the strongest, determines the situation in the world,"" he said.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russky Island lies just off the mainland Mr Kim greeted Russian officials warmly when he arrived in Russia on Wednesday.
The North Korean leader was entertained by a brass band in Vladivostok before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards, who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed.
What do we know about the summit? According to the Russian presidential spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the peninsula.

""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Wednesday.
""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas.""
What do both sides want? This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of the talks with the US.
The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Earlier this month North Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks , accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him.
The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, and for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula.
North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined.
Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state.
Big smiles and beetroot By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Vladivostok
This summit was held right in the middle of a college campus, but no classes were cancelled. The students clearly weren't expected to stage protests.
Small groups gathered to watch and film on their phones instead as first Vladimir Putin - some 35 minutes late - and then Kim Jong-un - even later - swept up the sports hall in their limousines. A sniper was poised on the roof; plain-clothed security officers dotted all around.
Inside, though, the tone of this first meeting was deliberately positive: the red carpet rolled out, then big smiles, firm handshakes and warm words. It was a show of support by Russia meant to tell Donald Trump that his tactics of pressuring and threatening Pyongyang are mistaken.
There was no joint statement or road map at the end of it all. But instead of collapse - like in Hanoi - this meeting ended in a champagne reception with the two leaders and their delegations serenaded by a Cossack choir as they tucked into beetroot soup and reindeer dumplings.
How close are Russia and North Korea? During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons.
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally.
Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture.
While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

Rahul Gandhi: Can India's Congress leader unseat PM Modi? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47978944," Image caption Rahul Gandhi (centre) received a tumultuous welcome during his road show in Amethi India's main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was all but written off after his crushing defeat in the last elections. But he has energised a struggling Congress party and increasingly set the agenda with a combative campaign. The BBC's Geeta Pandey visits his constituency to assess whether he can unseat the prime minister this time.
The main roads in the small town of Amethi were choked with supporters when Rahul Gandhi turned up to file his nomination papers last week.
Mr Gandhi - smiling and waving on an open truck, accompanied by his sister Priyanka - was greeted all along the 3km route to the district collector's office by party workers. Many waved flags, others carried their photographs and town residents showered them with rose petals.
A man in a horse costume danced to drum beats, a brass band played welcoming tunes and groups of supporters ran alongside the convoy shouting slogans in his support.
""Mr Modi's days are numbered,"" says Mustaqim Ahmed, who has travelled 125km (78 miles) from his village with his 12-year-old son to see the Congress chief.
Anokhelal Tiwari, a resident of Amethi, adds: ""Wait and see, once the votes are counted on 23 May, Mr Modi will known as the ex-prime minister of India. The Congress will form the next government and 'Rahul bhaiya [brother]' will become the prime minister.""
Image caption Mustaqim Ahmed (left) and Anokhelal Tiwari (second from left) are loyal Congress party supporters It's a dream Mr Gandhi's supporters in Amethi have had for a long time. In fact, ever since he made his political debut 15 years ago.
The 48-year-old is a three-term MP from this town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. He is now seeking a fourth term. This time though, he's also standing in Wayanad in the southern state of Kerala - leading to the BJP alleging he's scared of losing Amethi to their candidate Smriti Irani, who put up a tough fight in 2014. Congress leaders have defended the move, saying it will help widen their base in the south.
I followed Mr Gandhi's campaigns closely in 2004, 2009 and 2014 - and each time I was told by supporters they were electing the PM, not an MP. That sentiment is now being echoed in Wayanad too, says my BBC Hindi colleague Imran Qureshi, who's covering the election there.

His great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the first prime minister of independent India, his grandmother and father also served as prime ministers, while his mother, Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, was the Congress chief until poor health forced her to hand over the reins to her son 16 months ago.
Even before that, there never was any doubt that he was being groomed for the top job. In 2013, he was elevated to the second most senior position in the party and campaigned extensively in the 2014 general election.
Image caption Young men played drums to welcome Mr Gandhi to Amethi So when Congress suffered its most humiliating defeat that year, winning just 44 seats in the 545-member parliament, his political career hit rock bottom.
For a while after that, nothing seemed to be going right for him or the Congress.
The party faced electoral setbacks in several state elections; he was seen as ""remote and inaccessible"" and critics and rivals ridiculed him on social media as a bumbling, clueless leader prone to gaffes. Narendra Modi, who comes from a humble background, repeatedly criticised him for rising to the top not on merit, but because of belonging to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.
But then things began to change: Mr Gandhi started to emerge from the shadows, his social media campaigns became smarter and he began arguing convincingly about the government's controversial currency ban, a lack of employment opportunities, growing intolerance in the country and the slowdown in the economy.

Senior journalist Aarthi Ramachandran, author of a 2012 book on Mr Gandhi, says he's displayed leadership potential on the campaign trail by consistently taking a stand against Mr Modi , demanding answers from the government on alleged corruption in the Rafale fighter jet deal and arguing forcefully that the currency ban hit people's lives hard.

The fight over the Indian baby born in a bank queue ""The political acumen he's displaying now was largely absent from his politics earlier,"" she says, adding that his ability to speak too is ""vastly improved"".
""He does these meetings in colleges and universities with young people, he tells them, 'ask me whatever you want'. He connects very well with them. In the parliament too, rather than reading out prepared speeches, he speaks extempore, with confidence.
""He's come into his own, worked hard over a period of time on acquiring skills.""
 Image caption The Congress party has promised to give cash handouts to 50 million poor families if elected to power In recent weeks, there's also been a lot of chatter about the party's minimum income guarantee scheme that promises to give cash handouts to 50 million poor families if the Congress is elected to power. One analyst described it as a ""perfect disrupter"" which could help the party improve their election tally.
It was certainly well-timed - the scheme was announced just as pollsters began suggesting that India's air strikes in Pakistan may help the BJP to victory. The announcement brought the conversation back to poverty and lack of jobs and made the BJP fairly uncomfortable.
But it's not going to be a game-changer in 2019, says Prof Sanjay Kumar of research organisation CSDS (Centre for the Study of Developing Societies).
Why does PM Modi follow trolls on Twitter? ""It's come a bit too late. Also, the party doesn't have the communication skills or the resources to take it to the people.""
The Congress party, Prof Kumar says, faces multiple disadvantages.
""Their leaders don't have the language skills, they are carrying huge baggage because many in the majority community believe that Congress follows the policy of minority appeasement and when they question the government's honesty and accuse it of corruption, not many are ready to buy that because the Congress have had so many corruption allegations against them in the past.""
Image caption Many of Mr Gandhi's supporters in Amethi believe that they are electing the PM, not an MP The biggest disadvantage though, he says, is that it's not just their support base that's eroded - they also lack the party workers required during an election.
""So I won't put my money on the Congress now,"" he says. ""But that doesn't mean that there is no future for the Congress. Losing one or two elections doesn't mean a party has no future. Remember the 1984 elections when the BJP was reduced to two seats? And it bounced back to 282 in the last election.""
Several Congress leaders, too, have hinted that 2019 is really not a ""do-or-die"" battle for the party and that 2024 is perhaps a much more realistic goal.
In 2004, just as Mr Gandhi had embarked on his political career, I caught up with him during his campaign in Amethi and asked him to assess his chances.
""You win some, you lose some. Maybe I'll win this, maybe I won't,"" he'd said.
I then asked him what he would do if he lost.
""Just because you lose one battle doesn't mean you turn around and close shop and say, 'I can't do anything.' If I lose the election, would I say let's pack our bags and go home? No, no, no.""
So in his own words, he's in it for the long haul. Don't write him off yet.

Russia is currently home to thousands of North Korean migrant workers whose future remains in the balance - UN sanctions passed in 2017 require them to leave by the end of this year.
Both the workers and the companies that employ them are watching to see if progress on the diplomatic front might open a way for them to stay.

Many of the tables are pushed together to accommodate big groups.
""Is today a North Korean holiday?"" I ask the waitress. ""No,"" she says in faltering Russian. ""It's just an ordinary day.""
The staff at Koryo are just some of the 8,000 or so North Korean migrants employed by businesses across Russia.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is in Russia but the two countries already have a long relationship This latest figure was confirmed recently by Russia's Foreign Ministry and it marks a significant drop on the up to 40,000 who were working in the country until two years ago.
The majority have been forced to leave in order for Russia to comply with UN international sanctions prohibiting the employment of North Koreans because of the North's nuclear programme.
Since the UN sanctions resolution - which came into effect in September 2017 in response to a North Korean missile test - the only North Koreans who have been able to come to Russia to work are those whose employment contracts were signed before that date, the Ministry of Labour press office told BBC Russian.
According to Ministry of Labour statistics, more than 85% of North Korean migrants work in construction.
The rest are involved in a range of jobs from garment work and agriculture, to logging, catering and traditional medicine.
For poverty-stricken North Koreans landing a job in Russia is a dream ticket, said Professor Andrey Lankov, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Kookmin University.
""It's impossible to find a job in Russia without paying a bribe [in North Korea].""

In a well-documented case in 2015, immigration officials in Nakhodka in Russia's Far East found three highly-qualified North Korean agronomists clearing snow on the roads.
Their employers - a Russian-North Korean company - claimed it was a one-off departure from their main job monitoring the harvest, but the authorities were unconvinced. All three were deported.
According to Russia's labour ministry, North Koreans are paid on average $415 a month, 40% less than the average salary in Russia.
""You have to hand over half your pay to the [North Korean] state,"" Prof Lankov told BBC Russian.
""But what's left is still far more than you could earn at home.""
Life in North Korea Tourists swell Pyongyang marathon turnout North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis What it's like to 'vote' in North Korea Rape and no periods in North Korea's army Russian companies wishing to employ North Koreans must apply to the Ministry of Labour for a ""quota"" and permission to employ a foreign worker costing the equivalent of about $200 per person.
Many are in the Russian Far East where Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin are meeting this week.
With local populations shrinking, it's a region with a labour shortage, but despite this sanctions have had an impact on the numbers of North Korean workers. Last year a quota of 900 was issued, a big drop on previous years.
Labour ministry figures for 2018 showed North Koreans were working all over the country, with 40% of all licences issued to businesses in Moscow and St Petersburg regions.
In St Petersburg it was widely reported that North Korean construction workers were involved in building a football stadium for last year's World Cup.
Another St Petersburg company, the BTC Group which makes uniforms for the Russian army, had a licence to employ 270 North Koreans in 2017 - although a spokesman denied any had actually been offered jobs. In 2018, BTC applied for licences to employ Vietnamese workers instead, according to labour ministry data.

And in Sverdlovsk in the Ural region, there were even six North Korean trainers working at a factory table-tennis club in 2017.
The largest employers of North Koreans in Russia are North Korean-owned companies.
Data from Russia's Spark business information system suggests there were about 300 registered to operate by the beginning of 2018.
More than half are involved in construction, like the Enisei company in Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, which recently built a new prison.
The national airline, Air Koryo, is registered to operate flights from Vladivostok, and there's also branch of the North Korean Foreign Trade Bank. Neither responded to BBC calls this week.
Image caption Some 8,000 North Koreans are employed in businesses across Russia The majority of North Korean companies in Russia are owned by private individuals.
It's a sign, says Andrey Lankov, of how decentralised North Korean business has become.
""The Foreign Trade Ministry is at best a first among equals, but ministries, departments, parties, small organisations and entrepreneurs can also start businesses abroad.
""The owner of a private company could be a government official, someone from the security services, or just a North Korean entrepreneur with money and good contacts.""
The UN sanctions have been very unwelcome news for many businesses in Russia.
In Vladivostok, on the Pacific Coast, the Yav-Stroi construction company used to be one of the biggest employers of North Korean migrants, with licences for 400 in 2017.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption North Koreans staff a route from Vladivostok ""We can't manage without migrants,"" a company spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC soon after sanctions were introduced.
In Moscow the Eastern Medicine Clinic used to employ 10 North Korean doctors. In 2018 the quota was reduced to just four.
""If they have to leave our patients, many of whom are disabled children, will lose their treatment,"" then director Natalya Zhukova told the BBC when sanctions were introduced.
The UN sanctions also prohibit joint ventures, but there have been some exceptions.
Rasonkontrans was given special exemption in the UN resolution - it's a high-profile Russian-North Korean company involved in a major rail and port project in the Russian Far East.
It's clear Russian officials would like to find ways to ease the sanctions against North Korea.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This stadium in Saint Petersburg is said to have been built with the help of North Korea labour At a rare summit with his North Korean counterpart in Moscow in April 2018, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the two sides had discussed ways to boost economic ties while complying with the UNSC resolution.
""The possibilities to do so exist,"" he said.
This month a delegation from Russia's parliament visited North Korea with very much the same aim in mind.
""We are neighbours, we are bound by friendship and great victory, and we must help each other,"" MP Kazbek Taysaev told the BBC after the visit.
""Especially because of the sanctions imposed on North Korea for the past 70 years, and the sanctions under which our country now finds itself. We are soul mates.""
Back at the Koryo restaurant in Moscow the staff are reluctant to talk to the BBC about what the future will hold.
But diners looking for a taste of North Korea might be advised to take the chance while they still can.

"Scrap 'outdated' free TV licences for over-75s, peers say - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48046595,"Image copyright Getty Images ""Outdated"" age-specific benefits for older people should be replaced with support for the young to ""deliver a fairer society"", say peers.
The Committee on Intergenerational Fairness urged ministers to focus on housing and training, rather than benefits like free TV licences.
Committee chair Lord True said failing to rebalance policies could risk the ""strong bond"" between the generations.
But campaigners warned against changes, saying pensioner poverty was rising.
How housing has divided the young Free TV licence recipients 'richer' Tax over-40s for old age care, say MPs The committee - made up of Labour, Tory, Liberal Democrat and crossbench peers - issued a raft of recommendations, both to ""retain the supportive relationship between generations"" and to plan for the ""100-year life"" that younger people can expect to become the norm.
Suggested improvements include:
Ensuring local authorities have specific planning policies to meet the housing needs of younger and older people Increasing training funding for young people who don't go to college or university Making sure those who work for the ""gig"" economy - getting paid per ""gig"" - have the same rights as other workers The peers also propose changes to benefits for older people, including:
Removing the triple lock for pensions, which raises the basic state pension by the rate of average earnings increases, inflation or 2.5% - whichever is higher Phasing out free TV licences based on age (currently free for over-75s) and ensuring the government decides on whether to give free licences based on household income Limiting free bus passes for the over-65s and winter fuel payments until five years after retirement age Conservative peer Lord True said: ""Both young and older people recognise the contribution the other makes and the challenges they face.
""However, there is a risk that those connections could be undermined if the government does not get a grip on key issues such as access to housing, secure employment and fairness in tax and benefits.""
'The 100-year life' Image copyright PA Life expectancy in the UK is currently 82.9 years for women and 79.2 years for men.
But with technological revelations, medical breakthroughs and societal shifts, it is thought that an age expectancy of 100 is not far away.
While living a healthy life for longer may appeal, it changes the way governments will need to prepare.
The London Business School says the current life stages of education (between the ages of five and 21), work (22-65) and retirement (65+) will cease to exist.
This means people may need to retrain, work for longer or need more care in their later stages of life.
As a result, many aspects of the government's remit will be affected, such as housing, health, education and pensions, and the committee says its recommendations will help them get ready.
The committee said intergenerational unfairness was being ""exacerbated"" by an ageing population, the 2008 global financial crisis and successive government policies that have failed to consider the issue.
According to its report, many pensioner households are now, on average, better off than their working age counterparts, both in terms of income after housing costs and overall household wealth.
""We are calling for some of the outdated benefits based purely on age to be removed,"" said Lord True.
He said the universal benefits were ""justified when pensioner households were at the bottom of the income scale, but that is no longer the case"".
Image Copyright House of Lords House of Lords Report Image Copyright House of Lords House of Lords Report However, The Centre for Ageing Better warned against ""tinkering"" with existing benefits, saying pensioner poverty was increasing for the first time in a decade.
""This is not about old versus young,"" said its chief executive, Dr Anna Dixon.
""It is about creating a society where everyone, regardless of income or background, can enjoy every stage of life.
""Headline-grabbing proposals like abolishing free TV licences based on age risk distracting from the big structural changes needed across housing, work and communities.""
But David Sinclair, director of the International Longevity Centre, said policymakers had failed the young.
He said: ""Our approach to public policy at the moment risks pitching younger against older people and inadvertently and unhelpfully undermining the intergenerational contract.
""Today's young are tomorrow's older people.""

Based in Aberdeen, ScotSTAR (North) will be on hand to respond to patients involved in serious accidents, and those who are in remote locations.
A neonatal and paediatric team has already been in place.
However this is the first time the air and land transfer service will be available for adults in the north.
The team will initially focus on adult critical care retrievals from Shetland, Orkney and Wick.
Doctors have been recruited to respond to calls, so more advanced care can be offered at the scene.
ScotSTAR already serves other parts of the country.
Dr Alastair Ross, clinical lead for the north's emergency medical retrieval service, said: ""We are delighted to deliver this service from the ScotSTAR North base in Aberdeen as part of our ongoing commitment to improved patient care across Scotland.
""The team is available 24/7 providing consultant-delivered critical care and safe transfer to definitive care for patients in remote healthcare locations and at accident scenes.""

Why are Chinese fishermen destroying coral reefs in the South China Sea?,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35106631,"Why are Chinese fishermen destroying coral reefs in the South China Sea? By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, South China Sea 15 December 2015 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device What I came across on a reef far out in the middle of the South China Sea has left me shocked and confused.
I'd been told that Chinese fishermen were deliberately destroying reefs near a group of Philippine-controlled atolls in the Spratly Islands but I was not convinced.
""It goes on day and night, month after month,"" a Filipino mayor told me on the island of Palawan.
""I think it is deliberate. It is like they are punishing us by destroying our reefs.""
I didn't take it seriously. I thought it might be anti-Chinese bile from a politician keen to blame everything on his disliked neighbour - a neighbour that claims most of the South China Sea as its own.
But then, as our little aircraft descended towards the tiny Philippine-controlled island of Pagasa, I looked out of my window and saw it. At least a dozen boats were anchored on a nearby reef. Long plumes of sand and gravel were trailing out behind them. Image caption Pale plumes stretch out behind the small boats in the foreground
""Look,"" I said to my cameraman, Jiro. ""That's what the mayor was talking about, that's the reef mining!""
Even so, I was unprepared for what we found when we got out on the water.
A Filipino boatman guided his tiny fishing boat right into the midst of the Chinese poachers.
They had chained their boats to the reef and were revving their engines hard. Clouds of black diesel smoke poured into the air.
""What are they doing?"" I asked the boatman.
""They are using their propellers to break the reef,"" he said.
Again I was sceptical. The only way to see for sure was to get in the water.
It was murky and filled with dust and sand. I could just make out a steel propeller spinning in the distance on the end of long shaft, but it was impossible to tell exactly how the destruction was being carried out.
The result was clear, though. Complete devastation.
This place had once been a rich coral ecosystem. Now the sea floor was covered in a thick layer of debris, millions of smashed fragments of coral, white and dead like bits of bone.
I swam on and on. In every direction the destruction stretched for hundreds of metres, piles and piles of shattered white coral branches. It seemed so illogical. Why would fishermen, even poachers, destroy a whole coral system like this?
Then, down below me, I spotted two of the poachers, wearing masks and trailing long breathing hoses behind them. They were manhandling something heavy.
As they struggled up the sandy underwater slope, through a stream of bubbles, I caught sight of what they were carrying - a massive giant clam, at least 1m (3ft) across.
They dropped it on to a pile near their boat. Next to it lay three others they had pulled out earlier. Clams of this size are probably 100 years old, and - as I discovered later on an internet auction site - can sell for between $1,000 (£665) and $2,000 a pair.
We motored out to a group of much larger fishing boats anchored just off the reef. These are ""mother ships"" to the small poacher boats on the reef. On board the big boats I could see hundreds of clam shells stacked high.
On the stern of each boat, two large Chinese characters spelled out the name, Tanmen.
I'd heard of Tanmen before. It's a fishing port on the large Chinese island of Hainan.
In May 2014 another boat from Tanmen had been caught by Philippine police on another reef close to the Philippines called Half Moon Shoal. On board, the police had found 500 Hawksbill sea turtles, most of them dead.
Hawksbill turtles are critically endangered and protected under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). Image copyright Science Photo Library
A Philippine court sentenced the nine Chinese poachers to a year in prison.
Beijing was furious. The foreign ministry demanded the convicted poachers be immediately released and accused the Philippines of ""severely violating China's sovereignty… by illegally detaining Chinese fishing vessels and fishermen in waters off China's Nansha Islands"".
None of this proves China is protecting the poachers. But nor does Beijing appear to be doing anything to stop them. The poachers we saw showed absolutely no sign of fear when they saw our cameras filming them.
Back on Pagasa, a Philippine marine corps officer told me the destruction of the reef has been going on for at least two years, day and night.
""You men are armed,"" I said to him. ""Why don't you go over there in your speedboat and chase them off or arrest them?""
""It's too dangerous,"" he said. ""We don't want to start a shooting war with the Chinese Navy.""
I still found it hard to understand why these Chinese fishermen, who have a long tradition of fishing on these reefs, are now destroying them.
Greed may be one answer. In newly wealthy China there is far more money to be made from looting and trading in endangered species than in catching fish.
There is another sad fact about what is going on out here.
However shocking the reef plundering I witnessed, it is as nothing compared to the environmental destruction wrought by China's massive island building programme nearby.
The latest island China has just completed at Mischief Reef is more than 9km (six miles) long. That is 9km of living reef that is now buried under millions of tonnes of sand and gravel.

Sainsbury's-Asda merger blocked by regulator - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48048596,"Image copyright Alamy The proposed merger between Sainsbury's and Asda has been blocked by the UK's competition watchdog over fears it would raise prices for consumers.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also said it would raise prices at the supermarkets' petrol stations and lead to longer checkout queues.
Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe said the regulator was ""effectively taking £1bn out of customers' pockets"".
But he said the supermarkets had agreed to end the deal.
Asda boss Roger Burnley said he was disappointed: ""We were right to explore the potential merger with Sainsbury's, which would have delivered great benefits for customers and supported the long term, sustainable success of our business.""
Why did the supermarkets want to merge? The deal would have created the UK's biggest supermarket chain, accounting for £1 in every £3 spent on groceries.
Sainsbury's and Asda had said the planned tie-up would have cut their costs, allowing them to lower prices for consumers across the UK.
Analysts also believed it was designed to help the two supermarkets counter the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl in the increasingly competitive grocery market.
Why was the CMA concerned? But the CMA, which had previously raised concerns about the deal, said the merger would lessen competition at both a national and local level.
Sainsbury's has more than 1,400 shops in the UK, of which about 800 are convenience stores, while Asda has more than 600.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The CMA's Stuart McIntosh says the deal would have reduced competition Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA's inquiry group, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It would reduce competition in supermarkets and online grocery shopping and at the companies' petrol stations.
""We think that is likely to lead to higher prices or other changes which would be unwelcome to shoppers, such as longer checkout queues.""
What concessions had the supermarkets offered? Earlier this year, Sainsbury's and Asda, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, promised to sell between 125 and 150 of their supermarkets to allow the merger to proceed, along with some petrol stations and convenience stores.
They also pledged to bring in £1bn of price cuts for consumers if the deal went ahead, and be held to this by an independent guarantor.
Sainsbury's said the CMA had ignored this offer, and misunderstood the potential impact on competition.
But the CMA said it had conducted surveys of 60,000 of the supermarkets' customers.
""Those promises were based on cost savings which we don't think are likely to be realised. Also those price promises are very likely to be difficult to track in practice,"" Mr McIntosh said."

Police arrested the German father, suspected of killing the two victims.
Locals alerted police after finding the distressed five-year-old boy wandering in the mountains near Adeje, muddy and crying, on Tuesday.
Spanish media say the German mother and boys had arrived to see the father on Monday. He is a resident on Tenerife.
The father was arrested at his apartment, reportedly after a struggle.
The victims appear to have been beaten.
Spain's Socialist government - facing a general election on Sunday - is treating it as a case of domestic violence and has condemned it on Twitter. Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo called it ""a brutal sexist murder"" .
The Canary Islands are especially popular with German and UK tourists.

""It is suspected murder,"" a spokeswoman for the local police (Guardia Civil) told the BBC.
The suspect is being held at a police station in Playa de las Americas, near Adeje, and will probably go before an investigating judge on Friday, she said.

Unable to understand German, Rosi said she had fetched a friend, who then translated the boy's story. ""He said he had escaped, run away.""
The boy is now in the care of the Canary Islands family welfare service, Spain's Efe news agency reports.
The service has contacted a family member, via the German consulate, who is now travelling to Tenerife to meet up with the boy.
But officials are leaving it to the judiciary to decide when the boy can return to Germany, as a criminal investigation is under way.
A Canary Islands government official, Cristina Valido, said ""although we might be tempted to let the boy return as soon as possible to his normal family life in his country, evidently he witnessed an atrocity and probably it will be the judiciary which decides when he can go home"".
Gender-based violence is a major issue in Spain, following some high-profile cases. There was an outcry after five men accused of raping a young woman in Pamplona were acquitted a year ago, in a case known as La Manada (the wolf pack).
Deputy Prime Minister Calvo said 18 women had been murdered by partners or ex-partners so far this year. She condemned the Adeje case, saying ""we must stop criminal machismo"".

Sri Lanka attacks: Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Ethirajan Anbarasan Bbc News,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48048054,"Image caption Zahran Hashim was not widely known in Sri Lanka until this week A young mother of two in the coastal Sri Lankan town of Kattankudy sits in disbelief.
Mohammad Hashim Madaniya has found out that her brother, Zahran Hashim, is the alleged ringleader of a group of suicide bombers who attacked churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, killing at least 250 people.
She says she is horrified by what he has done and fears what could happen next. She has been interviewed by police but is not being treated as a suspect.
It's still not clear if Mr Hashim, who is accused of leading a group of bombers (alleged to include two sons of a wealthy tycoon), is alive or dead.
What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? Wearing a white scarf, Ms Madaniya sits uncomfortably in the humidity of Kattankudy, a predominantly Muslim town overlooking the Indian Ocean.
She is clearly unhappy with the attention that she is getting.
She is the youngest of five siblings and Mr Hashim, believed to be around 40, is the eldest. She insists she has had no contact with her brother since 2017, when he went underground after police tried to arrest him over violence between ideologically opposed Muslim groups.
Since Sunday's attacks, a video has emerged in which a man believed to be Zahran Hashim appears pledging allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State (IS) group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
His is the only face visible among eight men who are said by IS to have carried out the attacks.
Sri Lankan police say there were nine attackers in total, including a woman, and that they were all homegrown. They were described as ""educated"" and ""middle class"" - with one having studied in the UK and Australia. Two were sons of a prominent spice trader who is now in custody, and one of the men's wives blew herself up during a raid on Sunday, killing her two children and several police officers, police sources say.
""I came to know about his activities only through the media. I never thought, even for a moment, that he would do such a thing,"" says Ms Madaniya of her brother.
""I strongly deplore what he has done. Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care about him any more.""
Image caption Kattankudy's Muslims fear reprisals because the preacher came from their town Her brother, a radical Islamist preacher, came to local prominence a few years ago after he posted several videos on YouTube and other social media platforms denouncing non-believers.
Who were the Sri Lanka attackers? The worshipper who blocked a bomber The videos triggered concern among other Muslims, who are a minority in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka. Community leaders have said they raised concerns repeatedly with authorities but were ignored. Officials say they were unable to track him after he went into hiding.
But few would have expected a part-time preacher from a small town in eastern Sri Lanka to be able to organise the deadliest suicide bombings in this war-scarred country's history, attracting global attention and fresh scrutiny of links between local extremists and international groups like Islamic State (IS).
Image caption White flags are hung in Kattankudy to pay tribute to the dead ""We had a very good relationship during our childhood. He was very friendly with everyone in the neighbourhood. But for the last two years, he has not been in contact with us,"" said Ms Madaniya.
It is still not clear whether Mr Hashim had direct contact with IS or if he was a local jihadist who pledged allegiance to the group, which has claimed the attack.
Kattankudy is near the city of Batticaloa, where the Zion Church was bombed on Easter Sunday, killing at least 28 people.
The town, of less than 50,000 people, has now been thrust into the spotlight.
When I tried to find the ancestral house of Mr Hashim, many people were not willing to answer. People were scared to talk about him.
Since the bombings, the Muslim community has been on edge and apprehensive.
""That someone from our area has been linked to the attacks is really a worry for us. We are shocked and upset by it. Our community doesn't support hardliners. We believe in harmony and unity,"" said Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Zubair, the leader of the Federation of Kattankudy Mosques.
During my visit, Kattankudy was shut down in a day of protest against the carnage. Black and white ribbons fluttered along the main roads as a mark of respect for those killed.
Image caption The mosque Zahran Hashim founded had hundreds of followers - but is now empty Mr Zubair said he met the radical preacher several years ago and spoke to him about his Islamic traditions, which differed from mainstream local practices. He said the community abhorred violence and that it was taking all steps to stop young people being radicalised.
Mr Hashim started as a small-time preacher but, his sister said, soon attracted attention and admiration in some quarters because of his teachings.
As his popularity grew. he went around the region preaching Islam.
What is National Thowheed Jamath? 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' After the mainstream Islamic groups refused to allow him to speak to their congregations due to his hardline views, he started his own outfit, the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) in Kattankudy.
He also built a mosque close to the beach and held prayers and classes inside the building. After his controversial hate speeches surfaced on social media, locals say he was expelled from the NTJ. He simply vanished but continued to post incendiary videos from hiding. There is some scepticism locally as to whether he really cut links with the group he founded.
Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene has said that a splinter group emerged from the original NTJ.
Image caption Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Zubair says the community does not support extremists It is still not clear whether Zahran Hashim was one of the suicide bombers.
But one thing seems clear: as the government pointed out, those who carried out the bombings must have had some help from abroad.
During our conversation, Mr Hashim's sister also revealed that her elderly parents had left their home in the same area a few days before the Easter Sunday bombings and that she had not heard from them since.
""It makes me think that my brother could have kept in touch with them,"" she said. The authorities are also trying to trace Mr Hashim's younger brother.
Muslim leaders here maintain that Mr Hashim was an aberration and that their community, like all Sri Lankans, is mourning what they see as senseless attacks.
But the fear of reprisals in this small town is very real.

Sri Lanka attacks: Who were the bombers? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48049149," Footage shows a suspected bomber calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church Two of the nine bombers in Sri Lanka were the sons of a wealthy and well-known spice trader, local police sources have told the BBC.
All but one of the nine have been identified and most came from ""middle or upper middle class"" families.
Sri Lankan officials suspect a previously little-known Islamist group called the National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) but UK officials have told the BBC they think it is highly likely that the Islamic State group (IS) was linked in some way.
Some 32 Sri Lankan nationals are known to have joined IS in Iraq and Syria.
As the sweeping investigation into the Easter Sunday bombings - which hit churches and hotels, killing at least 250 people - continues, here is what we know about the suspects.
Spice trader's sons Two of the bombers were the sons of spice trader Mohammad Yusuf Ibrahim who is based in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo.
One of them detonated his explosives at the city's Shangri-La hotel while breakfast was being served. The other targeted the restaurant at the high-end Cinnamon Grand hotel which is a short distance away.
What we know so far Who were the victims? Children of the Easter Sunday carnage Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack Their father has been arrested and is now in custody.
His daughter-in-law detonated explosives during a police raid at the family's villa on Sunday, apparently to avoid arrest.
Several people, including children and police officers, were reportedly killed in that blast.

""They are financially quite independent and their families are quite stable financially,"" Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said at a press conference on Wednesday.
Former student One of the attackers studied in the UK, officials say.
Abdul Latif Jamil Mohammed visited south-east England in 2006-7 to study but did not complete a full university degree, a senior Whitehall official told the BBC.
He reportedly studied aerospace engineering at Kingston University.
The worshipper who blocked a bomber The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? He later studied in Australia before returning to Sri Lanka.
""I can confirm the suicide bomber had been in Australia,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday. ""They departed in early 2013.""
He added: ""They had a spouse and child visa at that time as well but they had not returned to the country.""
Suspected ringleader Islamist preacher Zahran Hashim, who founded the NTJ but was reportedly later expelled from the group, is suspected of having been the bombers' ringleader. He blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo.
An IS video that was released after the group said it had carried out the attacks appears to feature him prominently.
In the video, he can reportedly be seen pledging allegiance to the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Image caption Zahran Hashim was not widely known in Sri Lanka until this week The UK government believes it is highly likely IS were linked to the bombings although the full extent of the group's role is not clear, officials have told the BBC.
Sri Lanka's Muslim community have said they warned the authorities about him for years prior to the attacks.
""This person was a loner and he had radicalised young people,"" Hilmy Ahamed, vice-president of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, told AFP news agency,
""Nobody thought these people were capable of carrying out an attack of such magnitude.""
Zahran Hashim's sister told the BBC: ""I came to know about his actions only through the media. Even for a moment, I never thought that he would do such a thing.
""I strongly deplore what he has done. Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I'm not worried about him anymore."""
Jonathan Cairns murder: Fresh police appeal 20 years on - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-48050167,"Image caption Jonathan Cairns' parents Hazel and Raymond said it was never too late for someone to provide new information. A fresh appeal for information about the murder of Jonathan Cairns has been made by his parents and police on the 20th anniversary of his death.
Mr Cairns was 18 when he was attacked in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, on his way home from a night out on 25 April 1999.
His body was found in a shallow grave in Loughermore Forest the next day.
A man was jailed for helping to dispose of his body but no-one has ever been convicted of his murder.
Family of murdered Ballykelly teenager turn to Facebook Jonathan Cairns: 'New lines of inquiry' on teen's murder Speaking alongside Mr Cairns' mother Hazel, his father Raymond said it was never too late for someone to come forward to help the police with their investigation into the murder.
He said: ""It's been 20 years, 20 years since our son was murdered, 20 years of living each day without our lovely son, 20 years of living without answers, and without justice.
""He should now be 38 - maybe with kids of his own. We think about him every day. He was always smiling, always happy.
""The people who did this took our son away from us and we don't know why. All of his family loved him and miss him so much. Please tell us what you know.""
Image copyright Cairns Family Image caption Jonathan Cairns' was 18 when he died The investigation into Mr Cairns' murder has involved more than 2,500 witnesses, statements from almost 900 people and 20 searches.
Detectives will be conducting more searches in the area as part of the appeal.
A mobile police station has been opened in Ballykelly village for anyone who wishes to speak with police.
'Intolerable grief' Det Insp Adrian Brown said: ""I believe Jonathan's killer or killers were local to the area and they may have known Jonathan.
""I also believe that people within the Ballykelly community have information which could help solve this case.""
""Jonathan's family and friends have suffered intolerable grief. Their son died a violent death as a result of a vicious beating and we understand their desire to see justice done.
""We are committed to doing all in our power to apprehend those involved in this brutal incident, which went far beyond a drunken assault.""
Det Insp Brown appealed for anyone with information about two men who were seen on the Loughermore Road in the early hours of 25 April 1999 to contact officers.
He said: ""They were in their early 20s, about 5ft 10in tall and one of them might have had auburn coloured hair.
""They have never come forward to speak to police despite numerous appeals which leads me to believe they were involved in the murder."""
"IS conflict: Coalition strikes on Raqqa 'killed 1,600 civilians' - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48044115,"The city fit for no-one
Coalition states - including the US, UK and France - have conducted 34,000 strikes in Syria and neighbouring Iraq since 2014, when IS militants overran large swathes of the two countries and imposed their brutal rule on almost eight million people.
Last month, the coalition-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance captured the last pocket of land held by the jihadists, bringing a formal end to their self-proclaimed ""caliphate"", whose de facto capital was Raqqa. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Raqqa was the de facto capital of the ""caliphate"" the Islamic State group declared
Amnesty and Airwars said that following an unprecedented investigation they had been able to build a database of the civilians reportedly killed as a direct result of US, UK and French air strikes and US artillery strikes carried out in Raqqa from June to October 2017 in support of a ground offensive by the SDF.
Donatella Rovera, Amnesty's senior crisis response adviser, said that IS ""snipers and mines had turned the city into a death trap"" but that ""many of the [coalition] air bombardments were inaccurate and tens of thousands of artillery strikes were indiscriminate, so it is no surprise they killed and injured many hundreds of civilians"".
She added: ""Coalition forces razed Raqqa, but they cannot erase the truth."" Image copyright AFP Image caption Estimates of the number of casualties resulting from the battle vary
Amnesty and Airwars analysed open source information, including thousands of social media posts, to build its database of the more than 1,600 civilian fatalities.
Researchers then spent about two months on the ground in the city, carrying out investigations at strike locations and interviewing more than 400 witnesses and survivors.
They were able to directly verify the names of 641 victims, and there were very strong multiple source reports for the rest, Amnesty said.
The ""Strike Trackers"" project also identified when each of the more than 11,000 destroyed buildings in Raqqa, with 3,000 digital activists from 124 countries analysing more than two million satellite image frames.

Amnesty and Airwars said the coalition had admitted responsibility for 159 civilian deaths during the five-month offensive, but that it had dismissed many of their casualty reports as ""non-credible"".
The coalition had failed to adequately investigate the reports because it did not carry out site visits or interview witnesses and survivors, the organisations added. Image copyright AFP Image caption The immense task of rebuilding the city may take years
A coalition spokesperson told the BBC: ""Any unintentional loss of life during the defeat of [IS] is tragic. However it must be balanced against the risk of enabling [IS] to continue terrorist activities, causing pain and suffering to anyone they choose.""
The coalition ""methodically employs significant measures to minimise civilian casualties"" and ""always balances the risk of conducting a strike against the cost of not striking"".
The spokesperson insisted the coalition took all allegations of civilian casualties seriously and conducted thorough assessments, but if there was not enough information or there was not a coalition strike that matched the time and location then the allegation was closed.
""Amnesty International provided us with 86 new allegations regarding Raqqa, 43 of which had already been assessed as credible and previously reported or were deemed not credible because the allegation did not corroborate with our strike records,"" the spokesperson said.
""We requested that Amnesty International provide us with additional information on the remaining 43 allegations if they have it available so that we would be able to determine whether we could conduct an investigation."" Related Topics"
Police use of irritant spray in Fraserburgh 'was justified' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-48051283,"Police use of irritant spray in Fraserburgh 'was justified' 25 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Police officers were right to discharge an irritant spray in a bid to incapacitate a man at an Aberdeenshire police station, Scotland's police watchdog has ruled.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) investigated the incident which happened in Fraserburgh in November last year.
The 39-year-old man had been arrested after an alleged assault.
A Pirc report said the man had become violent. He was later convicted.
He had been arrested by officers after an alleged assault on two members of the public on 16 November and kicked an officer in the head. 'Little or no effect'
The man was taken to Fraserburgh Police Station and while trying to put him into a cell, he again struggled violently and grabbed hold of a police officer's body armour causing them both to fall over.
The report said he refused to release his grip on the officer and another officer discharged spray into the man's face.
This had ""little or no effect"" and the officer sprayed the man again which resulted in him releasing his grip of the officer he had been holding on to.
The Pirc report found the use of the spray was both ""necessary and proportionate"".
The commissioner said the man was charged with a number of offences and later convicted. Related Topics"

Northampton-based Tricker’s has shops in the town and in London, but the Japanese store is its first outside the UK.
The company was founded by Joseph Tricker in 1829 and has had its Royal Warrant since 1989.
Martin Mason, managing director, said: “If you head into Tokyo, Northampton footwear has a really important place”.
In 2015, Northamptonshire shoemakers were said to be exporting £20m-worth of shoes to Japan each year, an increase of 45% in the five years since 2010.

Mr Mason said that footwear made in the county was “revered” in Japan and seen as a “luxury brand”.
He said that 80% of the firm’s sales were overseas, and that it could open other stores in countries such as South Korea and the United States.
The British Footwear Association, based in Northamptonshire, said the county remained the “shoemaking capital of the world”."

Cyclone Kenneth: East Africa residents brace for deadly storm - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48050859,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Eyewitness captures moment Kenneth hits northern Mozambique A powerful cyclone has smashed into Mozambique, flattening thousands of homes and flooding low-lying areas.
Cyclone Kenneth struck with winds of 220km/h (140mph) barely a month after a previous cyclone killed hundreds and devastated large areas.
Heavy rain continued to fall on Friday, raising fears of more floods.
Authorities have advised people to move to higher ground amid concern that thousands may be trapped in remote villages.
Mozambique was still recovering from Cyclone Idai, which killed more than 900 people across three countries in March.
Cyclone Kenneth had already killed three people on the island nation of Comoros. At least one person has been reported dead in Mozambique after being crushed by a falling tree.
Africa Live: More on this and other stories Cyclone Idai: What the aftermath looks like How prepared was southern Africa for Idai? UN weather experts say it is unprecedented for two cyclones of such intensity to hit Mozambique in the same season.
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also said that no previous records show a cyclone striking the region as far north as Kenneth.
It said a fact-finding mission would examine the ""impact of climate change and sea-level rise on Mozambique's resilience"" to extreme weather.
What's the latest? Winds eased on Friday, but France's meteorological agency said up to 800mm of rain was expected to land on Mozambique over coming days.
Aid agencies say they are concerned about communities prone to flooding and landslides.
The level of expected rainfall is nearly double the 10-day accumulated rainfall that caused devastating flooding in the port city of Beira, further south, during Cyclone Idai.
The UN's World Food Programme said it was working on an ""emergency preparedness plan"" with the Mozambican government and other humanitarian groups.
Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) said 30,000 people had been evacuated from affected areas, and reports from northern Mozambique said many homes had collapsed and the provincial capital of Pemba had lost its power supply.
Kenneth made landfall on Mozambique's northern province of Cabo Delgado on Thursday evening, with wind speeds equivalent to a category four hurricane. Communications with the affected areas were disrupted, obscuring the full extent of the damage.
Thousands remain away from their homes after compulsory evacuation procedures were put in place by authorities.
What is the affected area like? Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there.
That, in addition to warnings by authorities ahead of the storm, could significantly stem losses compared with Cyclone Idai.
But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds, and the area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months, which could complicate humanitarian operations.
Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people.
How ruby smugglers nurtured jihadists in Mozambique What about other countries in the region? Comoros is still reeling from damage caused by the cyclone, which battered the islands with high winds and heavy rains. The winds have caused widespread power outages and damage to homes.
In some southern areas of neighbouring Tanzania, authorities have ordered schools and businesses to close.

Microsoft hits $1 trillion market valuation - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48050105," Image caption Microsoft boss Satya Nadella Microsoft has seen its stock market value top $1 trillion (£774bn) after reporting better-than-expected sales and profits.
The US software giant passed the mark briefly on Thursday, before its share price fell back.
It makes it one of only three US public firms to have hit the $1tn mark, the others being Apple and Amazon.
Microsoft's stock has climbed by about a third in the past year, helped by the growth of its cloud business.
On Wednesday, the firm said revenue rose 14% to $30.6bn in the fourth quarter, thanks to more cloud growth and an unexpected boost for its software.
Net profit surged 19% to $8.8bn.
 Image caption Microsoft also makes money from Bing search engine data It continues the strong performance seen under boss Satya Nadella, who has spent the past five years trying to lessen the firm's reliance on its once-dominant Windows operating system.
Apple and Amazon hit the $1tn mark for the first time last August and September respectively, but both fell back towards the end of the year amid a downturn on global markets.
PetroChina was briefly worth about $1.1tn after floating in Shanghai in 2007, although most of its shares were held by the Chinese government. It is now worth about $200bn.
While the $1tn milestone garners headlines, Microsoft executives have dismissed its importance in the past.

Sri Lanka toll revised down by 'about 100' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48059328,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Security is tight in the aftermath of the attacks Sri Lanka has revised down the death toll from last Sunday's wave of bombings by more than 100, to ""about 253"", the health ministry says.
It blamed a calculation error and the difficulty of identifying victims.
Scores were killed and hundreds injured when suicide bombers struck hotels and churches in Colombo, Negombo and the eastern city of Batticaloa.
Most of those killed were Sri Lankan but dozens of foreigners were also among the casualties.
Nine people are suspected of carrying out the attacks. Police have continued carrying out raids and have issued photographs of seven people wanted in connection with the attacks.
Sri Lanka attacks: What we know Sister of ‘ringleader’ deplores attack The authorities blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ), soon after the blasts but say the bombers must have had outside help.
The Islamic State group said it was behind the attacks and published a video showing eight men but provided no evidence of direct involvement.
In other developments:
Sri Lanka's defence secretary, Hemasiri Fernando, the top non-elected official at the department, announced his resignation on Thursday in response to intelligence failures Sri Lankan police apologised after mistakenly releasing a photo of US-based student activist Amara Majeed as one of the suspects The country's Catholic Church has announced the suspension of all church services Hundreds of refugee Pakistani Ahmadi Muslims, fearing revenge attacks, have been fleeing the city of Negombo, site of one of the blasts Police say more than 70 people have now been arrested The UK Foreign Office is now warning against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ramesh was killed in the blast in Batticaloa Why was the wrong toll given? Sri Lankan Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said morgues had provided inaccurate figures.
Another official, the head of health services, told Reuters news agency there had been so many body parts it was ""difficult to give a precise figure"".
According to the health ministry, all autopsies had been completed late on Thursday and it transpired that some victims had been counted more than once.
BBC World Service South Asia editor Jill McGivering says the revised figure comes as the government is struggling to restore its credibility - amid criticism of its apparent failure to respond to intelligence warnings before the attacks.
It's also battling to counter fake news and false rumours about the crisis, she says. This sudden dramatic change in the death toll is unlikely to help.
The downward revision means this no longer ranks as the deadliest attack claimed by IS.
What is the security situation in Sri Lanka now? At least seven suspects are still identified as being at large.
Fears of further attacks means that Sri Lanka remains a country on edge, with nightly curfews and security forces making sweeps across the nation, in an effort to root out all connections with the attacks.
Over the last few days, a clearer picture has also built up of the bombers, who officials said were well off and well educated and at least one had spent time abroad in the UK and Australia.
Thursday saw offices in central Colombo shut early and workers told to go home as well as a brief lockdown in part of the capital because of bomb scares.
Rumours and false alarms have also been making the rounds over the past few days.
Added to that is the ever-present fear of communal violence and reprisals against Muslims in Sri Lanka.
What about the Muslim minority? Some Muslims in Sri Lanka report feeling fearful and several Muslim organisations have advised worshippers to stay at home for Friday prayers.
In Negombo, a community of refugees and asylum-seekers, mostly belonging to the Ahamdi minority sect from Pakistan, but also including some Christians and Afghan nationals, have been ejected from their homes by landlords.
Ahmadi Muslims identify as Muslim and follow the Koran, but are viewed by many orthodox Muslims as heretical.
This community of refugees fled persecution and had been sheltering in Sri Lanka - human rights activists say they are likely to have been targeted largely for being both foreign and Muslim.
Sri Lanka has a sizeable and centuries-old Muslim population - out of 21 million, just under 10% are Muslim.
During Sri Lanka's civil war they were subject to several brutal assaults, and in the years since there has been sporadic violence against Muslims, largely by Sinhalese Buddhists.
A community in fear Muralitharan Kasiviswanathan, BBC Tamil, Negombo
As of Wednesday, more than 600 Ahmadis had taken refuge at Faizul Mosque in Negombo, one of the five Ahmadi mosques in Sri Lanka.
Most of the Ahmadis were renting their homes from Catholic Christians. Although the bomb blasts happened on Sunday, it was three days later that things got scary for the Ahmadis.
""My home is some streets away from the church. After the attack, the owner of my house was very worried and asked me to be safe somewhere. I am paying 13,000 rupees [£58; $74] for that house. Most of us paid a year's rent an advance. Where will we go now?"" asks 27-year-old Habis Rabba Soaib.
About 800 Ahmadis from Pakistan live here with the help of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. Fearing religious prosecution, they fled Pakistan and came to Negombo and hope to eventually seek asylum in Europe or the US.
Although the Faizul mosque is small, officials are taking care of them and it is being guarded by the army and the police.
More than 5,000 native Ahmadis live in Negombo. Many of them have lived here for years and now own houses and businesses.
""Since we have been here for a long time, nobody is threatening us,"" says one of the Muslim youths who is busy helping the Pakistanis."
Brexit and the economy- the cost of kicking cans,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-47997127,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Whatever else happened with Brexit, a weakened pound and the widespread message that Scotland remains open to Europe - whatever England's up to - should have kept tourism from the continent at a healthy high level.
But it's not looking that way.
Economic uncertainty - not just in Britain but around it - has seen a falling away in numbers, at least at the start of the year. It's obviously not the most important time of year for the industry, but it is increasingly a year-round line of work.
That finding was according to one of the surveys out recently, which was giving us an dashboard of updates on the strange economic goings-on in pre-Brexit Britain. Sharp deterioration
The rest of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey was as you might expect, if you keep across the other headlines: a sharp deterioration in outlook, investment down in every sector other than construction, and orders down.
That was especially so for manufacturing - with the worst confidence levels since 2012 - and even more so for manufacturing exports. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The oil price has broached the $70 a barrel point once again
That reflects problems for the eurozone, which might also help explain the fall-off in visitor numbers. The slowdown across the region has been heading for recessionary territory, so overseas travel may be a discretionary spend people were choosing to do without.
The British economy, having moved from fastest-growing large economy to the slowest, now finds itself having company in the slow lane.
The other significant message from the Chambers of Commerce survey (like quite a few others, it was carried out by the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University) is that cost pressures are on the rise. National Living Wage
The oil price rise has broached the $70 point again, which ought to be good for much of the oil and gas sector, but puts cost into bits of the supply chain for manufacturing, retail and tourism.
And the payroll bill is on the rise. According to the Chambers of Commerce survey, that's most noticeable in retail and construction. (It doesn't cover every sector, but samples Representative ones.) Automatic enrolment for pensions has stepped up substantially this month.
There's the Apprenticeship Levy. And the so-called National Living Wage has seen an index-linked rise.
The change in costs that is most dynamic results from the shortage of available recruits. Average pay was up 3.6% on winter of 2017-18, with inflation pegged just below its 2% target. Image copyright Getty Images
In wage bargaining - if you can still call it that - trade unions and staff associations have the advantage.
And as some push for more or to catch up, it's causing for a more lively environment for industrial action in pursuit of pay, covering offshore workers and staff in airports, teachers and conventional manufacturing, such as Volvo heavy plant factory in Lanarkshire. Sluggish
Despite all the uncertainty, last Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics published another month of frankly astonishing job figures.
The number of Scots seeking work in the winter months was down 8000, to only 93,000, taking the unemployment rate to only 3.3%.
To most economists, that is the kind of rate that counts as full employment, where the survey merely encounters the 'frictional' numbers, as people leave jobs and quickly take up new ones.
There's a regular caveat at this point about the quality of jobs to be had, how they are bunched towards the lower end of the pay distribution, with disappointingly slow progression, even for those taking on promoted roles in managing others. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scotland's unemployment rate currently stands at 3.3%
That was borne out by figures from Eurostat, the official counters of European beans, showing the UK's payroll costs are only just above the EU average.
Of the older 15 members - not including the catch-up states of the former communist east - only Portugal, Spain and Greece have lower wage costs.
That makes for a dynamic economy, but it's also the low-wage economy that politicians told us they wanted to avoid - where low investment makes productivity exceptionally sluggish. Diminishing spending power
And a reminder: even with full employment, it's only through rising productivity that we get collectively better off.
Without that, we're standing still while others scoot ahead, and over time, that is reflected with diminished spending power in international markets.
This is one explanation why the jobless numbers look so strong, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty.
Economic commentators this week seemed to agree that low investment means managers are choosing to spend their money on more people, and on retaining staff, rather than sink scarce resource into less flexible investment in equipment or training, through which productivity can be expected to improve. Image copyright Getty Images
Those familiar folk at Fraser of Allander put out their own periodical assessment of the economy, and pointed to the possibility that such a lack of investment could be backing up, in a potentially good way.
If government and MPs ever get to clarity on future trading relationships with the EU27 and beyond, then the pent-up desire to push ahead with company growth could lead to (slightly) elevated growth rates next year and the one after.
There was a hint of that also from the most recent Purchasing Managers survey. Sighs and cries
From IHS Markit data firm, with Royal Bank of Scotland as sponsor, it was downbeat about recent output, but much more positive about the 12-month horizon.
But if not a managed Brexit, the Strathclyde economists were forecasting a disorderly 'no deal' departure would mean a drop in output of 5.5%, and a contracting economy in the next two years. The orderly variety would also mean contraction.
To business, there was a sigh of relief that Britain didn't topple out of the European Union this month, but also a cry of despair that the can is being kicked further down the road.
While MPs took the week off to recharge and regroup, business was totting up the cost of retaining its supply chain stockpiles, or to replenish those with a shelf-life. That carries cost, in stock and warehousing. Image copyright Getty Images
Graeme Roy, leading the institute at Strathclyde, and with a recent insider's knowledge of the economic team at St Andrew's House, offers the additional observation that while we've been obsessing with Brexit, or getting a budget passed for next year, there are other and longer-term challenges that are getting sidelined.
They include that sluggish productivity puzzle, and in public spending, the bits of the almost permanently-squeezed budget that don't get the political priority afforded to health or schools, which get further squeezed every year.
You can hear the creaking discomfort around the nation's council chambers on a near daily basis. Ministerial headspace
Twenty years after the first Scottish Parliament election, there's an Allander plea for a more strategic approach to the economic policies being pursued at Holyrood.
There's an obvious reason why the economic growth targets set in 2007 by the incoming SNP administration have not been met - things went somewhat awry on a global scale the following year.
But is there evidence of what works? The small business bonus scheme, for instance? It's popular with those who benefit, of course.
But it's expensive, in terms of tax revenue foregone. And for what benefit in alternative investment and company growth by recipients? We don't know.
Unintentional consequences? We don't know about them either, because the Scottish government has chosen not to find out.
At Holyrood, and even more obviously at Westminster, ministerial and civil service headspace seems to be entirely blocked out by constitutional issues - most immediately, Brexit planning and its potential widespread consequences. There's a price being paid in what's not being considered. Related Topics"

Jockey Club braces itself for 'financial challenges' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48058768,"Image copyright PA The Jockey Club, which runs the UK's biggest race festivals, is braced for ""financial challenges"", despite a tenth year of record profits.
Bookmakers have warned that tougher regulations on gambling could hit the racing industry through the closure of thousands of betting shops .
The Jockey Club has estimated the cost to racing could be as high as £50m.
The Club, which stages The Cheltenham Festival and The Grand National made £48m profit last year.
As a non-profit making organisation founded in 1750 and governed by Royal Charter, it ploughs its profits back into the racing industry.
Bookmaker closures would damage the club's own money-making activities such as live coverage of races for betting shops.
The bookmakers levy which supports horse breeding, veterinary science and horse racing through the the Horserace Betting Levy Board is expected to be hit, leaving the Jockey Club to make up some of the shortfall.
Simon Bazalgette, The Jockey Club's group chief executive said: ""Our next set of results will include the first year of the impact of the changes in the gambling sector and we need to be realistic that we're now into a time of financial challenge for British racing.
""If the sport as a whole collaborates, innovates and diversifies, we can come out of the other side in good shape.""
""The Jockey Club will do everything in our power to support the sport along the way.""
Prize money In 2018 the Club contributed £27m to the sport's prize money, which totalled a record £53.2m.
It promised to maintain the contribution from its own resources at the expense of other areas of investment.
Chief executive of Jockey Club Resources, Paul Fisher, said at the time: ""We've had some tough decisions to make and we've chosen to prioritise our contribution to prize money because we know how important it is to racing's participants.
""We will maintain this record contribution from our resources for as long as we can, which comes at a cost to other areas of investment, such as improving our facilities."""
India election 2019: Meeting a 'foot soldier' of the Hindu far-right - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Soutik Biswas India Correspondent,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48020301,"Image copyright Mansi Thapliyal Image caption Sharad Sharma is a functionary of a radical Hindu group Ever since Narendra Modi swept to power in 2014, India has seen a resurgence in right-wing Hindu nationalism. The Indian PM has made it the cornerstone of his ongoing re-election campaign. Soutik Biswas meets a self-proclaimed foot soldier of Hindu nationalism, and explores the forces driving the rise of the far-right in India.
Sharad Sharma was 20 when right-wing Hindu mobs tore down a mosque in his city, triggering one of the worst bouts of religious riots in independent India.
It happened in the fabled city of Ayodhya in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh on 6 December, 1992.
The mob that razed the 16th Century Babri mosque claimed that it was built on the site of a temple destroyed by Muslim rulers. More importantly, they said it was standing on ground believed to be the birthplace of the Hindu god, Rama.
On that fateful Sunday evening, news about the fallen mosque swept the city. Young men carrying saffron flags stood on its broken dome. As dusk fell, a journalist at the site reported, a ""red cloud of dust settled on the rubble"" and all that remained was the ""myth of Hindu tolerance"". The riots that followed the demolition killed nearly 2,000 people across India.
""I was not at the site. I remember people running through the town, returning from the site. They were jubilant, shouting Jai Sri Ram [hail lord Ram],"" Mr Sharma told me when I met him in Ayodhya recently.
He had grown up in the temple-studded city listening to stories of the internecine dispute. Hindus and Muslims have been at loggerheads over the shrine for more than a century.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Right-wing Hindu mobs razed the 16th Century mosque in 1992 Earlier that year, he had joined the Bajrang Dal, a far-right Hindu supremacist group that was mobilising support to build a Hindu temple at the site of the destroyed Babri mosque. The group is part of the ""Sangh Parivar"" or family of Hindu nationalist groups. They are led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), widely regarded as the parent organisation of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Bajrang Dal is officially described as a ""security ring of Hindu society"".
But the group has been accused of burning alive an Australian missionary and his two children and attacking churches, rioting and forcibly converting Muslims . American political scientist Paul Brass wrote that it resembled a ""fighting protection squad for the other [Hindu nationalist] organisations, a somewhat pathetic, but nevertheless dangerous version of the Nazi SA"".
India votes 2019 Can Rahul Gandhi unseat PM Modi? The ancient epic dominating India's election Why jobs are at the centre of the Indian election All our latest election coverage ""At Bajrang Dal, I would hold meetings with officials, and do some organising work. That's all,"" Mr Sharma says.
Four years later - in 1996 - he joined the Vishwa Hindu Parisad (VHP), or the World Hindu Council, which was at the forefront of the demolition of the mosque. Political scientist Manjari Katju describes the group as a ""clamorous and militant sibling"" of the RSS.
Two years later, Mr Sharma was given the responsibility of handling the media and appointed the local spokesperson of the organisation. With time, media interest in the temple appears to have waned. These days, he says, he mostly interacts with a handful of local journalists.
Image copyright Mansi Thapliyal Image caption Ayodhya is a city of 50,000 people with more than 100 temples ""Agitating for the temple is not all we do. We run schools, dispensaries, work with tribespeople all over the country. There's a lot of other work.""
The evolution of the son of a lawyer and a school teacher into a member of a far-right supremacist group was perhaps foretold.
In his early years, Mr Sharma spent a lot of his time travelling with his father, who practised as a criminal lawyer, and wrote articles in newspapers. His grandfather studied engineering in Lahore (now in Pakistan), and worked as a civil engineer in Ayodhya.
Babri mosque: The build-up to a demolition that shook India How the Babri mosque destruction shaped India When he was a student, Mr Sharma would often attend local shakhas or daily meetings held by the RSS. There they were taught lessons on ""nationalism, social science, moral science and history"". One recent evening, on the banks of Sarayu river which flows past Ayodhya, I saw a group of children holding hands, chanting poems and reciting lessons.
""They are children of a shakha. That's how we learnt things here,"" Mr Sharma says.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ayodhya has been a flashpoint since the demolition sparked riots As a teenager, he lived in a city that was rapidly slipping into the politics of grievance, frustration and discrimination.
In 1989, radical Hindu religionists unveiled plans to build a ""grand Ram temple"" where the Babri mosque stood. A coalition of Muslim groups responded with protest marches and rallies. A senior BJP leader launched a nationwide march to the temple. It was, as observers said - a ""full blown campaign of hatred by communalists on both sides"".
Timeline: Ayodhya holy site crisis Q&A: The Ayodhya dispute The same year, Hindu groups raised an appeal to collect bricks embossed with the name Ram and small donations from tens of thousands of villages across India. The bricks would be consecrated and taken to Ayodhya. Firebrand religious leaders and kar sevaks (Hindu volunteers) streamed into Ayodhya to canvass support for the temple.
Myths swirled around the disputed site. In VHP's telling of history, 176,000 Hindus were killed trying to defend the temple upon which India's first Mughal ruler Babur allegedly built the mosque. ""The death figure is absurd and has no basis whatsoever, but to its credit VHP has turned puerile propaganda into popular history,"" says Valay Singh, author of Ayodhya: City of Faith, City of Discord.
Image copyright Mansi Thapliyal Image caption Mr Sharma says Hindus can never provoke violence Mr Sharma remembers it all as a ""very heady time"".
""I was, at once, both inspired and angry when I heard the speeches of the saints and the stories about the mosque. I felt that a historical wrong had to be corrected. We would be on the roads offering food and water to the volunteers who began arriving here from all over India.""
Things came to a head in 1990 when the police fired on kar sevaks near the city for defying a curfew and shoot-on-sight orders, killing several of them.
""That was really the last straw for us,"" he says. ""I was shocked that innocent believers had been killed.
""Bringing down the mosque two years later was a reaction to the killing of our volunteers.""
Ayodhya: Masses gather as Hindu-Muslim dispute simmers In person, Mr Sharma, a masters graduate in Hindi, is unfailingly polite and low-key. His wife is a homemaker who also does social work, and his son is studying to become a lawyer in the bustling state capital of Lucknow, some 135km (83 miles) from Ayodhya. His brother runs a car rental firm. He says he has a few Muslims friends, who ""also want the temple to be built"".
Mr Sharma is a self-professed news junkie, saying his favourite hobby is ""discussing the news of the day with fellow workers and journalists"".
His Twitter feed is more forceful than the man himself: he rails against ""anti-nationals"" and says the election is a ""fight between nationalists and anti-nationals"", a signature riff of Mr Modi's campaign. In his WhatsApp profile picture, he smilingly poses with the powerful BJP president Amit Shah.
Image copyright EPA Image caption VHP led the movement for the Ram temple to be built in Ayodhya The fact that Mr Sharma isn't a star of the resurgent Hindu right doesn't seem to bother him. He's happy to remain a ""committed foot soldier"" and wait patiently for the temple to be built. A few doors away from his workplace, some 350,000 donated bricks bearing the name Ram and carved sandstone pillars are heaped in a ""workshop"". All this will be used to build the temple.
I ask him whether he feels frustrated that the temple hasn't yet been built. The dispute over the site has been fought in India's courts for more than half a century and a solution doesn't appear to be in sight yet.
Tearing down the Babri Masjid ""India fought the British for nearly 100 years to become independent. The Babri mosque came down just 26 years ago. It marked the end of our religious slavery. The temple will be built. We will wait. The people are with us.
""Who knows? Maybe another generation will build the temple.""
Image copyright Mansi Thapliyal Image caption More than 350,000 bricks embossed with the name of Ram are stored in a workshop What about the lives lost in rioting and violence over the temple and the allegations that it was mostly provoked by VHP storm troopers?
""If attacks have happened in the past, it is because historical wrongs had to be corrected. After correcting these wrongs, we can all live together.""
Mr Sharma denies that the VHP has been involved in stoking riots against minorities.
""Hindus can never be rioters. There's no Hindu terror. We never start a confrontation. If our temples are attacked or cows slaughtered, we will react and resist. If we are heavy in number, we will punish the enemy,"" he says.
""We are humans. Things happen.""

Surrogacy: Are babies at risk because of a lack of rules? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Claire Fenton-Glynn University Of Cambridge,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47826356,"Image copyright Getty Images Surrogacy is not a new phenomenon. For thousands of years, women have nominated others to give birth on their behalf.
However, technological advances such as IVF, softening of cultural attitudes and the trend for having children later have fuelled a recent boom in surrogacy.
In the past two decades, it has become a global phenomenon. There are no precise figures on how many children are involved but as far back as 2012 the industry around surrogacy was worth an estimated $6bn (£4.7bn) a year .
In the UK alone, the number of parental orders made following a surrogate birth has tripled from 121 in 2011 to 368 in 2018 . The true number of surrogacy arrangements may be even higher, as there is no obligation to seek such an order.
Hitting the headlines Surrogacy comes in two forms - gestational, where the surrogate mother is implanted with an egg and sperm; and traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate's own egg is used.
The procedure can bring with it great advantages, especially for those who can't have children naturally, by allowing individuals and couples to have their ""own"" child, without going through a long and restrictive adoption process.
In the majority of cases, these procedures go smoothly. But surrogacy's soaring popularity has come at a human cost and stories of potential mistreatment have hit the headlines several times in recent years.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Baby Gammy with his surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, who has raised him For example, the case of baby Gammy shocked the world, when it was alleged the commissioning parents had intentionally left Gammy, who has Down's syndrome, in Thailand, while taking his non-disabled twin sister Pipah home to Australia.
A court later ruled he had not been abandoned , although it emerged the commissioning father had previous convictions for child sex offences, playing into wider concerns regarding the welfare of surrogate children.
Kim Kardashian confirms surrogate pregnancy The corner of Europe where women rent out their wombs Paid to carry a stranger's baby - then forced to raise it Targeting the vulnerable On top of child welfare concerns, there are also examples of surrogate mothers being exploited by agents and kept in inhumane conditions.
Financially and socially vulnerable women can be targets for surrogacy recruitment, attracted by the sums of money on offer. A surrogate in Ukraine, for example, can earn up to $20,000 (£15,507) - more than eight times the average yearly income.
However, there have been reports of poor treatment of surrogate mothers, with some agencies refusing to pay surrogates if they do not obey strict requirements or if they miscarry.
Exploitation concerns have led to many countries shutting down their previously booming surrogacy industries, while last year the UN warned that ""commercial surrogacy... usually amounts to the sale of children"".
Image caption Ukraine has become a popular spot for international surrogacy The rise of 'health tourism' One problem is that legislation around surrogacy varies hugely from country to country, shaped by history, culture and social values.
In some places, like Germany and France, surrogacy is seen as violating the dignity of women, using them as the means to someone else's end. Therefore, the practice is completely forbidden.
Others, like the UK, view surrogacy as a gift from one woman to another, and allow it on an ""altruistic"", expenses-only basis.
Others still, such as California, Russia and Ukraine, permit commercial surrogacy, viewing it as an expression of a woman's autonomy to engage in surrogacy of their own free will.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kim Kardashian is expecting her fourth child, the second to be born via a surrogate Worryingly, some international surrogacy destinations remain unregulated - for example, Kenya and Nigeria.
These huge inconsistencies have led to surrogacy becoming a popular form of ""health tourism"".
If their own country does not allow surrogacy, or places restrictions on it, prospective parents can simply travel to somewhere with more relaxed laws, or more problematically, a country where the practice is completely unregulated.
Recent years have seen would-be parents flocking in large numbers to countries like India, Thailand, Cambodia and Nepal, only for these countries to shut their clinics to foreigners following concerns about exploitation of their citizens.
But as one surrogacy hotspot gets shut down, another pops up in its place.
Legal headaches There are clearly serious ethical issues stemming from the potential exploitation of women in poorer countries, and the dangers of treating children like commodities. On top of this, health tourism can also create significant legal dilemmas.
While some countries recognise the surrogate as the legal parent, others allocate parenthood to the commissioning parents from the moment of birth - a clash of laws meaning children can be left stateless, with neither country recognising them as citizens.
For example, in the 2008 landmark baby Manji case, a child born to an Indian surrogate was left in limbo after the Japanese commissioning parents divorced before birth.
Neither the surrogate nor the intended mother wanted custody of the baby. The commissioning father, who did want the child, was not allowed to adopt as a single person under Indian law.
As a result, it was unclear who the legal parents were, and what the child's nationality was.
If the child does return home with the commissioning parents, the authorities in that home country must decide whether to give effect to the agreement that took place overseas and allow them to become the legal parents in their home jurisdiction.
In most countries, the wellbeing of the child comes first. This means that authorities are often forced to accept the results of the arrangement, turning a blind eye to exploitative practices that may have taken place abroad.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Baby Manji was born in India to commissioning parents who were Japanese Is an international agreement possible? Intergovernmental body the Hague Conference on Private International Law is currently looking into the possibility of forming internationally agreed rules for authorities to recognise the parenthood of children born abroad through surrogacy, and set out consistent rules.
However, it may be difficult to reach international agreement, due to the widely differing attitudes towards surrogacy.
Countries that ban or restrict the practice would be unlikely to sign up to something that allows commercial surrogacy, and vice versa.
More like this
The friends who are good for your brain What do the people of the world die from? Why the world is becoming more allergic This means authorities are left in a very difficult situation: the global surrogacy market has sprung up due to the inconsistency of laws around the world, but it is precisely because of these differences that they are unable to regulate the practice effectively.
Surrogacy can provide the joy of a longed-for child, but at the same time it opens the door for the exploitation of the most vulnerable.
As surrogacy gains in popularity, these legal and ethical dilemmas will only become more pressing. Pandora's Box has been opened and the law has failed to respond.

BBC - Future - An information chain that could end contaminated seafood,www.bbc.com,Justin Calderon,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190425-making-sure-fish-is-safe-to-eat,"Food How to make sure the fish we eat is safe Plastics and chemicals pollute our oceans and contaminate seafood. Now, a new sea-to-plate data chain could track fish from ocean to local shops, clamping down on dishonest labelling. By Justin Calderon 26 April 2019
It has become a new, horrible norm. Our marine life is today being choked by a gathering minefield of plastic in our oceans, and the images make for stark viewing. A rainbow runner fish with a disturbing kaleidoscope of plastic bits in its liver. A mahi mahi fish with plastic bottle caps in its stomach. Or the mussels and clams , the filters of the sea, that harbour hidden microplastics, invisible to our naked eye.
Our first reaction to this news is often disgust. But this reflex quickly gives way to a more sobering thought: the far-reaching impact of the eight million metric tons of plastic pollution that enter our ocean every year. Not just proof of our mounting ecological misdeeds, this catastrophe also directly threatens to poison us where we are truly vulnerable: our plates.
The prospects of such a future impact how we shop for food. Last year, a European shopper survey conducted by the research firm McKinsey & Company , reconfirmed a long-known trend : quality food continues to be more important than price. In other words, shoppers deeply care about consuming safe food, and willingly demonstrate it with their wallets.

The problem is that our modern industrial food network detaches us from any knowledge of our food’s origin. In a strange twist of fate, we have become unfathomably clueless in a world oversaturated by information.
That is all about to change. New technology is now bridging this information gap and returning the power of knowledge to consumers. By cataloguing the long trail of supply chain data on encrypted ledgers, the nebulous world of the global food network will be exposed. Shoppers will soon be able to follow the “story of the fish”– a report card enclosing the product’s original photo, place of catch, initial weight, species type, vessel and crew details, RFID tag number, catch water details and more. View image of Fisherman standing over nets (Credit: Getty Images)
Food sold in this system will be more detailed that most online products we buy, and downright encyclopedic compared to online dating profiles.
The first fish products to be transparently produced and traced – from ocean to point of sale – through these blockchain-enabled ledgers will hit supermarkets in New Zealand and the EU some time this year, says Alfred Cook, a programme manager for the World Wildlife Foundation, who works in the project. The breakthrough comes after a pilot that started in June 2017, supported by the WWF, which hopes that enforced transparency in the supply chain will also prevent fish caught through slave labour from ending up unknowingly in our groceries.
Uniting the siloes of modern food supply chains is one of the best examples of a real-world problem that only blockchain can solve
To ensure no one is buying plastic-laden fish, geolocation information will show the catch was far from populated coastlines, and inspection certifications can be uploaded to demonstrate that the product passed quality checks.
Since the days of Bitcoin’s 2017/18 boom and bust, blockchain technology, the foundation behind cryptocurrencies, has attracted exhausting levels of hype. Today there are countless startups across the globe scouring for ways to apply the arcane ways of decentralised, encrypted ledgers to disrupt businesses large and small. Most are gimmicks.
This one, however, feels different. Uniting the siloes of modern food supply chains is one of the best examples of a real-world problem that only blockchain can solve, and which promises to have an impact on the average shopper sooner than later.
“The traditional supply chain is based on relationships and a complete lack of information from one actor to the next,” says Brett Haywood, the New Zealand managing director of Sea Quest Fiji, the tuna-fishing and processing company involved in the pioneering programme. View image of Tray full of fish (Credit: Getty Images)
“We know what we sell our fish for but we do not know what the next actor gets as a margin. On one hand it is not our business to know what the fish is sold for down the supply chain but on the other hand, we are subject to the inefficiencies of the actors down that chain,” he explains.
“While it has taken more time, the disruption that will be caused to traditional supply chains it is no less significant, as the primary producer can get closer to the end consumer,” Haywood says.
The technological infrastructure for this project has been around for several years, and chances are you’ve already experienced it. Pioneering efforts were made in New Zealand and Australia in 2015 and 2016, and similar projects soon followed, including in Miami .
To do traceability at scale is almost an impossible task – Tyler Mulvihull
These programmes never provided great detail. Using automated identification technologies, such as radio frequency identification tags and 2D barcodes, food retailers provided instant data on product origin to consumers through smartphone applications. But until now comprehensive data of our food provenance has been lacking. Our modern supply chains have had too many isolated moving parts to assimilate.
“An enormous amount of time is spent reconciling information between organisations because everyone maintains their own copy of a database,” observes Tyler Mulvihill, co-founder of Viant, the Brooklyn-based company building the software on the public ethereum blockchain.
Why is this technology even necessary? View image of Bed of oysters (Credit: Getty Images)
“End-to-end traceability is extremely difficult to do without blockchain because you have siloed data systems and if one of those chains break, the entire system breaks down,” answered Mulvihill. “To do traceability at scale is almost an impossible task,” he added.
Yet, conscientiously lifting the veil of a company’s inner workings will not come as a sensible decision to many CEOs. The modern business world does not incentivise greater transparency, and changing the old way of doing things may take considerable time. Just think of any vertically integrated company: airing your product’s more intimate details out in the open will reveal yourself to direct competitors. That is often not the wisest choice.
“The problem is this information is controlled by what the supply chain actors wish to share and there has to be a revolution to change this,” asserts Haywood. “I believe that blockchain technology is the catalyst [to change], creating a relationship (at least knowledge-based) between consumer and primary producer.”
The idea of knowing where your food comes from is a privilege of those who are more or less economically secure – Robyn Metcalfe
Marketing campaigns will pressure change, of course, as shoppers begin to naturally expect more transparency with their food. Yet, while the future will impose greater numbers of companies to connect to publically available ledgers, it must be said that this technology is very much here to solve a rich “first-world problem”.
“The idea of knowing where your food comes from is a privilege of those who are more or less economically secure,” Robyn Metcalfe, director of the Food+City organisation at the University of Texas at Austin. “Many city dwellers are in need of food on a more basic basis and therefore have no basic interest in knowing where it comes from. If we’re only talking about those who are food secure, sure, there are technologies that they have the time and resources to enjoy.” View image of Fish and chips (Credit: Getty Images)
Applications offering food information will abound, she predicts, and they will continue to become more sophisticated by the day.
“Interacting with your food will become a thing,” Metcalfe continues. “This connection doesn’t necessarily mean that people will have more power; it may be that knowing more about your food will be a convenience and in some cases, a form of entertainment.”
In a world where the habitats of our seafood are becoming increasing under threat, such technologies could become a mandatory requisite for quality-sensitive shoppers. But an inundation of new information is no guarantee of an evolutionary shift, as many emerging technologies have often taught us, and such breakthroughs will always depend how well we are educated to use them.

North Korea summit: Kim accuses US of 'bad faith' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48062071," Putin and Kim toast at the summit in Vladivostok North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has accused the US of acting in ""bad faith"" during the summit earlier this year with President Donald Trump, according to the Korean Central News Agency.
He also said peace in the Korean peninsula would depend entirely on Washington.
Mr Kim made his remarks at Thursday's summit with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Vladivostok.
The North Korean leader departed Vladivostok on Friday.
Russian media had reported that Mr Kim would be visiting the city's aquarium and seeing a ballet, however his visit was cut short. It is unclear why.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Kim Jong-un smiles as he departs Vladivostok KCNA reported that President Putin had accepted an invitation to visit North Korea.
The visit would take place ""at a convenient time"", the news agency added.
During the meeting, Kim Jong-un reportedly told Vladimir Putin that ""the situation on the Korean peninsula and the region is now at a standstill and has reached a critical point"".
He warned the situation ""may return to its original state as the US took an unilateral attitude in bad faith"" during recent talks.
It comes a week after Pyongyang accused the US of derailing peace talks.
The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Negotiations between the two countries broke down during a summit in Vietnam in February, with no deal reached over North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Those talks reportedly stalled over North Korea's demand for full economic sanctions relief in return for some denuclearisation commitments - a deal the US was not willing to make.
During Thursday's summit in Vladivostok, President Putin attempted to act as arbiter, saying Mr Kim needed international security guarantees if he was to end his nuclear programme.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Kim travelled on his armoured train Such guarantees would need to be offered within a multinational framework, the Russian leader added.
""We need to... return to a state where international law, not the law of the strongest, determines the situation in the world,"" Mr Putin said.
Mr Kim greeted Russian officials warmly when he arrived in Russia on Wednesday.
He praised the summit as a ""very meaningful one-on-one exchange,"" and said he hoped to usher in a ""new heyday"" between Moscow and Pyongyang.
What do we know about the summit? The two leaders agreed to seek stronger relations. However nothing has been publicly reported about agreements on US sanctions and North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Mr Putin is now attending a two-day summit in China, where he said he would inform China's leadership about the talks. He also said he was willing to share details with the US.
According to Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea are the only efficient way of addressing nuclear weapons on the peninsula.
 Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un meet in Vladivostok Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. They are currently stalled, however.
""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Wednesday.
""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas.""
What did both sides want? The visit was widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of talks with the US.
The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Earlier this month North Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks , accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him.
The summit was also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, and for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula.
North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea President Putin had been eager to meet the North Korean leader for some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin had been somewhat sidelined.
Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state.
How close are Russia and North Korea? During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons.
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally.
Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture.
While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, Mr Kim's regime regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers."

RBS warns of impact of Brexit uncertainty as profits fall - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48062911," RBS has reported a drop in profits for the first three months of the year and warned of the continuing impact of Brexit uncertainty on near-term growth.
The bank, which is 62% government-owned, reported £707m profit, down from £808m for the same period last year.
It said Brexit uncertainty could delay business borrowing decisions and ""is likely to make income growth more challenging in the near term"".
The fall in profit comes a day after chief executive Ross McEwan resigned.
He will remain in the role until a successor has been appointed.
Alison Rose, who was recently promoted to deputy chief executive of the bank, has been tipped as the leading internal candidate to take over from Mr McEwan.
Image copyright RBS Image caption Alison Rose has been tipped for the top job Tougher competition in the mortgage market hit the bank's profit margins in the first quarter. Its investment bank also performed badly over the period, with income down 41.4% on the previous year.
""This is a solid set of results set against a highly uncertain and competitive backdrop,"" said Mr McEwan.
""We continue to support our customers through this Brexit uncertainty while investing and innovating in digital services to meet rapidly changing customer needs.""
RBS shed £45m in costs over the quarter and is on track to take £300m out of the group by the end of the financial year.
It said almost three quarters of its current account customers were now regular digital users.
The bank has been majority-owned by the government since it received a £45bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis in November 2008."

John McCartney, 39, of Eastwood Road, Rayleigh, was arrested after the attack in the Rayleigh area, at about 21:15 BST on Wednesday.
On Friday, Southend magistrates heard he launched a ""targeted"" and ""frenzied attack"" when the alleged victim answered his door.
Mr McCartney was remanded into custody.
He has also been charged with possession of an offensive weapon and will next appear at Basildon Crown Court.
The court heard Mr McCartney had been living in China until he returned to the UK three weeks ago.
Magistrates were also told the alleged victim suffered six stab wounds to the centre of his chest and lacerations to his chest, arm and abdomen.
Essex Police said the victim remained in a stable condition in hospital.

SAS pilot walkout leaves thousands stranded - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48062918,"Image copyright European Photopress Agency Scandinavian airline SAS has cancelled hundreds of Sunday flights as a pilot strike continues, disrupting tens of thousands of passengers.
Pilots went on strike on Friday in a wage dispute, grounding around 70% of the airline's flights and hitting some 170,000 people over the weekend.
""We deeply regret that our customers are affected by the ongoing pilot strike,"" SAS said in a statement.
Some 64,000 passengers will be hit on Sunday as 587 flights are cancelled.
'Real will' ""We believe the unions have to face reality and resume talks,"" Torbjoern Lothe at the Norwegian Confederation of Enterprise, an employers' association involved in the negotiations with the unions last week, told Reuters.
One of two SAS pilot unions in Norway, Norsk Pilotforbund, said it had had no contact with the airline.
And Rawaz Nermany, chairman of the Swedish Airline Pilots Association, said: ""We are waiting for SAS to get in touch and show a real will to discuss the issues that are important to us.""
Pilots in Norway, Sweden and Denmark went on strike.
A total of 670 flights were cancelled on Friday, affecting 72,000 passengers, SAS has said. And cancellations on Saturday affected 34,000 more people.
The pilot walkout comes after negotiations over pay and work schedules - which began last month - broke down.
Most domestic, European and all long-haul flights have been cancelled. The strike does not affect flights operated by SAS partners, which make up approximately 30% of all departures.
Customers who have a flight booked, are advised to check if their flight is affected by the strike .
'Negative consequences' SAS has said it wants to ""reach an agreement to end the strike as soon as possible"", but warns if the pilots' requirements were met it would have ""very negative consequences"" for the airline.
Pilots are trying to secure a 13% wage increase. They currently earn an average of 93,000 Swedish crowns (£7,500) a month.
The pilots' walkout comes against a backdrop of tough business conditions for SAS. It is currently in the middle of renewing its aging plane fleet and faces rising competition from budget carriers such as Norwegian, Ryanair and Easyjet.
The airline reported a bigger-than-expected loss for its first quarter in February, but said it still expected to record a profit for the year."
All the references in Taylor Swift's Me! video - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Mark Savage Bbc Music Reporter,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48063952,"Skip Youtube post by TaylorSwiftVEVO Warning: Third party content may contain adverts Report End of Youtube post by TaylorSwiftVEVO
Image Copyright TaylorSwiftVEVO TaylorSwiftVEVO Report The old Taylor can come to the phone right now, because she's been raised from the dead.
Taylor Swift's new single, Me! shrugs off the icy, vengeful character of her last album, and resurrects the sugary euphoria of her earlier, dorky pop hits.
The song, which features Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco, sees Taylor declaring that, despite all her bad qualities, her partner will ""never find another like me"".
""It's a song about embracing your individuality and owning it,"" the star said.
The video has been watched more than 26 million times since it launched 5am BST; and became the fastest music video in history to reach more than 10 million views - reaching the milestone in just 2 hours.
As usual, the video is packed with easter eggs and callbacks to her previous records. Here are all the ones we could find... If you spot any others, drop us a line on @BBCNewsEnts , or entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk .
The Snake! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc Snakes were a motif on Taylor's last album - as the singer took ownership of the ""Taylor Swift Is a Snake"" meme that pursued her after her break-up with Calvin Harris and her (unrelated) feud with Kanye West.
Symbolically, the snake explodes into a cloud of butterflies at the start of the ME! video, while Taylor survives a snake-bite later on, putting a full-stop on that era.
The melodrama! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc The action begins in an apartment, where Brendon and Taylor are having a major domestic (in French, for some reason).
The scene is a call-back to Panic At The Disco's But It's Better If You Do video, which opens in a very similar way.
Oh, if you're wondering about the tree - Taylor grew up on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania.
Olivia and Meredith! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc Taylor's Scottish fold cats, Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey, are almost as famous as she is... and they get their own cameo in the video, playing the star's ""young daughters"".
""The most influential factor in my life is cats,"" the star recently told Time magazine . ""I have cats, I'm obsessed with them. They're just a real joy to live with.""
The (Dixie) Chicks! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc When Taylor sings "" You're the kind of guy the ladies want - and there's a lot of cool chicks out there ,"" the video cuts to a wall of framed pictures of, well, chicks.
With one exception... In the middle of shot, we see a portrait of country legends The Dixie Chicks.
Taylor, who invited Natalie Maines to sing Goodbye Earl on her 1989 Tour, has been hinting the band will appear on her forthcoming album.
The pastels! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc Taylor emerges from her apartment building into a candy-coloured fantasy world. The pastel palette is part of the branding of her new era (there's even an Instagram filter) signifying how she's emerged from a place of darkness.
The seven suitcases represent her previous albums, and the one that's on the way.
And some fans have also interpreted the colour scheme, and the song's references to rainbows, as a further message of support for the star's LGBT fans; after she donated $113,000 (£86,000) to an LGBT advocacy group in Tennessee, USA.
Sesame Street! Skip Youtube post by LittleJerryFan92 Warning: Third party content may contain adverts Report End of Youtube post by LittleJerryFan92
Image Copyright LittleJerryFan92 LittleJerryFan92 Report On her last album, Taylor interpolated Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy.
This time around, she Quote: s the Sesame Street song ""one of these things is not like the others"".
We're hoping she does the pinball song next.
A chrysalis! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc Eagle-eyed fans have spotted that the entire video takes place inside a chrysalis - continuing the butterfly theme and hinting at a metamorphosis from the sound and lyrics of her previous albums.
Arthouse film references! Skip Youtube post by criterioncollection Warning: Third party content may contain adverts Report End of Youtube post by criterioncollection
Image Copyright criterioncollection criterioncollection Report The pastel colour scheme and elaborate dance sequence could be a reference to Jacques Demy's infectious 1967 musical, Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (The Young Ladies of Rochefort) - which starred Catherine Deneuve and Françoise Dorléac as two sisters who leave their seaside town in search of romance.
Come to think of it, that would explain Taylor's tres mal French accent at the start of the clip.
Brendon Poppins! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc Next up, we have Brendon Urie jumping out of a window, grabbing an umbrella and floating to the ground, like a floral-suited Mary Poppins.
Of course, this could also be a reference to Jacques Demy's other famous musical, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. It's all so multi-layered.
A song title tease? Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc As we arrive at the second verse, Taylor sits astride a unicorn wearing a dress that turns into a waterfall. Your guess is as good as mine on that one - although the outfit recalls Vilanelle's shocking pink Molly Goddard dress from the first series of Killing Eve.
Look beyond that, though, and you'll see a pink neon sign spelling the word ""Lover"".
Fans have speculated this will be the title of Taylor's next song - as the star has a habit of teasing new material in the background of her videos.
An engagement ring! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc In the video for Look What You Made Me Do , Taylor included a shot of an empty engagement ring box and the word ""no"" spelled in jewellery on the floor.
The message is even more explicit here, as Taylor haughtily rejects the ring that Brendon proffers on bended knee.
Fans have theorised that this is a response to tabloid speculation that the star and her boyfriend Joe Alwyn are getting engaged.
A new cat! Image copyright Taylor Swift, Inc Before the video premiered, the star told fans, ""there's a secret in the video I've been keeping in for months - let's see who can guess it"". Could it be that she got a new cat?
UPDATE: Taylor confirmed her new arrival on Twitter later on Friday. He's called Benjamin Button. Awwww.
Image Copyright @taylorswift13 @taylorswift13 Report Image Copyright @taylorswift13 @taylorswift13 Report The lyrical callback! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc This scene, which you'll find about 2 minutes into the video, reflects Welcome To New York - the opening track of Swift's fifth album.
""I have a lyric on an an earlier song that says 'kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats,' so he pulls his coat to the side, there's a heart and it goes through a kaleidoscope,"" Swift revealed in a YouTube Q&A about the video.
The heart motif! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc The second chorus takes place on a set that recalls the 60s pop shows like Soul Train and Ready, Steady, Go - festooned with hearts.
Taylor's dress, her earrings, the piano and even the guitarist's guitar are heart-shaped; while the band are all pink-winged Cupids.
Look closely throughout the rest of the video, and you'll see hearts embroidered into the costumes and scattered across the elaborate sets.
It seems to confirm the theory that the star's new album will pick up where the Reputation album left off - on the love-struck piano ballad New Year's Day .
A, B, C... Image Copyright @ginaswift13 @ginaswift13 Report Image Copyright @ginaswift13 @ginaswift13 Report "" Hey kids, spelling is fun! "" declares Taylor as she launches into the middle 8; a throwback to the time she won her elementary school spelling bee.
The star's first ever post on MySpace was a picture of her wearing the winner's t-shirt, fact fans.
A Super Bowl hint? Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc Taylor unveiled the ME! video on ABC during the NFL Draft (essentially a televised version of the UK's football transfer deadline day); and the clip features her being hoisted in the air by a marching band while wearing a majorette uniform.
That's prompted speculation that the singer will perform the half time show at next year's Super Bowl.
Cowboy boots! Image copyright Taylor Swift Productions, Inc ME! might sound like an off-cut from The Greatest Showman, but Taylor's lead singles haven't always been representative of the songs that follow.
The reappearance of the star's cowboy boots after the electro-pop experimentation of the 1989 and Reputation albums suggests she could be returning to her Nashville roots.
We'll know for sure when the star's album comes out later this year. When exactly, we don't know... but this fleeting glimpse of a clock set to 8:30 has fans convinced it'll be 30 August.

India election 2019: 22-26 April the week that was - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48067522,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption PM Modi is contesting from Varanasi India has entered full election mode: voting began on 11 April, and the final ballot will be cast more than five weeks later on 19 May. Every day, the BBC will be bringing you all the latest updates on the twists and turns of the world's largest democracy.
On Friday, Narendra Modi filed his nomination in Varanasi What happened?
India Prime Minister Narendra Modi filed his nomination on Friday amid huge crowds. He is contesting from Varanasi constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
He travelled to the local district office in a procession of cars that stretched for several kilometres.
President of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Amit Shah, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and several cabinet ministers joined Mr Modi on the roadshow.
Why does this matter?
Mr Modi won the seat in 2014 with a huge margin of more than 300,000 votes. There was speculation that opposition parties would field a common candidate to take on the prime minister in the high-profile constituency.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Modi also led roadshow on Thursday in Varanasi But the main opposition Congress party and prominent regional heavyweights like the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party failed to form a coalition. And on Thursday Congress announced its own candidate for the seat, putting an end to rumours that Priyanka Gandhi herself would run against Mr Modi.
Analysts say the triangular contest will help Mr Modi retain the seat.
Varanasi is strategically important because the BJP hopes that Mr Modi's campaign there will help the party repeat their thumping win in the 2014 elections when it won 71 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh.
On Thursday, Priyanka Gandhi ended speculation that she would run against PM Modi What happened?
The main opposition Congress party on Thursday named Ajay Rai to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Varanasi constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
The announcement ended weeks of speculation that Priyanka Gandhi, the charismatic sister of Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, was going be the party's candidate for the seat.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra connects easily with the voters Mr Modi won the seat by a huge margin of more than 300,000 votes in 2014, ahead of Aam Admi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal. Mr Rai was in the third spot.
Why does this matter?
Ms Gandhi has always been considered the more popular of the Gandhi siblings with many blaming her brother's ""lacklustre leadership"" for a string of Congress defeats between 2014 and 2018.
In previous elections, she campaigned in Amethi and Rae Bareli - the parliamentary constituencies of her brother and mother, Sonia Gandhi, respectively - and is held in high esteem by voters there.
But she formally joined politics only in January after she was appointed the party's general secretary for eastern part of Uttar Pradesh.
India votes 2019 Can Rahul Gandhi unseat PM Modi? The ancient epic dominating India's election Why jobs are at the centre of the Indian election All our latest election coverage Many in the party were hoping that she would be a formidable challenger against Mr Modi. Ms Gandhi herself had hinted that she would contest against the PM if her party asked her to do so.
But the Congress' announcement ended the possibility of a so-called ""mega contest"".
The party gained some ground in recent state elections and Mr Gandhi's stock has risen, but Congress still faces a tough challenge to beat the BJP and regain power.
On Wednesday, Bollywood star Akshay Kumar interviewed PM Modi What happened?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi sat down with Bollywood star Akshay Kumar for a ""candid"" interview, where the two discussed everything - except politics.
It's unclear when the interview actually took place but it aired on the ANI television channel on Wednesday. It was filmed at the prime minister's residence in Delhi.
Image copyright BJP4India/Twitter Image caption The interview was broadcast on Wednesday The ""completely non-political"" - as Kumar put it - conversation led to jokes on Twitter and #ModiwthAskhay was one of the top trends in India.
Why does this matter?
It's surprising because Mr Modi is known to avoid spontaneous interactions with the media. Televised interviews have been rare; and he has not held a single press conference in his five years as prime minister.
The casual tone aside, the interview was not really freewheeling because Kumar steered clear of anything remotely political or controversial.
And it spawned some snarky humour on Twitter.
Skip Twitter post by @sardesairajdeep Whatever else he has done or not, @narendramodi has changed the art of political communication in this country forever.. if he ever loses an election should consider starting a PR/marketing/communications school! #ModiWithAkshay

We learnt a few new things about the otherwise reticent Mr Modi - he ""enjoys"" watching memes on himself; former US president Barack Obama repeatedly advised him to sleep longer; his very own remedy for a cold involves fasting for two days and putting mustard oil in his nostrils; and West Bengal chief minister and arch rival Mamata Banerjee sends him sweets and kurtas every year.
He also said he had never aspired to be prime minister; instead he wanted to join the army and ""serve the nation"".
One user commented on how Mr Modi appeared to have narrated his biography to Kumar considering the Election Commission had held back the release of a biopic on him during the election.

On Tuesday, Shah Rukh Khan urged fans to vote in a music video What happened?
Well, Prime Minister Narendra Modi put out a barrage of tweets on 13 March asking famous Indians to ""creatively"" encourage voting.
And Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan obliged...on Monday, some five weeks later. He said he was sorry for the delay - but Mr Modi did ask for ""creativity"".

The Indian election kicked off on 11 April but it's so long - it's staggered over five weeks - that Khan's appeal to voters may still work.
Why is this important?
Khan is a huge celebrity in India and one of the few that did not immediately respond to Mr Modi's string of tweets in March.
Narendra Modi bombards Bollywood with democracy-loving tweets So his tweet on Monday, although late, quickly made news. And Mr Modi was certainly impressed.

It's worth mentioning that the prime minister had gone all out when he tweeted at celebrities, even channelling his inner Bollywood. Our personal favourite is the tweet in which he punned on the iconic tagline from the early noughties Bollywood blockbuster Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham: ""It's all about loving your family.""
He tagged the film's two male leads, Khan and Amitabh Bachchan, and its director Karan Johar, and ended with ""It's all about loving your... democracy"".

On Monday, any chance of a Congress-AAP alliance was doomed... What happened?
The main opposition Congress party named its candidates for six out of seven parliamentary seats in Delhi, ending the possibility of a coalition with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
The AAP, which is the ruling party in the Delhi legislative assembly, and the Congress had earlier talked about forming an alliance to fight Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
But with the Congress going ahead with its list, we will now see a three-cornered contest in Delhi.
The Congress named former Delhi Chief Minister, Sheila Dikshit, as its candidate for the North East Delhi seat.
Why is this important?
The AAP and the Congress both oppose the BJP, and analysts say a coalition would have avoided the splitting of opposition votes in Delhi.
But both parties couldn't agree to a seat sharing agreement.
The first signs that their talks were failing came when Congress President Rahul Gandhi accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of making a U-turn in a tweet on 15 April.
Skip Twitter post by @RahulGandhi An alliance between the Congress & AAP in Delhi would mean the rout of the BJP. The Congress is willing to give up 4 Delhi seats to the AAP to ensure this.
But, Mr Kejriwal has done yet another U turn!
Our doors are still open, but the clock is running out. #AbAAPkiBaari
— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) April 15, 2019 Report End of Twitter post by @RahulGandhi
In response, Mr Kejriwal had tweeted: ""What U-Turn? The talks were still on. Your tweet shows that having an alliance is not your wish. I am saddened by your comment. Today it is important to save the country from the threat of Modi-Shah [BJP chief Amit Shah]. It is unfortunate that in UP [Uttar Pradesh state] and other states you are helping Modi by splitting the anti-Modi vote.""
...And PM Modi's 'nuclear button' remark sparked outrage What happened?
At a rally in the northern state of Rajasthan on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to India's nuclear arsenal, sparking a storm on social media.
""Pakistan keeps threatening us every now and then by saying, 'We have a nuclear button'. Even if they do, they should know that India also has one. Do they think our button is for Diwali?"" the PM said. Diwali is a Hindu festival of lights and firecrackers.
India is no longer scared of ""Pakistan's threats"", he added.
He also attacked the main opposition Congress party, saying that they were unable to curb terrorism when they were in power. ""It is the Congress that has weakened the country. The BJP, however, is in a process to strengthen it,"" he said.
Why is this important?
Mr Modi and the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have drawn flak for including India's recent strikes in Pakistan in their election campaign.
Earlier this month, a row erupted over a letter from retired military officers urging President Ram Nath Kovind to ensure that political parties do not use the armed forces to ""further their political agendas"".
Mr Modi has made national security the BJP's number one campaign plank ahead of the vote, continuously accusing the Congress of being weak on terrorism.
National security has traditionally never been an election issue in India, but some analysts say that this strategy by the BJP could help galvanise voters and boost the party's chances.
But Mr Modi's remarks prompted outrage on Twitter, with many calling them ""flippant"" and ""unfortunate"".

London Marathon: How do you reduce the environmental impact?,www.bbc.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48064102," Tens of thousands of plastic water bottles are collected after each London Marathon Tens of thousands of runners will take part in the London Marathon on Sunday - a gruelling 26.2-mile race around the capital.
The iconic event raised £63m ($81m) for charity last year - but it's also known for generating lots of plastic waste, particularly plastic water bottles discarded by runners.
Like concerts and other major events, the marathon also generates a massive carbon footprint with thousands travelling - some by plane - to the location. Waste from food, packaging and goodie bags gets left behind by spectators and runners.
After last year's marathon, Westminster City Council collected 5,200kg of rubbish and 3,500kg of recycling - including about 47,000 plastic bottles - from the streets.
And the council has warned that the amount is likely to increase this year, if the weather remains hot.

This year the London Marathon is making some big changes and trialling a number of ideas to try to make the event more green.
The measures include:
Reducing the total number of drink stations on the running route from 26 to 19 and reducing the number of plastic bottles on the course by 215,000 Using compostable cups rather than plastic bottles at three Lucozade Sport stations Providing Lucozade Sport in edible seaweed capsules at one drinks station Trialling new bottle belts made from recycled plastic so 700 runners can carry 250ml bottles with them during their run Issuing digital rather than printed race instructions Plastic bottles made from 100% or 50% recycled plastic London Marathon event director Hugh Brasner told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We're trying to lead the way... there's a raft of initiatives we are using this year that we think will lead to some huge behavioural changes in the future.""
Encouraging runners to trial bottle belts could also ""hugely reduce the amount of bottles used on the course"", he added.
However, a marathon is one of the toughest physical events a runner can endure - so are the proposals practical?
 A lot of marathons such as this one in New York use cups rather than plastic bottles Mike Robinson, who is running in Sunday's marathon, thinks reducing the number of drinks stations is sensible.
""Realistically you're not going to need to drink every mile, and that's actually against medical advice,"" he told the BBC.
However, he describes the bottle belt trial as ""a good idea"" which unfortunately ""came a little late"".
""The email [about the bottle belts trial] came through about a week ago - but if you're going to be doing that, you need to be practising with them a lot earlier.
""If you're wearing something that moves around - even a bit - it becomes an irritation [during a marathon]. I had two sport gels in the side pocket of my shorts once, and after running two miles my legs started bleeding.""
Image copyright Harald Greve Image caption Cindy Roy and Harald Greve have run seven and six marathons respectively And would runners be willing to drink out of paper cups rather than plastic bottles?
Runners Harald Greve and Cindy Roy have completed six and seven marathons respectively and say paper cups are actually better in some ways because they contain the right amount of liquid.
""The bottles contain a lot of drink you don't necessarily need; what you want is a sip every few miles because you want to avoid needing the bathroom,"" Cindy told the BBC.
The two, who have run marathons in London, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin, Manchester, Stockholm and Athens, say in most marathons outside the UK runners are given paper cups rather than bottles anyway.
London Marathon accused of discrimination Why we are running the London Marathon However, the couple agree that running with bottles is ""easier by a long way"".
""For recreational runners, I think the time wasted from drinking from a cup is just a matter of seconds - but for elite runners a couple of seconds might mean the difference between winning and losing,"" says Harald.
Image copyright Mike Robinson Image caption Mike Robinson has completed the London and Brighton marathons It's a view shared by Mike, who argues: ""If you ever try drinking [from a cup] whilst you're running, you end up getting more of it on your face than your mouth. For 75% of runners, they'd be cool with that, but for anyone trying to beat a time, telling them to stop is just like talking to a wall.""
Meanwhile, all three runners considered the edible pouches of Lucozade to be a good idea - but pointed out that many runners will be reluctant to consume something they haven't already tried during a marathon, in case it makes them ill.
Party packs help cut single-use plastic The plastic packaging paradox What else can be done? Dr Andrea Collins, a lecturer at Cardiff University, has researched the impact of major events on the environment.
From her studies, she has found that ""the way in which people travel to an event is one of the key contributors to the size of the environmental footprint"".
The London Marathon encourages participants to travel by public transport - and Dr Collins says that spectators can also think about the type of food and drink they purchase at the event - going for local or seasonal food without packaging where possible, and taking care not to over purchase.
Meanwhile, Mike's tip for runners is to empty their bottles once they're done with them.
""What usually happens is you have a few swigs and then throw your bottle to the side - because running with a bottle of water can change your running form quite a lot.
""But one thing I've only recently learned is that you can't recycle a bottle that's got water inside it - it's worth publicising this so runners know to squeeze out the water before throwing their bottles away. It's something I'll be doing this year.""
Do marathons do any good for the environment? Dr Collins says more and more people are becoming aware of the importance of holding big events in a sustainable way.
""Spectators and participants are realising that our ability to hold an event [in the future] will also depend on the quality of the environment. We can't continue to consume resources at the rate we are - it contributes to the bigger issue of climate change.""
However, she also argues that big sporting events, when done right, can do some good.
""These high profile events raise our awareness of environmental impacts, and organisers can demonstrate in quite a positive way what they've done. People might be inspired - and other big races, like the Great North Run, will be looking to see what has been put in place at the London Marathon, and what works.""
A study by King's College London found that air pollution in the capital fell by 89% during the last London Marathon due to road closures.
And the experience of running a marathon also encourages people to be more environmentally friendly, Cindy argues.
""Training for a marathon makes you more sustainable in day-to-day activities - I started walking or running to work every day and shunning public transport altogether - being environmentally friendly while training kind of sticks with you and becomes a way of life.""

Protests over plan to change domain pricing - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48066945,"Protests over plan to change domain pricing 26 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption Many non-profits and charities, such as the Red Cross, use the .org domain Protests have greeted plans to remove a cap on the price of web domains that end in .org, .biz and .info.
This change could hit a lot of charities, many of which use the .org domain for their websites.
The organisation overseeing web domains wants to let the companies behind the suffixes set their own prices.
One domain seller criticised the idea, saying prices to renew or buy these domains could go ""sky high"" as a result. Price change
The price cap removal has been proposed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), which oversees the web's domain name system.
It wants to remove the cap because it dates from an era when there were only a few so-called ""top-level"" domains. Now there are more than 1,200 and none of the new ones are subject to any price restrictions.
Icann's plan drew criticism from registrar Namecheap, which said the move could mean prices ""shoot up"" or go ""sky high"".
""Switching domains is hard, so you will have little option but to pay the higher prices,"" wrote Jackie Dana, Namecheap's blog editor.
Icann launched a consultation exercise to debate the idea in March, and asked anyone involved with domains to comment via a discussion forum on its own website.
The consultation exercise ends on 29 April and Icann will report on the response on 13 May.
Of the three domains under consideration, .org is by far the biggest. It is believed to have about 10 million customers, many of which are non-profit groups or charities. Protections
Comments left on the Icann website about the proposed change are mainly critical. Holders of .org domains, companies selling domain names, ISPs and net marketing firms have all asked for the proposal to be dropped.
One commenter said removing the cap would undoubtedly lead to higher prices, which those holding .org, .biz or .info domains would have to pay.
The ""enormous switching costs"" made it impossible to move large, established organisations to new domains.
Others said Icann should ""leave well enough alone"" as any change could lead to domain prices no longer being ""reasonable, affordable and stable"".
But in a statement to the BBC, Icann said it was not a price regulator, and that the protections were put in place by the US Department of Justice at a time when there were fewer options for organisations wanting to register a domain name. Those protections are no longer in effect, it said.
""Existing domain registrants are also afforded some protection in the event of price increases,"" added Cyrus Namazi, Icann's head of global domains division.
""They must be given a minimum six-month notice of any price increase and can renew their registrations for as many as 10 years prior to the change taking effect, thus enabling a registrant to lock in current prices for up to 10 years in advance of a pricing change"" Related Topics"

Sri Lanka bombings: PM Wickremesinghe says he was 'out of the loop' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48070552,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke to the BBC Sri Lanka's prime minister has told the BBC he was ""out of the loop"" when it came to intelligence warnings ahead of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings.
Ranil Wickremesinghe said that crucial information about any potential danger in the country was not passed to him.
The subsequent attacks, which claimed at least 250 lives, exposed a massive intelligence failure by Sri Lanka.
The country's police chief and top defence ministry official have both resigned over the bombings.
But Mr Wickremesinghe argued the fact that he was unaware of the warnings meant he did not need to step down from his position.
""If we had any inkling, and we had not taken action, I would have handed in my resignation immediately,"" he said, adding: ""But what do you do when you are out of the loop?""
The apparent lapse in communication has refocused attention on the infighting between the country's two most powerful men, Mr Wickremesinghe and the president, Maithripala Sirisena.
Relations deteriorated to such an extent that last October, Mr Sirisena sacked Mr Wickremesinghe . He was reinstated in December following rulings by Sri Lanka's highest courts.
What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? The victims of the Easter Sunday bombings US woman wrongly identified as suspect President Sirisena, meanwhile, has told reporters that Sri Lankan intelligence services believed around 130 suspects linked to the Islamic State (IS) group were in the country and that police were hunting 70 who were still at large.
Police later discovered what they believed was the attackers' safe house in the eastern city of Sammanthurai. An ""Islamic State banner [and] IS uniform similar to the video that was released by alleged suicide bombers"" were found inside the building, a police spokesman told the BBC.
About 150 sticks of dynamite and 100,000 ball bearings were also found during the raid.
There have also been reports of a shootout between security forces and a group of alleged suspects in a separate location.
Sri Lankan authorities have blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Tawheed Jamath, for the attacks, although IS has also said it was behind them.
Attack 'leader' died in bombings Mr Sirisena also confirmed that the attackers' alleged ringleader, Zahran Hashim, a radical preacher, died at the Shangri-La hotel in the capital, Colombo.
He said Hashim led the attack on the popular tourist hotel, accompanied by a second bomber identified as ""Ilham"". It was one of six hotels and churches targeted by the group.

It is not clear whether Hashim had been in direct contact with IS or if he had simply pledged allegiance to the group.
Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack Latest developments Sri Lankan officials revised the death toll from the bombings down by about 100 on Thursday, to 253, blaming the difficulty in identifying body parts at bomb scenes. But the move raised questions over how the previous estimate could have been so inaccurate.

The Sri Lankan government has said it will search schools, in one of a series of announcements designed to address public anxiety in the aftermath of the attacks.
A state of emergency, declared on Monday, has continued, allowing police to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders.
Sri Lanka's finance minister, Mangala Samaraweera said on Friday there were fears the country's lucrative tourism industry could see a fall in arrivals of up to 30% this year - resulting in a loss of $1.5bn (£1.2bn).
Who were the attackers? Nine people are suspected of carrying out the attacks. Two of the bombers are said to have been the sons of spice trader Mohammad Yusuf Ibrahim, one of Sri Lanka's richest men. Mr Ibrahim was detained and questioned after the attacks.
One of his sons was reportedly the bomber at the city's Shangri-La hotel - alongside Hashim, according to President Sirisena. The other son reportedly targeted the restaurant at the high-end Cinnamon Grand hotel, a short distance away.

Ex-Met Police assistant commissioner Sir Mark Rowley says it is a disgrace a jailed radical preacher ranks top for search term ""British Muslim spokesman"".
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the internet search company's algorithms ""pushed readers to extremist material"" to maximise ad revenue.
Google denies the claim, saying it aims to steer users to third-party sites.
The top-ranked search referred to by Sir Mark takes users to the Wikipedia entry for Anjem Choudary, who was released from prison last year , halfway through a five-year jail term for encouraging support for the so-called Islamic State group.
He told Today: ""I think I mentioned on your programme a few months ago, if you Google 'British Muslim spokesman' you get Anjem Choudary. That's a disgrace."" Hate speech
Sir Mark said: ""These algorithms are designed to push us towards contentious material because that feeds their bottom line of advertising revenues, by pushing readers to extremist material.""
This is something Google denies, pointing out that it actually wants to get people off the platform and on to a third-party site as quickly as possible.
Neither does it generally show adverts next to news-related enquiries, the BBC was told.
Sir Mark said the scale and pace of all social-media firms' attempts to deal with the problem were ""completely insufficient"".
The Home Affairs Select Committee grilled executives from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook this week over the amount of hate speech on their platforms.
Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, was particularly angry at the amount of far-right content recommended to her on YouTube, questioning why the algorithms did that and whether they could be changed.
YouTube executive Marco Pancini said it was working to make controversial content ""less visible"". Police co-operation
But it is not just with regard to Islam that Google's algorithms produce contentious results.
The first result in a search for ""UK Christian spokesman"" is Christian Voice - an organisation which has called for British law to be based on the Bible, and which opposes abortion, homosexuality and compulsory sex education.
MPs asked the three social-media firms, Twitter, Facebook and Google, how they responded when they found users who were sharing propaganda.
All three said they would give information on users to police only if there was ""an imminent threat of risk to life"".
Sir Mark told the Today programme that the firms needed to do more to pass on any information they had about terrorist material being shared on their platforms. Related Topics"

Does the Bank of England have a woman problem? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Katie Hope Business Reporter,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48062920," Image caption Silvana Tenreyro is the only female member of the Monetary Policy Committee Take a glance at a photo of the Bank of England's influential Monetary Policy Committee and its problem is immediately clear.
The nine-strong committee look pretty similar: eight white men and one woman.
This is the body that guides the UK economy. Their monthly votes on interest rates ultimately determine how far our money goes.
Yet they don't look anything like many of the people whose lives they have so much influence over.
Women make up half of the UK population, yet just one ninth of the Monetary Policy Committee. There is also not a single black, Asian or minority ethnic group (BAME) member.
In fact, current governor Mark Carney is the 120th in a continuous line of white men to have headed the Bank.
It's obvious the Bank has a diversity problem.
Last month, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the Bank was some way off its diversity targets for next year ""with little evidence the gap is closing quickly enough"".
But in January, the Bank appointed two women: former Virgin Money boss Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia and Banking Standards Board chair Dame Colette Bowe to its Financial Policy Committee.
The Bank's chief operating officer Joanna Place also said: ""In terms of diversity and inclusion, we have done a lot more than just gender and ethnicity.
""We have a number of staff networks. We have inclusive events. We have a wellbeing policy. We have done a cognitive diversity survey. We have started to look at social mobility,"" she added.
Many are hoping that the Bank's search for a new governor - which kicked off earlier this week - could herald the start of a new era with a female governor at the helm for the first time in its history.
 Image caption Rachel Reeves says the Bank needs to do more to train and promote talented women Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business select committee and who was an economist at the Bank of England before becoming a politician, said now is the time for the Bank to act: ""We've had two women prime ministers and yet have had no women chancellors or Bank governors.
""The sad truth is that the Bank has not done enough to recruit, train and promote talented women. More needs to be done to bring forward a generation of women economists who can be considered for the top job.""
'Self reproducing' But Wendy Carlin, a professor of economics at University College London, says the problem is not with the Bank of England, but the economics profession itself.
""If you google economists you'll get a great number of pictures of economists in suits holding up a financial chart. Those impressions are self-reproducing. If people only see men in suits then they don't think it's for them,"" she says.
 Image caption Just over a third of undergraduate economics students in the UK are women Statistics show that women are far less likely than men to study economics, let alone get a job in the sector.Just over a third of undergraduate economics students in the UK are women. The picture is similar in Australia and the US.
Prof Carlin is leading an international project - the CORE project - to change the way economics is taught, with the aim of broadening its appeal.
""We're being much clearer that economics is about addressing the problems we face. Yes, it's about financial stability but it's also about inequality, the environmental future and work.""
But, she cautions, work at this academic level will take time to filter through to the real world.
""It's crucial to widen the pool [of job candidates] as far as possible, but you've got to get people into the pool in the first place and that's what we're working on,"" she says.
Image copyright Margaret Heffernan Image caption Dr Heffernan says the onus is on the the profession itself to make sure it is attracting the widest possible pool of applicants Dr Margaret Heffernan, author and the former chief executive of five businesses, says the lack of a women in the sector has become self-fulfilling, that because the profession is dominated by males they tend to ""promote and nurture male students"".
""Economics can be very excluding of women, sometimes unintentionally and sometimes intentionally. People with privilege don't happily give it up,"" she says.
Unfair A recent survey by the American Economic Association of more than 9,200 economists suggests there are also deep-rooted problems. Some 30% of female economists said they felt discriminated against, compared with 12% of men. Women felt they were treated especially unfairly when it came to pay and promotion decisions.
Dr Heffernan says the profession itself should try to make sure it is attracting the widest possible pool of applicants, warning that women often underestimate their abilities when it comes to applying for jobs.
One chief executive she spoke to ran a series of different recruitment adverts for a senior position. She found the more junior she made the role sound, the higher the number of female applicants.
""How you word a job will define someone's right to apply. If you're not getting the right kind of applicants then describe the job differently and see what happens.""
Room for optimism? Recruitment firm Sapphire Partners has been asked to carry out the search for the new governor.
The fact it describes itself as ""advocates for women in business"", and is run by five female partners, suggests this time there could be room for optimism.
But Dr Heffernan also points out that women in senior positions currently get a lot more scrutiny than men, something that can put them off applying.
""The first woman in any post of visible power knows there's extra scrutiny that goes with it.
""Everyone wants to know what they're wearing, what their family and social life is like. Some are ambivalent about that.""
Nonetheless, she says the more common females in power become the less this will happen because it will become normal rather than extraordinary.
Does she think the next Bank of England governor could be a woman?
""I'm cautiously optimistic,"" she says."

Fitness trackers 'add miles to your marathon' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Zoe Kleinman Technology Reporter,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48072255," Apple Watch was the most accurate, according to the Which? study Some fitness trackers are inaccurately measuring running distance, according to research from the consumer watchdog Which?
It tested 118 trackers using a treadmill to complete the distance of a marathon - 26.2 miles (42km).
It found that the least reliable was the Garmin Vivosmart 4, which underestimated the distance by 10.8 miles – meaning the researcher actually ran 37 miles.
Garmin said it was because that particular tracker did not contain GPS.
It described the Vivosmart 4 as an “all-round smart fitness tracker” and suggested that marathon runners use its Forerunner range which is GPS-enabled.
Of the eight Apple models involved in the test, the Apple Watch series 1 was the most accurate, over-estimating the distance by 1%, while the series 3 overestimated by 13% - stating that the runner had completed the marathon distance after 22.8 miles.
“Our tests have found a number of models from big-name brands that can’t be trusted when it comes to measuring distance, so before you buy, make sure you do your research to find a model that you can rely on,” said Natalie Hitchins, head of home product and services at Which?
Other results for the number of miles reached before the tracker recorded the official marathon distance included:
Samsung Gear S2 – 36.2 miles Xiaomi Amazfit Bip – 34 miles Huawei Watch 2 Sport – 18.9 miles A Huawei spokesman told the BBC “individual runner variances” could have affected the test results.
“With regards to running indoors, as this particular test was carried out on a treadmill,"" he said. ""The algorithm of Huawei Watch 2 Sport calculates the user’s stride length from the acceleration sensor data while running at different speeds.""
 Testing devices in the real world, rather than on treadmills, would provide more accurate results, experts said In January 2019 researchers at Aberystwyth University found that all the trackers they tested overestimated the number of calories burned during activity.
Gavin Taitt is a regular middle-distance runner from Earlston, in the Scottish Borders, who also coaches others. He said he and his group use a combination of Garmin Forerunner watches and the social fitness network Strava to measure and share results.
“The watches are quite expensive but have good feedback,” he said.
“Accuracy is very important.”
Another expert agreed that the calibrated treadmill test was not the best method because all the devices would have had to rely on step-counting algorithms rather than GPS (for those which had it) to calculate distance.
""This is a real shame as a real world (on-road) test would have been more useful for consumers,"" said Dr Dale Esliger, senior lecturer in physical activity and health at Loughborough University.
He added that when investing in a tracker, people should think about which metric is going to be most useful to them in terms of measuring their progress.
""Step-counting has become a key metric for many; however, devices are now coming with heart-rate monitoring capability which relates to activity intensity and provides insight into cardiovascular health,"" he explained.
""In our research, this [heart rate] is the metric that seems to be the potent driver for behaviour change."""

Edge of the Knife: The film in a language only 20 people speak - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Rosie Blunt Bbc News,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48028970,"Image copyright Niijang Xyaalas Productions Image caption The protagonist of Edge of the Knife, Adiits'ii, as he begins his descent into madness On a wintry beach lined with conifers, the body of a teenage boy washes up on the grey sand. A mother runs to her dead son and clutches him to her chest, wailing.
Meanwhile, a young man named Adiits'ii flees from the scene, running into the forest, gasping and grunting. Having taken the boy out in a boat which hit choppy waters, he feels responsible for his death.
It is this family tragedy that serves as the focus of the Canadian film Edge of the Knife, or Sgaawaau K'uuna. The story, steeped in the supernatural, centres on the universal themes of family, love, loss and betrayal.
What is less universal is the language of the film, Haida. According to the First People's Culture Council, there are only 20 remaining fluent speakers of this language, making it critically endangered.
Helen Haig-Brown and Gwaai Edenshaw, who is Haida himself, directed the film.
Writing the film in Haida ""did not even feel like a choice"", said Gwaai. ""We were telling a Haida story.""
Although they were ""fully committed to the storytelling"", he said, another consideration was that Edge of the Knife would act as a learning resource.
Diane Brown, Gwaai's grandmother, is one of the last remaining speakers of Haida and acted in the film.
""Our dream right at the start was it would help our children learn the language. That we help teach them,"" she said.
Image copyright Lauren Brown Image caption Diane Brown and her granddaughter Xyaalaa Emma, who played Eagle Child in the film The indigenous Haida communities live on Haida Gwaii, an archipelago 100km (62 miles) off the west coast of Canada. Edge of the Knife is set in this sparse but beautiful coastal landscape in the mid-1800s.
In the film, two Haida communities come together to prepare food for the winter. Geometric patterns are tattooed across their chests and they wear cloaks woven from the spruce trees of the land around them.
It is a delicate portrayal of a family unaware of the suffering soon to strike. The Haida Gwaii archipelago was colonised by the British in 1853, when it was renamed the Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands.
Many believe that the Europeans deliberately spread diseases such as smallpox by giving the Haida people infected blankets and scarves, causing the population to plummet from approximately 10,000 to just 588.
This brutal annexation is foreshadowed in the film by Adiits'ii's journey into the forest, where he descends into madness and becomes Gaagiixid, the Wildman, losing his entire sense of self.
Image Copyright TIFF Trailers TIFF Trailers Report Image Copyright TIFF Trailers TIFF Trailers Report Throughout the 20th Century, the Haida population crept back up and now stands at 3,442. But Haida suffering was far from over as their culture was stamped out, particularly in residential schools, where indigenous children were forced to work all morning in the fields then given rudimentary lessons in the afternoon. Speaking Haida was strictly forbidden.
Diane Brown said that her parents were told by teachers that if they spoke ""their language"" they would go to hell. Some children were beaten for speaking their mother tongue.
""It was a way of trying to control us,"" she said. ""A grand plan to assimilate us 100%.""
Gwaai said that most Haida still ""understand their situation to be one of foreign occupation and are frustrated with their incapability to speak their own language in their own land"".
Haida: A short guide Haida, or X̲aad Kil / X̲aaydaa Kil is mainly spoken on the islands of Haida Gwaii in British Columbia and dates to when people first settled there after the last Ice Age, about 11,000 years ago.
There are three different dialects of Haida, spoken in Skidegate and Massett in Canada and Hydaburg in the US state of Alaska. Haida is an isolate, meaning it does not connect to any other existing language.
Haida phrases
Siingway laa - Good day
Gass ingu dang giidang? - How are you?
Asanga dang hll King Gas sang - See you later
Gasanguu siingaay Giieang - How's the weather?
Gina waa dluxan gud ad kwaagid - Everything depends on everything else (a well-known Haida saying)
According to Unesco, there are 70 recognised indigenous languages in Canada. The First Peoples' Cultural Council says that almost half of these are in British Columbia, which has an indigenous population of 172,520. But only 3% of this population speaks an indigenous language fluently.
This reflects the international picture: a report by the National Geographic Society and the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages found that across the world, a language dies every two weeks.
The United Nations declared 2019 the International Year of Indigenous Languages and funding to preserve them in Canada has increased from $5m (£3.9m) to $118m (£91.2m) in recent years.
Are dying languages worth saving? Economics 'driving language loss' Robert-Falcon Ouellette, a member of parliament for Winnipeg, believes the fight to protect threatened languages is a worthwhile cause.
He is of mixed English and indigenous Cree descent and was the first politician to speak in his native language in parliament in 2017. He said that everyone has a right to their own language.
Image copyright Bernard Thibodeau, Canada House of Commons Image caption Robert-Falcon Ouellette speaking in his Cree dialect in parliament ""There's value to people whose language is their culture and their history,"" he said. ""We often hear that indigenous people don't feel part of Canada. There's an awful lot of anger.""
Robert-Falcon's Cree speech paved the way for MPs to have the right to interpreters to translate indigenous languages in parliament. In March, the aboriginal television network APTN broadcast a hockey game in Cree for the first time.
According to Robert-Falcon, using indigenous languages, whether it is in film, parliament or sports, is ""the chance to tell indigenous people that they matter"".
Erica Ryan-Gagne was an actor in Edge of the Knife, as well as the on-set language coach. She is Haida and learned the language especially for the project.
Image copyright Erica Ryan-Gagne Image caption Erica Ryan-Gagne (R) on set in traditional Haida clothing To hear Haida spoken for the first time in the film, you might assume that the process of learning it was torturous. There is a consonant-heavy, guttural sound to it, worlds away from the fluidity of English.
But Erica said the process was less like learning and more like drawing out the language into her consciousness. ""I had no problem with the pronunciation,"" she said. ""It was already in me.""
For the 22 non-Haida speaking actors in the film, ""boot camps"" were arranged for the elders to teach it to them.
""We brought actors and speakers all together in one place, off-grid, for two weeks,"" said Erica. ""They learned how to speak, how to memorise the language. To do the language justice and give our ancestors justice.""
Image copyright Niijang Xyaalas Productions Image caption A scene from the film showing Hlaaya, the mother of the boy who dies, drying leaves to prepare them for weaving Many languages die because, like Haida, they are passed from generation to generation orally and do not have an orthography to preserve them. But now, for the first time, Haida has been written down - an important tool to help new learners.
As for the script, the writers first wrote it in English then took it to the elders to translate. Erica described the elders as the ""the heartbeat, the backbone"" of the project and said the production team needed to ""harness their knowledge and give them the floor"".
Haida now has 265 active learners. For the first time, it is also being taught in schools. As such a relatable medium for younger generations, film is a crucial part of this educational process.
""It's gained way more interest than we ever dreamed it would,"" said Diane Brown. ""Young people are interested in it."" She saw evidence of this with her own grandson, Gwaai, who has learned Haida. ""It gave him a sense of pride in who he was as a Haida,"" she said.
Image copyright Niijang Xyaalas Productions Image caption A Haida man stands in front of their traditional wooden housing in a scene from the film ""It's inspiring further generations; it's opening minds up,"" said Erica Ryan-Gagne. ""This film gives hope to other languages and other indigenous communities. If you can pave that way and be that baton then we have got to do it.""
For Erica and all the Haida people involved in the film, after so many years of having such a crucial part of their identity destroyed, reviving the language has been an emotional process.
""The language has healed me - made me feel whole, made me realise what it means to be Haida,"" she said. ""That's how I'm going to help my people, help my kids."""
Japan emperor: The mysterious Imperial Treasures - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Anna Jones Bbc News,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47931671,"Akihito and Japan's Imperial Treasures that make a man an emperor By Anna Jones BBC News 27 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Picture Art/Alamy Image caption The three Treasures have their origins in the legend of Amaterasu - the sun goddess
On 1 May, Crown Prince Naruhito will ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne after his father abdicates, becoming the new emperor of Japan.
Both the abdication and accession will involve deeply symbolic Shinto ceremonies, and central to them will be three objects - a mirror, a sword and a gem - known as the Imperial Treasures or Regalia.
The origins and whereabouts of the mysterious objects are shrouded in secrecy, but myths about them are peppered throughout Japanese history and pop culture. Why are the Imperial Treasures so important?
Japan's unofficial national religion, Shinto, places huge importance on ritual to maintain a connection with the past and with spirits which intervene in human lives. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The treasures feature prominently in the accession ceremony but are never seen
The Imperial Treasures are part of this. They are said to have been passed down from the gods through generations of emperors seen as their direct descendants. In the absence of an imperial crown, the treasures act as the symbol of imperial power.
But the treasures are so sacred, they are kept hidden from the world.
""We do not know when they were made. We have never seen them,"" Prof Hideya Kawanishi from Nagoya University told the BBC.
""Even the Emperor has never seen them.""
In fact they won't even be at the coronation - replicas (which still won't be seen) will be used, and the originals - if they are even that - will stay at their shrines around the country. Yata no Kagami - the sacred mirror
The mirror, which may be more than 1,000 years old, is believed to be kept at the Ise Grand Shrine in Mie prefecture. According to Shinsuke Takenaka at the Institute of Moralogy - a Japanese body which researches ethics and morality - it is considered the most precious of the treasures.
It was the only one of the treasures which did not feature in the last enthronement in 1989. Image copyright BBC/DaviesSurya
In Japanese folklore, mirrors are said to have divine power and to reveal truth. In the imperial ceremonies, Yata no Kagami - or eight-sided mirror - represents the wisdom of the emperor.
According to the Kojiki, the ancient written record of Japanese history and legend, the Yata no Kagami was made by the deity Ishikoridome.
After the sun goddess Amaterasu fought with her brother Susanoo, the god of the sea and storms, she retreated to a cave taking the light of the world with her.
Susanoo arranged a party to lure her out, and Amaterasu was dazzled by her own reflection in the mirror. They repaired their squabble, bringing light back to the universe.
The mirror and the other treasures eventually made their way to Amaterasu's grandson, Ninigi.
According to the legends, says Mr Takenaka, the goddess told Ninigi: ""Serve this mirror as my soul, just as you'd serve me, with clean mind and body.""
Ninigi is believed to be the great-grandfather of Jimmu, who legends say became Japan's first emperor in 660 BC. Kusanagi no Tsurugi - the sacred sword
The location of the Kusanagi no Tsurugi - or grass-cutting sword - is not clear, but it may be at the Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya. Image copyright BBC/DaviesSurya
Legend says it grew in the tail of an eight-headed serpent that was devouring the daughters of a wealthy family.
The father appealed to Susanoo for help, promising marriage to his last uneaten daughter if he could rid them of the snake. Susanoo tricked the serpent into getting drunk, then cut off its tails, finding the sword.
But he didn't have it for long - it too was used in his efforts to make up with his sister, Amaterasu.
The sword represents the bravery of the emperor. Because so little is known about it and where it is kept, some question whether the sword actually still exists.
It's certainly been kept in secret - one priest who reported having seen it in the Edo period (some time between the 17th and 19th Century) was banished.
There are rumours it may have been lost at sea during a 12th Century battle, but Mr Takenaka says that may itself have been a copy, and that a duplicate of that, kept at the palace, is used for coronations.
When Emperor Akihito came to the throne in 1989 he was given a sword said to be Kusanagi no Tsurugi. But the box he was given remained unopened. Yasakani no Magatama - the sacred jewel
A magatama is a type of curved bead which started being made in Japan around 1,000 years BC. Originally decorative, they started taking on symbolic value. Image copyright BBC/DaviesSurya
According to the legend, the Yasakani no Magatama was part of a necklace made by Tamanooya-no-Mikoto. It was worn by Ame-no-Uzume, the goddess of merriment, who played a central role in the efforts to lure Amaterasu from her cave.
She performed an extravagant dance, wearing the beads, to cause a commotion and attract the sun goddess's attention.
Whatever its origins, the Yasakani no Magatama, made of green jade, may be the only surviving ""original"" among the three treasures.
It is housed in the imperial palace in Tokyo and in the enthronement ceremony, represents the benevolence required of an emperor. Do Japanese believe in the treasure?
While Japan's emperors trace their lineage to Amaterasu, they no longer claim to be gods themselves - Emperor Hirohito renounced his divine status after Japan's defeat in World War Two. Image copyright Culture Club/Getty Images Image caption A depiction of the coronation of Emperor Taisho in 1912 in Kyoto
Prof Kawanishi says there are many in Japan who still think of the objects as being imbued with divine power, but that many people ""think of them now more as ornaments, a bit like a crown in other monarchies"".
They're largely important because they ""show the mystery of the emperor"", he says, and as a ""symbol that the system has continued for a long time"".
Mr Takenaka says there is also a view among scholars that the items represent the fusion of Japan's ancient indigenous groups with new arrivals.
Based on that theory, he says, the three treasures are a symbol the emperor should unite the ethnic groups without discrimination.
But he adds that in the 20th Century, the term ""three treasures"" also took on a slightly more practical meaning, becoming the phrase for the three things Japanese people felt they could not live without: a TV, a refrigerator and a washing machine.

Will the transition be two years or four years? Will the military retain control of security policy and ministries? How will cabinet posts be divided between the constituent parts of the opposition - civil society and established political parties?
Big questions but none can detract from the immensity of this moment.
Not since the days when Nelson Mandela left prison in 1990 and campaigned in the South African townships have I seen such exuberance - the wide, open face of honest hope.
The crowds in front of the army headquarters in Khartoum occupy a space that is both physical and psychological.

There are families petitioning for news of long-disappeared loved ones, Darfuris demanding the trial of the ousted President Omar al-Bashir, lawyers calling for the rule of law, doctors pleading for universal healthcare, teachers calling for a revolution in education.
Not all can possibly be satisfied. But that is the struggle of the future. Maintaining pressure
First comes the immense task of achieving a transition from 30 years of military rule to a civilian administration.
In this regard, Sudan appears to be more fortunate than Algeria which is also experiencing street protests against an entrenched ""deep state"". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Women are at the forefront of protests in Sudan
The Sudanese generals have been extremely pragmatic.
They ditched the coup leader within 24 hours when it became clear the street detested him. Three other Islamist generals were forced to resign as part of the price for the protesters resuming negotiations.
The new military leader, Lt Gen Abdul Fatah al-Burhan, has given interviews to the international media and is quick to react to opposition initiatives.
It is an extraordinary contrast to the sclerotic and paranoid government of the previous three decades.
But can Sudan inspire seismic change elsewhere in Africa? The immediate signs are not optimistic. The new strongmen
In Algeria, ongoing protests have forced the departure of the long-standing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. But the military deep state remains in power.
Preserving the power of one party through a ruthless intelligence service has been a feature of Algerian political life since the country achieved independence from France in 1962.

Algeria withstood a violent civil war in the 1990s after the government - backed by the West - refused to acknowledge an Islamist election victory.
I will never forget the terror of walking through the Algiers Casbah during that war, surrounded by heavily armed policemen, unsure of who the enemy really was and when they would strike.
Next door in Egypt, the strongman Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has just won a referendum which allows him to extend the number of and duration of presidential term limits. Repression of the media and opposition are routine.
In Uganda, 75-year-old President Yoweri Museveni has trodden a similar path and could stay in power well into his eighties.

Police said they had received five reports of attacks in the past two weeks in the north of Norwich.
After the first one, pet Bubba returned home with his ears cut off.
Taverham Vets, which treated a second cat with the same mutilations, said: ""Due to the frequency, location and nature of the injuries we can conclude humans are carrying out these attacks.""
The attack on Bubba on 14 April was the first to be reported. 'Remain vigilant'
On Thursday a cat bearing similar wounds was treated by the Taverham surgery, which is still trying to determine whether the unchipped animal is a stray.
His injuries prompted vets to issue a warning, writing on Facebook : ""There have been reports of other incidents of mutilation, including findings of remains in and around the area.
""We advise that everyone remain vigilant, keep your cats safely indoors if you can - especially at night.""
Police confirmed officers were investigating the attacks and two reports of a man seen bundling a cat into a bag and one of a cat being swung by its tail against a garage wall.
There were further reports of feline body parts being found at an allotment in the same part of the city, a spokesman said.

Nigeria gunmen kidnap Shell workers and kill police guards - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48075423," Shell is involved in oil and gas production in the Niger Delta Two senior employees of the oil company Shell have been kidnapped and their police escorts killed in Nigeria's restive Delta region, police said.
The attack took place as the workers were returning from a business trip on Thursday on a road in Rivers state.
Gunmen killed the guards, one of whom was driving the vehicle, and seized the two workers, officials said.
A police spokesman said efforts were under way to rescue the Shell employees.
Their names and nationalities have not been released.

Kidnapping for ransom is common in Nigeria, with foreigners and high-profile Nigerians frequently targeted.
Earlier this month, a British woman was one of two people shot dead by gunmen who stormed a holiday resort in the northern city of Kaduna. Three others were kidnapped during the attack.
In January last year, two Americans and two Canadian citizens were abducted while travelling from the town of Kafanchan in Kaduna state to the capital Abuja. Two of their police escorts were killed.

Mexico City 'milestone' for migrant caravan heading north,www.bbc.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46092995,"Mexico City 'milestone' for migrant caravan heading north 5 November 2018 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Migrant caravan Image copyright AFP Image caption The migrants arrived exhausted and immediately bedded down on the stands of the stadium in Mexico City The first members of a large group of migrants travelling through Mexico towards the United States have arrived in the capital, Mexico City.
About 450 people, mostly men and boys, were given temporary shelter at a sports stadium.
They are part of a now 5,000-strong group, known as the migrant caravan, which left Honduras on 12 October.
Critics have accused Mr Trump of using people's fears of illegal immigration to fire up his supporters ahead of Tuesday's mid-term elections. 'Major milestone'
It has taken this group of migrants more than three weeks to get from the crime-ridden Honduran city of San Pedro Sula to Mexico City. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Children enjoyed the rest after weeks of walking
They say they left Honduras for fear of violence and to escape poverty and unemployment. 'We left because we had to'
Many said that reaching Mexico City felt like a major milestone after three weeks of crossing Guatemala and southern Mexico, mainly on foot.
Mexico City, the first major metropolis the migrants have reached since leaving Honduras, is expected to be the place where the caravan may divide and some may decide to stay.
Mexican officials said legal advisers would be on hand to talk those arriving through their options.
Honduran migrant Jackson García is one of those considering asking for asylum in Mexico. ""If I can find a job so as to support my family [I will stay in Mexico]. My family is very poor and I need to help them,"" he said.
But many others, such as Carlos Flores, remain determined to continue to the US: ""The little that you get in US dollars goes a long way in Honduras. But what you earn here [in Mexico] not so much, you have to pay for food, room, things are expensive here.""
Mauricio Mancilla, who has travelled from northern Honduras with his six-year-old son, says for him his destination has always been clear: ""Our heads are set at getting to the United States, to fulfil the American dream. We have faith in God that we will do this, whatever the circumstances."" More on the way
President Trump has put pressure on the Mexican authorities to stop the migrant caravan, which he has called ""an invasion"". He has also said that he will use the military to completely close the US-Mexico border if necessary, to stop the migrants crossing into the US.

After briefly stopping them at Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, the Mexican authorities have not stood in the way of the migrants. Watch: Migrants illegally cross into Mexico
The governor of Veracruz, Miguel Ángel Yunes, on Friday offered to lay on free buses to take the migrants crossing his state to Mexico City, but he later withdrew the offer .
In the capital, city officials prepared food and shelter as well as medical services to those arriving at the Jesús Martínez ""Palillo"" stadium.
""There are pregnant women, many children, vulnerable people and we have to guarantee the space and the services they require,"" said city leader José Ramón Amieva Gálvez.
Many of those arriving were so exhausted they only grabbed a blanket before falling asleep. ""From what I brought from Honduras I have nothing. Even yesterday I walked barefoot,"" Kenia Alvarado, 21, told El Universal newspaper.
Residents of Mexico City have donated clothes and shoes for the travellers, local media reported.
Apart from the approximately 5,000-strong group approaching Mexico City, there are two more groups of migrants heading north. One has only just crossed the Suchiate river, which marks the border between Mexico and Guatemala, and the other is moving north from Mexico's southern Chiapas state.
It is expected all three groups will meet up in Mexico City and that those who remain determined to make it to the US will set off together. Related Topics"

"London Marathon 2019: Eliud Kipchoge on freedom, simplicity & power of the mind - BBC Sport",www.bbc.com,msn.com,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/48055305,"Read more about sharing. Kipchoge broke the marathon world record in Berlin in September Eliud Kipchoge's eyes light up. He points to an electric blue band he is wearing on his wrist, where four simple words are written.
""No human is limited.""
It could sound like an inane Instagram post from a social media influencer. Coming from the greatest marathon runner of all time it feels anything but.
At the Berlin Marathon last September, Kipchoge set a new world record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds, an incredible run that took 78 seconds off the previous best. It was the biggest single improvement for over 50 years.
Such a seismic step forward was no surprise. The Kenyan 34-year-old had served notice of his capabilities on 6 May 2017 when he ran 2:00:25 in Monza as part of Nike's Breaking2 project.
Nobody in history has gone closer to breaking the magical two-hour barrier.
That time is not considered a world best because pacemakers who could swap in and out were used, but while the record books have ignored it, the world at large could not possibly turn a blind eye.
Sixty-three years to the day since Roger Bannister's historic four-minute mile, running had been changed forever. The conversation had shifted from 'if' a two-hour marathon was possible to 'when'. For Kipchoge - the once-in-a-lifetime athlete responsible for shifting the sporting axis - the burning question is, how?
His answer lies in the power of the mind.
""The mind is what drives a human being,"" Kipchoge says. ""If you have that belief - pure belief in your heart - that you want to be successful then you can talk to your mind and your mind will control you to be successful.
""My mind is always free. My mind is flexible. That is why I wear this band on my wrist.
""I want to show the world that you can go beyond your thoughts, you can break more than you think you can break.""
Success in the world of marathon running is a lucrative business. Having won 10 of the 11 marathons he has entered since switching from track to road running in 2013, Kipchoge is a multi-millionaire.
However, money is not the motivation. Kipchoge believes that ""living simply sets you free"".
For nearly 300 days a year he lives and trains away from his wife and three children at a simple training centre in Kaptagat, a tiny village in the Kenyan highlands.
He is known as the ""boss man"" by his training partners but that doesn't stop him cleaning the toilets or doing his share of the daily chores. Eliud Kipchoge training in his native Kenya
""I enjoy the simplistic training and life in marathon,"" he says. ""You run, eat, sleep, walk around - that's how life is. You don't get complicated. The moment you get complicated it distracts your mind.""
Kipchoge was little more than a kid when he began his journey to becoming the greatest male marathon runner of all time.
At the 2003 World Championships in Paris, aged 18, he won 5,000m gold - a breakthrough victory all the more notable for two additional facts.
Firstly the time - a Championship record of 12:52.79 minutes which still stands today. Secondly the identity of the two men he outkicked in the finishing straight - 1500m world record holder Hicham El Guerrouj and future 5,000m world record holder Kenenisa Bekele.
His track career didn't quite progress as he might have liked from there.
Between 2004 and 2012 he won global medals galore but none of them with gold. Olympic bronze in 2004 was followed by silver in 2008. The only addition to his World Championship collection was a 5,000m silver medal at the 2007 championships in Osaka.
Having failed to even make the Kenyan team for the 2012 Olympics, he switched his focus to the roads. They have since been almost exclusively paved with gold.
Three of those 10 victories so far have come in London and he will start as heavy favourite to become the first man ever to win four on the streets of the English capital this weekend.
A world record is unlikely in London, not least because the course is far less favourable than that of Berlin, where the men's world record has been broken seven times in the past 16 years.
But in the future?
""One day, one time, someone will run under two hours,"" he says. An inquiry as to whether it could be him brings a laugh. ""Maybe. Maybe not.""
Brett Kirby certainly still believes.
He worked closely with Kipchoge as the lead physiologist on Nike's Breaking2 project and continues to advise the Kenyan and his coaches in areas such as strategy, workout analysis and race strategy.
""I think it's possible,"" he says. ""I think his race in Berlin [the world record last September] was incredible. And I don't see any decay.""
Kirby's belief is based on the many months he spent analysing Kipchoge during that Breaking2 project. Funded by Nike, it was three years in the making but had one simple goal. To produce the first ever sub-two-hour marathon.
The mere mention of the idea was enough to scare off plenty of prospective hopefuls. But not Kipchoge.
""When we started Breaking2 at the time it was very, very scary,"" Kirby says. ""Plenty of athletes were hesitant about doing it.
""For some the approach was either to be egotistical about it and say 'of course I can do it' or to be scared of it and just say 'it's not possible'.
""Eliud respected it, he became a partner in it. He had the discipline and fortitude to take on the challenge. It was amazing to see the respect he gave the idea.""
Respect married with the physical and mental capabilities.
""I don't even know how to describe how he has shown me how important the mind is,"" Kirby said in the Breaking2 documentary released by National Geographic in September 2017.
""I have a big, blank, open box for how I quantify the mind. How do I quantify a person's ability to push beyond what we thought was possible based on physiology alone?""
Eighteen months later Kirby is still working with Kipchoge and is still enjoying trying to work him out.
""On the surface, Eliud might look like just another Kenyan,"" Kirby says. ""But his mind is different, his body is different.
""In layman's terms he has the ability to both run fast and to maintain that speed for a long time. Some people can hold that speed for a half-marathon but being able to do it for a full marathon is what makes Eliud unique.
""Having that sustainable speed - that is the complete package. He always says that 'no human is limited' and he has shown that. In life and in sport. He is impactful as a human being and impactful as an athlete.
""Being disciplined, not just about the two-hour run you are doing but what you're doing the other 22 hours in the day as well. He has definitely changed me and shown and given us so much.""
Such discipline is plain to see in Kipchoge's company. The only time the calm demeanour shifts? A question regarding the ""failure"" of the Breaking2 project.
Kipchoge lurches forward. His eyes wide and his normally soft voice ever so slightly raised.
""Let me tell you one thing,"" he says. ""The Breaking2 project was the most successful project of the 21st century as far as sport is concerned. I have no regrets at all.""
A sense of what might have been would be understandable, because time is running out.
Kipchoge is widely regarded to be a few years older than 34. Kenyan runners often don't have birth certificates, having been raised in rural areas, leaving his birthday of 5 November 1984 perhaps uncertain.
And marathon running is a demanding occupation - even for a man like Kipchoge with his ""living simply will set you free"" ethos.
Paula Radcliffe knows the demands too well. When she set the women's world record of 2:17:18 in Chicago in 2002, the effort required was so extreme that she tore her colon. A year later she lowered that mark to 2:15:25.
Her record still stands today. In fact, Radcliffe remains over a minute and a half faster than her nearest rival, Kenya's Mary Keitany. Her physio Gerard Hartmann described her performances as ""going to Mars and beyond"". A stratospheric showing that Radcliffe based on some Kipchoge-esque simplicity.
""Some people would look at his life and say that is a sacrifice,"" Radcliffe says. ""I had that singular focus in my career too but I never saw it as a sacrifice. I loved it.""
Radcliffe believes Kipchoge still has the capabilities to run under two hours, but has her doubts over whether it will happen.
""If anyone is capable of running sub two hours then he is,"" she says.
""He is definitely the closest but now, I am not sure. It depends on how many more fast marathons he has in him because everyone has a finite point when you start to slow down. That is different for everyone.
""For me, I ran every single one of my marathons flat out and so it was probably a bit shorter.
""Eliud has not done that in all of his marathons which might help, but it's difficult to say when he might slow down. I don't know how old he genuinely is. At some point he is going to slow down and that is why I am so happy he got the world record in Berlin.""
Kipchoge is optimistic on the subject of how long he has left.
""You'll still see me around,"" he says. ""I think there are still beautiful things in store. I am still there to do some cool things.""
And when he does say finally say farewell?
""After I retire my plan is to concentrate on inspiring people.
""My dream is to make this world a running world. A running world is a healthy world. A running world is a wealthy world. A running world is a peaceful world. A running world is a joyful world.
""There is freedom in running. Go and run and your mind will be free. That is what is needed in the whole planet.""

Putin mulls easing Russian passport rules for whole Ukraine - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48078842,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption A woman poses with her Ukrainian passport (blue) and new Russian passport (red) in Simferopol, Crimea Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is considering extending a scheme that makes it easier for Ukrainians to obtain Russian citizenship.
This week he signed a decree that offers people in eastern Ukraine's separatist territories Russian passports in less than three months.
Now he says he may extend the scheme to the whole of Ukraine.
Ukrainian politicians accuse Russia of trying to make Ukraine's territorial divide permanent.
Ukraine country profile Relations between the two countries were further strained this week when Ukraine's parliament passed a law making the use of the Ukrainian language mandatory for public sector workers.
Russia says the move discriminates against Russian speakers in Ukraine - for many, particularly in eastern regions, Russian is still the first language.
The new tensions add to the challenges facing Ukraine's President-elect, Volodymyr Zelensky, who ousted Petro Poroshenko at last Sunday's election by a landslide.
What did Putin say exactly? On Wednesday, the Russian leader announced the passport scheme would be applied to Donetsk and Luhansk, the self-declared republics seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
Crimea itself was incorporated into Russia, giving its inhabitants the same citizenship rights as those in Russia.
Mr Putin said people living in Donetsk and Luhansk who considered themselves Russian were entitled to Russian passports.
""For many years already - about 10 years - Poland has been giving out passports, Hungary has also been doing so, to Hungarians, and Romania... so are Russians living in Ukraine worse than Poles, Hungarians?"" he said.
Mr Putin said earlier that people living in the rebel territories were ""completely deprived of civil rights"" and could not ""move normally"" or ""realise their most elementary needs"".
On Saturday, he announced: ""We are considering providing a simplified procedure [of obtaining Russian citizenship] to all the residents of Ukraine.""
What is Ukraine's position on the citizenship move? In a Facebook post after Wednesday's announcement abut the Russian passport move, Mr Zelensky's team called Russia ""an aggressor state which wages war against Ukraine"".
""This [Mr Putin's] decree is not bringing us closer to achieving the ultimate goal: a ceasefire,"" it said.
The armed conflict in Ukraine has claimed about 13,000 lives since 2014.
Mr Zelensky was elected as Ukraine's next president on Sunday , with no previous political experience. He played the role of president in a comedy television show.
What does a comic president mean for Ukraine? Zelensky team plans Ukraine anti-corruption drive In the run-up to his election, he had said he wanted to ""renew relations"" with eastern Ukraine and start a ""powerful information war to end the conflict"".
In response, Russia said it wanted him to show ""sound judgement"", ""honesty"" and ""pragmatism"" so that relations could improve.
What is the new language law? Under the new law:
Ukrainian must be used for signs, letters and in adverts Local TV channels are set a target of 90% Ukrainian content Ukrainian should be used for all official duties of public servants ranging from the president to judges, doctors and bank workers Mr Zelensky, whose own first language is Russian, defended the new legislation, which his opponent Petro Poroshenko had championed.
However, he added that he intended to review it once he took office. He said he would conduct a ""detailed analysis of this law to make sure that all constitutional rights and the interests of all Ukrainian citizens are respected in it""."
