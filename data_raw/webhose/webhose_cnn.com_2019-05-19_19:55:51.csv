Slowing US growth could be good for investors - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Anneken Tappe, CNN Business",04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/investing/stocks-week-ahead-us-growth/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) 1. US first quarter GDP: The first report card of the year for the American economy is due on Friday. Hold tight.
Investors will be watching closely after worries about a global and US economic slowdown weighed on their minds at the start of the year. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates 2.8% real GDP growth in January through March, while analysts polled by Refinitiv forecast an average of 1.9%. A weaker than expected GDP reading could pull stocks and other assets lower. Government stimulus, like tax reform, boosted the economy last year, but that's now petering out. The US economy is widely expected to grow at a slower speed in 2019 than last year's 2.6% . First quarter growth tends to be weaker due to seasonal factors. This year, the data will also reflect the partial government government shutdown, the longest in US history , which started in December but went on for much of January. Read More But Friday's GDP number is only the first of three, and revisions are common, so any initial reaction could be short-lived. ""Slowing down is fine, as long as there is no recession,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual. The more than 4% annualized growth figure the United States reported for the second quarter of 2018 was certainly outside the trend. GDP slowing to what many economists say is a more sustainable level will keep inflation around 2%, the Federal Reserve's target, and will prolong the economic growth cycle, Schutte said. On the back of that, fears of an impending recession are letting up, he added. There are other positive signs. The US trade deficit narrowed by more than expected to $49.4 billion in February, its best reading in more than 18 months, data showed last Wednesday. And this bodes well for Friday's GDP number. As market expectations for economic growth look up again, stocks in cyclical sectors like construction and manufacturing should outperform those in defensive industries like healthcare. The next driver to lead stocks across the board higher will be global growth, Schutte said. Just a few months ago, analysts promised doom and gloom for the world economy. But if last week's better-than-expected Chinese GDP data is any indication, those worries may have been overdone. China economic stimulus seems to be working, alleviating global concerns for now, although worries over the health of Europe's economy remain. 2. Tech and Tesla: Earnings season is in full bloom, and this week's results will include Twitter ( TWTR ) , Facebook ( FB ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) . Tesla ( TSLA ) will also report results, and the company is again in focus over its supply constraints and sales slump. Earlier this month, Tesla reported a massive drop in sales for the first quarter . The earnings report will show how the annual target for deliveries will be affected. So far, the company has not changed its guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for the year. For Amazon, there could be increased focus on Amazon Prime given Disney ( DIS ) 's venture into the streaming realm with the announcement of Disney+, as well as Apple ( AAPL ) 's new streaming service. 3. Boeing and the 737 Max turbulence: Boeing will report quarterly results on Wednesday. Its earnings are expected to take a hit after the grounding of its 737 Max planes after two fatal crashes. How bad a quarter, and how long the problem will last, is what Wall Street is waiting to see. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv forecast that earnings per share fell 11% in the quarter compared to a year earlier. Before the crisis, Boeing ( BA ) had been expected to report higher earnings. Boeing halted deliveries of the jets on March 14 due to the grounding, so there was only about two weeks of lost sales revenue. The forecasts for the second quarter have already taken an even bigger hit. Investors will be particularly eager to hear when the grounding will be lifted. They will also want Boeing's outlook for deliveries and orders for the jet going forward. Boeing is working to find an acceptable software fix to the safety system that is now the focus of investigations into the crashes. 4. European bank earnings: A number of European banks will follow their American peers and share first-quarter earnings this week. Investors who worried that the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes will crimp lending growth in the United States are unlikely to find relief abroad. Europe's banks are under pressure from sluggish economic growth, as well as the European Central Bank's decision to keep interest rates in negative territory until at least the end of 2019. Unlike the Fed, the ECB has not yet raised interest rates since slashing them to record lows in the aftermath of the European sovereign debt crisis. Particular attention will be paid to results from Deutsche Bank ( DB ) on Friday, as merger talks with Germany's Commerzbank ( CRZBF ) drag on. 5. Coming this week: Monday — European markets are closed, Tesla holds its investor day Tuesday —Twitter, Snap ( SNAP ) and Procter & Gamble ( PG ) earnings Wednesday — Facebook, Boeing, and Tesla earnings Thursday — Amazon and Starbucks ( SBUX ) earnings Friday — US first-quarter GDP due at 8:30 a.m. ET; April consumer sentiment due at 10 a.m. ET -- CNN Business' Julia Horowitz and Chris Isidore contributed to this report."
Mueller report is quite the page-turner (opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Richard Galant,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/mueller-report-is-quite-the-page-turner-galant/index.html,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
(CNN) When it finally came to light this week, special counsel Robert Mueller's report seemed to animate everyone -- and satisfy no one.
The report's 448 pages (with 946 redactions, courtesy of Attorney General William Barr) laid out evidence of a systematic campaign by the Russian government to undermine American democracy -- and of President Donald Trump's efforts to throw sand in the gears of the law enforcement machine that was investigating him. At the same time, Trump's defenders could point to Mueller's conclusions that the President's 2016 campaign did not illegally coordinate with the Russians and that he would not charge the President with obstructing justice. That measured verdict gave ammunition to all sides. The report, wrote Princeton historian Julian Zelizer, "" does not exonerate him from obstruction of justice -- the charge at the heart of Presidents Nixon's and Clinton's impeachment processes. The Mueller team found multiple instances where Trump tried to stifle a legitimate investigation into his own conduct. Very often the only thing that saved him were advisers who wouldn't do what he wanted done. ... Indeed, if this is a 'good' report for the President, it is hard to imagine what a bad one would look like."" But for a Republican commentator, the report's findings were more than enough reason to turn the page: ""It's a painful pill for Trump critics to swallow, but ill-advised is not illegal, unsavory is not unlawful, and chaos is not a conspiracy,"" observed Alice Stewart . The report can be summed up in ""four simple words: Russiagate was no Watergate ."" Read More What if Trump said... To truly turn the page, though, might require the kind of presidential speech Trump could never give, wrote CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen . He imagined these healing words : ""My fellow Americans. ...The special counsel's report has cleared me and my team from conspiracy but I have to acknowledge that the report also paints a devastating portrait of the Russian efforts to manipulate our electoral process. Therefore, I now accept that this was not the possible work of 'some guy in his home in New Jersey' as I said during the transition. ...In fact, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his henchmen are the only ones to blame. This is a disgrace and I am instructing my national security team to prevent any kind of repeat of what happened in 2016 ..."" Barr at the barricades Barr, who released the Mueller report, set the table for it with the four-page letter he wrote last month, disclosing some of Mueller's findings and adding his own determination that Trump wouldn't be charged with obstruction. Then, minutes before the report's release on Thursday, Barr held a news conference that seemed designed to further shape how the public would perceive the report. Many were outraged. "" William Barr has cemented his status as a crafty partisan whose primary tricks are to cloak his political moves to shape public opinion and to protect President Trump under a thin sheen of law and process,"" wrote CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Elie Honig . Journalist Jill Filipovic observed that the attorney general appeared to be trying to make excuses for Trump's behavior, as described in the Mueller report, because of what he called Trump's ""sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency."" A woman under those circumstances would be accused of surrendering to her emotions and wouldn't get any sympathy. ""Men in an emotional tailspin have 'sincere beliefs,'"" she noted. "" Trump is perhaps the most emotionally unbalanced national politician in living memory, tweeting semi-literate all-caps outbursts and frothing up his followers with incoherent tirades."" The defects in the Barr-driven process aren't only his fault, wrote CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin . They were a glaring illustration of why it was a mistake for Congress to abolish powerful independent counsels after the Ken Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton. Notre Dame will rebuild Easter Sunday began in Paris with parts of the ancient Notre Dame Cathedral in ruins and with the French nation vowing to rebuild. The Monday fire that destroyed the roof and collapsed the spire of the church, which has sat on an island in the Seine for eight centuries, riveted and saddened people around the world. "" What a week for this fire to happen : a time when thousands of worshippers in France were readying themselves through penitence and prayer for the Passion, for Easter itself -- the celebration that comes on Resurrection Sunday,"" wrote Jay Parini. ""It felt like the entire world was in pain,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""In a time of inflamed political, religious and sectarian divisions, somehow, a fire in a Catholic church, a cathedral in France, managed to melt away the animosity -- if only for a moment -- and bring people together in shared sorrow. Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jew, or atheist; in France, India, Argentina, everywhere."" In the National Review, Rich Lowry wrote, ""Notre Dame stands for so many qualities that we now lack -- patience and staying power, the cultivation of beauty, a deep religious faith, the cultural confidence and ambition to build a timeless monument of our civilization -- that the collapse of its spire was almost too much to bear ."" The fire brought painful memories, and also a sense of determination, to Katie Hawkins-Gaar . As newlyweds, she and her husband Jamie took pictures in front of the cathedral in 2008 and vowed to return to Paris every five years. But when Katie returned in 2018, she was alone -- and carrying her husband's ashes. He had collapsed and died while running a half-marathon at the age of 32. "" Everything is ephemeral, including the people and places we love ,"" she wrote. ""Notre Dame will rebuild. And so will I."" Lessons of rebuilding That same spirit emerged in the words of people connected with two American churches that are rebuilding after fires: Christine Behnke , parish education director of Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church UAC in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, wrote: ""After watching a news report about Notre Dame Monday, I went and stood in Trinity's dark, damp, scarred sanctuary. ... All the ash has been removed, scaffolding erected and a temporary roof covers the nave. ... We really are rising from the ashes! "" The Rev. Richard Hong , pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Englewood, New Jersey, recalled that after the fire at his church, ""while strangers were sending me messages about how devastated they were upon hearing about it, our members were not devastated. ... We lost our building, but we still had our church -- because we still had each other, and God was with us. God still is with us."" Tiger Woods is back Wearing the famous green jacket, Tiger Woods celebrated his first Masters win since 2005, in a comeback that energized fans and the sport of golf. Sports historian Amy Bass described it as "" a return to grace after a fall documented everywhere , from the lurid tabloid headlines chronicling his marital infidelity and divorce to the medical journals outlining the odyssey of his multiple injuries and ongoing back pain."" Not surprised by Aunt Becky's rule-breaking Gerry Brooks , an elementary school principal in Lexington, Kentucky, shared a sobering take on the college admissions scandal, focusing on ""Aunt Becky,"" the character played by Lori Loughlin in ""Full House."" "" Do you know who isn't surprised by the situation? Every educator in America ,"" Brooks wrote. ""This thing occurs all the time, in every school."" ""When a parent signs a reading log saying a child read for 10 minutes that night but they really didn't, because they were out late for a sports event or just didn't have time, they are basically doing the same thing. They believe a rule or policy is not important or dumb or optional. Do you know who else thought the rules were dumb? Aunt Becky."" Roxanne Jones asked: What's the right punishment in the college admissions scandal? In her view, jail time shouldn't be off the table. ""No matter how many times we see justice seemingly tip in favor of the rich, or famous, Americans still want to believe we all have an equal shot . That money and privilege don't always win. That hard work and integrity still matter. The college cheating scandal puts those notions to the test."" What immigrants contribute Controversy continued to swirl around Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Democrat from Minnesota, but retired Real Adm. John Kirby , a CNN national security analyst, came to her defense. ""One could argue that Rep. Omar's use of 'some people' to describe the 9-11 hijackers was cavalier. Maybe it was,"" Kirby wrote. ""But her larger point was valid: those hijackers and the terrorist groups who survive them do not represent all Muslims , at home or abroad. And it's just plain wrong -- un-American, really -- to hold in disdain an entire community of our fellow citizens for the evil act of a few who perverted their faith. ... I've seen commentary online not only deriding Muslims as people, but also denying any contribution they made to our history."" Kirby recalled a 2006 visit to Fallujah, Iraq, where he met an immigrant from Pakistan, Dr. Saleem Khan, a Navy surgeon. Khan was on his fifth tour in Iraq at that point and would go on to complete another three combat deployments, earning the Bronze Star and the Legion of Merit. ""I'll never forget what he told me that day: 'I don't want anyone to ever say that, as an immigrant, I did not pay my dues.'"" Detaining the asylum-seekers With Barr, the attorney general, ruling out the release of some asylum-seekers who have shown a credible case for avoiding deportation, the Trump administration's immigration crackdown grew. For those, like author Barbara Fischkin , who are the descendants of refugees to the United States, the move seemed particularly cruel. A century ago, her mother, then 6 years old, escaped one of a series of pogroms in the Ukraine, in which more than 100,000 Jews died. She ""ran into the woods and hid in a haystack where she might have frozen to death if not for a Catholic farmer who risked his own life to take her to his home. It is likely that the local band of young nationalists would have killed him if they found out."" Eventually her mother's family made its way to the United States, where they have annually observed the spiritual injunction of Passover, which started Friday evening, to welcome the stranger. ""After my grandfather immigrated to the US, he insisted that every Seder end with his own, booming Yiddish-accented rendition of 'God Bless America.' I will sing this at our Seder and also hope that migrants and other immigrants in peril can sing it here and live comfortably in the open."" How to save the planet As Earth Day approaches on Monday, it's worth focusing on the crucial role of farming in determining the health of the planet. Bethany Cianciolo, who edits the Perspectives section of CNN Business, noted via email that two chief executives co-wrote an op-ed this week making the case for going back to basics. Rose Marcario , president and CEO of Patagonia, and David Bronner , CEO of Dr. Bronner's, argued that farmers should rotate crops, compost, plant cover crops and reduce tillage rather than rely on fertilizers and soil-mixing machines. ""Over time, as chemically degraded soil starts to come back to life, crop yields from regenerative organic agriculture can outperform conventional methods, meaning we can feed a growing global population without destroying the planet. "" Don't miss these: • Brandon Tensley : The real power of 'pulling a Beyoncé' • Thomas Maier : The evidence that the US government got into the assassination business • Jill Filipovic : 'Selfie' deaths: Don't blame victims • Samantha Vinograd : Trump's third date with Kim will likely be as unsuccessful as the last one • Steven Mnuchin : The Tax Cuts and Jobs act is working • Peggy Drexler : Georgia Engel, Mary Tyler Moore's sidekick, showed that spacy can be smart"
A white driver faces hate crime charges after he allegedly tried to hit an interracial couple with his truck - CNN,www.cnn.com,Rebekah Riess and Dakin Andone,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/louisiana-hate-crime-interracial-couple/index.html,"(CNN) A Louisiana man has been arrested and booked on charges including committing a hate crime after he allegedly accelerated his truck toward an interracial couple in a suburban New Orleans parking lot, according to the local sheriff's office.
James Descant, who is white, is accused of driving his vehicle toward a black man and a white woman in a convenience store's parking lot around 9 p.m. Tuesday in Metairie, said Capt. Jason Rivarde of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. The vehicle hit the woman, causing injuries to her hip, wrist and foot. Prosecutor adds hate crimes to charges against Louisiana church fire suspect Descant allegedly attacked the couple because he was upset about their interracial relationship, Rivarde told CNN. The couple -- a black man and a white woman -- told police they had interacted with Descant at a local motel within a week of the incident. Descant was arrested Wednesday and charged with aggravated second-degree battery, aggravated assault, damaging property and hate crimes , records show. He is being held at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. Read More CNN was unable to immediately determine whether Descant is represented by an attorney. Descant's arrest comes weeks after the burning of three historically black churches in Louisiana captured the nation's attention. The suspect in that case pleaded not guilty this week to hate crimes and arson charges. "

Rudy Giuliani: 'There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/rudy-giuliani-trump-russia-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said while he would have advised the Trump campaign to avoid Russian help, he thought there was nothing wrong with a campaign taking information from Russia.
""There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians,"" Giuliani said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper if he would have taken information from a foreign source, Giuliani said, ""I probably wouldn't."" What we learned watching Robert Mueller for 18 months ""I wasn't asked,"" Giuliani said. ""I would have advised, just out of excess of caution, don't do it."" Giuliani's comments came in an extended rebuttal to Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, who issued a statement Friday saying he was ""sickened"" by the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller's recently released report. Read More The former New York mayor -- and 2008 presidential candidate in a GOP field that included Romney -- said Romney should ""stop the bull,"" but conceded he did not know that Romney accepted information from foreign sources. Romney, in his statement Friday, said he took issue with both the dishonesty documented in the Mueller report and that ""fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia."" Giuliani knocks Mueller's investigators as 'unfair' to Trump ""Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders,"" Romney said. Former US Attorney Preet Bharara, a CNN legal analyst, said in a separate interview during the same program that he hoped Giuliani would retract his statement. ""The idea that it is OK, separate and apart from it being a criminal offense, that we should be telling future candidates in the run-up to an election in 2020 that if an adversary, a foreign adversary, is offering information against a political opponent, that it's okay and right and proper and American and patriotic, it seems he's saying, to take that information and that's okay -- that's an extraordinary statement and I would hope he would retract it,"" Bharara said."
Joseph Stiglitz: Corporate greed is accelerating climate change. But we can still head off disaster - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Joseph E. Stiglitz for CNN Business,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/perspectives/joseph-stiglitz-earth-day-economy/index.html,"Joseph E. Stiglitz is University Professor at Columbia University and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is also the co-chair of the High-Level Expert Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress at the OECD, and the chief economist of the Roosevelt Institute. His latest book, People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent, will be released by W.W. Norton on April 23. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.
America's economy has not been working for a large portion of the country. Workers at the bottom of the income scale earn wages, adjusted for inflation, that are not much higher than what they were 60 years ago , while the income of a typical full‐time male worker hasn't budged much from 40 years ago . In addition, life expectancy is in decline. But the economy is not only failing American citizens. It's failing the planet, and that means it's failing future generations.
There are many reasons for our plight, including corporate power and greed centered on immediate profits and little regard for the impacts business decisions have on low-income Americans and the environment. Corporations have translated their economic power into political power, lobbying for policies that give them free rein to despoil the environment; and the swamp President Donald Trump promised to drain has been overflowing. At the same time, Trump has publicly asserted that climate change is a hoax, and yet his administration has repeatedly been forced to admit it is a reality — in response to climate lawsuits such as Juliana v. United States , for which I'm an expert witness. More Markets & Economy Perspectives It's a tough time for trade. But emerging economies are moving ahead
What to expect from 2019's 'post-peak' economy
Why the US would never win a trade war with China
Climate change is real, and it includes not only an increase in the average temperature, but also more extreme weather events including droughts, floods and hurricanes that have led to a large number of deaths. The United States has borne enormous costs as a result of the warming planet — in 2017 , more than 1.5% of GDP . By the end of this century, some sectors of the US economy, including agriculture and energy , could lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year because of climate change, according to the latest report issued by the U.S. Global Change Research Program . So there is a real urgency to respond to our economic malaise and our climate crisis. The good news on this Earth Day is that these are problems of our own making, and that means a change toward pro-Earth policies can make a big difference. Even better, the major investments we need to respond to the crisis would be a spur to the economy. This is one of the central messages of the Green New Deal. The transition to the ""green economy,"" in which we rely on renewable energy, won't happen on its own, however. It will require a mobilization of resources — the kind we saw during the New Deal and the Second World War. Government will have to take the lead, and it will require public investments — including in infrastructure and research — and regulations. Environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act can and have worked, and typically are very cost‐effective. Without these measures, our air would be even more unbreathable than the air in New Delhi or Beijing today. Read More Dealing effectively with climate change is well within our reach; in fact, I recently co‐chaired an international commission that showed that the global goals of limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius were clearly achievable. It would make so much more sense to spend money retrofitting our economy to reduce the risk of disastrous climate change rather than spending money to deal with the enormous economic and human costs of coping with its consequences. Some of the required resources would come simply from eliminating the huge subsidies we provide for fossil fuels, or from taxing corporations that inflict damage on our environment. This would encourage corporations to work hard to prevent it. But there are broader changes that would help grow the economy, providing some of the needed resources: curbing the excesses of corporate power more generally would lead to a more efficient economy and to more equality. So, too, would curbing the abuses of corporate governance, like CEOs paying themselves so much at the expense both of workers and investment. Policies that reduce discrimination in the labor market and provide more flexibility in hours are examples of supply‐side measures that work. And over the long run, education policies that help all citizens live up to their potential would also help the economy grow. The mobilization during World War II had some long‐term salutary effects on our economy and society: It brought women into the labor force and it helped transform us from an agrarian to an urban society. The mobilization required to fight climate change has a similar potential. As we restructure our economy and society away from a high‐carbon economy and toward a more sustainable one, we should seize this opportunity to create the society that benefits all of us, as well as the planet."

Watched by rockstar Bruce Springsteen and Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, the tight course in the compact, sandy arena of Miami Beach saw seven riders retire in the first round while only three went clear in the jump-off on a hot and humid day. ""It was tough sport, it was of the highest level sport, but it's normal, it's Global Champions Tour, the best riders of the world,"" said Devos. ""It was difficult, it was very delicate jumping, faults everywhere. That's why I was so happy with my mare, Claire, she jumped amazing."" The Global Champions Tour, show jumping's richest circuit, consists of a record 20 stops in 2019, including new venues in New York, Montreal and Stockholm. The season will finish with the GC Prague Playoffs November 21-24. READ: Jerome Guery wins LGCT Mexico City READ: Julien Epaillard edges Ben Maher in Doha Jump-off Edwina Tops-Alexander of Australia, a two-time winner in Miami Beach, began the jump-off with a fast ride of 37.38 seconds, but her horse California touched a rail coming out of the double. Tops-Alexander, a two-time overall winner, watched from the warmup arena as the next four riders -- Olivier Philippaerts of Belgium, Daniel Deusser and Christian Ahlmann of Germany and Britain's Scott Brash -- all failed to jump clear. Devos entered the arena as the sixth rider knowing that a clear round would guarantee him a spot on the podium. He expertly guided his mare around the course, taking a tight turn into the last jump to finish in the same time as Tops-Alexander, but taking the lead as he made no mistakes.

Would the last rider, the experienced Smolders of the Netherlands, spoil the party for Devos?

Earlier in the day, the Global Champions League team event went down to the wire after no teams managed to produce a double clear during the first round on Thursday, which saw New York Empire being eliminated. After Shanghai Swans swept the first two legs of the GCL, Miami Celtics pulled off a sensational home win as the Irish duo of Shane Breen and Michael Duffy produced a double clear on Saturday to finish with a total of six penalties. ""We've had our ups and downs, and it's nice to come back here on home turf,"" Duffy told a news conference. When asked if he had felt any pressure after his team mate and friend had gone clear, Duffy said: ""Pressure is for tyres."" St Tropez Pirates, with Athina Onassis of Greece and Devos, were in second place with a total of seven penalties, while Emil Hallundbaek of Denmark and Baryard-Johnsson kicked off their new partnership for Berlin Eagles with a third-place finish, on eight penalties. The Celtics, who had been lying in fourth place after the first round, moved to third place in the overall classification with 59 points, just one behind St Tropez Pirates. The Swans, the winners in Doha and Mexico City, remain the overall leaders with 79 points. After Doha, Mexico Ciy and Miami Beach, the Global Champions Tour now heads to Asia, with Shanghai hosting the fourth leg on May 3-5."

Rudy Giuliani: 'There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians' CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/rudy-giuliani-trump-russia-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said while he would have advised the Trump campaign to avoid Russian help, he thought there was nothing wrong with a campaign taking information from Russia.
""There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians,"" Giuliani said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper if he would have taken information from a foreign source, Giuliani said, ""I probably wouldn't."" ""I wasn't asked,"" Giuliani said. ""I would have advised, just out of excess of caution, don't do it."" Giuliani's comments came in an extended rebuttal to Utah GOP Sen.

""Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders,"" Romney said. Former US Attorney Preet Bharara, a CNN legal analyst, said in a separate interview during the same program that he hoped Giuliani would retract his statement. ""The idea that it is OK, separate and apart from it being a criminal offense, that we should be telling future candidates in the run-up to an election in 2020 that if an adversary, a foreign adversary, is offering information against a political opponent, that it's okay and right and proper and American and patriotic, it seems he's saying, to take that information and that's okay -- that's an extraordinary statement and I would hope he would retract it,"" Bharara said."
Tim Ryan does not support impeachment proceedings against Trump: 'Let the process play itself out' CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/tim-ryan-trump-impeachment-mueller-cnntv/index.html,"(CNN) 2020 Democratic candidate Tim Ryan said he does not support beginning the impeachment process against President Donald Trump, even though he argued that special counsel Robert Mueller's report shows the President committed obstruction of justice .
""Let the process play itself out,"" Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday on ""State of the Union."" Though he argued ""it's pretty clear that the President obstructed on several different occasions,"" Ryan said he believes the ""first step"" should be for House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler to ""continue to open up this investigation to better understand this."" ""Let the Judiciary Committee look at this. There's a process in place here,"" Ryan said, adding: ""I think that's the natural next step, and let's see where that leaves."" Nadler said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" he thinks some of the matters brought forth in the Mueller report, if proven, are impeachable for President Donald Trump. He, however, did not specifically call for impeachment hearings, saying he first wants to hear Mueller's testimony in front of the committee.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another 2020 Democratic candidate, called on Friday for the House to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Ryan told CNN on Sunday that while he ""(understands) their move to try to impeach"" Trump, ""I would rather us take this next step, educate the American people, really get these details out."" ""This is a very nuanced document,"" Ryan said of the redacted report, adding later that ""it's very detailed, the American people, through this process, will get up to speed with how this administration has been behaving. The Mueller report said the special counsel's investigation does not exonerate Trump of criminal conduct on the issue of obstruction.

But House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff told ""Fox News Sunday"" there will be a Democratic caucus meeting in the next couple of weeks ""to figure out what the best course is"" on whether to proceed with impeachment. ""We will have to decide, do we nonetheless go through an impeachment because to do otherwise would signal that somehow this President's conduct is okay, that future presidents can engage in this kind of corruption without consequence, or do we decide that we are better off doing oversight through the context of oversight hearings by the various committees rather than a formal impeachment?""

So, in addition to other newsgathering efforts, CNN had journalists who stood outside their offices. Journalists often call this a stakeout. Here, the CNN team lays out the backstory of their assignment and how this investment of time yielded big journalistic returns.
The first challenge for CNN's nearly 18-month stakeout of special counsel Robert Mueller was finding the man himself. It all started on a chilly autumn morning in 2017, watching the sun rise over southwest Washington. After a day of staking out what we suspected to be Mueller's base of operations, a man with a red backpack crossed the street. Peter Carr was known as Mueller's spokesman, and he unwittingly led us to paydirt: a set of glass doors leading to a plain office building -- a classic example of the form in a part of town that was once an industrial hub but is now full of concrete and glass office buildings. Over the next year, we glued ourselves to the various entrances to try to catch a glimpse of the comings and goings of the major and minor players involved in the investigation. Eventually, we discovered when Mueller zipped into work in his signature silver Subaru, and identified his team of prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff who also drove or walked into the special counsel's office. There were garages, loading docks, front doors -- all part of the office complex. But we couldn't be at the garage and the front door at the same time to catch everything. Often, it was a gamble about where to stand and watch and risk missing something important. Read More Spotting Mueller beyond his daily entrance and exit in his car was difficult. And then, about a year after CNN started staking out Mueller's office regularly, out of the corner of our eyes, through the lobby window, a tall, silver-haired man came out from one hallway. Two seconds later, he disappeared into another hallway. We ran to the side to the garage to see if we could catch the man leaving. Success. There he was -- the elusive Robert Mueller, spotted not just coming and leaving through the garage but in the lobby. So the coffee shop became ""our spot."" Not just to see Mueller. If we were perched at the right seat, we could partially see into the building's lobby and catch glimpses of people coming and going. Not to mention the special counsel team coming in and out of the cafe themselves given its proximity and convenience. It was a key moment for the four of us -- two different pairs of CNN reporters over the course of the 22-month investigation -- who took shifts in the daily routine of standing outside the garage and office building and sitting inside the coffee shop, observing the movements of various prosecutors and FBI personnel, marking the times and sending dispatches back to CNN's Washington bureau to help inform, and in some cases, advance the broader story. A passerby at one point jokingly dubbed the CNN team 'TMZ', after the site that makes ample use of paparazzi. But the point wasn't to ambush people by snapping pictures. The point was to help the public know what its government was doing. Time and time again, CNN was able to penetrate the wall of secrecy surrounding Mueller's team thanks to key observations and break news about what the special counsel was up to, from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's cooperation sessions to the secret indictment of Roger Stone . The work was sometimes thrilling, often monotonous and always continued no matter rain, sleet or snow. Countless hours were spent watching, and by extension, listening -- to music, podcasts, Russian talk radio for one journalist, or Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow's daily radio show in hopes of hearing something Mueller-related -- to pass the time. Even though the stakeouts could be exhausting, there were moments when the full weight of the responsibility would hit us. Often we were the only journalistic eyes and ears on the ground at Mueller's office -- not just for all of CNN, but all of the world. It was history. JUST WATCHED What's in the Mueller report?

What's in the Mueller report? CNN breaks it down 07:37 The daily plan Our mornings followed a pretty standard routine: one of us would arrive around 6:50 a.m., set up our camera by the garage, and look for Mueller and his team to arrive. Often at least one prosecutor or FBI agent beat Mueller into the office. Most came by car, but some walked in from a nearby Metro station. One frequently rode a motorized scooter. By mid-morning, we would move to the front entrance of the building, where a courtyard separated us from visitors, defense counsel and possible witnesses. We took hundreds of photographs of strangers we thought looked ""lawyerly"" entering and leaving the premises, and we were always on the lookout for clues. At lunch, we waited for prosecutors and FBI personnel to emerge for Korean BBQ or Mexican food at the nearby food trucks, and sandwiches at the coffee shop. The daily lunch hour was our opportunity to spot anyone we had missed that morning and conduct a final headcount of who did or didn't show up to work that day. Afternoons were generally slower -- though not always. Finally, by 5 p.m., we would sweep the area, check for any departures and then head out. Of course, we were not invisible -- that wasn't the aim. And while the special counsel team was famously tight-lipped, sometimes they had questions for us. On one federal holiday, prosecutor Aaron Zebley with the special counsel's office stopped to ask us if Mueller had yet to arrive, knowing we probably had the answer. (We did -- Mueller wasn't in yet.) But the team was guarded, respecting their boss' serious ""no leak"" policy. Questions about the investigation were off the table. Polite hellos and 'how are yous' were the only things exchanged. (The special counsel's office is aware of this story.) Sometimes journalists from other organizations were there, often not. And we were right in the middle of it, even if we were just standing on the sidewalk. Paul Manafort and the ice cream social There was a rhythm to Mueller's office -- so changes from the ordinary helped us decipher what was happening. Like on September 13, 2018, when there was free ice cream in the plaza. Mueller's team was approaching a deal with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, but you never would have known it from the tiki-themed ice cream event the building management threw in the courtyard. The courtyard outside of Mueller's office was full of people -- including members of the special counsel team like Carr, prosecutor Michael Dreeben, and several FBI agents -- who all came down for free scoops. Carr even returned for seconds. Then, a big clue. At 2:40 p.m., when a paralegal who we knew to be part of the Manafort defense team went into the nearby cafe, emerging with a pizza, four sandwiches and four sodas -- just enough, we surmised, for himself and Paul Manafort's three lawyers. At the end of the day, a black Dodge Durango left the Mueller's office loading dock -- half an hour after Mueller left. (The Durango was one of many ordinary, plain vehicles the special counsel's office used to transport witnesses and members of the team.) Mueller's report leaves open possibility of post-White House criminal exposure for Trump About a week later, the proffer sessions began in earnest. While the rest of the country was gearing up for the midterms, Manafort and his legal team were visiting the special counsel on a nearly weekly basis, adding up to a total of nine sessions. It was during many of these sessions when, we later learned, Manafort was later accused of lying to prosecutors. Every morning, we were on the lookout for what would come first: a black government car with tinted windows which we figured out was transporting Manafort from jail and into the loading dock, or Manafort's lawyers coming in on foot -- often led by lead defense attorney Kevin Downing ready with a joke. How are negotiations going with the Mueller team? ""Just having lunch, tacos around the corner,"" he said, holding the bag open to see, before moving on. Why they were there following Manafort's agreement to waive having an attorney present as part of his plea deal? He motioned across the plaza: ""There's great sandwiches over there."" The mystery case Over time, we trained our eyes to recognize not only Mueller from where we sat in the coffee shop but everyone else we knew who worked at the special counsel's office, whether they were walking toward us or away from us, or with a crowd of people. (The government shutdown, which drastically reduced foot traffic in the plaza, helped confirm this as well.) At the same time, any deviation caused consternation in the CNN office. One day in December 2018, Mueller wasn't seen coming in, and an email returned half-jokingly with:""SO MUELLER IS MISSING?!"" The unofficial FBI uniform of a bright white dress shirt -- Mueller does not like his team wearing shirts with patterns -- and a dark suit helped to spot people from far away, too. We realized that when a group of people -- prosecutors, FBI agents, DOJ paralegals or administrative personnel -- headed to the garage, we could catch them leaving and send a heads up to our colleagues at US District Court, roughly five minutes away. We could run to the side to the garage, too, to see which tinted car they left in and in which direction they were headed.

Mystery grand jury in Mueller probe explained 02:10 We reverse-engineered this method as well; if we saw a car drive into the special counsel's office, we could run to the front to see who was coming up from the garage and into the lobby elevators. On December 14, 2018, a hearing at the DC court of appeals about a mysterious grand jury subpoena was to occur. The case, long suspected to be related to Mueller's investigation, was sealed and secretive -- the court had taken great precautions to keep the identity of the defense lawyers and prosecutors anonymous by clearing the entire fifth floor of any journalists. RELATED: Mystery Mueller mayhem at a Washington court As the press corps teamed up to stake out the courthouse, we knew that members of the special counsel's office drove out in a black DOJ car that day, and they would presumably drive the car back. We waited at the side for the car to return and ran to the front where we observed prosecutors Zainab Ahmad, Dreeben, Andrew Weissmann, Elizabeth Prelogar and one other person emerged from the garage. Our stakeout again paid off helping us fill some gaps in the story we reported later that day . From spots to scoops Of course, Manafort wasn't the only high profile witness being ushered quietly into the special counsel's office earlier that year for hours of interviews. In January 2018, we spotted a man with a dark overcoat and brown suitcase exiting Mueller's office, flanked by two people who appeared to be legal assistants. The trio hurried out of the front entrance and got into a dark car, but we were able to snap a quick photo from our post on the sidewalk. We later identified that the older man was a prominent white-collar attorney, Tom Green. This led to CNN's scoop that former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates had quietly added Green to his defense team and that Gates was nearing a plea deal with the special counsel. Gates, not known for grabbing headlines like other witnesses in Mueller's probe, turned into one of Mueller's most significant witnesses, testifying against his former boss Manafort. One night in early February 2018, someone we hadn't seen before exited the building. We later identified the man as veteran pollster and political strategist Tony Fabrizio, which led to CNN's report that he had been interviewed by Mueller's team . Fabrizio had previously worked on Ukrainian elections with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and went on to serve as the Trump campaign's chief pollster. The hunch that helped CNN get Roger Stone's arrest on camera Slight deviations from anyone's routine signaled something important, we came to believe. Prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky, for example, frequently zipped into work on a motorized scooter before walking past us and looking down at his phone. But on one memorable Thursday in January, something was different. Zelinsky walked into work with a small suitcase, a plastic bag and his usual black messenger bag. His charcoal helmet, which he wears while usually scootering or biking into the office, was noticeably absent. We knew Zelinsky was one of the Mueller prosecutors working on matters relating to Roger Stone, Jerome Corsi and WikiLeaks. Corsi's stepson was scheduled to testify that day in front of the grand jury, and we knew there had been speculation for months that Stone could be indicted. JUST WATCHED Video shows FBI at Roger Stone's house Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Video shows FBI at Roger Stone's house 01:16 Roughly half an hour later, we spotted Zelinsky and an FBI agent leaving the special counsel's office in a tinted car we had previously identified as a car used by Mueller's team. Zelinsky and Andrew Goldstein were later spotted at court for what our court reporter believed was a convening of Mueller's grand jury. Was an indictment coming? As it happened, both Sam and Em were at the stakeout that afternoon since one of us (we won't say who) locked the stakeout car key, along with their jacket and bag, in the car. It was a chilly day, so as we waited for help we decamped to the coffee shop to stay warm -- where we then spotted Zelinsky leaving the office in casual clothes with his suitcase and briefcase. He then walked down the street to a nearby hotel, where he hailed a cab. Earlier in the day, we thought that perhaps the suitcase contained materials or documents, but Zelinsky's early departure in casual clothing didn't make sense. Back at the CNN office, reporters covering the investigation put this clue, along with the grand jury session on a Thursday, rather than the usual Friday, together and guessed that Stone may have been indicted. CNN sent a producer and camera to his home in Florida that night, and sure enough, less than 12 hours later, captured the dramatic pre-dawn arrest on video. Zelinsky showed up in the Florida courthouse for the Stone appearance. RELATED: How CNN captured video of the Roger Stone raid The end of the investigation By the time Mueller's investigation wrapped up last month, we had plenty of company outside the building. Mueller's ranks of prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff deviated from routine to avoid the gaggle of cameras stationed at the front of the building and other press in general. ""Oh, here we go again,"" one passerby scoffed as she walked past the gaggle of cameras and into one of the neighboring buildings. Of course, the gathered reporters knew Mueller was not about to walk out with the report in hand and give a press conference. But the press corps was ready for something to happen. Things had already gotten a bit odd. On one memorable afternoon in February 2019, about a month before the report was submitted, we noticed a commotion in the lobby of Mueller's office building. A few minutes later someone in a bird costume ""flew"" towards the lobby entrance. Whoever it was then danced, flapped their wings, and ""mooned"" the press corps assembled outside. They then flapped their arms and ""flew"" back to the elevators of the steel and glass building. . @FossumSamuel 's best update from #CNNStakeout today:

By 4 p.m., every prosecutor we spotted entering the office that morning was gone for the day. Scott Meisler walked out with a backpack and suitcase, turning the tables and stopping briefly to take a photo of the flock of cameras outside. Rush Atkinson, Dreeben, James Quarles, Goldstein, Prelogar, Zebley and Adam Jed had all either driven or walked out of the building. Aaron Zelinsky, the last man standing, left at 3:38 p.m. Where was Mueller? One minute later, the head of the special counsel's security sped out of the garage and drove north in the silver Subaru with no one else inside. The press outside the garage buzzed for the first time all day. About 10 minutes later a woman in a compact car drove out of the special counsel's office building saying, ""He's coming, he's coming."" Then, the silver Ford expedition drove out of the building. Was Mueller inside? We can't say for sure. But all clues suggest he was, because this car -- a vehicle that CNN's stakeout team has previously seen used to transport witnesses and persons of interest -- was likely used to bring him to work early in the morning.

"Pentagon, DHS considering designating fentanyl a WMD, memo says CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,David Shortell,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/dhs-fentanyl-wmd/index.html,"(CNN) Top military and Homeland Security officials are considering classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, according to an internal DHS memo.
The synthetic opioid, blamed in health surveys for surging drug overdose deaths in the United States, has for decades concerned national security officials because of its potential widespread lethality in terror attacks, and in recent months, officials from DHS and the Pentagon have met to discuss an official WMD designation as a tool to disrupt the drug's widespread availability on the black market, the memo says. ""Fentanyl's high toxicity and increasing availability are attractive to threat actors seeking nonconventional materials for a chemical weapons attack,"" the DHS assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction, James F. McDonnell, wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the military news publication Task & Purpose . A DHS official confirmed the authenticity of the memo, which was sent to then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in February. The national security threat posed by fentanyl has remained largely out of the public eye, but the Trump administration has made thwarting its illegal distribution a centerpiece of the campaign against the opioid crisis. Read More China announces new crackdown on fentanyl in win for US President Trump Fentanyl and its derivatives were behind 30,000 of the 72,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2017, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Versions of the drug, which has legitimate medical use as a painkiller, are widely produced in China and can be purchased on the dark web in the US. Mexican cartels and elements of the heroin trade have been known to use fentanyl as an additive to increase the potency of other illegal drugs. Late last year, after pressure from the Trump administration, the Chinese government said it would add fentanyl to its list of controlled substances in a significant shift that aims to curb the drug's manufacturing in the country. Congress has also set new standards on the US Postal Service that will help customs inspectors screen and interdict packages with fentanyl and other opioids at ports of entry. ""Disturbingly easy"" to weaponize Despite these efforts, it would be ""disturbingly easy"" to use the drug in a chemical attack, said Andy Weber, the former assistant secretary of defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs. ""Now that there's actually a market where one can buy large quantities of fentanyl analogues, it eliminates the capability gap and it makes it accessible to terrorist groups,"" Weber said. ""It's a game changer. In my lifetime I've never seen a weapon of mass destruction that is part of an existing black market."" There are other officially-designated WMDs that are made from easily obtainable items, like ricin, which is extracted from the castor bean, though weapons experts said the threat posed by fentanyl and its derivatives are more significant. ""It's as bad as it seems,"" said a government consultant who requested anonymity to discuss countering-WMD projects he has worked on. ""Because of its strength, it's like nothing else that we've seen, beyond radiation, nuclear, chemical and high explosive. It's something that is potentially very, very dangerous."" Fentanyl could be weaponized to devastating effect through its distribution in air and water systems. US defense officials first noted the danger of a fentanyl attack when the Russian military in 2002 pumped it into the ventilation system of a theater in Moscow that had been taken over by Chechen rebels, according to Weber. Dozens of hostages were killed by the fentanyl gas, along with the insurgents. ""That's when we at the Pentagon started to realize that militaries were developing fentanyl analogues as a form of chemical weapon and that we needed to start working on countermeasures,"" Weber said. Formal designation proposed According to the memo, there has been ""reinvigorated interest"" in addressing fentanyl as a WMD ""due to the ongoing opioid crisis ,"" and in recent months, senior DOD leaders, including the commander of the US Southern Command, have proposed the formal designation. Another former Defense Department official, who requested anonymity to speak to CNN about sensitive topics, said the current consideration of fentanyl as a WMD is part of a broader discussion between national security officials around the classification of pharmaceutical-based agents. DHS also had ""informal discussions on the topic"" in the first two months of this year between its sub-agencies and a number of DOD divisions, McDonnell wrote in the memo. In statements, DHS and US Southern Command both said that they are ""constantly assessing"" a range of threats in partnership with other agencies, but declined to comment on the specifics of those conversations. Countering illegal shipments Designating fentanyl as a WMD would allow national security officials to more effectively divert resources to building technology that could detect shipments of fentanyl. The Defense Department has been developing capabilities against non-traditional chemical weapons, like fentanyl, according to the memo, but ""certain operational [countering weapons of mass destruction] entities at DOD and elsewhere have been slow to act due to concern of getting pulled into the counter-narcotics mission,"" the memo says. An official WMD designation would also open up new tools for prosecuting the illicit distribution of the drug. ""It's going to enable them to get moving on the ability to stop big shipments of it quicker and easier,"" the government consultant said."
Premier League: Manchester United suffer humiliating defeat Everton - CNN,edition.cnn.com,cnn,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/football/premier-league-manchester-united-everton-spt-intl/index.html,"Story highlights Cardiff 0-2 Liverpool Liverpool regain Premier League top spot Everton 4-0 Manchester United Worst defeat since Solskjær took over (CNN) Georginio Wijnaldum and James Milner fired Liverpool back to the top of the Premier League as Jurgen Klopp's side overcame a resilient Cardiff City.
After a goalless first half in the Welsh capital, Dutch midfielder Wijnaldum broke the deadlock in emphatic fashion 10 minutes into the second period, striking a crisp half-volley from Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner. Liverpool rode their luck in the second half as Alisson's costly error almost gifted relegation-threatened Cardiff the equalizer, but Sean Morrison failed to convert. Milner then secured the three points nine minutes from time, converting from the penalty spot after Morrison had clumsily hauled Mo Salah to the ground. Just 24 hours earlier, Liverpool had seen Manchester City regain the lead at the top of the Premier League thanks to a hard-fought victory over Tottenham and knew only a win against Cardiff would keep them in the hunt for a first top flight title since 1990. Read More Mohamed Salah is hauled to the ground by Sean Morrison for a Liverpool penalty. Liverpool now sit two points clear at the summit with City's game in hand against Manchester United to come on Wednesday. Though the bitterest of rivals they may be, you get the sense Liverpool fans will be cheering on United in three days' time. Victory takes Liverpool onto 88 points, a new Premier League record for the club and a total that would have been good enough to win the league in six of the last 11 seasons. Manchester United humiliated Manchester United suffered the worst defeat of Ole Gunnar Solskjær's reign as manager, going down 4-0 against Everton at Goodison Park. The hosts took a commanding first-half lead thanks to goals from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson, before Lucas Digne and Theo Walcott turned the game into a rout in the second half. So poor was the performance -- United didn't register a shot on target until the 85th minute -- Solskjær went over to the traveling fans after the match and held his hands up in apology. United have now conceded 48 goals this season, their worst defensive tally in Premier League history -- and there are still four matches left to play. READ: Man City return to top of Premier League with victory over Tottenham READ: Juventus and Cristiano Ronaldo make history in Italy ""From the first whistle, everything went wrong,"" Solskjaer told Sky Sports after the match. ""I just want to apologize to the fans. They're the only people with the badge on today who can hold their head high, because we can't."" Defeat leaves United two points behind Arsenal in fourth place -- the final Champions League spot -- though the Gunners play their game in hand against Crystal Palace later on Saturday. The loss to Everton, which sees Solskjær's side now on a run of six defeats in eight games, was the first time United have conceded four goals in a Premier League game since October 2016. In the build up to this game, Solskjær had abruptly stated that some of his players needed a ""reality check"" following a poor run of form which culminated in last week's humbling 3-0 defeat to Barcelona. Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer apologizes to the traveling fans after the match. If he had been hoping for a reaction him team on Sunday then United's performance will have left him exasperated, as Everton took a 2-0 lead with less than half an hour played. The Norwegian coach, evidently bitterly disappointed with the performance, hauled off Phil Jones and Fred at half time for Ashley Young and Scott McTominay. But things went from bad to worse for the visiting side as Digne made it 3-0 within 10 minutes of the restart and Walcott put the icing on the cake 10 minutes later. Since that improbable comeback away at PSG in the Champions League -- a ninth away win in a row -- United have now lost five consecutive games away from home 1981. Up next is the small matter of the Manchester Derby, as Solskjær's side welcome Pep Guardiola and Manchester City to Old Trafford on Wednesday in the hope of derailing their Premier League title charge."
Tim Ryan does not support impeachment proceedings Trump: 'Let the process play itself out' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/tim-ryan-trump-impeachment-mueller-cnntv/index.html,"(CNN) 2020 Democratic candidate Tim Ryan said he does not support beginning the impeachment process against President Donald Trump, even though he argued that special counsel Robert Mueller's report shows the President committed obstruction of justice .
""Let the process play itself out,"" Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday on ""State of the Union."" Though he argued ""it's pretty clear that the President obstructed on several different occasions,"" Ryan said he believes the ""first step"" should be for House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler to ""continue to open up this investigation to better understand this."" ""Let the Judiciary Committee look at this. There's a process in place here,"" Ryan said, adding: ""I think that's the natural next step, and let's see where that leaves."" Nadler said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" he thinks some of the matters brought forth in the Mueller report, if proven, are impeachable for President Donald Trump. He, however, did not specifically call for impeachment hearings, saying he first wants to hear Mueller's testimony in front of the committee. Nadler had formally requested Mueller to testify ""no later than May 23, 2019."" Read More No. 2 House Democrat: Impeachment 'not worthwhile at this point' Asked by NBC about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's role in potential impeachment, Nadler indicated it is up to ""partly her and partly a lot of other people."" After the Mueller report's release on Thursday, House Democratic leadership opted not to encourage potential impeachment, while a small number of House Democrats have argued that it should be pursued. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another 2020 Democratic candidate, called on Friday for the House to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Ryan told CNN on Sunday that while he ""(understands) their move to try to impeach"" Trump, ""I would rather us take this next step, educate the American people, really get these details out."" ""This is a very nuanced document,"" Ryan said of the redacted report, adding later that ""it's very detailed, the American people, through this process, will get up to speed with how this administration has been behaving. The Mueller report said the special counsel's investigation does not exonerate Trump of criminal conduct on the issue of obstruction. The redacted report details numerous cases in which Trump asked his aides to take actions that would have obstructed the investigation, but stated they were unsuccessful because the aides refused his orders. Mueller's report leaves open possibility of post-White House criminal exposure for Trump Attorney General William Barr concluded that the evidence was ""not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."" But House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff told ""Fox News Sunday"" there will be a Democratic caucus meeting in the next couple of weeks ""to figure out what the best course is"" on whether to proceed with impeachment. ""We will have to decide, do we nonetheless go through an impeachment because to do otherwise would signal that somehow this President's conduct is okay, that future presidents can engage in this kind of corruption without consequence, or do we decide that we are better off doing oversight through the context of oversight hearings by the various committees rather than a formal impeachment?"" Schiff told Fox News. ""That's going to be a very consequential decision and one that I'm going to reserve judgment on until we have a chance to fully deliberate about it."""
Bengal tigers could vanish from one of their final strongholds,us.cnn.com,"Isabelle Gerretsen, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/world/bengal-tigers-sundarbans-scn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Feared and revered, it's one of the world's most iconic creatures: the majestic Bengal tiger.
Already threatened by poaching and humans spreading into its shrinking habitats, researchers say that in just 50 years it could completely disappear from one of its last remaining strongholds -- a huge mangrove forest called the Sundarbans, which crosses India and Bangladesh. Over the past century, we've lost 95% of all the world's tigers, leaving less than 4,000 in the wild. Bengal tigers are found in a handful of Asian countries, but just a few hundred still roam free in the Sundarbans. Read More Covering more than 10,000 square kilometers, the low-lying area is shrinking rapidly, with some of its islands submerging as local sea levels rise much faster than the global average . Read: The most effective way to fight climate change? Between 2004 and 2015, the number of Bengal tigers fell from 440 to 106 in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. That number is ""dangerously low"" said Dipankar Ghose, director of the species and landscapes program at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), due to ""an escalating poaching crisis, habitat degradation and fragmentation."" Rising seas and less fresh water Earlier this year, a study modeled how much of the Sundarbans would remain a suitable habitat for tigers as global greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. It found that by 2070, the Bengal tiger could vanish from the Sundarbans as habitats are completely wiped out by rising sea levels, more extreme weather and increasing salt in the water and soil. 5 everyday foods that are making droughts worse Rising sea levels and a decline in rainfall have already increased the amount of salt in the water, causing Sundri trees -- from which the Sundarbans region gets its name -- to die, and shrinking the tiger's mangrove habitat, according to Sharif Mukul, the study's co-author and assistant professor at the Independent University of Bangladesh. It's also leaving tigers without access to fresh water, Mukul told CNN. ""Fresh water is crucial for Bengal tigers to survive,"" he said. ""If sea levels [continue] to rise, Bengal tigers might not have any way to [survive]."" Read: Climate change - do you know the basics? Illegal poaching has also greatly diminished Bengal tiger's main prey, the spotted deer, the study noted. The study does not take into account the impact of disease outbreak, poaching and prey reduction, Mukul said, meaning the actual scenario could be better or worse than projected. A tiger wearing a radio collar wades through a river after being released by wildlife workers in the Indian Sundarbans. Conflict with humans As their fresh water and food supply declines, Bengal tigers are venturing out of their habitat and closer to human settlements, sometimes resulting in fatalities. According to a 2013 study , at least three tigers are killed each year as a result of human-tiger conflict. An average of 20-30 people are reported to be killed by tigers every year in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans but the number is likely to be higher as many attacks are not reported because they involve people who have entered the tigers' habitat without a permit. But conservation efforts are reducing human-tiger conflicts, according to a group that works in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans. Anwarul Islam, chief executive of conservation organization WildTeam, told CNN that the number of tiger attacks and deaths have fallen in the past five years due to increased awareness of wildlife protection among local communities. WildTeam launched a tiger hotline in 2013 and a 24-hour patrol team who intervene if a tiger roams into a village. Best places to spot tigers in India A Bengal tiger in the Sundarbans. ""If a stray tiger comes out of the forest, people know that they will not be killed because of the tiger team. They feel safe,"" Islam said. But more needs to be done to preserve the tiger's habitat, he said, stressing that the tigers will have nowhere to go if the Sundarbans are submerged. Read: Stronger hurricanes could decimate forests, accelerate climate change Ratul Saha of the WWF Sundarbans Landscape program told CNN that to protect the Bengal tigers, India and Bangladesh should identify hotspots where mangrove plants and species are thriving, despite a lack of soil nutrients, and move these resilient mangroves to dying parts of the forest. ""It is crucial that the necessary steps be taken to increase climate resilience in the region,"" he said. ""For tigers, conservation efforts must remain focused on habitat restoration and protection."""
Slowing US growth could be good for investors,us.cnn.com,"Anneken Tappe, CNN Business",04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/investing/stocks-week-ahead-us-growth/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) 1. US first quarter GDP: The first report card of the year for the American economy is due on Friday. Hold tight.
Investors will be watching closely after worries about a global and US economic slowdown weighed on their minds at the start of the year. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates 2.8% real GDP growth in January through March, while analysts polled by Refinitiv forecast an average of 1.9%. A weaker than expected GDP reading could pull stocks and other assets lower. Government stimulus, like tax reform, boosted the economy last year, but that's now petering out. The US economy is widely expected to grow at a slower speed in 2019 than last year's 2.6% . First quarter growth tends to be weaker due to seasonal factors. This year, the data will also reflect the partial government government shutdown, the longest in US history , which started in December but went on for much of January. Read More But Friday's GDP number is only the first of three, and revisions are common, so any initial reaction could be short-lived. ""Slowing down is fine, as long as there is no recession,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual. The more than 4% annualized growth figure the United States reported for the second quarter of 2018 was certainly outside the trend. GDP slowing to what many economists say is a more sustainable level will keep inflation around 2%, the Federal Reserve's target, and will prolong the economic growth cycle, Schutte said. On the back of that, fears of an impending recession are letting up, he added. There are other positive signs. The US trade deficit narrowed by more than expected to $49.4 billion in February, its best reading in more than 18 months, data showed last Wednesday. And this bodes well for Friday's GDP number. As market expectations for economic growth look up again, stocks in cyclical sectors like construction and manufacturing should outperform those in defensive industries like healthcare. The next driver to lead stocks across the board higher will be global growth, Schutte said. Just a few months ago, analysts promised doom and gloom for the world economy. But if last week's better-than-expected Chinese GDP data is any indication, those worries may have been overdone. China economic stimulus seems to be working, alleviating global concerns for now, although worries over the health of Europe's economy remain. 2. Tech and Tesla: Earnings season is in full bloom, and this week's results will include Twitter ( TWTR ) , Facebook ( FB ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) . Tesla ( TSLA ) will also report results, and the company is again in focus over its supply constraints and sales slump. Earlier this month, Tesla reported a massive drop in sales for the first quarter . The earnings report will show how the annual target for deliveries will be affected. So far, the company has not changed its guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for the year. For Amazon, there could be increased focus on Amazon Prime given Disney ( DIS ) 's venture into the streaming realm with the announcement of Disney+, as well as Apple ( AAPL ) 's new streaming service. 3. Boeing and the 737 Max turbulence: Boeing will report quarterly results on Wednesday. Its earnings are expected to take a hit after the grounding of its 737 Max planes after two fatal crashes. How bad a quarter, and how long the problem will last, is what Wall Street is waiting to see. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv forecast that earnings per share fell 11% in the quarter compared to a year earlier. Before the crisis, Boeing ( BA ) had been expected to report higher earnings. Boeing halted deliveries of the jets on March 14 due to the grounding, so there was only about two weeks of lost sales revenue. The forecasts for the second quarter have already taken an even bigger hit. Investors will be particularly eager to hear when the grounding will be lifted. They will also want Boeing's outlook for deliveries and orders for the jet going forward. Boeing is working to find an acceptable software fix to the safety system that is now the focus of investigations into the crashes. 4. European bank earnings: A number of European banks will follow their American peers and share first-quarter earnings this week. Investors who worried that the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes will crimp lending growth in the United States are unlikely to find relief abroad. Europe's banks are under pressure from sluggish economic growth, as well as the European Central Bank's decision to keep interest rates in negative territory until at least the end of 2019. Unlike the Fed, the ECB has not yet raised interest rates since slashing them to record lows in the aftermath of the European sovereign debt crisis. Particular attention will be paid to results from Deutsche Bank ( DB ) on Friday, as merger talks with Germany's Commerzbank ( CRZBF ) drag on. 5. Coming this week: Monday — European markets are closed, Tesla holds its investor day Tuesday —Twitter, Snap ( SNAP ) and Procter & Gamble ( PG ) earnings Wednesday — Facebook, Boeing, and Tesla earnings Thursday — Amazon and Starbucks ( SBUX ) earnings Friday — US first-quarter GDP due at 8:30 a.m. ET; April consumer sentiment due at 10 a.m. ET -- CNN Business' Julia Horowitz and Chris Isidore contributed to this report."

Stiglitz is University Professor at Columbia University and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is also the co-chair of the High-Level Expert Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress at the OECD, and the chief economist of the Roosevelt Institute. His latest book, People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent, will be released by W.W. Norton on April 23.
America's economy has not been working for a large portion of the country. Workers at the bottom of the income scale earn wages, adjusted for inflation, that are not much higher than what they were 60 years ago , while the income of a typical full‐time male worker hasn't budged much from 40 years ago . In addition, life expectancy is in decline. But the economy is not only failing American citizens. It's failing the planet, and that means it's failing future generations.
There are many reasons for our plight, including corporate power and greed centered on immediate profits and little regard for the impacts business decisions have on low-income Americans and the environment. Corporations have translated their economic power into political power, lobbying for policies that give them free rein to despoil the environment; and the swamp President Donald Trump promised to drain has been overflowing. At the same time, Trump has publicly asserted that climate change is a hoax, and yet his administration has repeatedly been forced to admit it is a reality — in response to climate lawsuits such as Juliana v. United States , for which I'm an expert witness. More Markets & Economy Perspectives It's a tough time for trade. But emerging economies are moving ahead
What to expect from 2019's 'post-peak' economy
Why the US would never win a trade war with China
Climate change is real, and it includes not only an increase in the average temperature, but also more extreme weather events including droughts, floods and hurricanes that have led to a large number of deaths. The United States has borne enormous costs as a result of the warming planet — in 2017 , more than 1.5% of GDP . By the end of this century, some sectors of the US economy, including agriculture and energy , could lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year because of climate change, according to the latest report issued by the U.S. Global Change Research Program . So there is a real urgency to respond to our economic malaise and our climate crisis. The good news on this Earth Day is that these are problems of our own making, and that means a change toward pro-Earth policies can make a big difference. Even better, the major investments we need to respond to the crisis would be a spur to the economy. This is one of the central messages of the Green New Deal. The transition to the ""green economy,"" in which we rely on renewable energy, won't happen on its own, however. It will require a mobilization of resources — the kind we saw during the New Deal and the Second World War. Government will have to take the lead, and it will require public investments — including in infrastructure and research — and regulations. Environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act can and have worked, and typically are very cost‐effective. Without these measures, our air would be even more unbreathable than the air in New Delhi or Beijing today. Read More Dealing effectively with climate change is well within our reach; in fact, I recently co‐chaired an international commission that showed that the global goals of limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius were clearly achievable. It would make so much more sense to spend money retrofitting our economy to reduce the risk of disastrous climate change rather than spending money to deal with the enormous economic and human costs of coping with its consequences. Some of the required resources would come simply from eliminating the huge subsidies we provide for fossil fuels, or from taxing corporations that inflict damage on our environment. This would encourage corporations to work hard to prevent it. But there are broader changes that would help grow the economy, providing some of the needed resources: curbing the excesses of corporate power more generally would lead to a more efficient economy and to more equality. So, too, would curbing the abuses of corporate governance, like CEOs paying themselves so much at the expense both of workers and investment. Policies that reduce discrimination in the labor market and provide more flexibility in hours are examples of supply‐side measures that work. And over the long run, education policies that help all citizens live up to their potential would also help the economy grow. The mobilization during World War II had some long‐term salutary effects on our economy and society: It brought women into the labor force and it helped transform us from an agrarian to an urban society. The mobilization required to fight climate change has a similar potential. As we restructure our economy and society away from a high‐carbon economy and toward a more sustainable one, we should seize this opportunity to create the society that benefits all of us, as well as the planet."
Mueller report is quite the page-turner (opinion),us.cnn.com,Richard Galant,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/mueller-report-is-quite-the-page-turner-galant/index.html,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
(CNN) When it finally came to light this week, special counsel Robert Mueller's report seemed to animate everyone -- and satisfy no one.
The report's 448 pages (with 946 redactions, courtesy of Attorney General William Barr) laid out evidence of a systematic campaign by the Russian government to undermine American democracy -- and of President Donald Trump's efforts to throw sand in the gears of the law enforcement machine that was investigating him. At the same time, Trump's defenders could point to Mueller's conclusions that the President's 2016 campaign did not illegally coordinate with the Russians and that he would not charge the President with obstructing justice. That measured verdict gave ammunition to all sides. The report, wrote Princeton historian Julian Zelizer, "" does not exonerate him from obstruction of justice -- the charge at the heart of Presidents Nixon's and Clinton's impeachment processes. The Mueller team found multiple instances where Trump tried to stifle a legitimate investigation into his own conduct. Very often the only thing that saved him were advisers who wouldn't do what he wanted done. ... Indeed, if this is a 'good' report for the President, it is hard to imagine what a bad one would look like."" But for a Republican commentator, the report's findings were more than enough reason to turn the page: ""It's a painful pill for Trump critics to swallow, but ill-advised is not illegal, unsavory is not unlawful, and chaos is not a conspiracy,"" observed Alice Stewart . The report can be summed up in ""four simple words: Russiagate was no Watergate ."" Read More What if Trump said... To truly turn the page, though, might require the kind of presidential speech Trump could never give, wrote CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen . He imagined these healing words : ""My fellow Americans. ...The special counsel's report has cleared me and my team from conspiracy but I have to acknowledge that the report also paints a devastating portrait of the Russian efforts to manipulate our electoral process. Therefore, I now accept that this was not the possible work of 'some guy in his home in New Jersey' as I said during the transition. ...In fact, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his henchmen are the only ones to blame. This is a disgrace and I am instructing my national security team to prevent any kind of repeat of what happened in 2016 ..."" Barr at the barricades Barr, who released the Mueller report, set the table for it with the four-page letter he wrote last month, disclosing some of Mueller's findings and adding his own determination that Trump wouldn't be charged with obstruction. Then, minutes before the report's release on Thursday, Barr held a news conference that seemed designed to further shape how the public would perceive the report. Many were outraged. "" William Barr has cemented his status as a crafty partisan whose primary tricks are to cloak his political moves to shape public opinion and to protect President Trump under a thin sheen of law and process,"" wrote CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Elie Honig . Journalist Jill Filipovic observed that the attorney general appeared to be trying to make excuses for Trump's behavior, as described in the Mueller report, because of what he called Trump's ""sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency."" A woman under those circumstances would be accused of surrendering to her emotions and wouldn't get any sympathy. ""Men in an emotional tailspin have 'sincere beliefs,'"" she noted. "" Trump is perhaps the most emotionally unbalanced national politician in living memory, tweeting semi-literate all-caps outbursts and frothing up his followers with incoherent tirades."" The defects in the Barr-driven process aren't only his fault, wrote CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin . They were a glaring illustration of why it was a mistake for Congress to abolish powerful independent counsels after the Ken Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton. Notre Dame will rebuild Easter Sunday began in Paris with parts of the ancient Notre Dame Cathedral in ruins and with the French nation vowing to rebuild. The Monday fire that destroyed the roof and collapsed the spire of the church, which has sat on an island in the Seine for eight centuries, riveted and saddened people around the world. "" What a week for this fire to happen : a time when thousands of worshippers in France were readying themselves through penitence and prayer for the Passion, for Easter itself -- the celebration that comes on Resurrection Sunday,"" wrote Jay Parini. ""It felt like the entire world was in pain,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""In a time of inflamed political, religious and sectarian divisions, somehow, a fire in a Catholic church, a cathedral in France, managed to melt away the animosity -- if only for a moment -- and bring people together in shared sorrow. Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jew, or atheist; in France, India, Argentina, everywhere."" In the National Review, Rich Lowry wrote, ""Notre Dame stands for so many qualities that we now lack -- patience and staying power, the cultivation of beauty, a deep religious faith, the cultural confidence and ambition to build a timeless monument of our civilization -- that the collapse of its spire was almost too much to bear ."" The fire brought painful memories, and also a sense of determination, to Katie Hawkins-Gaar . As newlyweds, she and her husband Jamie took pictures in front of the cathedral in 2008 and vowed to return to Paris every five years. But when Katie returned in 2018, she was alone -- and carrying her husband's ashes. He had collapsed and died while running a half-marathon at the age of 32. "" Everything is ephemeral, including the people and places we love ,"" she wrote. ""Notre Dame will rebuild. And so will I."" Lessons of rebuilding That same spirit emerged in the words of people connected with two American churches that are rebuilding after fires: Christine Behnke , parish education director of Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church UAC in Milwaukee, Quote: : ""After watching a news report about Notre Dame Monday, I went and stood in Trinity's dark, damp, scarred sanctuary. ... All the ash has been removed, scaffolding erected and a temporary roof covers the nave. ... We really are rising from the ashes! "" The Rev. Richard Hong , pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Englewood, New Jersey, recalled that after the fire at his church, ""while strangers were sending me messages about how devastated they were upon hearing about it, our members were not devastated. ... We lost our building, but we still had our church -- because we still had each other, and God was with us. God still is with us."" Tiger Woods is back Wearing the famous green jacket, Tiger Woods celebrated his first Masters win since 2005, in a comeback that energized fans and the sport of golf. Sports historian Amy Bass described it as "" a return to grace after a fall documented everywhere , from the lurid tabloid headlines chronicling his marital infidelity and divorce to the medical journals outlining the odyssey of his multiple injuries and ongoing back pain."" Not surprised by Aunt Becky's rule-breaking Gerry Brooks , an elementary school principal in Lexington, Kentucky, shared a sobering take on the college admissions scandal, focusing on ""Aunt Becky,"" the character played by Lori Loughlin in ""Full House."" "" Do you know who isn't surprised by the situation? Every educator in America ,"" Brooks wrote. ""This thing occurs all the time, in every school."" ""When a parent signs a reading log saying a child read for 10 minutes that night but they really didn't, because they were out late for a sports event or just didn't have time, they are basically doing the same thing. They believe a rule or policy is not important or dumb or optional. Do you know who else thought the rules were dumb? Aunt Becky."" Roxanne Jones asked: What's the right punishment in the college admissions scandal? In her view, jail time shouldn't be off the table. ""No matter how many times we see justice seemingly tip in favor of the rich, or famous, Americans still want to believe we all have an equal shot . That money and privilege don't always win. That hard work and integrity still matter. The college cheating scandal puts those notions to the test."" What immigrants contribute Controversy continued to swirl around Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Democrat from Minnesota, but retired Real Adm. John Kirby , a CNN national security analyst, came to her defense. ""One could argue that Rep. Omar's use of 'some people' to describe the 9-11 hijackers was cavalier. Maybe it was,"" Kirby wrote. ""But her larger point was valid: those hijackers and the terrorist groups who survive them do not represent all Muslims , at home or abroad. And it's just plain wrong -- un-American, really -- to hold in disdain an entire community of our fellow citizens for the evil act of a few who perverted their faith. ... I've seen commentary online not only deriding Muslims as people, but also denying any contribution they made to our history."" Kirby recalled a 2006 visit to Fallujah, Iraq, where he met an immigrant from Pakistan, Dr. Saleem Khan, a Navy surgeon. Khan was on his fifth tour in Iraq at that point and would go on to complete another three combat deployments, earning the Bronze Star and the Legion of Merit. ""I'll never forget what he told me that day: 'I don't want anyone to ever say that, as an immigrant, I did not pay my dues.'"" Detaining the asylum-seekers With Barr, the attorney general, ruling out the release of some asylum-seekers who have shown a credible case for avoiding deportation, the Trump administration's immigration crackdown grew. For those, like author Barbara Fischkin , who are the descendants of refugees to the United States, the move seemed particularly cruel. A century ago, her mother, then 6 years old, escaped one of a series of pogroms in the Ukraine, in which more than 100,000 Jews died. She ""ran into the woods and hid in a haystack where she might have frozen to death if not for a Catholic farmer who risked his own life to take her to his home. It is likely that the local band of young nationalists would have killed him if they found out."" Eventually her mother's family made its way to the United States, where they have annually observed the spiritual injunction of Passover, which started Friday evening, to welcome the stranger. ""After my grandfather immigrated to the US, he insisted that every Seder end with his own, booming Yiddish-accented rendition of 'God Bless America.' I will sing this at our Seder and also hope that migrants and other immigrants in peril can sing it here and live comfortably in the open."" How to save the planet As Earth Day approaches on Monday, it's worth focusing on the crucial role of farming in determining the health of the planet. Bethany Cianciolo, who edits the Perspectives section of CNN Business, noted via email that two chief executives co-wrote an op-ed this week making the case for going back to basics. Rose Marcario , president and CEO of Patagonia, and David Bronner , CEO of Dr. Bronner's, argued that farmers should rotate crops, compost, plant cover crops and reduce tillage rather than rely on fertilizers and soil-mixing machines. ""Over time, as chemically degraded soil starts to come back to life, crop yields from regenerative organic agriculture can outperform conventional methods, meaning we can feed a growing global population without destroying the planet. "" Don't miss these: • Brandon Tensley : The real power of 'pulling a Beyoncé' • Thomas Maier : The evidence that the US government got into the assassination business • Jill Filipovic : 'Selfie' deaths: Don't blame victims • Samantha Vinograd : Trump's third date with Kim will likely be as unsuccessful as the last one • Steven Mnuchin : The Tax Cuts and Jobs act is working • Peggy Drexler : Georgia Engel, Mary Tyler Moore's sidekick, showed that spacy can be smart"
Prince's 5 best-selling albums - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Jodi Upchurch and Brandon Griggs, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/entertainment/prince-albums-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) When Prince died on April 21, 2016 , he left behind an extensive catalog which could not to be confined to a single genre.
His singular sound , which combined elements of rock, jazz, R&B, funk and pop, was as identifiable as the artist himself. As a solo artist and performing as Prince & the Revolution, he had five albums go multi-platinum in the US, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. (For an album to be considered platinum, it must sell 1 million units.) On the third anniversary of Prince's death, we look back at his top-selling albums. 'Purple Rain' (soundtrack) Read More 13x multi-platinum Released June 25, 1984 Singles: ""When Doves Cry,"" ""Let's Go Crazy,"" ""Purple Rain,"" ""I Would Die 4 You,"" ""Take Me With U"" The first album credited to Prince and The Revolution, this was his blockbuster -- and one of the defining albums of the '80s. The soundtrack to his rock drama, ""Purple Rain,"" it was released a month before the movie and helped drive audiences to theaters. It also won Prince an Oscar for Best Original Song Score. '1999' 4x multi-platinum Released October 27, 1982 Singles: ""1999,"" ""Little Red Corvette,"" ""Delirious,"" and ""Let's Pretend We're Married"" This double album was Prince's breakthrough and spawned three hit singles, including ""Little Red Corvette"" -- his first Top 10 hit. Its title song became a dance-floor smash and remained a popular party tune through the last years of the millennium. 'Around the World in a Day' 2x multi-platinum Released April 22, 1985 Singles: ""Raspberry Beret,"" ""Pop Life,"" and ""America"" This was the first release from Prince's Paisley Park Records, and although it was considered a critical disappointment after the genius of ""Purple Rain,"" the psychedelic-tinged album produced two Top 10 hits. From 1985 to 1992, Prince would release eight albums, one each year. 'Batman' (soundtrack) 2x multi-platinum Released June 20, 1989 Singles: ""Batdance,"" ""Partyman,"" ""The Arms Of Orion,"" and ""Scandalous"" The soundtrack to Tim Burton's box-office smash ""Batman."" Some critics thought Prince's songs didn't fit the superhero movie, while others thought they brought it a playful sensuality. The movie was produced by Warner Brothers, who also acted as Prince's record company. 'Emancipation' 2x multi-platinum Released November 19, 1996 Singles: ""Betcha By Golly Wow!"" and ""The Holy River"" This was Prince's first triple album and was released under his new name, an unpronounceable symbol. Its title refers to Prince's joy over his freedom from his longtime contract with Warner Brothers. JUST WATCHED Songs you didn't know Prince wrote Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Joe Biden's uphill climb in early states - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,"Ben Geldon, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/inside-politics-forecast-april-21/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast.
1. Biden's uphill climb From CNN Chief National Correspondent John King : There is no doubt Joe Biden is well liked, even treasured, by Democratic voters. But the Easter weekend inbox includes several observations from key states that underscore the early challenges awaiting the former vice president as he gears up to enter the 2020 race this week. ""Joe's name is not coming up much,"" said one county Democratic chair in Iowa. ""There is a lot of interest in these new, fresh and younger candidates."" Read More To illustrate that point, this Democrat noted that a local bookstore owner was scrambling to get more copies of a book by Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose candidacy is generating considerable early buzz. Team Biden believes his official entry will change the conversation. It also believes his early poll numbers, which show him at the top of the pack, are anchored on more than just universal name recognition among Democrats. The Iowa county chair, though, was skeptical. ""I really don't think it is very deep or strong support."" New Hampshire comes next on the calendar, and its electorate could more closely mirror Biden's strength. But a big complicating factor there is that two of the state's neighbors are in the race -- Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. ""There is competition on the bread and butter issues,"" was how a seasoned New Hampshire Democratic operative described the challenge for Biden. This Democrat said the party's affection and respect for Biden and its hunger to beat President Trump would guarantee Biden a fair look. But, he added, ""this might not be fair but I don't think he will be allowed the mistakes all candidates tend to make."" Biden has said he waited to get into the race because he believed his stature in the party allowed him to take his time. The New Hampshire Democrat sees a downside to the wait -- saying, in his view, it allowed other candidates to gather support. ""I see both an open lane and a closing window, if that makes any sense,"" the New Hampshire Democrat said. 2. Will Stephen Miller testify? The Mueller Report is finished, but Democratic probes into the Trump Administration and the President's personal finances are just getting started. Near the top of the list -- an investigation into the president's immigration policy. The House Oversight Committee wants to hear from White House senior adviser Stephen Miller. ""He's the architect of a lot of the immigration agenda,"" New York Times congressional reporter Julie Hirschfeld Davis said. ""(They want him) to come testify in front of the committee voluntarily."" The committee gave him until Wednesday to respond to their invitation. ""It's pretty unlikely that Stephen Miller, who has been very much in the background ... will respond voluntarily to this invitation,"" Davis said. ""I think we can expect to see Congress continue to press to hear from Stephen Miller, to hear from other people inside the administration about what the plans are and what the legal defenses are of those steps."" 3. Security clearance fallout The House Oversight Committee is also looking into questions about security clearances granted to top White House aides over the objections of career officials. ""This is all part of the House Oversight Committee's investigation into how the security clearance process was handled, whether the President improperly overruled security officials and allowed his son-in-law Jared Kushner to get a security clearance, and Ivanka Trump as well,"" CNN's senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju said. This week, the committee is expected to hear from Carl Kline, who served as the White House personnel security director during the first two years of the Trump administration. A whistleblower alleges that Klein played a key role in reversing security clearance rejections for more than two dozen officials. ""The White House has been fighting this very hard almost every step of the way,"" Raju said. ""They are also threatening potentially to assert executive privilege in his testimony."" 4. Democrats' strategy to get Trump financial documents A third big subject for the Oversight Committee -- the President's personal finances. The Democrats have given the Treasury Department a Tuesday deadline to turn over Trump's tax returns. They are not expected to comply. ""But the House Democrats are employing this clever strategy to get Trump's financial information by going around the White House,"" Washington Post reporter congressional reporter Rachael Bade said. ""They have reached out to a number of financial institutions that Trump worked with as a businessman. ... And from lawyers that I have talked to, former House counsels I've spoken with, they actually think the Democrats have a very good shot at getting this information."" ""Trump World has tried to threaten these institutions and say, 'do not hand over this information,' they do not want to ignore a congressional subpoena and are likely to comply,"" Bade said. 5. Trump skipping media dinner again Next weekend is official Washington's biggest social event of the year -- the White House Correspondents Association Dinner. But for the third year in a row, President Trump will skip it. ""He'll go to Green Bay, Wisconsin, to hold another one of his big rallies with hardcore supporters,"" New York Times White House reporter Michael Shear said. ""That's a sort of diss by the President of the national media. Now it's no surprise the President would want to diss the 'fake news media,' but it is remarkable that even as he's facing an election campaign, he just doesn't feel see any need to repair that relationship or any of the other relationships with his adversaries."" The day before that rally, he'll speak at the NRA's annual meeting. ""There will likely not be a single mind in that audience that has to be convinced to support the President,"" Shear said. ""Presidents often try to expand their base of political support by going into the lion's den, speaking to people who don't necessarily agree with them ... His campaign thinks he can win without doing that. We'll see in about a year-and-a-half."""

Voter excitement for the 2020 election is already on par with the days before the 2016 vote - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Grace Sparks,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/fox-poll-vote-interest/index.html,"(CNN) Americans won't go to the polls to choose who they want to be president for about 18 months. But bipartisan enthusiasm for the 2020 vote is so high that it's comparable to the days before the last time they cast a presidential ballot.
In a new poll by Fox News released Thursday, more than half of voters said they were extremely interested in the 2020 presidential election (52%). That's about equivalent to the 54% who said the same thing in the final days of the 2016 campaign. Election excitement was strong in both parties, with 57% of Republicans and 56% of Democrats who expressed strong interest. The 54% who said they were extremely interested in the election in 2016 was the highest percentage who had ever said so since Fox began tracking the question in 2011. CNN's March survey found enthusiasm among registered voters above 2016 enthusiasm and about on par with the level seen in the final days of the 2008 campaign. It's hard to say, at this point in the campaign's early days, what this means for the 2020 presidential race. Despite the level of voter interest in 2016, the turnout in that election was similar to 2012 and lower than in 2008. While this poll may not predict exactly how many people will vote, it does show that a huge amount are paying attention. Read More While the Fox poll didn't delve deep into the horse race rankings, it measured a more unique metric: how satisfied voters would be if certain candidates ended up being the 2020 Democratic nominee. Among those who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary or caucus in their state, 78% said they would be satisfied if former Vice President Joe Biden were the nominee, followed by 75% who said the same of Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, and 61% for both Sens. Kamala Harris, of California, and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts. Dissatisfaction was highest for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, and Warren (23% and 22% respectively). Among the Democratic primary voters who are extremely interested in the 2020 election, the percent who would be satisfied with Harris as a nominee rises from 61% to 70% and Mayor Pete Buttigieg's support rises from 43% to 50%. For likely Republican primary voters, 88% said they would be satisfied is President Donald Trump were their nominee and 11% reported they'd be dissatisfied. Only 12% said they'd be satisfied with former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who officially declared his run for president this week . Fox also found 45% of voters who approved of Trump's job as president and 51% disapproved, steady from their March poll. With Biden expected to jump into the race next week, after months of publicly teasing a run for the White House, the poll found about two in 10 of all registered voters and 14% of Democratic women said they were extremely or very concerned about criticism of Biden making women uncomfortable when he ""hugged them or smelled their hair."" Women weren't more worried about Biden's actions than men -- 18% of women voters said they were concerned and 20% of men said the same. The Fox News poll was conducted April 14-16, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R) and includes interviews with 1,005 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters, and five points for both the Democratic (413) and Republican primary voter samples (374)."
John Bolton's 'troika of tyranny' message has its risks - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Samantha Vinograd,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/trump-weekly-briefing-bolton-regime-changes-vinograd/index.html,"Samantha Vinograd is a CNN national security analyst. She served on President Obama's National Security Council from 2009-2013 and at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush. Follow her @sam_vinograd . The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) Last week, US National Security Adviser John Bolton took direct aim at specific leaders in Latin America, declaring that the ""troika of tyranny -- Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua -- is beginning to crumble.""
He also outlined new measures the Trump administration is taking, such as sanctions on the Central Bank of Venezuela, to hasten their demise. Many may interpret Bolton's declaration, which echoes President George W. Bush's oft-repeated ""axis of evil"" phrase, as a new foundation for pursuing regime change. Samantha Vinograd The 'three stooges' These ""three stooges of socialism,"" as Bolton calls the leaders of the three countries, are are not the targets of his rhetoric alone. President Donald Trump is implementing direct measures against them, including restrictions on US dollar transactions by banks in Venezuela and Nicaragua, in an effort to cut off finances for the leaders of both countries. Read More When it comes to Cuba, the administration is reversing Obama-era policies designed to support the Cuban people and reinstating a cap on the amount Americans can send to their relatives there. Trump has been very public about his policy of pushing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power. He declared Maduro an illegitimate leader and said that all options remain on the table, including a military intervention . Maduro has long accused the US of supporting a coup against him , and now we are openly using all the available tools to remove him from power. The administration has also voiced support for a change in leadership in Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega and others associated with him have been added to the US sanctions list . Democratic socialism is the scenic route to serfdom Bolton has a history of supporting regime changes and his latest statements are likely fueling the notion that the United States is prepared to throw its weight behind leaders it favors. While the administration's efforts to unseat socialist leaders in Latin America have been uncharacteristically disciplined, these moves align with the President's domestic attacks on perceived political opponents whom he labels socialists. And it's important to note that Trump has had harsher words for socialist leaders in Latin America -- who do not pose threats to US national security or our sovereignty -- than he's had for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who's overseeing an ongoing attack on our democracy. The message from the administration is that not all regimes are created equal. Trump appears more willing to push back against leaders who espouse a political doctrine that he views as a threat to his own political standing. Behavioral therapy in Iran? The Trump administration has said that it is not seeking regime change in Iran, but rather a change in behavior. Trump's latest Iran decision sets a dangerous precedent However, these statements become harder to believe as the administration not only ramps up economic pressure on Iran, but also launches a very public PR campaign against the ""outlaw"" regime . The State Department has denounced the regime's ""grotesque level of self-interest,"" routinely says that the Iranian people ""deserve better"" and uses social media to encourage the Iranian people to speak out against the government. This looks, sounds and smells like support for regime change in a lot of ways. The juxtaposition between the administration's attitude toward the Iranian regime, which currently has no nuclear weapons, and its approach toward North Korea -- a regime that has weapons it has threatened to use against us -- further highlights the discrepancies in our foreign policy. Throw in the allure of a possible Nobel Peace Prize, for example, and the President seems willing to let dangerous authoritarian regimes like North Korea get away with the illegal proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human rights abuses, cyberattacks and more. Changing of the guard While the administration is preoccupied with influencing regime change in countries like Venezuela and Iran, there are other major leadership transitions underway that the United States should focus on if promoting democracy is a priority for this President. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was ousted earlier this month after nearly 30 years of rule, and the military now looks to be in control of the country for up to two years. While the military council, led by the generals who deposed Bashir, charts a way forward, it is unclear the Sudanese people will gain any new freedoms now that the dictator has been toppled. The United States should communicate that a transition toward actual democratic governance could benefit Sudan, with an agreement to lift US sanctions . I was 11 when Omar al-Bashir came to power. Terror is all his people have ever known In Algeria, hundreds of thousands of protesters are continuing their pressure campaign for sweeping democratic reform more than two weeks after President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on April 2. Protests calling for the ouster of a cadre of officials -- many of whom have dominated Algerian politics since the country gained independence from France in 1962 -- have been peaceful, but the Algerian military has warned that ""time is running out,"" suggesting that they could be gearing up for more violent responses. The US government has an opportunity -- and a responsibility -- to communicate to Algerian authorities that protecting democratic rights, including the right to peacefully protest, is critical. But it will take work to ensure that Trump's comments are in sync with any outreach by the administration. On Friday, Trump undercut his own team yet again on US policy towards Libya. The President decided to endorse Khalifa Haftar after the military strongman mounted an armed attack against the sitting government, which is backed by the UN. Just days before Trump made this endorsement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had denounced Haftar's efforts. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

We are likely going to witness a series of regime changes over the coming months.

Cain and Moore wouldn't shift the Fed. A Trump 2020 victory might - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Donna Borak,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/cain-moore-federal-reserve-control-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's selection of former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain and former Trump campaign adviser Stephen Moore to fill two open seats on the Federal Reserve board has unleashed a wave of anxiety about the independence of the world's most powerful central bank.
But even if they were to make it through Senate confirmation -- an uncertain outcome, given bipartisan objections from senators that have surfaced even before either has been formally nominated -- neither Moore nor Cain would have any immediate sway over the seven-member Fed board of governors. Though they would likely inject additional turbulence and uncertainty, offering splintering views in speeches and interviews, they would be in the minority when it comes to policymaking, outnumbered by traditional bankers and economists aligned with chairman Jerome Powell . The seven-member board is already dominated by people chosen by Trump. The President has made three appointments since he assumed office in January 2017, all of whom were confirmed with bipartisan support, and chose to elevate Powell, originally an Obama appointee, by naming him chair of the board of governors in 2017. Only one other Obama appointee, Lael Brainard, remains -- and her term runs through 2026, after the end of a possible second Trump term. Read More A Fed governor can be nominated by the President for a full 14-year term, and cannot be removed from office except for ""cause"" -- which does not include their policy views. The length of the terms mean governors routinely outlast presidents, and the terms are staggered to further insulate the Fed from political pressure. However, nothing requires a Fed governor to serve out their full term, and many don't. That means new governors are often appointed to complete the balance of an unexpired term. One Trump appointee, Michelle Bowman, comes up again in January 2020 -- the last Fed seat to open up before next year's presidential election. Three more seats are due to come up in the next presidential term. That means that if Trump wins re-election, he could put his stamp on the Fed well into the 2030s. And, more importantly, he will be in a position to name a new chair in 2022. Trump's unprecedented attacks on the Fed Since last year, Trump has publicly ripped into the Federal Reserve, calling the venerable institution filled with the country's top economists as ""crazy"" and ""loco"" for raising rates four times last year under Powell. He's even gone so far as to threaten firing Powell , Trump's own choice to lead the central bank for a four-year term that expires in 2022, claiming that rate hikes have undermined his plans to drive economic growth. Powell, a former investment banker who also served in the George H.W. Bush administration, was initially appointed to the Fed Board by President Barack Obama but named chairman in 2017 by Trump at the urging of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, succeeding Janet Yellen. During his tenure, Powell has repeatedly defended the impenetrability of the Fed to political interference, telling an audience in January, ""We have a strong culture. It's not a fragile one. It's not subject to be being disrupted."" So far, Powell has been able to build consensus with his existing board, with not a single dissenting vote on any policy decision since he took the helm in February 2018. That would change with Moore and Cain on the board. Private dissent is common on the Fed board It's not rare for members of the seven-member Board and any of the 12 regional Fed presidents around the country to offer dissenting views on monetary policy, and Fed chairs -- at least publicly -- have embraced diversity of views as a tenet of policymaking. Members of the Federal Open Market Committee, comprised of the seven Board members and 12 regional Fed presidents, have dissented under both of Powell's predecessors. Janet Yellen garnered 22 votes in opposition across a total of 31 interest-rate setting policy meetings while she was chair and there were 58 dissents under Ben Bernanke's chairmanship over the course of 65 meetings under Presidents George W. Bush and then Obama. But any perception of undermining the independence of any central bank runs the risk of undermining its effectiveness at keeping the economy on even keel and preventing inflation from taking off. ""The potential nominations of Herman Cain and Stephen Moore suggest the administration is changing its approach to the Federal Reserve,"" Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Barclays Investment Bank, wrote in a note clients. ""The selections could raise questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and could be perceived as an attempted politicization of monetary policy."""

""Joe's name is not coming up much,"" said one county Democratic chair in Iowa. ""There is a lot of interest in these new, fresh and younger candidates."" Read More To illustrate that point, this Democrat noted that a local bookstore owner was scrambling to get more copies of a book by Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose candidacy is generating considerable early buzz. Team Biden believes his official entry will change the conversation. It also believes his early poll numbers, which show him at the top of the pack, are anchored on more than just universal name recognition among Democrats. The Iowa county chair, though, was skeptical. ""I really don't think it is very deep or strong support."" New Hampshire comes next on the calendar, and its electorate could more closely mirror Biden's strength. But a big complicating factor there is that two of the state's neighbors are in the race -- Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. ""There is competition on the bread and butter issues,"" was how a seasoned New Hampshire Democratic operative described the challenge for Biden. This Democrat said the party's affection and respect for Biden and its hunger to beat President Trump would guarantee Biden a fair look. But, he added, ""this might not be fair but I don't think he will be allowed the mistakes all candidates tend to make."" Biden has said he waited to get into the race because he believed his stature in the party allowed him to take his time. The New Hampshire Democrat sees a downside to the wait -- saying, in his view, it allowed other candidates to gather support. ""I see both an open lane and a closing window, if that makes any sense,"" the New Hampshire Democrat said. 2. Will Stephen Miller testify? The Mueller Report is finished, but Democratic probes into the Trump Administration and the President's personal finances are just getting started. Near the top of the list -- an investigation into the president's immigration policy. The House Oversight Committee wants to hear from White House senior adviser Stephen Miller. ""He's the architect of a lot of the immigration agenda,"" New York Times congressional reporter Julie Hirschfeld Davis said. ""(They want him) to come testify in front of the committee voluntarily."" The committee gave him until Wednesday to respond to their invitation. ""It's pretty unlikely that Stephen Miller, who has been very much in the background ... will respond voluntarily to this invitation,"" Davis said. ""I think we can expect to see Congress continue to press to hear from Stephen Miller, to hear from other people inside the administration about what the plans are and what the legal defenses are of those steps."" 3. Security clearance fallout The House Oversight Committee is also looking into questions about security clearances granted to top White House aides over the objections of career officials. ""This is all part of the House Oversight Committee's investigation into how the security clearance process was handled, whether the President improperly overruled security officials and allowed his son-in-law Jared Kushner to get a security clearance, and Ivanka Trump as well,"" CNN's senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju said. This week, the committee is expected to hear from Carl Kline, who served as the White House personnel security director during the first two years of the Trump administration. A whistleblower alleges that Klein played a key role in reversing security clearance rejections for more than two dozen officials. ""The White House has been fighting this very hard almost every step of the way,"" Raju said. ""They are also threatening potentially to assert executive privilege in his testimony."" 4. Democrats' strategy to get Trump financial documents A third big subject for the Oversight Committee -- the President's personal finances. The Democrats have given the Treasury Department a Tuesday deadline to turn over Trump's tax returns. They are not expected to comply. ""But the House Democrats are employing this clever strategy to get Trump's financial information by going around the White House,"" Washington Post reporter congressional reporter Rachael Bade said. ""They have reached out to a number of financial institutions that Trump worked with as a businessman. ... And from lawyers that I have talked to, former House counsels I've spoken with, they actually think the Democrats have a very good shot at getting this information."" ""Trump World has tried to threaten these institutions and say, 'do not hand over this information,' they do not want to ignore a congressional subpoena and are likely to comply,"" Bade said. 5. Trump skipping media dinner again Next weekend is official Washington's biggest social event of the year -- the White House Correspondents Association Dinner. But for the third year in a row, President Trump will skip it. ""He'll go to Green Bay, Wisconsin, to hold another one of his big rallies with hardcore supporters,"" New York Times White House reporter Michael Shear said. ""That's a sort of diss by the President of the national media. Now it's no surprise the President would want to diss the 'fake news media,' but it is remarkable that even as he's facing an election campaign, he just doesn't feel see any need to repair that relationship or any of the other relationships with his adversaries."" The day before that rally, he'll speak at the NRA's annual meeting. ""There will likely not be a single mind in that audience that has to be convinced to support the President,"" Shear said. ""Presidents often try to expand their base of political support by going into the lion's den, speaking to people who don't necessarily agree with them ... His campaign thinks he can win without doing that. We'll see in about a year-and-a-half."""
Cain and Moore wouldn't shift the Fed. A Trump 2020 victory might - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Donna Borak,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/cain-moore-federal-reserve-control-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's selection of former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain and former Trump campaign adviser Stephen Moore to fill two open seats on the Federal Reserve board has unleashed a wave of anxiety about the independence of the world's most powerful central bank.
But even if they were to make it through Senate confirmation -- an uncertain outcome, given bipartisan objections from senators that have surfaced even before either has been formally nominated -- neither Moore nor Cain would have any immediate sway over the seven-member Fed board of governors. Though they would likely inject additional turbulence and uncertainty, offering splintering views in speeches and interviews, they would be in the minority when it comes to policymaking, outnumbered by traditional bankers and economists aligned with chairman Jerome Powell . The seven-member board is already dominated by people chosen by Trump. The President has made three appointments since he assumed office in January 2017, all of whom were confirmed with bipartisan support, and chose to elevate Powell, originally an Obama appointee, by naming him chair of the board of governors in 2017. Only one other Obama appointee, Lael Brainard, remains -- and her term runs through 2026, after the end of a possible second Trump term. Read More A Fed governor can be nominated by the President for a full 14-year term, and cannot be removed from office except for ""cause"" -- which does not include their policy views. The length of the terms mean governors routinely outlast presidents, and the terms are staggered to further insulate the Fed from political pressure. However, nothing requires a Fed governor to serve out their full term, and many don't. That means new governors are often appointed to complete the balance of an unexpired term. One Trump appointee, Michelle Bowman, comes up again in January 2020 -- the last Fed seat to open up before next year's presidential election. Three more seats are due to come up in the next presidential term. That means that if Trump wins re-election, he could put his stamp on the Fed well into the 2030s. And, more importantly, he will be in a position to name a new chair in 2022. Trump's unprecedented attacks on the Fed Since last year, Trump has publicly ripped into the Federal Reserve, calling the venerable institution filled with the country's top economists as ""crazy"" and ""loco"" for raising rates four times last year under Powell. He's even gone so far as to threaten firing Powell , Trump's own choice to lead the central bank for a four-year term that expires in 2022, claiming that rate hikes have undermined his plans to drive economic growth. Powell, a former investment banker who also served in the George H.W. Bush administration, was initially appointed to the Fed Board by President Barack Obama but named chairman in 2017 by Trump at the urging of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, succeeding Janet Yellen. During his tenure, Powell has repeatedly defended the impenetrability of the Fed to political interference, telling an audience in January, ""We have a strong culture. It's not a fragile one. It's not subject to be being disrupted."" So far, Powell has been able to build consensus with his existing board, with not a single dissenting vote on any policy decision since he took the helm in February 2018. That would change with Moore and Cain on the board. Private dissent is common on the Fed board It's not rare for members of the seven-member Board and any of the 12 regional Fed presidents around the country to offer dissenting views on monetary policy, and Fed chairs -- at least publicly -- have embraced diversity of views as a tenet of policymaking. Members of the Federal Open Market Committee, comprised of the seven Board members and 12 regional Fed presidents, have dissented under both of Powell's predecessors. Janet Yellen garnered 22 votes in opposition across a total of 31 interest-rate setting policy meetings while she was chair and there were 58 dissents under Ben Bernanke's chairmanship over the course of 65 meetings under Presidents George W. Bush and then Obama. But any perception of undermining the independence of any central bank runs the risk of undermining its effectiveness at keeping the economy on even keel and preventing inflation from taking off. ""The potential nominations of Herman Cain and Stephen Moore suggest the administration is changing its approach to the Federal Reserve,"" Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Barclays Investment Bank, wrote in a note clients. ""The selections could raise questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and could be perceived as an attempted politicization of monetary policy."""
Premier League: Manchester United suffer humiliating defeat against Everton,us.cnn.com,"Matias Grez, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/football/premier-league-manchester-united-everton-spt-intl/index.html,"Story highlights Cardiff 0-2 Liverpool Liverpool regain Premier League top spot Everton 4-0 Manchester United Worst defeat since Solskjær took over (CNN) Georginio Wijnaldum and James Milner fired Liverpool back to the top of the Premier League as Jurgen Klopp's side overcame a resilient Cardiff City.
After a goalless first half in the Welsh capital, Dutch midfielder Wijnaldum broke the deadlock in emphatic fashion 10 minutes into the second period, striking a crisp half-volley from Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner. Liverpool rode their luck in the second half as Alisson's costly error almost gifted relegation-threatened Cardiff the equalizer, but Sean Morrison failed to convert. Milner then secured the three points nine minutes from time, converting from the penalty spot after Morrison had clumsily hauled Mo Salah to the ground. Just 24 hours earlier, Liverpool had seen Manchester City regain the lead at the top of the Premier League thanks to a hard-fought victory over Tottenham and knew only a win against Cardiff would keep them in the hunt for a first top flight title since 1990. Read More Mohamed Salah is hauled to the ground by Sean Morrison for a Liverpool penalty. Liverpool now sit two points clear at the summit with City's game in hand against Manchester United to come on Wednesday. Though the bitterest of rivals they may be, you get the sense Liverpool fans will be cheering on United in three days' time. Victory takes Liverpool onto 88 points, a new Premier League record for the club and a total that would have been good enough to win the league in six of the last 11 seasons. Manchester United humiliated Manchester United suffered the worst defeat of Ole Gunnar Solskjær's reign as manager, going down 4-0 against Everton at Goodison Park. The hosts took a commanding first-half lead thanks to goals from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson, before Lucas Digne and Theo Walcott turned the game into a rout in the second half. So poor was the performance -- United didn't register a shot on target until the 85th minute -- Solskjær went over to the traveling fans after the match and held his hands up in apology. United have now conceded 48 goals this season, their worst defensive tally in Premier League history -- and there are still four matches left to play. READ: Man City return to top of Premier League with victory over Tottenham READ: Juventus and Cristiano Ronaldo make history in Italy ""From the first whistle, everything went wrong,"" Solskjaer told Sky Sports after the match. ""I just want to apologize to the fans. They're the only people with the badge on today who can hold their head high, because we can't."" Defeat leaves United two points behind Arsenal in fourth place -- the final Champions League spot -- though the Gunners play their game in hand against Crystal Palace later on Saturday. The loss to Everton, which sees Solskjær's side now on a run of six defeats in eight games, was the first time United have conceded four goals in a Premier League game since October 2016. In the build up to this game, Solskjær had abruptly stated that some of his players needed a ""reality check"" following a poor run of form which culminated in last week's humbling 3-0 defeat to Barcelona. Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer apologizes to the traveling fans after the match. If he had been hoping for a reaction him team on Sunday then United's performance will have left him exasperated, as Everton took a 2-0 lead with less than half an hour played. The Norwegian coach, evidently bitterly disappointed with the performance, hauled off Phil Jones and Fred at half time for Ashley Young and Scott McTominay. But things went from bad to worse for the visiting side as Digne made it 3-0 within 10 minutes of the restart and Walcott put the icing on the cake 10 minutes later. Since that improbable comeback away at PSG in the Champions League -- a ninth away win in a row -- United have now lost five consecutive games away from home for the first time since 1981. Up next is the small matter of the Manchester Derby, as Solskjær's side welcome Pep Guardiola and Manchester City to Old Trafford on Wednesday in the hope of derailing their Premier League title charge."

(CNN) A wave of attacks in Sri Lanka",04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/asia/sri-lanka-attacks-explainer-intl/index.html,"(CNN) A wave of attacks in Sri Lanka left at least 207 people dead and hundreds more injured on Easter Sunday after a series of explosions tore through churches and hotels on what should have been a day of rest and worship.
By Sunday afternoon, there were eight blasts and the government had announced an island-wide curfew starting at 6 p.m. local (8:30 a.m. ET Sunday) until the following morning. Social media sites were also blocked as investigations took place. ""These are certainly acts of terror,"" the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to the UK Manisha Gunasekera told CNN on Sunday. ""This is an attack against the whole of Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka is very multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural country and the whole country comes together in celebration of Easter Sunday."" What happened? Read More There were almost simultaneous explosions on Sunday morning, which hit busy Easter services at churches in three separate cities. Targets included St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo, St. Sebastian's Church more than 22 miles north in Negombo, and the evangelical Zion Church in Batticaloa, 196 miles away from Colombo on Sri Lanka's east coast. Additional explosions occurred on Sunday morning at high-end hotels in Colombo: the Cinnamon Grand, Shangri-La Hotel and The Kingsbury. By the afternoon, a seventh and eighth blast occurred at a hotel in front of the Dehiwala Zoo in Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia and at a private house in Mahawila Gardens, in Dematagoda, while police officers conducted a house raid. Who carried out the attacks? It is still unclear who caused the attacks. What is known is at least seven people have been arrested in connection with the bombings and three police officers were killed during a house raid in connection to the attacks. ""The Colombo crime division... went to a house at [Mahawila Gardens] in Dematagoda, in relation to information received with regard to these hotels explosions,"" Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara, said at a press conference. ""When crime division officials started questioning the people in the house, two explosions occurred, One sub inspector and two constables of police have been killed and one constable was taken to the national hospital with wounds,"" he added. High Commissioner Gunasekera, told CNN they had information that the attacks were suicide bombings. Who was targeted? Sri Lanka's minority Christian community appeared to be the main target of the seemingly coordinated attacks. Christianity is a minority religion in Sri Lanka, accounting for less than 10% of the total population of 21.4 million. According to census data, 70.2% of Sri Lankans identify as Buddhist, 12% Hindu, 9.7% Muslim, and 7.4% Christian. It is estimated that 82% of Sri Lankan Christians are Roman Catholic Tourists were also targeted in the attacks, Sri Lanka High Commissioner Gunasekera told CNN.

Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on ""CNN Newsroom"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.
(CNN) Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report has arrived. While the report is more than 400 pages long, it raises countless new questions -- so many, in fact, that we decided to run a special installment of ""Cross-exam"" to answer them. Let's dig in.
Elie Honig Stan, Montana: Mueller spent two years investigating. Why did we need a meaningless summary filtered by Attorney General William Barr? ""Meaningless"" would have been an improvement. Now that we've seen the report itself, we know that Barr's four-page summary -- which he later claimed was not actually a summary -- was misleading and manipulative. Two main things jump out about how Barr used his letter to preemptively distort perceptions of Mueller's report. First, Barr told us that Mueller could not decide the obstruction issue, which ""leaves it to the Attorney General."" Predictably, and true to his previously stated hostility to Mueller's obstruction inquiry, Barr gave a thumbs-down -- declaring that obstruction charges do not apply to President Donald Trump. However, Mueller likely had no intention for Barr to jump in. Nowhere in the report does Mueller call on the Attorney General to decide the obstruction issue. Rather, Mueller notes that he specifically ""determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes"" (Volume 2, Page 2) because Department of Justice policy prevents indictment of a sitting president. Read More Given that Justice Department policy ties Mueller's hands on charging Trump criminally, Mueller appears to refer the obstruction matter to Congress: ""[w]ith respect to whether the President can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded that Congress has the authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice."" (Volume 2, Page 8). This line is somewhat ambiguous. Mueller appears to refer the obstruction inquiry to Congress to consider impeachment proceedings, though he might simply be mentioning that Congress has the power to take legislative action. Either way, it is notable that Mueller invoked Congress in his analysis of the obstruction issue. Yet in his four-page summary, Barr made no mention of Mueller's call to Congress on obstruction -- which might be the single most significant line of the entire report. Mueller report is quite the page-turner Second, Barr quoted the Mueller report selectively and strategically to protect Trump. For example, Barr told us the good news for Trump on Russia: Mueller found that ""the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" Yet that quote from Barr turns out to be only the second half of a complete sentence. In the first half of that same sentence -- which Barr clipped off -- Mueller tells us, ""Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts..."" (Volume I, Page 1-2). This kind of intentional, selective quotation would get an ordinary lawyer torn apart by a judge. For nearly a month since he first received Mueller's report, Barr gave Congress and the American people an inaccurate and disingenuous account of Mueller's findings. Now that the report has been released, we can clearly see how Barr issued a selective summary of Mueller's findings that benefited Trump. Through his handling of the Mueller report, Barr has thrown his credibility and independence in the gutter. Patti, Texas: Did Mueller deliberately avoid any conclusions about Trump's legal culpability because he was following existing Justice Department precedent and knew that only Congress could take action against the president? Yes. Mueller based his decision not to come to a prosecutorial conclusion on obstruction largely on the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president. Here's another area where Barr was dishonest, stating during his press conference , before the release of the report, that Mueller did not decide obstruction because the evidence was ambiguous -- when in fact Mueller made clear in the report that he did not decide obstruction largely because of the existing policy. Mueller declined to make a typical charge-or-no-charge prosecutorial decision because ""fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought."" Mueller also noted, perhaps suggestively, that it is entirely permissible to investigate a president while he is in office and to indict after the term ends. (Volume 2, Page 1). And then Mueller gave us a perplexing construct: ""if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment."" In other words: if we concluded it was not a crime, we'd tell you -- and we're not telling you. Matt, Arizona: How could the White House be given access to the report before Congress? Barr did Trump a favor by providing a redacted version of the Mueller report to the White House before Congress or the American public got to see it. While there was no legal prohibition against Barr providing the report, the move reflected Barr's political solicitude of Trump. Barr claimed that he provided an advanced copy to the White House ""consistent with the Ethics in Government Act."" Barr's defense here is limp and confused. The law to which he refers expired in 1999 , and was used before that to deny an advance copy of Independent Counsel Ken Starr's report to the White House. Barr did not need to offer any legal explanation. He was within his rights to give the report to the White House early -- even though it was plainly political to do so. But rather than owning up, Barr instead offered up a flimsy legal justification for his baldly political act. The Mueller report is shocking Karie, North Dakota: How can Mueller conclude there is no collusion when Donald Trump Jr. accepted a meeting with Russians to get damaging information on Hillary Clinton and hurt her election prospects? Donald Trump Jr. danced between the raindrops of a criminal charge based on his participation in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a group of Russians who had offered dirt on Hillary Clinton (prompting Trump Jr.'s infamous e-mail response ""if it's what you say I love it""). Mueller spends 14 pages (Volume 2, Pages 110-123) in the report describing his factual findings about the Trump Tower meeting and another eight (Volume 2, Pages 183-190) discussing the potential criminal implications, noting that the meeting ""could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and donations by foreign nationals."" (Volume 2, Page 185). Ultimately, what separated Trump Jr. from an indictment, according to Mueller, was that Trump Jr. did not provably have the heightened understanding of the law required to convict a person of campaign finance crimes. (Vol. 2, Pages 187-188). In other words, if Trump Jr. had had a slightly more sophisticated understanding of campaign finance laws, he might well have found himself on the wrong end of an indictment for soliciting or receiving illegal foreign campaign contributions from Russians. Charles, Indiana: Does the Mueller report include background on the Steele Dossier and its use in FISA subpoenas? Mueller's report dealt a death blow to the conspiracy theory that the investigation of Russian election meddling began with a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant based on the controversial Steele Dossier. Rather, we now know for sure that the Russian interference investigation began when Trump campaign official George Papadopoulos revealed to a foreign government that the ""Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to"" Hillary Clinton (Volume I, Page 1). ( Papadopoulos was later convicted of lying to the FBI about those contacts). Mueller confirmed that ""that information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation"" into connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. (Volume I, Page 1).

Notwithstanding this straightforward finding of fact by Mueller, Barr testified in Congress that ""I think spying did occur."" This statement by Barr -- in which he used a non-legal term that also happens to be one of Trump's favorite political rallying and fundraising points -- is (1) false because a FISA judge lawfully approved the controversial warrant, and (2) entirely beside the point because, as we now know, it had nothing to do with the origins of Mueller's work in the first place. Three questions to watch this week: 1. Will Congress call Barr and Mueller to testify, and will we get an answer on whether Mueller intended to refer the obstruction case to Congress? 2. Will Trump's team issue their ""rebuttal,"" and how will they respond to Mueller's evidence of Russian contacts and potential obstruction? 3. Mueller referred 14 cases to other prosecutors. We only know about two of them . What are the remaining 12?"
Lizzo is musical artist you need to hear right now,edition.cnn.com,Kendall Trammell,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/entertainment/lizzo-new-album-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) If you're not familiar with Lizzo yet, you'll be hearing a lot more about her soon.
The singer and rapper released her new album ""Cuz I Love You"" Friday, and it's quickly climbed the charts alongside artists like Beyoncé . That shouldn't surprise anyone who knows a thing or two about the ""Juice"" singer, who also rocked the crowd at Coachella this year . Lizzo songs like ""Coconut Oil"" and ""Good As Hell"" are unapologetic, self-love mantras that empower a demographic we rarely see celebrated: plus-sized black women. In her music they're depicted as confident, sexual and a lot of fun. Here's what else you should know about her. Read More She stopped talking in order to find her voice Lizzo, born as Melissa Viviane Jefferson, grew up in Houston and stopped talking for three months when she was 20 years old. ""I don't know what was wrong. It was dark,"" she told Great Big Story. The singer, who turns 31 next week, said she needed to listen to the voice inside of her to learn her life's purpose. During her self-imposed silence, she decided she wanted to become a singer. Now signed to Atlantic Records, Lizzo wants her music to make the world a better place. ""I want to see tons of plus-size pop stars,"" she said. ""I want to see black girl magic. I just want to see us way more."" Therapy had a big influence on her life and music Last summer Lizzo said she started going to therapy, which shaped her life more than what was happening on her Twitter and Instagram feeds. ""That was really scary,"" she told Rolling Stone . ""But going on that journey of being vulnerable with someone who I didn't know, and then learning how to be vulnerable with people that I do know, gave me the courage to be vulnerable as a vocalist."" Lizzo said she tried to sing the words in her new album's title track like they were being ripped from her lungs so her listeners could hear her vulnerability. ""I was so afraid of sounding like that for so long. It's a raw part of me that I didn't allow myself to celebrate."" Her social feeds are authentic and unfiltered Lizzo has a lot of personality and is not afraid to be herself. Sometimes she likes to play the flute on stage. Other days, you can catch her showing off her twerking skills. You can tell she's comfortable in her own skin, communicating body positivity to her fans and directly interacting with them on a frequent basis. In the digital age, it's important for your audience to know you, she told CNN in 201 6. That's one of the reasons she says her music sticks among black women. Because they can see themselves in her work. ""I realized that it's because I am who I am that makes these songs political,"" Lizzo said. ""You get a skinny white girl singing 'Coconut Oil' ... and it's one thing. I sing it, and it's this whole other thing.""

We shouldn't compare Lizzo to other music icons Sure, we could drop a few names to give you a better idea of who Lizzo is. We could say she's a more profane Amy Winehouse, a more irreverent Erykah Badu, an equally woke Beyoncé. But that would undermine the whole essence of Lizzo, a black woman who is just trying to be herself."

Eminem went to rehab in 2005 to get treatment for his addiction to sleeping pills. But in 2007, he spiraled out of control again and was hospitalized for a methadone overdose. It wasn't until 2008 that Eminem decided he wasn't about to lose himself to drugs. According to the New York Times , he checked himself into rehab early that year and started the full 12-step program of a recovering addict. He got sober on April 20, 2008. His albums ""Relapse"" and ""Recovery"" deal with his addiction and his comeback."

Prince's 5 best-selling albums,us.cnn.com,"Jodi Upchurch and Brandon Griggs, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/entertainment/prince-albums-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) When Prince died on April 21, 2016 , he left behind an extensive catalog which could not to be confined to a single genre.

John Bolton's 'troika of tyranny' message has its risks,us.cnn.com,Samantha Vinograd,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/trump-weekly-briefing-bolton-regime-changes-vinograd/index.html,"Samantha Vinograd is a CNN national security analyst. She served on President Obama's National Security Council from 2009-2013 and at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush. Follow her @sam_vinograd . The views expressed her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) Last week, US National Security Adviser John Bolton took direct aim at specific leaders in Latin America, declaring that the ""troika of tyranny -- Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua -- is beginning to crumble.""
He also outlined new measures the Trump administration is taking, such as sanctions on the Central Bank of Venezuela, to hasten their demise. Many may interpret Bolton's declaration, which echoes President George W. Bush's oft-repeated ""axis of evil"" phrase, as a new foundation for pursuing regime change. Samantha Vinograd The 'three stooges' These ""three stooges of socialism,"" as Bolton calls the leaders of the three countries, are are not the targets of his rhetoric alone. President Donald Trump is implementing direct measures against them, including restrictions on US dollar transactions by banks in Venezuela and Nicaragua, in an effort to cut off finances for the leaders of both countries. Read More When it comes to Cuba, the administration is reversing Obama-era policies designed to support the Cuban people and reinstating a cap on the amount Americans can send to their relatives there. Trump has been very public about his policy of pushing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power. He declared Maduro an illegitimate leader and said that all options remain on the table, including a military intervention . Maduro has long accused the US of supporting a coup against him , and now we are openly using all the available tools to remove him from power. The administration has also voiced support for a change in leadership in Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega and others associated with him have been added to the US sanctions list . Democratic socialism is the scenic route to serfdom Bolton has a history of supporting regime changes and his latest statements are likely fueling the notion that the United States is prepared to throw its weight behind leaders it favors. While the administration's efforts to unseat socialist leaders in Latin America have been uncharacteristically disciplined, these moves align with the President's domestic attacks on perceived political opponents whom he labels socialists. And it's important to note that Trump has had harsher words for socialist leaders in Latin America -- who do not pose threats to US national security or our sovereignty -- than he's had for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who's overseeing an ongoing attack on our democracy. The message from the administration is that not all regimes are created equal. Trump appears more willing to push back against leaders who espouse a political doctrine that he views as a threat to his own political standing. Behavioral therapy in Iran? The Trump administration has said that it is not seeking regime change in Iran, but rather a change in behavior. Trump's latest Iran decision sets a dangerous precedent However, these statements become harder to believe as the administration not only ramps up economic pressure on Iran, but also launches a very public PR campaign against the ""outlaw"" regime . The State Department has denounced the regime's ""grotesque level of self-interest,"" routinely says that the Iranian people ""deserve better"" and uses social media to encourage the Iranian people to speak out against the government. This looks, sounds and smells like support for regime change in a lot of ways. The juxtaposition between the administration's attitude toward the Iranian regime, which currently has no nuclear weapons, and its approach toward North Korea -- a regime that has weapons it has threatened to use against us -- further highlights the discrepancies in our foreign policy. Throw in the allure of a possible Nobel Peace Prize, for example, and the President seems willing to let dangerous authoritarian regimes like North Korea get away with the illegal proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human rights abuses, cyberattacks and more. Changing of the guard While the administration is preoccupied with influencing regime change in countries like Venezuela and Iran, there are other major leadership transitions underway that the United States should focus on if promoting democracy is a priority for this President. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was ousted earlier this month after nearly 30 years of rule, and the military now looks to be in control of the country for up to two years. While the military council, led by the generals who deposed Bashir, charts a way forward, it is unclear the Sudanese people will gain any new freedoms now that the dictator has been toppled. The United States should communicate that a transition toward actual democratic governance could benefit Sudan, with an agreement to lift US sanctions . I was 11 when Omar al-Bashir came to power. Terror is all his people have ever known In Algeria, hundreds of thousands of protesters are continuing their pressure campaign for sweeping democratic reform more than two weeks after President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on April 2. Protests calling for the ouster of a cadre of officials -- many of whom have dominated Algerian politics since the country gained independence from France in 1962 -- have been peaceful, but the Algerian military has warned that ""time is running out,"" suggesting that they could be gearing up for more violent responses. The US government has an opportunity -- and a responsibility -- to communicate to Algerian authorities that protecting democratic rights, including the right to peacefully protest, is critical. But it will take work to ensure that Trump's comments are in sync with any outreach by the administration. On Friday, Trump undercut his own team yet again on US policy towards Libya. The President decided to endorse Khalifa Haftar after the military strongman mounted an armed attack against the sitting government, which is backed by the UN. Just days before Trump made this endorsement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had denounced Haftar's efforts. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

We are likely going to witness a series of regime changes over the coming months. The administration's ability to position itself as an honest broker would be reinforced by developing a consistent approach to leadership transitions rather than continuing to support the ouster of certain oppressive leaders while embracing others."
William Barr threw his credibility in the gutter (opinion),us.cnn.com,Elie Honig,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/william-barr-mueller-report-credibility-gutter-honig/index.html,"In this weekly column ""Cross-exam,"" Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers.

(CNN) Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report has arrived. While the report is more than 400 pages long, it raises countless new questions -- so many, in fact, that we decided to run a special installment of ""Cross-exam"" to answer them. Let's dig in.
Elie Honig Stan, Montana: Mueller spent two years investigating. Why did we need a meaningless summary filtered by Attorney General William Barr? ""Meaningless"" would have been an improvement. Now that we've seen the report itself, we know that Barr's four-page summary -- which he later claimed was not actually a summary -- was misleading and manipulative. Two main things jump out about how Barr used his letter to preemptively distort perceptions of Mueller's report. First, Barr told us that Mueller could not decide the obstruction issue, which ""leaves it to the Attorney General."" Predictably, and true to his previously stated hostility to Mueller's obstruction inquiry, Barr gave a thumbs-down -- declaring that obstruction charges do not apply to President Donald Trump. However, Mueller likely had no intention for Barr to jump in. Nowhere in the report does Mueller call on the Attorney General to decide the obstruction issue. Rather, Mueller notes that he specifically ""determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes"" (Volume 2, Page 2) because Department of Justice policy prevents indictment of a sitting president. Read More Given that Justice Department policy ties Mueller's hands on charging Trump criminally, Mueller appears to refer the obstruction matter to Congress: ""[w]ith respect to whether the President can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded that Congress has the authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice."" (Volume 2, Page 8). This line is somewhat ambiguous. Mueller appears to refer the obstruction inquiry to Congress to consider impeachment proceedings, though he might simply be mentioning that Congress has the power to take legislative action. Either way, it is notable that Mueller invoked Congress in his analysis of the obstruction issue. Yet in his four-page summary, Barr made no mention of Mueller's call to Congress on obstruction -- which might be the single most significant line of the entire report. Mueller report is quite the page-turner Second, Barr Quote: d the Mueller report selectively and strategically to protect Trump. For example, Barr told us the good news for Trump on Russia: Mueller found that ""the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" Yet that Quote: from Barr turns out to be only the second half of a complete sentence. In the first half of that same sentence -- which Barr clipped off -- Mueller tells us, ""Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts..."" (Volume I, Page 1-2). This kind of intentional, selective quotation would get an ordinary lawyer torn apart by a judge. For nearly a month since he first received Mueller's report, Barr gave Congress and the American people an inaccurate and disingenuous account of Mueller's findings. Now that the report has been released, we can clearly see how Barr issued a selective summary of Mueller's findings that benefited Trump. Through his handling of the Mueller report, Barr has thrown his credibility and independence in the gutter. Patti, Texas: Did Mueller deliberately avoid any conclusions about Trump's legal culpability because he was following existing Justice Department precedent and knew that only Congress could take action against the president? Yes. Mueller based his decision not to come to a prosecutorial conclusion on obstruction largely on the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president. Here's another area where Barr was dishonest, stating during his press conference , before the release of the report, that Mueller did not decide obstruction because the evidence was ambiguous -- when in fact Mueller made clear in the report that he did not decide obstruction largely because of the existing policy. Mueller declined to make a typical charge-or-no-charge prosecutorial decision because ""fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought."" Mueller also noted, perhaps suggestively, that it is entirely permissible to investigate a president while he is in office and to indict after the term ends. (Volume 2, Page 1). And then Mueller gave us a perplexing construct: ""if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment."" In other words: if we concluded it was not a crime, we'd tell you -- and we're not telling you. Matt, Arizona: How could the White House be given access to the report before Congress? Barr did Trump a favor by providing a redacted version of the Mueller report to the White House before Congress or the American public got to see it. While there was no legal prohibition against Barr providing the report, the move reflected Barr's political solicitude of Trump. Barr claimed that he provided an advanced copy to the White House ""consistent with the Ethics in Government Act."" Barr's defense here is limp and confused. The law to which he refers expired in 1999 , and was used before that to deny an advance copy of Independent Counsel Ken Starr's report to the White House. Barr did not need to offer any legal explanation. He was within his rights to give the report to the White House early -- even though it was plainly political to do so. But rather than owning up, Barr instead offered up a flimsy legal justification for his baldly political act. The Mueller report is shocking Karie, North Dakota: How can Mueller conclude there is no collusion when Donald Trump Jr. accepted a meeting with Russians to get damaging information on Hillary Clinton and hurt her election prospects? Donald Trump Jr. danced between the raindrops of a criminal charge based on his participation in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a group of Russians who had offered dirt on Hillary Clinton (prompting Trump Jr.'s infamous e-mail response ""if it's what you say I love it""). Mueller spends 14 pages (Volume 2, Pages 110-123) in the report describing his factual findings about the Trump Tower meeting and another eight (Volume 2, Pages 183-190) discussing the potential criminal implications, noting that the meeting ""could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and donations by foreign nationals."" (Volume 2, Page 185). Ultimately, what separated Trump Jr. from an indictment, according to Mueller, was that Trump Jr. did not provably have the heightened understanding of the law required to convict a person of campaign finance crimes. (Vol. 2, Pages 187-188). In other words, if Trump Jr. had had a slightly more sophisticated understanding of campaign finance laws, he might well have found himself on the wrong end of an indictment for soliciting or receiving illegal foreign campaign contributions from Russians. Charles, Indiana: Does the Mueller report include background on the Steele Dossier and its use in FISA subpoenas? Mueller's report dealt a death blow to the conspiracy theory that the investigation of Russian election meddling began with a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant based on the controversial Steele Dossier. Rather, we now know for sure that the Russian interference investigation began when Trump campaign official George Papadopoulos revealed to a foreign government that the ""Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to"" Hillary Clinton (Volume I, Page 1). ( Papadopoulos was later convicted of lying to the FBI about those contacts). Mueller confirmed that ""that information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation"" into connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. (Volume I, Page 1).

Notwithstanding this straightforward finding of fact by Mueller, Barr testified in Congress that ""I think spying did occur."" This statement by Barr -- in which he used a non-legal term that also happens to be one of Trump's favorite political rallying and fundraising points -- is (1) false because a FISA judge lawfully approved the controversial warrant, and (2) entirely beside the point because, as we now know, it had nothing to do with the origins of Mueller's work in the first place. Three questions to watch this week: 1. Will Congress call Barr and Mueller to testify, and will we get an answer on whether Mueller intended to refer the obstruction case to Congress? 2. Will Trump's team issue their ""rebuttal,"" and how will they respond to Mueller's evidence of Russian contacts and potential obstruction? 3. Mueller referred 14 cases to other prosecutors. We only know about two of them . What are the remaining 12?"

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN) A wave of attacks in Sri Lanka",04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/21/asia/sri-lanka-attacks-explainer-intl/index.html,"(CNN) A wave of attacks in Sri Lanka left at least 207 people dead and hundreds more injured on Easter Sunday after a series of explosions tore through churches and hotels on what should have been a day of rest and worship.
By Sunday afternoon, there were eight blasts and the government had announced an island-wide curfew starting at 6 p.m. local (8:30 a.m. ET Sunday) until the following morning. Social media sites were also blocked as investigations took place. ""These are certainly acts of terror,"" the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to the UK Manisha Gunasekera told CNN on Sunday. ""This is an attack against the whole of Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka is very multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural country and the whole country comes together in celebration of Easter Sunday."" What happened? Read More There were almost simultaneous explosions on Sunday morning, which hit busy Easter services at churches in three separate cities. Targets included St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo, St. Sebastian's Church more than 22 miles north in Negombo, and the evangelical Zion Church in Batticaloa, 196 miles away from Colombo on Sri Lanka's east coast. Additional explosions occurred on Sunday morning at high-end hotels in Colombo: the Cinnamon Grand, Shangri-La Hotel and The Kingsbury. By the afternoon, a seventh and eighth blast occurred at a hotel in front of the Dehiwala Zoo in Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia and at a private house in Mahawila Gardens, in Dematagoda, while police officers conducted a house raid. Who carried out the attacks? It is still unclear who caused the attacks. What is known is at least seven people have been arrested in connection with the bombings and three police officers were killed during a house raid in connection to the attacks. ""The Colombo crime division... went to a house at [Mahawila Gardens] in Dematagoda, in relation to information received with regard to these hotels explosions,"" Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara, said at a press conference. ""When crime division officials started questioning the people in the house, two explosions occurred, One sub inspector and two constables of police have been killed and one constable was taken to the national hospital with wounds,"" he added. High Commissioner Gunasekera, told CNN they had information that the attacks were suicide bombings. Who was targeted? Sri Lanka's minority Christian community appeared to be the main target of the seemingly coordinated attacks. Christianity is a minority religion in Sri Lanka, accounting for less than 10% of the total population of 21.4 million. According to census data, 70.2% of Sri Lankans identify as Buddhist, 12% Hindu, 9.7% Muslim, and 7.4% Christian. It is estimated that 82% of Sri Lankan Christians are Roman Catholic Tourists were also targeted in the attacks, Sri Lanka High Commissioner Gunasekera told CNN.

Mueller report is quite the page-turner (opinion) - CNN,www.cnn.com,Richard Galant,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/mueller-report-is-quite-the-page-turner-galant/index.html,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
(CNN) When it finally came to light this week, special counsel Robert Mueller's report seemed to animate everyone -- and satisfy no one.
The report's 448 pages (with 946 redactions, courtesy of Attorney General William Barr) laid out evidence of a systematic campaign by the Russian government to undermine American democracy -- and of President Donald Trump's efforts to throw sand in the gears of the law enforcement machine that was investigating him. At the same time, Trump's defenders could point to Mueller's conclusions that the President's 2016 campaign did not illegally coordinate with the Russians and that he would not charge the President with obstructing justice. That measured verdict gave ammunition to all sides. The report, wrote Princeton historian Julian Zelizer, "" does not exonerate him from obstruction of justice -- the charge at the heart of Presidents Nixon's and Clinton's impeachment processes. The Mueller team found multiple instances where Trump tried to stifle a legitimate investigation into his own conduct. Very often the only thing that saved him were advisers who wouldn't do what he wanted done. ... Indeed, if this is a 'good' report for the President, it is hard to imagine what a bad one would look like."" But for a Republican commentator, the report's findings were more than enough reason to turn the page: ""It's a painful pill for Trump critics to swallow, but ill-advised is not illegal, unsavory is not unlawful, and chaos is not a conspiracy,"" observed Alice Stewart . The report can be summed up in ""four simple words: Russiagate was no Watergate ."" Read More What if Trump said... To truly turn the page, though, might require the kind of presidential speech Trump could never give, wrote CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen . He imagined these healing words : ""My fellow Americans. ...The special counsel's report has cleared me and my team from conspiracy but I have to acknowledge that the report also paints a devastating portrait of the Russian efforts to manipulate our electoral process. Therefore, I now accept that this was not the possible work of 'some guy in his home in New Jersey' as I said during the transition. ...In fact, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his henchmen are the only ones to blame. This is a disgrace and I am instructing my national security team to prevent any kind of repeat of what happened in 2016 ..."" Barr at the barricades Barr, who released the Mueller report, set the table for it with the four-page letter he wrote last month, disclosing some of Mueller's findings and adding his own determination that Trump wouldn't be charged with obstruction. Then, minutes before the report's release on Thursday, Barr held a news conference that seemed designed to further shape how the public would perceive the report. Many were outraged. "" William Barr has cemented his status as a crafty partisan whose primary tricks are to cloak his political moves to shape public opinion and to protect President Trump under a thin sheen of law and process,"" wrote CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Elie Honig . Journalist Jill Filipovic observed that the attorney general appeared to be trying to make excuses for Trump's behavior, as described in the Mueller report, because of what he called Trump's ""sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency."" A woman under those circumstances would be accused of surrendering to her emotions and wouldn't get any sympathy. ""Men in an emotional tailspin have 'sincere beliefs,'"" she noted. "" Trump is perhaps the most emotionally unbalanced national politician in living memory, tweeting semi-literate all-caps outbursts and frothing up his followers with incoherent tirades."" The defects in the Barr-driven process aren't only his fault, wrote CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin . They were a glaring illustration of why it was a mistake for Congress to abolish powerful independent counsels after the Ken Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton. Notre Dame will rebuild Easter Sunday began in Paris with parts of the ancient Notre Dame Cathedral in ruins and with the French nation vowing to rebuild. The Monday fire that destroyed the roof and collapsed the spire of the church, which has sat on an island in the Seine for eight centuries, riveted and saddened people around the world. "" What a week for this fire to happen : a time when thousands of worshippers in France were readying themselves through penitence and prayer for the Passion, for Easter itself -- the celebration that comes on Resurrection Sunday,"" wrote Jay Parini. ""It felt like the entire world was in pain,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""In a time of inflamed political, religious and sectarian divisions, somehow, a fire in a Catholic church, a cathedral in France, managed to melt away the animosity -- if only for a moment -- and bring people together in shared sorrow. Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jew, or atheist; in France, India, Argentina, everywhere."" In the National Review, Rich Lowry wrote, ""Notre Dame stands for so many qualities that we now lack -- patience and staying power, the cultivation of beauty, a deep religious faith, the cultural confidence and ambition to build a timeless monument of our civilization -- that the collapse of its spire was almost too much to bear ."" The fire brought painful memories, and also a sense of determination, to Katie Hawkins-Gaar . As newlyweds, she and her husband Jamie took pictures in front of the cathedral in 2008 and vowed to return to Paris every five years. But when Katie returned in 2018, she was alone -- and carrying her husband's ashes. He had collapsed and died while running a half-marathon at the age of 32. "" Everything is ephemeral, including the people and places we love ,"" she wrote. ""Notre Dame will rebuild. And so will I."" Lessons of rebuilding That same spirit emerged in the words of people connected with two American churches that are rebuilding after fires: Christine Behnke , parish education director of Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church UAC in Milwaukee, Quote: : : ""After watching a news report about Notre Dame Monday, I went and stood in Trinity's dark, damp, scarred sanctuary. ... All the ash has been removed, scaffolding erected and a temporary roof covers the nave. ... We really are rising from the ashes! "" The Rev. Richard Hong , pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Englewood, New Jersey, recalled that after the fire at his church, ""while strangers were sending me messages about how devastated they were upon hearing about it, our members were not devastated. ... We lost our building, but we still had our church -- because we still had each other, and God was with us. God still is with us."" Tiger Woods is back Wearing the famous green jacket, Tiger Woods celebrated his first Masters win since 2005, in a comeback that energized fans and the sport of golf. Sports historian Amy Bass described it as "" a return to grace after a fall documented everywhere , from the lurid tabloid headlines chronicling his marital infidelity and divorce to the medical journals outlining the odyssey of his multiple injuries and ongoing back pain."" Not surprised by Aunt Becky's rule-breaking Gerry Brooks , an elementary school principal in Lexington, Kentucky, shared a sobering take on the college admissions scandal, focusing on ""Aunt Becky,"" the character played by Lori Loughlin in ""Full House."" "" Do you know who isn't surprised by the situation? Every educator in America ,"" Brooks wrote. ""This thing occurs all the time, in every school."" ""When a parent signs a reading log saying a child read for 10 minutes that night but they really didn't, because they were out late for a sports event or just didn't have time, they are basically doing the same thing. They believe a rule or policy is not important or dumb or optional. Do you know who else thought the rules were dumb? Aunt Becky."" Roxanne Jones asked: What's the right punishment in the college admissions scandal? In her view, jail time shouldn't be off the table. ""No matter how many times we see justice seemingly tip in favor of the rich, or famous, Americans still want to believe we all have an equal shot . That money and privilege don't always win. That hard work and integrity still matter. The college cheating scandal puts those notions to the test."" What immigrants contribute Controversy continued to swirl around Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Democrat from Minnesota, but retired Real Adm. John Kirby , a CNN national security analyst, came to her defense. ""One could argue that Rep. Omar's use of 'some people' to describe the 9-11 hijackers was cavalier. Maybe it was,"" Kirby wrote. ""But her larger point was valid: those hijackers and the terrorist groups who survive them do not represent all Muslims , at home or abroad. And it's just plain wrong -- un-American, really -- to hold in disdain an entire community of our fellow citizens for the evil act of a few who perverted their faith. ... I've seen commentary online not only deriding Muslims as people, but also denying any contribution they made to our history."" Kirby recalled a 2006 visit to Fallujah, Iraq, where he met an immigrant from Pakistan, Dr. Saleem Khan, a Navy surgeon. Khan was on his fifth tour in Iraq at that point and would go on to complete another three combat deployments, earning the Bronze Star and the Legion of Merit. ""I'll never forget what he told me that day: 'I don't want anyone to ever say that, as an immigrant, I did not pay my dues.'"" Detaining the asylum-seekers With Barr, the attorney general, ruling out the release of some asylum-seekers who have shown a credible case for avoiding deportation, the Trump administration's immigration crackdown grew. For those, like author Barbara Fischkin , who are the descendants of refugees to the United States, the move seemed particularly cruel. A century ago, her mother, then 6 years old, escaped one of a series of pogroms in the Ukraine, in which more than 100,000 Jews died. She ""ran into the woods and hid in a haystack where she might have frozen to death if not for a Catholic farmer who risked his own life to take her to his home. It is likely that the local band of young nationalists would have killed him if they found out."" Eventually her mother's family made its way to the United States, where they have annually observed the spiritual injunction of Passover, which started Friday evening, to welcome the stranger. ""After my grandfather immigrated to the US, he insisted that every Seder end with his own, booming Yiddish-accented rendition of 'God Bless America.' I will sing this at our Seder and also hope that migrants and other immigrants in peril can sing it here and live comfortably in the open."" How to save the planet As Earth Day approaches on Monday, it's worth focusing on the crucial role of farming in determining the health of the planet. Bethany Cianciolo, who edits the Perspectives section of CNN Business, noted via email that two chief executives co-wrote an op-ed this week making the case for going back to basics. Rose Marcario , president and CEO of Patagonia, and David Bronner , CEO of Dr. Bronner's, argued that farmers should rotate crops, compost, plant cover crops and reduce tillage rather than rely on fertilizers and soil-mixing machines. ""Over time, as chemically degraded soil starts to come back to life, crop yields from regenerative organic agriculture can outperform conventional methods, meaning we can feed a growing global population without destroying the planet. "" Don't miss these: • Brandon Tensley : The real power of 'pulling a Beyoncé' • Thomas Maier : The evidence that the US government got into the assassination business • Jill Filipovic : 'Selfie' deaths: Don't blame victims • Samantha Vinograd : Trump's third date with Kim will likely be as unsuccessful as the last one • Steven Mnuchin : The Tax Cuts and Jobs act is working • Peggy Drexler : Georgia Engel, Mary Tyler Moore's sidekick, showed that spacy can be smart "
Political newcomer Volodymyr Zelensky projected to win Ukraine's presidential elections,edition.cnn.com,"Kara Fox, CNN",04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/europe/ukraine-election-results-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Political newcomer and television comedian Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday declared victory in Ukraine's presidential elections after exit polls showed he was on track for a landslide win against incumbent and chocolate magnate Petro Poroshenko.
""We did it together. Thanks to everyone! Now there will be no pathetic speeches, I just want to say -- thank you,"" Zelensky said amongst loud cheers from a crowd of supporters. Early projections put Zelensky at 73.2%, giving him a significant lead over Poroshenko, who has won 25.3%, according to an exit poll published by Ukrinform. A second exit poll conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation put Zelensky at 73% of the vote and Poroshenko at 25.5%. Shortly after the first exit poll, Poroshenko conceded defeat. In a series of tweets, Poroshenko said he had accepted the decision of the Ukrainian people and will leave office next month but added he would not leave politics. Read More ""The new President will have a strong opposition, and the country will only benefit from this,"" he said. ""Personally, my team and I are ready to support the new President in all his decisions that will be in line with national interests of Ukraine and that will bring us closer to the European Union and NATO."" In a barbed comment, Poroshenko tweeted he believed the Russian government would be happy about the election of a ""new inexperienced"" president of Ukraine who could be returned to Russia's orbit of influence. Poroshenko's support had dwindled under a platform that was focused on playing tough with neighboring Russia, which has been locked in a proxy war with Ukraine for the last five years. Zelensky's bid for the presidency was initially dismissed as a protest vote and a joke. The actor found fame in his role in the Ukrainian television series ""Servant of the People"" as a down-and-out schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes President of Ukraine after becoming famous for an anti-corruption rant that went viral on social media. But Zelensky's biggest role as presidential hopeful resonated well with an electorate tired of economic turmoil, militant rhetoric and escalating tensions with Russia. In November, after Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait -- a strategic waterway that links the Azov Sea with the Black Sea -- Poroshenko's government responded by imposing martial law and warning of impending Russian invasion. Poroshenko's turbulent term Poroshenko, a supporter of EU membership who came to power in the aftermath of the country's 2013 pro-European Maidan protests, has spent his presidency entangled in an undeclared war with Ukraine's neighbor. Ukranian troops in the eastern Donbas region have been battling Russian-backed separatists, who have received covert military support from Moscow in a bloody conflict that emerged following Russia's annexation of the Black sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. That conflict has claimed almost 13,000 lives, with at least 3,321 civilian deaths, according to United Nations estimates. Poroshenko has also played on Ukraine's bid for greater spiritual independence from Russia, welcoming a decision last October by Bartholomew I of Constantinople, the spiritual and symbolic leader of the Eastern Orthodox church, to recognize an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He capitalized on his ability to play tough with Russia throughout his campaign, casting Russian President Vladimir Putin as his rival. Ukraine Fast Facts ""When asked who is my ally, with whom I am ready to unite and coordinate my actions, I answer: my ally is the Ukrainian people,"" he said in a tweet in late March. ""Who is my opponent? I am not ashamed to say it openly -- this opponent is Putin."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the first-round vote in March, but did say that he hoped the ""party of war"" would not prevail. As Poroshenko ramped up his pro-military, national rhetoric, Zelensky turned the campaign into an entertaining spectacle. Ahead of the first vote on March 31, Zelensky challenged Poroshenko to a debate in the Kiev's Olympic Stadium, the nation's largest arena -- under the condition that both men would take an alcohol and drug test. It was broadcast live. And two days before the second-round vote, the two candidates squared off in a raucous debate inside Kiev's Olympic soccer stadium. In the first round of votes in March, Zelensky took 30.4% of the vote share, nearly double Poroshenko's share. Another top candidate, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko who had been seen as the likely frontrunner prior to Zelensky's candidacy, received 14.2% of the votes. Zelensky's policies are unclear Zelensky has no political experience, with a career mainly focused on his business empire -- mostly in entertainment -- which is estimated to be worth tens of millions. He used that entertainment platform to announce his bid for the presidency on New Year's Eve on Ukraine's 1+1 channel. The country's second-most popular TV station is owned by tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, who is connected to Zelensky. The relationship between the two men has been sharply criticized by Poroshenko, who said that 1+1's broadcast of ""Servant of the People"" was a campaign advertisement. ""My opponents have been pouring shameful lies on me over the past few weeks,"" Poroshenko said on Twitter. ""The main tool of spreading lies during the last months, unfortunately, was 1+1."" What a comedy TV series tells us about Ukraine and its high-stakes presidential race Zelensky has yet to outline any clear policies, prompting some critics to raise questions as to how he will steer the country out of its current challenges. Ukraine is one of Europe's poorest countries, with a growing number of people emigrating for better economic opportunities elsewhere. The image that Zelensky has projected has been a simple one that stresses a new era of politics that would fight against corruption and oligarchy. Zelensky has been able to effectively push back on criticism of his connection to Kolomoisky, saying that most TV stations in Ukraine are owned by oligarchs and that his relationship to the 1+1 tycoon is strictly professional. Ukraine watchers say that Zelensky's television series has functioned as a road map to the way that he might operate as a leader. His rise to power is a testament to Ukrainian population's deep-rooted disappointment in the governing class, which has been befuddled by corruption and economic woes. The team of advisors he's chosen -- a group of reform-minded technocrats -- appear to be a potential signal towards the type of Ukraine he'd like to lead, one poised to act as a bridge between civil society and politics. Chief among those advisors are former finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk; former economic development and trade minister Aivaras Abromavicius; and lawmaker and anti-corruption campaigner Sergii Leshchenko."
A tragic Holy Week culminates in an Easter Sunday horror,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Nic Robertson,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/europe/holy-week-nic-robertson-analysis-gbr-intl/index.html,"Derry/Londonderry, Northern Ireland (CNN) It has been a testing week for Christians everywhere.
Easter Sunday, in Christian teaching tradition began with a frightening shock. The resurrection. Jesus of Nazareth's body was discovered missing from the cave his disciples left it in following his crucifixion days earlier. It has since become one of the most sacred precious and holy days in the Christian calendar. A moment of spirituality and communion with others in the faith This past Monday saw some of those faithful fall to their knees in prayer and hymn as their beloved Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris burned as they watched. Read More They gasped as the 150-year-old spire of the iconic cathedral first leaned, then twisted and fell crashing through the roof to the altar below. As if prayers were answered, the walls held and holy icons including the crown of thorns that many believed Jesus wore at his crucifixion were saved. Paris prosecutors were investigating if an electrical short-circuit caused the fire in the 850-year-old building, where renovations had been taking place. Fire caused Notre Dame's spire to collapse as people watched on horrified. Across the Atlantic in New York, police intercepted a would-be arsonist as he stepped into St. Patrick's Cathedral's venerated halls. Loaded with cans of gasoline, lighter fluid and lighters, a second cathedral fire in a week was averted. Not so fortunate in Louisiana a few weeks earlier , arsonists set fire to three historically black churches. Fires burned at St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre on March 26, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2 and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 4. All this at a time when the Catholic Church struggles with an abuse scandal that stretches the breadth of the it reach , straddling generations of victims and clerics, throwing up an indigestible litany of wretched wrongdoing and suffering. Easter this year already had an ecclesiastical cloud hanging over it. The faithful tested in their belief that good will triumph over evil. The grasp on that faith stretched more on Thursday when one of Northern Ireland's most promising young journalists was shot dead by teenage dissident Irish republicans. Lyra McKee, 29, was rated in a top 30 under 30 media list by Forbes. Her writing had a formidable capacity to reach into her readers emotions. A talent most can only dream of. Easter played its role in her death. File picture of Lyra McKee, Freelance journalist, writer, editor pictured at TEDxStormont Women 2017. Ahead of Irish Republican Easter parades, commemorating the 1916 uprising against British rule, police raided a Catholic neighbourhood in Derry, Northern Ireland. Events turned violent late Thursday night as local young people threw petrol bombs at police. As McKee stood at the back of one of the police's armored vehicles, a teenage gunman, police described as ""a new breed of terrorist"" from the New IRA terror group, fired shots. McKee was hit in the head, her bright light, as her partner said the following day, was ""snuffed out"". With the holy day, Easter, came the worst. A shock, not spiritual like the resurrection, but a blow to Christians everywhere, an attack on the faithful while at worship. In any religion, little can be more heinous than this. The damage at St. Sebastian's Church in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The church teaches forgiveness, and so it will, but not before horror and anguish have spent their way through all those involved. In Sri Lanka, bombs causing carnage that as horrible as the previous week was, left those events paling in the shadow of a lesser cloud. Not buildings that can rebuilt, not holy relics to be retrieved and revered, but lives, like Lyra McKee's shattered and lost forever. Hundreds of bright lights darkened. Families devastated, faith tested. A most unholy week."

"Weeks after Nipsey Hussle's slaying, many questions remain unanswered - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Eliott C. McLaughlin,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/nipsey-hussle-investigation-questions/index.html,"(CNN) Three weeks after Nipsey Hussle was fatally gunned down in Los Angeles, the community continues to mourn and seek answers.
As so often is the case, answers are elusive as an investigation into the 33-year-old rapper's killing continues. Police have declined to divulge certain details they say could affect the outcome of the case against his alleged killer. Nipsey: More of a movement than a musician Still, those who grew up in the Crenshaw District that Nipsey loved and made a central theme in his music and business endeavors have questions -- chief among them, why the woman who drove the rapper's suspected killer remains free and why one of the men shot alongside Nipsey was arrested. Here are answers to some of those questions: Read More Why was a shooting victim arrested? Eight days after Nipsey and two other men were shot in front of the rapper's The Marathon clothing store in the Hyde Park neighborhood, police arrested one of the other shooting victims, Kerry Lathan.

Rappers want Fox host fired after 'disrespecting' Nipsey Hussle 01:31 The 56-year-old was released on parole seven months ago, after serving about 25 years for murder. He was arrested April 8 and appeared in court Thursday for a petition of parole revocation. The probable cause documentation said Lathan was accused of violating parole by associating with a gang member -- that gang member being Nipsey Hussle, who was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips, defense attorney Lauren Noriega told CNN. Community activists were angry Lathan was arrested on such an allegation given that Mayor Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore and LAPD Commissioner Steve Soboroff praised Nipsey's efforts to help mitigate gang violence. ""It was frustrating because it's another example in government of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing,"" Noriega said. ""I think they picked him up without really knowing the facts of what happened that day."" After reviewing the incident, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation determined it was merely a ""technical violation"" and requested the petition be dismissed, spokesman Jeffrey Callison said. Lathan was released Saturday, 12 days after his arrest. Lathan didn't know Nipsey well, but the rapper had helped him out with new clothes in the past, Noriega said. The day he and Nipsey were shot, Lathan visited The Marathon to buy a new shirt before visiting the family of a friend whose father had died, she said. When he learned the store was out of the style he wanted, his nephew pointed to Nipsey in the parking lot and suggested his uncle ask the rapper when a new shipment was arriving, Noriega said. The shooting came minutes later, killing the rapper and injuring Lathan and his nephew, she said. JUST WATCHED Barack Obama pens letter in tribute to Nipsey Hussle Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

She'd prefer he focus on his health, she said, but ""we're not totally out of the woods"" when it comes to the parole violation, she said. After arresting Lathan, police said his phone contained photos of him posing with men throwing the Rollin 60s gang sign. In the Thursday hearing, Noriega said, prosecutors asked the judge to dismiss the petition without prejudice, leaving open the possibility of revisiting the parole violation, she said. What's happening with the 'getaway driver?' Chief Moore told reporters after the shooting that the suspect, Eric Holder, shot Nipsey and the other two men before jumping into a waiting car driven by an unidentified woman. Citing ABC News, CNN affiliate KABC reported that the woman turned herself in, spoke with detectives and was allowed to leave. She claimed she didn't know what happened in the shooting, KABC reported. Nipsey Hussle greets kids during a community event in Los Angeles in October. She has not been arrested or publicly identified, the station reported.

""That woman is lying through her teeth. She's the getaway driver in the murder of Nipsey Hussle. The only reason why she turned herself in two days later is because her face and his face was plastered all over social media,"" he told KABC . Following news of Lathan's release from prison Saturday, Ali tweeted, ""Mission accomplished. Now we need the getaway driver arrested in Nipsey's murder."" What was the motive for killing the rapper? Police have implied that the shooting was not random but have yet to provide a motive for the attack. Holder and Nipsey knew each other, and the suspect had approached the rapper numerous times that Sunday afternoon, Moore told reporters. On their final encounter, the chief said, Holder returned with a handgun and ""purposely and repeatedly fired"" at Nipsey, Lathan and the other man.

Nipsey Hussle shooting shown on surveillance video 03:07 Despite Nipsey's gang affiliation and that Holder is believed to be a gang member as well, Moore said the dispute between the men does not appear gang-related. He declined to name the gang to which police believe Holder belongs. Surveillance video from the parking lot where Nipsey was shot showed the rapper casually talking with three other men in front of The Marathon store when a figure dressed in dark clothing approaches them and everyone scatters. Two of the victims don't get far. They fall to the ground. One of them, wearing a white hat and shirt, tries to get back up but promptly collapses, the video, which has no sound, shows. Why didn't Nipsey have security? It would appear Nipsey knew that there were folks who wished to do him harm. Hours before he was killed, he tweeted, ""Having strong enemies is a blessing."" It was not clear to what or to whom he was referring. A few days before he was killed, Nipsey was in Inglewood to shoot a video for a song he performed with DJ Khaled and John Legend, according to the entertainers' social media posts. According to TMZ, the production crew for the video was so concerned for Nipsey's safety that it had 10 armed police officers on hand for protection. Again, no one has explained why.

Given the circumstances, many people have questioned why Nipsey was at The Marathon store without security.

Sri Lanka blocks social media after attacks - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Donie O'Sullivan,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/tech/sri-lanka-blocks-social-media/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Sri Lanka placed a nationwide block on social media sites after more than 200 people died in multiple attacks on Sunday. The government, in taking the drastic step, cited ""false news reports"" it said were circulating online.
The shutdown, which the government said would be temporary, highlights the challenges the world's most powerful tech companies face in curbing the spread of misinformation and propaganda in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. It also raises questions of censorship and a government's ability to turn off the world's most popular websites. In announcing the ban on its official news portal, Sri Lanka named Facebook and Instagram among the sites it had blocked. Tech companies have a major 'live' problem YouTube, Snapchat and the messaging apps WhatsApp and Viber were also blocked, according to the internet monitoring group NetBlocks. Twitter did not appear to be blocked. Twitter is not as widely used in Sri Lanka as are Facebook and WhatsApp, according to Sanjana Hattotuwa , senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives in Colombo, Sri Lanka. A spokesperson for Facebook ( FB ) , which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, told CNN Business, ""We are aware of the government's statement regarding the temporary blocking of social media platforms. People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time.""

(CNN) It is one of the most lethal terrorist operations since September 11 -- with a death toll of more than 250 people . That number will almost certainly rise, given the hundreds that were also injured in the eight attacks at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Sunday.
What is puzzling about the attacks is that while Sri Lanka has seen plenty of terrorism in the past -- a result of the civil war between the separatist Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government -- that war ended a decade ago. And the Tamil Tigers had notably focused their attacks on ""transit hubs, Buddhist shrines, and office buildings ... and Sri Lankan officials,"" rather than churches, according to a Council on Foreign Relations report .

Moment blast strikes church caught on camera 00:41 Sri Lankan Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardene told reporters the ""terrorist incident"" was carried out by those following ""religious extremism."" While no group has claimed responsibility yet, the targets of the attacks -- churches packed with the faithful on Easter Sunday and three five-star hotels catering to foreigners -- have also figured in previous attacks. In January of this year, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack that killed at least 20 in a church in the Philippines. The attack also took place on a Sunday, when worshippers were gathered for mass. Then, last May, ISIS claimed responsibility for carrying out attacks at three churches in Indonesia, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens more. And, in 2017, on Palm Sunday, ISIS killed at least 49 people gathered for Mass at two churches in Egypt. But ISIS isn't the only Islamist group to operate this way. An offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq killed 58 people at a church on a Sunday in the Iraqi capital Baghdad in 2010. Four years earlier, al Qaeda in Iraq attacked the Grand Hyatt, the Radisson SAS and Days Inn hotels in Amman, Jordan, killing 57 . (For reference, ISIS has its roots in al Qaeda in Iraq.)

None of these groups has had much of a presence in Sri Lanka, though ISIS did try to recruit from the South Asian country.

CNN obtained a memo circulated by Sri Lankan police that warned on April 11 of a ""suicidal attack by the leader of 'Nations Thawahid Jaman.'"" It's not clear if this Islamist group carried out the attacks. Of course, there are more questions than answers right now -- particularly surrounding who is behind the Sunday attacks. All we know now for sure is that a group of extremists killed almost 300 people on Sunday in one of the most deadly attacks the world has seen since 9/11.

Lyra McKee: Two men released without charges after death of journalist in Northern Ireland,edition.cnn.com,Nic Robertson,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/world/lyra-mckee-murder-arrest/index.html,"(CNN) The two teenagers who had been arrested in connection with the killing of investigative journalist Lyra McKee were released without charges on Sunday, police in Northern Ireland said.
The two men, aged 18 and 19, had previously been arrested under the terrorism act, the Police Service of Northern Ireland tweeted. McKee, a 29-year-old prominent freelance journalist who wrote for publications including The Atlantic and Buzzfeed News, was killed in the Creggan area of Londonderry, also known as Derry, on Thursday night in what police described as a terrorist incident. The release of the two men comes the same day that Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O'Neill called on those who brought guns to the streets of Derry to disband and end their actions. ""The people who brought guns onto the street, and those who organize them do not represent any version of Irish republicanism,"" O'Neill said at the Easter Commemoration in Derry.

Bishop Donal McKeown, speaking at St. Columba's Church in Londonderry, also spoke about McKee's death. ""We pray for all those who are heartbroken at the tragic loss of Lyra. As the dead have slipped through our fingers, we pray trust in the risen Jesus they will be at peace and we will find peace at their passing."" Journalist was shot amid street violence On Sunday, detectives from the Police Service of Northern Island asked for anyone who may have information on the killing to come forward. ""We have received very positive support from the community but we need to convert this support into tangible evidence that will enable us to bring Lyra's killers to justice,"" Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said. ""We will continue to work positively and sensitively with the local community to achieve this."" My friend Lyra McKee lost her life seeking the truth Thursday night's violence came ahead of Easter weekend, during which some republicans mark the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, considered one of the most important events in the struggle for Irish independence from Britain. Trouble flared when police entered the Creggan area in Londonderry to carry out searches among dissident republicans who were storing firearms and explosives for a number of planned attacks over Easter weekend, police said in a statement. As the searches began, a crowd gathered and ""upwards of 50 petrol bombs were thrown at officers,"" the statement said. Two vehicles were hijacked and set on fire, it added. McKee was standing close to a police vehicle when she was wounded by the shots fired by a single gunman. She died soon after from her injuries, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told reporters on Friday. Police release surveillance footage Police said the shooting was carried out by dissident republicans, namely the New IRA. Murphy said Saturday that he believed the two teenagers who were arrested were members of the New IRA and were involved in the attack. ""Lyra was killed by shots that were fired indiscriminately,"" he said. ""The gunman showed no thought for who may have been killed or injured when he fired these shots. ""I know there will be some people who know what happened but are scared to come forward. I want to reassure you that we will work with you sensitively."" Murdered investigative journalist 'tirelessly pursued the truth' In addition, the PSNI released footage of the shooting in the hope that members of the public would provide information to assist the investigation into McKee's killing. McKee, who was born in Belfast, is the first journalist to be killed in the United Kingdom since 2001, according to nonprofit organization the Committee to Protect Journalists. During a vigil on Friday, her partner, Sara Canning, said McKee's ""amazing potential was snuffed out by this single barbaric act."" ""Victims and LGBTQIA community are left without a tireless advocate and activist and it has left me without the love of my life, the woman I was planning to grow old with,"" she added. ""This cannot stand. Lyra's death must not be in vain because her life was a shining light in everyone else's life and her legacy will live on and the life that she has left behind."" In a rare joint appearance Friday, Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster and Irish republican Sinn Fein party leader Mary Lou McDonald condemned the killing."

Volodymyr Zelensky played Ukraine's president on TV. Now it's a reality,edition.cnn.com,"Kara Fox, CNN",04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-president-profile-intl/index.html,"(CNN) He played a president on television. Now he's getting a shot at his biggest role yet.
Ukrainians threw their overwhelming support behind comedian, actor and businessman Volodymyr Zelensky in Sunday's presidential election, according to exit polls, choosing a political novice over five more years of Petro Poroshenko. The 41-year-old political newcomer won 73.2% of the vote while incumbent Poroshenko won 25.3%, according to an exit poll from Ukraine's state broadcaster Ukrinform. It was the second round of elections. Zelensky's rise to power is a testament to voters' deep-rooted disappointment in the governing class, disgust over rampant corruption, and a flagging economy. Prior to his bid for the presidency, Zelensky was best known for his role in the Ukrainian comedy series, ""Servant of the People,"" where he played a destitute schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine after becoming famous for an anti-corruption rant that went viral on social media. In real life, his entertainment empire is estimated to be worth tens of millions. Ukraine President takes drug test before debating comedian in 70,000-seater stadium Read More Art mirrored reality when Zelensky used that same platform to announce his bid for the presidency. On New Year's Eve, he addressed the nation on the 1+1 channel, which broadcasts his show and is the country's second most popular TV station. Initially, support for Zelensky was largely seen as a protest vote , and his popularity grew as faith in Poroshenko floundered. Poroshenko, who came to power in the aftermath of the 2013 pro-Western Maidan protests, ran on a militant patriotic platform, but it appears to have struck the wrong chord with a population exhausted from a 5-year proxy war with Russia. Inherited problems Since Russia's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian troops have been battling in the eastern Donbas region against Russian-backed separatists, who have received military support from Moscow. According to United Nations estimates, the conflict has claimed almost 13,000 lives, with at least 3,321 civilian deaths. In November, tensions with Moscow reached fever pitch after Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait, a strategic waterway. Poroshenko's government responded by imposing martial law and warning of impending Russian invasion. Though Zelensky will certainly inherit those problems, it's not clear how he will manage them. Zelensky casts his ballot in the first round of voting in April Zelensky ran on a fairly nebulous platform, offering little in the way of concrete policies. He also largely avoided having to express his views publicly, dodging big interviews, holding few press conferences and famously standing up Poroshenko at the first scheduled debate. Speaking on the 1+1 show, ""The Right to Power"" earlier this week, Zelensky said it was his campaign's strategy to not go on talk shows where ""people from the old government sit and quarrel, do only PR and no real deals."" ""I wasn't hiding from anyone,"" he said, adding an apology to journalists who might have been offended by his lack of attention to the press. Although Zelensky never provided any clear policy goals, what did emerge from his campaign platform was his attention to starting fresh and a vow to fight against corruption and oligarchy. Life imitating art And while his television series is a fictional comedy, the subjects explored in the show may offer clues to how he plans to lead -- or at least to what Ukrainians might expect of him. In the show, the intersection between crime and politics is a persistent theme, and Zelensky ran on a promise to get rid of systemic corruption. His character also primarily speaks Russian, along with many other cast members. Thirty percent of Ukraine speaks Russian, according to government statistics, and language is a controversial subject used by all sides to score political points. Zelensky at a shoot for ""Servant of the People"" in Kiev in March. In 2017, Ukrainian became the required language of study in state schools from the fifth grade, and a moratorium on Russian-language media in western Ukraine -- where Ukrainian is the majority language -- has drawn international criticism. Zelensky's choice of language could be viewed as an attempt to take a more liberal stance on the language question, a sign that he sees it as more of an individual matter, based on cultural lines. His critics, will argue however, that he is failing to stand up to Russia and its cultural influence in the country -- something Poroshenko built his entire campaign around. Andreas Umland, fellow at the Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation, told CNN that Zelensky's political inexperience might act to his advantage, noting that there was a ""general mood for change,"" and that Zelensky was able to seize a moment where voters were protesting not only against Poroshenko but against the political class. What a comedy TV series tells us about Ukraine and its high-stakes presidential race Umland said that inexperience could force Zelensky to forge stronger ties between civil society and politics. His choice of advisers -- a group of reform-minded technocrats -- might signal that. Chief among those advisers are former Finance Minister Oleksandr Danylyuk, former Economic Development and Trade Minister Aivaras Abromavicius, and lawmaker and anti-corruption campaigner Sergii Leshchenko. How smoothly Zelensky's projected image and political persona will meld, however, is unknown. Stay tuned."
Philadelphia Flyers remove a statue of Kate Smith over her racist songs,edition.cnn.com,Doug Criss,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/philadelphia-flyers-kate-smith-statue/index.html,"(CNN) A year after her 1986 death, the NHL's Philadelphia Flyers erected a statue to honor renowned singer Kate Smith, whose rendition of ""God Bless America"" was played during home games for decades, including the 2018-2019 season.
But on Sunday the Flyers announced they had removed the statue , saying the team had discovered some of her songs contained racist lyrics and sentiments that were ""incompatible"" with the organization's values. ""The NHL principle 'Hockey is for Everyone' is at the heart of everything the Flyers stand for,"" Flyers President Paul Holmgren said in a statement. ""As a result, we cannot stand idle while material from another era gets in the way of who we are today."" Smith, one of America's biggest singing stars of the early- to mid-20th century, had performed the song before Flyers games in the 1970s . In 1987, the Flyers unveiled a statue of her, which most recently stood across the parking lot from the Wells Fargo Center -- the team's arena -- on the walkway to Xfinity Live, the team said . However, the Flyers announced late last week that they would stop playing Smith's version of the song and cover up her statue. Read More In addition, the New York Yankees said Smith's iconic 1939 version of the song, which had been a fixture at home games since the September 11, 2001, attacks, was no longer being played at Yankee Stadium.

Sports teams dump Kate Smith's 'God Bless America' because of her racist songs The decisions come amid growing recognition that other songs performed by Smith, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1982 , are racist. ""While Kate Smith's performance of 'God Bless America' cannot be erased from its place in Flyers history, that rendition will no longer be featured in our game presentations,"" the team said. ""And to ensure the sentiments stirred this week are no longer echoed, earlier today we completed the removal of the Kate Smith statue from its former location outside of our arena."" The Flyers enjoyed a ""long and popular"" relationship with Smith's ""God Bless America"" rendition, but the team learned in recent days that her 1930s songs ""evoke painful and unacceptable themes,"" the statement said. One such song is her 1931 rendition of "" That's Why Darkies Were Born ,"" which has lyrics that read: ""Someone had to pick the cotton, Someone had to plant the corn, Someone had to slave and be able to sing, That's why darkies were born"" Another is her 1933 recording, "" Pickaninny Heaven ,"" which asks ""colored children"" living in an orphanage to dream about a magical place of ""great big watermelons."" In a statement, the Yankees said they had ""been made aware of a recording that had been previously unknown to us and decided to immediately and carefully review this new information. The Yankees take social, racial and cultural insensitivities very seriously. And while no final conclusions have been made, we are erring on the side of sensitivity."" Smith's version of ""God Bless America"" has been replaced at Yankee Stadium by other versions."

"Weeks after Nipsey Hussle's slaying, many questions remain unanswered - CNN",us.cnn.com,Eliott C. McLaughlin,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/nipsey-hussle-investigation-questions/index.html,"(CNN) Three weeks after Nipsey Hussle was fatally gunned down in Los Angeles, the community continues to mourn and seek answers.
As so often is the case, answers are elusive as an investigation into the 33-year-old rapper's killing continues. Police have declined to divulge certain details they say could affect the outcome of the case against his alleged killer. Nipsey: More of a movement than a musician Still, those who grew up in the Crenshaw District that Nipsey loved and made a central theme in his music and business endeavors have questions -- chief among them, why the woman who drove the rapper's suspected killer remains free and why one of the men shot alongside Nipsey was arrested. Here are answers to some of those questions: Read More Why was a shooting victim arrested? Eight days after Nipsey and two other men were shot in front of the rapper's The Marathon clothing store in the Hyde Park neighborhood, police arrested one of the other shooting victims, Kerry Lathan.

Rappers want Fox host fired after 'disrespecting' Nipsey Hussle 01:31 The 56-year-old was released on parole seven months ago, after serving about 25 years for murder. He was arrested April 8 and appeared in court Thursday for a petition of parole revocation. The probable cause documentation said Lathan was accused of violating parole by associating with a gang member -- that gang member being Nipsey Hussle, who was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips, defense attorney Lauren Noriega told CNN. Community activists were angry Lathan was arrested on such an allegation given that Mayor Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore and LAPD Commissioner Steve Soboroff praised Nipsey's efforts to help mitigate gang violence. ""It was frustrating because it's another example in government of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing,"" Noriega said. ""I think they picked him up without really knowing the facts of what happened that day."" After reviewing the incident, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation determined it was merely a ""technical violation"" and requested the petition be dismissed, spokesman Jeffrey Callison said. Lathan was released Saturday, 12 days after his arrest. Lathan didn't know Nipsey well, but the rapper had helped him out with new clothes in the past, Noriega said. The day he and Nipsey were shot, Lathan visited The Marathon to buy a new shirt before visiting the family of a friend whose father had died, she said. When he learned the store was out of the style he wanted, his nephew pointed to Nipsey in the parking lot and suggested his uncle ask the rapper when a new shipment was arriving, Noriega said. The shooting came minutes later, killing the rapper and injuring Lathan and his nephew, she said. JUST WATCHED Barack Obama pens letter in tribute to Nipsey Hussle Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

After arresting Lathan, police said his phone contained photos of him posing with men throwing the Rollin 60s gang sign. In the Thursday hearing, Noriega said, prosecutors asked the judge to dismiss the petition without prejudice, leaving open the possibility of revisiting the parole violation, she said. What's happening with the 'getaway driver?' Chief Moore told reporters after the shooting that the suspect, Eric Holder, shot Nipsey and the other two men before jumping into a waiting car driven by an unidentified woman. Citing ABC News, CNN affiliate KABC reported that the woman turned herself in, spoke with detectives and was allowed to leave.

Following news of Lathan's release from prison Saturday, Ali tweeted, ""Mission accomplished. Now we need the getaway driver arrested in Nipsey's murder."" What was the motive for killing the rapper? Police have implied that the shooting was not random but have yet to provide a motive for the attack. Holder and Nipsey knew each other, and the suspect had approached the rapper numerous times that Sunday afternoon, Moore told reporters. On their final encounter, the chief said, Holder returned with a handgun and ""purposely and repeatedly fired"" at Nipsey, Lathan and the other man.

Nipsey Hussle shooting shown on surveillance video 03:07 Despite Nipsey's gang affiliation and that Holder is believed to be a gang member as well, Moore said the dispute between the men does not appear gang-related. He declined to name the gang to which police believe Holder belongs. Surveillance video from the parking lot where Nipsey was shot showed the rapper casually talking with three other men in front of The Marathon store when a figure dressed in dark clothing approaches them and everyone scatters. Two of the victims don't get far. They fall to the ground. One of them, wearing a white hat and shirt, tries to get back up but promptly collapses, the video, which has no sound, shows. Why didn't Nipsey have security? It would appear Nipsey knew that there were folks who wished to do him harm. Hours before he was killed, he tweeted, ""Having strong enemies is a blessing."" It was not clear to what or to whom he was referring. A few days before he was killed, Nipsey was in Inglewood to shoot a video for a song he performed with DJ Khaled and John Legend, according to the entertainers' social media posts. According to TMZ, the production crew for the video was so concerned for Nipsey's safety that it had 10 armed police officers on hand for protection. Again, no one has explained why.

A tragic Holy Week culminates in an Easter Sunday horror,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Nic Robertson,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/europe/holy-week-nic-robertson-analysis-gbr-intl/index.html,"Derry/Londonderry, Northern Ireland (CNN) It has been a testing week for Christians everywhere.
Easter Sunday, in Christian teaching tradition began with a frightening shock. The resurrection. Jesus of Nazareth's body was discovered missing from the cave his disciples left it in following his crucifixion days earlier. It has since become one of the most sacred precious and holy days in the Christian calendar. A moment of spirituality and communion with others in the faith This past Monday saw some of those faithful fall to their knees in prayer and hymn as their beloved Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris burned as they watched. Read More They gasped as the 150-year-old spire of the iconic cathedral first leaned, then twisted and fell crashing through the roof to the altar below. As if prayers were answered, the walls held and holy icons including the crown of thorns that many believed Jesus wore at his crucifixion were saved. Paris prosecutors were investigating if an electrical short-circuit caused the fire in the 850-year-old building, where renovations had been taking place. Fire caused Notre Dame's spire to collapse as people watched on horrified. Across the Atlantic in New York, police intercepted a would-be arsonist as he stepped into St. Patrick's Cathedral's venerated halls. Loaded with cans of gasoline, lighter fluid and lighters, a second cathedral fire in a week was averted. Not so fortunate in Louisiana a few weeks earlier , arsonists set fire to three historically black churches. Fires burned at St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre on March 26, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2 and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 4. All this at a time when the Catholic Church struggles with an abuse scandal that stretches the breadth of the it reach , straddling generations of victims and clerics, throwing up an indigestible litany of wretched wrongdoing and suffering. Easter this year already had an ecclesiastical cloud hanging over it. The faithful tested in their belief that good will triumph over evil. The grasp on that faith stretched more on Thursday when one of Northern Ireland's most promising young journalists was shot dead by teenage dissident Irish republicans. Lyra McKee, 29, was rated in a top 30 under 30 media list by Forbes. Her writing had a formidable capacity to reach into her readers emotions. A talent most can only dream of. Easter played its role in her death. File picture of Lyra McKee, Freelance journalist, writer, editor pictured at TEDxStormont Women 2017. Ahead of Irish Republican Easter parades, commemorating the 1916 uprising against British rule, police raided a Catholic neighbourhood in Derry, Northern Ireland. Events turned violent late Thursday night as local young people threw petrol bombs at police. As McKee stood at the back of one of the police's armored vehicles, a teenage gunman, police described as ""a new breed of terrorist"" from the New IRA terror group, fired shots. McKee was hit in the head, her bright light, as her partner said the following day, was ""snuffed out"". With the holy day, Easter, came the worst. A shock, not spiritual like the resurrection, but a blow to Christians everywhere, an attack on the faithful while at worship. In any religion, little can be more heinous than this. The damage at St. Sebastian's Church in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The church teaches forgiveness, and so it will, but not before horror and anguish have spent their way through all those involved. In Sri Lanka, bombs causing carnage that as horrible as the previous week was, left those events paling in the shadow of a lesser cloud.

Political newcomer celebrates victory in Ukraine's presidential elections,us.cnn.com,"Kara Fox, CNN",04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/europe/ukraine-election-results-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Political newcomer and television comedian Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday declared victory in Ukraine's presidential elections after exit polls showed he was on track for a landslide win against incumbent and chocolate magnate Petro Poroshenko.
""We did it together. Thanks to everyone! Now there will be no pathetic speeches, I just want to say -- thank you,"" Zelensky said amongst loud cheers from a crowd of supporters. Early projections put Zelensky at 73.2%, giving him a significant lead over Poroshenko, who has won 25.3%, according to an exit poll published by Ukrinform. A second exit poll conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation put Zelensky at 73% of the vote and Poroshenko at 25.5%. Shortly after the first exit poll, Poroshenko conceded defeat. In a series of tweets, Poroshenko said he had accepted the decision of the Ukrainian people and will leave office next month but added he would not leave politics. Read More ""The new President will have a strong opposition, and the country will only benefit from this,"" he said. ""Personally, my team and I are ready to support the new President in all his decisions that will be in line with national interests of Ukraine and that will bring us closer to the European Union and NATO."" In a barbed comment, Poroshenko tweeted he believed the Russian government would be happy about the election of a ""new inexperienced"" president of Ukraine who could be returned to Russia's orbit of influence. Poroshenko's support had dwindled under a platform that was focused on playing tough with neighboring Russia, which has been locked in a proxy war with Ukraine for the last five years. Zelensky's bid for the presidency was initially dismissed as a protest vote and a joke. The actor found fame in his role in the Ukrainian television series ""Servant of the People"" as a down-and-out schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes President of Ukraine after becoming famous for an anti-corruption rant that went viral on social media. But Zelensky's biggest role as presidential hopeful resonated well with an electorate tired of economic turmoil, militant rhetoric and escalating tensions with Russia. In November, after Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait -- a strategic waterway that links the Azov Sea with the Black Sea -- Poroshenko's government responded by imposing martial law and warning of impending Russian invasion. Poroshenko's turbulent term Poroshenko, a supporter of EU membership who came to power in the aftermath of the country's 2013 pro-European Maidan protests, has spent his presidency entangled in an undeclared war with Ukraine's neighbor. Ukranian troops in the eastern Donbas region have been battling Russian-backed separatists, who have received covert military support from Moscow in a bloody conflict that emerged following Russia's annexation of the Black sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. That conflict has claimed almost 13,000 lives, with at least 3,321 civilian deaths, according to United Nations estimates. Poroshenko has also played on Ukraine's bid for greater spiritual independence from Russia, welcoming a decision last October by Bartholomew I of Constantinople, the spiritual and symbolic leader of the Eastern Orthodox church, to recognize an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He capitalized on his ability to play tough with Russia throughout his campaign, casting Russian President Vladimir Putin as his rival. Ukraine Fast Facts ""When asked who is my ally, with whom I am ready to unite and coordinate my actions, I answer: my ally is the Ukrainian people,"" he said in a tweet in late March. ""Who is my opponent? I am not ashamed to say it openly -- this opponent is Putin."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the first-round vote in March, but did say that he hoped the ""party of war"" would not prevail. As Poroshenko ramped up his pro-military, national rhetoric, Zelensky turned the campaign into an entertaining spectacle. Ahead of the first vote on March 31, Zelensky challenged Poroshenko to a debate in the Kiev's Olympic Stadium, the nation's largest arena -- under the condition that both men would take an alcohol and drug test. It was broadcast live. And two days before the second-round vote, the two candidates squared off in a raucous debate inside Kiev's Olympic soccer stadium. In the first round of votes in March, Zelensky took 30.4% of the vote share, nearly double Poroshenko's share. Another top candidate, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko who had been seen as the likely frontrunner prior to Zelensky's candidacy, received 14.2% of the votes. Zelensky's policies are unclear Zelensky has no political experience, with a career mainly focused on his business empire -- mostly in entertainment -- which is estimated to be worth tens of millions. He used that entertainment platform to announce his bid for the presidency on New Year's Eve on Ukraine's 1+1 channel. The country's second-most popular TV station is owned by tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, who is connected to Zelensky. The relationship between the two men has been sharply criticized by Poroshenko, who said that 1+1's broadcast of ""Servant of the People"" was a campaign advertisement. ""My opponents have been pouring shameful lies on me over the past few weeks,"" Poroshenko said on Twitter. ""The main tool of spreading lies during the last months, unfortunately, was 1+1."" What a comedy TV series tells us about Ukraine and its high-stakes presidential race Zelensky has yet to outline any clear policies, prompting some critics to raise questions as to how he will steer the country out of its current challenges. Ukraine is one of Europe's poorest countries, with a growing number of people emigrating for better economic opportunities elsewhere. The image that Zelensky has projected has been a simple one that stresses a new era of politics that would fight against corruption and oligarchy. Zelensky has been able to effectively push back on criticism of his connection to Kolomoisky, saying that most TV stations in Ukraine are owned by oligarchs and that his relationship to the 1+1 tycoon is strictly professional. Ukraine watchers say that Zelensky's television series has functioned as a road map to the way that he might operate as a leader. His rise to power is a testament to Ukrainian population's deep-rooted disappointment in the governing class, which has been befuddled by corruption and economic woes. The team of advisors he's chosen -- a group of reform-minded technocrats -- appear to be a potential signal towards the type of Ukraine he'd like to lead, one poised to act as a bridge between civil society and politics. Chief among those advisors are former finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk; former economic development and trade minister Aivaras Abromavicius; and lawmaker and anti-corruption campaigner Sergii Leshchenko."
Volodymyr Zelensky played Ukraine's president on TV. Now it's a reality,us.cnn.com,"Kara Fox, CNN",04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-president-profile-intl/index.html,"(CNN) He played a president on television. Now he's getting a shot at his biggest role yet.
Ukrainians threw their overwhelming support behind comedian, actor and businessman Volodymyr Zelensky in Sunday's presidential election, according to exit polls, choosing a political novice over five more years of Petro Poroshenko. The 41-year-old political newcomer won 73.2% of the vote while incumbent Poroshenko won 25.3%, according to an exit poll from Ukraine's state broadcaster Ukrinform. It was the second round of elections. Zelensky's rise to power is a testament to voters' deep-rooted disappointment in the governing class, disgust over rampant corruption, and a flagging economy. Prior to his bid for the presidency, Zelensky was best known for his role in the Ukrainian comedy series, ""Servant of the People,"" where he played a destitute schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine after becoming famous for an anti-corruption rant that went viral on social media. In real life, his entertainment empire is estimated to be worth tens of millions. Ukraine President takes drug test before debating comedian in 70,000-seater stadium Read More Art mirrored reality when Zelensky used that same platform to announce his bid for the presidency. On New Year's Eve, he addressed the nation on the 1+1 channel, which broadcasts his show and is the country's second most popular TV station. Initially, support for Zelensky was largely seen as a protest vote , and his popularity grew as faith in Poroshenko floundered. Poroshenko, who came to power in the aftermath of the 2013 pro-Western Maidan protests, ran on a militant patriotic platform, but it appears to have struck the wrong chord with a population exhausted from a 5-year proxy war with Russia. Inherited problems Since Russia's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian troops have been battling in the eastern Donbas region against Russian-backed separatists, who have received military support from Moscow. According to United Nations estimates, the conflict has claimed almost 13,000 lives, with at least 3,321 civilian deaths. In November, tensions with Moscow reached fever pitch after Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait, a strategic waterway. Poroshenko's government responded by imposing martial law and warning of impending Russian invasion. Though Zelensky will certainly inherit those problems, it's not clear how he will manage them. Zelensky casts his ballot in the first round of voting in April Zelensky ran on a fairly nebulous platform, offering little in the way of concrete policies. He also largely avoided having to express his views publicly, dodging big interviews, holding few press conferences and famously standing up Poroshenko at the first scheduled debate. Speaking on the 1+1 show, ""The Right to Power"" earlier this week, Zelensky said it was his campaign's strategy to not go on talk shows where ""people from the old government sit and quarrel, do only PR and no real deals."" ""I wasn't hiding from anyone,"" he said, adding an apology to journalists who might have been offended by his lack of attention to the press. Although Zelensky never provided any clear policy goals, what did emerge from his campaign platform was his attention to starting fresh and a vow to fight against corruption and oligarchy. Life imitating art And while his television series is a fictional comedy, the subjects explored in the show may offer clues to how he plans to lead -- or at least to what Ukrainians might expect of him. In the show, the intersection between crime and politics is a persistent theme, and Zelensky ran on a promise to get rid of systemic corruption. His character also primarily speaks Russian, along with many other cast members. Thirty percent of Ukraine speaks Russian, according to government statistics, and language is a controversial subject used by all sides to score political points. Zelensky at a shoot for ""Servant of the People"" in Kiev in March. In 2017, Ukrainian became the required language of study in state schools from the fifth grade, and a moratorium on Russian-language media in western Ukraine -- where Ukrainian is the majority language -- has drawn international criticism. Zelensky's choice of language could be viewed as an attempt to take a more liberal stance on the language question, a sign that he sees it as more of an individual matter, based on cultural lines. His critics, will argue however, that he is failing to stand up to Russia and its cultural influence in the country -- something Poroshenko built his entire campaign around. Andreas Umland, fellow at the Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation, told CNN that Zelensky's political inexperience might act to his advantage, noting that there was a ""general mood for change,"" and that Zelensky was able to seize a moment where voters were protesting not only against Poroshenko but against the political class. What a comedy TV series tells us about Ukraine and its high-stakes presidential race Umland said that inexperience could force Zelensky to forge stronger ties between civil society and politics. His choice of advisers -- a group of reform-minded technocrats -- might signal that. Chief among those advisers are former Finance Minister Oleksandr Danylyuk, former Economic Development and Trade Minister Aivaras Abromavicius, and lawmaker and anti-corruption campaigner Sergii Leshchenko. How smoothly Zelensky's projected image and political persona will meld, however, is unknown. Stay tuned."
Sri Lanka blocks social media after attacks,us.cnn.com,Donie O'Sullivan,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/tech/sri-lanka-blocks-social-media/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Sri Lanka placed a nationwide block on social media sites after more than 200 people died in multiple attacks on Sunday. The government, in taking the drastic step, cited ""false news reports"" it said were circulating online.
The shutdown, which the government said would be temporary, highlights the challenges the world's most powerful tech companies face in curbing the spread of misinformation and propaganda in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. It also raises questions of censorship and a government's ability to turn off the world's most popular websites. In announcing the ban on its official news portal, Sri Lanka named Facebook and Instagram among the sites it had blocked. Tech companies have a major 'live' problem YouTube, Snapchat and the messaging apps WhatsApp and Viber were also blocked, according to the internet monitoring group NetBlocks. Twitter did not appear to be blocked. Twitter is not as widely used in Sri Lanka as are Facebook and WhatsApp, according to Sanjana Hattotuwa , senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives in Colombo, Sri Lanka. A spokesperson for Facebook ( FB ) , which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, told CNN Business, ""We are aware of the government's statement regarding the temporary blocking of social media platforms. People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time."" Read More The spokesperson said Facebook had been working to support law enforcement in Sri Lanka and to identify content that violates the company's standards. ""A few years ago we'd view the blocking of social media sites after an attack as outrageous censorship; now we think of it as essential duty of care, to protect ourselves from threat,"" Ivan Sigal, the executive director of Global Voices, an international journalism and digital advocacy group, tweeted after the block was announced. ""Facebook your house is not in order,"" he said on Twitter.

— Ivan Sigal (@ivonotes) April 21, 2019 Earlier, the Red Cross in Sri Lanka had used Twitter to push back on misinformation. ""Rumours circulating on social media that the Red Cross building was attacked is false and wrong information,"" they tweeted, adding, ""Please refrain from spreading unauthentic and false information on Social Media.""

The company did not remove the video until after New Zealand police contacted the company. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg calls for more regulation of the internet Sri Lanka temporarily blocked Facebook and other platforms last year after the government said they were being used to incite violence.

It's not 1998 anymore. Democrats shouldn't be afraid of impeachment (Opinion),edition.cnn.com,Julian Zelizer,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/democrats-must-begin-impeachment-proceedings-zelizer/index.html,"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author, with Kevin Kruse, of the new book "" Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974 .""

(CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first 2020 Democratic candidate to call for impeachment proceedings to begin against President Donald Trump. In a tweet on Friday, she said, ""To ignore a President's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways.""
Many other Democrats, however, are fearful of going down this path. With the 2020 election around the corner, they worry that moving forward with impeachment will stimulate a political backlash against the party and hurt the Democrats' prospects of winning back control of the White House. Congress should initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump But Democrats can't afford to be so fearful about impeachment proceedings. And it might very well be that the Mueller report has forced their hand. While the first part of the report points to highly unethical and problematic behavior by the Trump campaign, the second section lays out some strong evidence of the President's continued efforts to interfere with the Mueller investigation. And this is in addition to his overt efforts to undermine Mueller, most notably from his bully pulpit of choice -- Twitter . Of course, Democrats have reason to be wary. It didn't go particularly well for Republicans in 1998, when the House, led by Newt Gingrich, impeached President Bill Clinton for lying under oath and obstructing justice into the investigation of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. In fact, Clinton's approval rating soared to 73% following the GOP-led impeachment. And the House Republican majority shrunk that year . Read More But the substance of the current impeachment debate is quite different. In the case of Clinton, a large portion of America saw the investigation as revolving around the private life of the President. But, in the case of Trump, this was an investigation into contacts between Trump campaign officials and individuals connected to a Russian government who were attempting to interfere in the 2016 US election -- as well as the President's ongoing efforts to stop the investigation. There is simply no comparison in the weight of the underlying charges. A political upside to impeachment for Trump? Some Trump advisers think so Public opinion has reflected that a majority or close to a majority of the public has continued to approve of Mueller, despite the constant attacks from the President. Meanwhile, Trump has yet to win a majority of American voter support in his first two years in office. It would seem, then, that the public agrees that the substance of the charges is serious, and the content of the Mueller report only intensifies the severity of what the President has done while in office. What Democrats do regarding impeachment proceedings will also say a great deal about the party's views of presidential power. The issue is not, and has never been, what is the best way to remove Trump from the White House. The question has been whether Democrats take the abuse of presidential power seriously and whether they insist that the commander in chief needs to live under some restraints. If Congress allows the actions that Mueller documented in the obstruction portion of the report to stand, they will help to establish a dangerous precedent for future inhabitants of the Oval Office. In contrast, launching impeachment proceedings would be a strong act that formally puts the party on record as not accepting these actions as legitimate and believing that they are severe enough to warrant consideration of impeachment. Importantly, impeachment proceedings are not the same as impeaching a president. The House would have to pass a resolution referring the case to the House Judiciary Committee or a select committee. The committee would conduct its own hearing, with a staff investigation of the evidence, to decide whether the grounds exist for voting on articles of impeachment. A look back at Clinton's impeachment reveals the GOP's searing hypocrisy If those grounds exist, the committee must pass each article by a majority vote -- at which point they would be sent to the floor for a vote. If the House votes in favor of any article by majority vote, only then does the case reach the Senate, where the bar is much higher, requiring two-thirds support to convict. Democrats who fear a backlash to moving forward with the impeachment process might want to consider the political consequence of being a party that decides to let this abuse of power stand. At the most basic level, doing nothing will allow Trump to spin his narrative that the entire issue was a partisan hit job. And political parties can be rewarded for doing the right thing. The entire Watergate saga made this clear. After a brutal multi-year investigation into President Richard Nixon that shocked the nation and resulted in his resignation, Democrats retained control of the House and Senate in the 1976 election -- building on their sizable majorities in the 1974 midterms -- and won the presidency. President Jimmy Carter capitalized on public anger about presidential wrongdoing and succeeded as the candidate who best responded to the distrust that existed about our leaders. It is also worth noting that even with the controversial and unpopular impeachment proceedings in 1998, Republicans actually didn't lose all of their power. The GOP retained control of Congress (temporarily losing a split Senate when Jim Jeffords caucused with Democrats in 2001, though they regained control in 2002). And George W. Bush won the presidency and served for two terms. While most Democrats don't want to make Clinton's impeachment the baseline as they consider what to do next, they should understand that Republicans did not totally fall apart after moving forward with proceedings on a much more questionable charge than the President is currently looking at today.

For Democrats who insist on gaming out what this will all look like, they should also consider the possibility that by refusing to hold the President accountable, they could end up improving his chances for re-election and giving legitimacy to his use of power. By doing nothing, one can imagine the Democrats helping Republicans elevate the ""witch hunt"" narrative and diminishing the serious political problems this administration already faces for its behavior. Focusing on the economy, Trump could put together the coalition that brought him to office in 2016. Once that second term begins, the behavior documented in the Mueller report and elsewhere would have an electoral stamp of approval. When the Mueller investigation started, the report shows, Trump was convinced that his presidency was ""f--ked."" But he underestimated the partisan loyalty that he could count on from the GOP. And he might also have underestimated just how politically trepidatious the opposition party had become."

(CNN) It is one of the most lethal terrorist operations since September 11 -- with a death toll of more than 250 people . That number will almost certainly rise, given the hundreds that were also injured in the eight attacks at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Sunday.
What is puzzling about the attacks is that while Sri Lanka has seen plenty of terrorism in the past -- a result of the civil war between the separatist Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government -- that war ended a decade ago. And the Tamil Tigers had notably focused their attacks on ""transit hubs, Buddhist shrines, and office buildings ... and Sri Lankan officials,"" rather than churches, according to a Council on Foreign Relations report . JUST WATCHED Moment blast strikes church caught on camera
Moment blast strikes church caught on camera 00:41 Sri Lankan Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardene told reporters the ""terrorist incident"" was carried out by those following ""religious extremism."" While no group has claimed responsibility yet, the targets of the attacks -- churches packed with the faithful on Easter Sunday and three five-star hotels catering to foreigners -- have also figured in previous attacks. In January of this year, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack that killed at least 20 in a church in the Philippines. The attack also took place on a Sunday, when worshippers were gathered for mass. Then, last May, ISIS claimed responsibility for carrying out attacks at three churches in Indonesia, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens more. And, in 2017, on Palm Sunday, ISIS killed at least 49 people gathered for Mass at two churches in Egypt. But ISIS isn't the only Islamist group to operate this way. An offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq killed 58 people at a church on a Sunday in the Iraqi capital Baghdad in 2010. Four years earlier, al Qaeda in Iraq attacked the Grand Hyatt, the Radisson SAS and Days Inn hotels in Amman, Jordan, killing 57 . (For reference, ISIS has its roots in al Qaeda in Iraq.) Read More Then there's Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which carried out attacks in 2008 on two luxury hotels in Mumbai -- the Taj and the Oberoi -- that were part of a larger operation in which a total of 164 people were killed.

And Indonesia-based Jemaah Islamiyah carried out multiple attacks on churches in 2000, killing 17. They also attacked the JW Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton hotels in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, in 2009, killing nine. None of these groups has had much of a presence in Sri Lanka, though ISIS did try to recruit from the South Asian country. And, in 2016, a Sri Lankan official said that 32 Sri Lankans had joined the group. CNN obtained a memo circulated by Sri Lankan police that warned on April 11 of a ""suicidal attack by the leader of 'Nations Thawahid Jaman.'"" It's not clear if this Islamist group carried out the attacks. Of course, there are more questions than answers right now -- particularly surrounding who is behind the Sunday attacks. All we know now for sure is that a group of extremists killed almost 300 people on Sunday in one of the most deadly attacks the world has seen since 9/11. Update: This story has been updated to reflect the death toll has been revised by the Sri Lankan Health Ministry."

When the Mueller investigation started, the report shows, Trump was convinced that his presidency was ""f--ked."" But he underestimated the partisan loyalty that he could count on from the GOP. And he might also have underestimated just how politically trepidatious the opposition party had become."
New Hampshire senator to call on 2020 Democrats to support repeal of voter residency law - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/2020-democrats-pledge-new-hampshire-voter-law/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, plans to send 2020 Democratic presidential candidates a letter Monday, urging them to sign a petition condemning a state law that would require college students to be a permanent resident of the state to vote.
""I am asking every candidate for President to stand up for these students, condemning these tactics and protecting the integrity of New Hampshire's voting process by signing a petition publicly denouncing this voter suppression law,"" Shaheen, the state's senior senator, writes in a letter she intends to send to all 18 declared candidates Monday morning. Currently, New Hampshire does not require registered voters to prove residency -- only to prove ""domicile."" But the new state law, House Bill 1264, which goes into effect in July, puts the same legal requirements for residents onto ""domicile"" persons. Those from out-of-state living in New Hampshire, like college students, will have to pay fees to obtain a New Hampshire driver's license and register their vehicles within 60 days of established residency, or after casting a ballot. The Granite State also allows same-day voter registration . CNN to host back-to-back town halls with five Democratic presidential candidates on April 22 In her letter, which CNN obtained ahead of its publication, Shaheen argues that the law effectively creates a ""poll tax"" for college students. Read More ""They are being disenfranchised by photo ID requirements, arbitrary challenges to residency, and unfounded allegations of fraud,"" Shaheen writes. President Donald Trump has claimed, without evidence, that thousands of people were bused from Massachusetts to vote illegally in New Hampshire, which he narrowly lost in the 2016 state primary. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner refuted the President's claim, telling the Boston Globe , ""We have never gotten any proof about buses showing up at polling places."" CNN is hosting back-to-back town halls Monday night with five 2020 Democratic candidates in New Hampshire. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will appear in the events beginning at 7 p.m. ET. The presidential hopefuls will field questions directly from students and young New Hampshire Democrats on issues of importance to young voters. Presidential candidate and former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke weighed in on Sunday. ""Don't need to wait until tomorrow on this,"" he tweeted. ""The law is wrong. It must be overturned. And we must enact a new Voting Rights Act so every person is able to cast their vote, have their voice heard, fully participate in our democracy."" Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York also spoke out against the law on Sunday. ""Our democracy is strongest when voters have the freedom to head to the ballot box to make their voice heard,"" she tweeted. ""The efforts of @GovChrisSununu to restrict this right for tens of thousands of students is unconscionable. I strongly support efforts to amend and repeal this bill."" Shaheen's push for 2020 Democrats to reject the bill comes as the candidates barnstorm the state ahead of its early presidential primary -- a key to building momentum for their campaigns. ""With the nation's eyes turned toward our first-in-the-nation primary, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to anyone seeking to subvert voting rights,"" Shaheen writes in her letter. ""I hope that you will join me in standing up for all Americans' right to vote."" The chair of the state's Democratic Party called for every presidential hopeful to sign the pledge. ""Every candidate for President campaigning in New Hampshire should sign Senator Shaheen's pledge and commit to protect the right to vote for everyone in the Granite State, especially the young people now threatened by a new voter suppression law that must be condemned and overturned,"" said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley in a statement provided to CNN. When HB 1264 was passed last year in the state legislature, the state Supreme Court found in a 3-2 ruling that the bill was constitutional and places ""voters and residents on equal footing as New Hampshire citizens,"" according to the Concord Monitor . After initially questioning the bill's constitutionality, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed the measure into law last July following the court's decision. ""House Bill 1264 restores equality and fairness to our elections,"" Sununu said in a statement, adding, ""Finally, every person who votes in New Hampshire will be treated the same. This is the essence of an equal right to vote."" But New Hampshire's Democrats, after taking control of the state House and Senate in the 2018 midterms, have sought to undo HB 1264. The law also faces a legal challenge. The American Civil Liberties Union, on the behalf of two Dartmouth college students, sued the state's attorney general and secretary of state in February, arguing the law is unconstitutional. ""Make no mistake: this is meant to deter young people from participating in our elections,"" Maggie Flaherty, a sophomore at Dartmouth from California and plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a post on the ACLU website. ""For me, the importance of voting in New Hampshire comes down to two factors: the fact that I now spend more time here than anywhere else, and that state and local policies can affect anything from my access to health care to the quality of the air I breathe."""

"The 5 biggest 2020 stories to watch this week, ranked - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/2020-campaign-schedule-week-ahead/index.html,"(CNN) With 288 days until the Iowa caucuses and a record number of Democratic candidates, the 2020 election is already in full swing. Every Sunday, I'll tell you the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the #1 story is the most important of the coming week. Subscribe to The Point newsletter to get this delivered directly to your inbox!
5. 20 for 2020: By the time we hit the end of the week we should have 20 announced Democratic presidential candidates in the race. While Joe Biden's entrance will draw the most attention -- scroll down for much more on the former VP's candidacy -- Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton is also expected to officially join the race this week. The 2020 Democratic field is already the largest in modern political history -- passing the 17 people who ran for the Republican nod in 2016. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
The challenges of a big field are myriad: It's hard to know where to put your resources -- or who is aiming at you. (I've compared it to a horse running in the always-crowded Kentucky Derby.) Opportunity exists, too -- particularly for lesser-known candidates. Get to double-digit support in Iowa or New Hampshire and, suddenly, you could find yourself in third place! Read More 4. Hogan gets serious: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan will travel to New Hampshire this week to participate in a Politics & Eggs event at Saint Anselm College -- the most clear sign yet that he is taking a hard look at a primary challenge to President Donald Trump. Every word Hogan utters within the confines of the Granite State will be closely monitored for clues as to whether he's moving toward the race or away from it. Hogan has been relatively open in his criticism of Trump's brand of Republicanism, but has also said he wouldn't run simply to be crushed underneath the incumbent's machine. Quiz: Think this primary is wild? See what you remember about the Republicans in 2016 At the moment, that seems the most likely end for a GOP primary challenge to Trump, given how popular he remains among base Republicans . Unlike Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor already challenging Trump, Hogan has a future within the party and may not want to risk it with a long-shot challenge to the incumbent. 3. You get a town hall! And you get a town hall!: We haven't reached the time when all -- or many -- of the top Democratic candidates will share a debate stage. (The first Democratic debate will be June 26 and 27 in Miami.) But on Monday, you'll get the next-best thing: Five (yes, five!) back-to-back-to-, well, you get the idea, 2020 town halls sponsored by CNN and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics . Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar kicks things off at 7 p.m. ET, followed every hour by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Comparisons will be inevitable -- whether the candidates invite them or not. 2. The Mueller question: The Mueller report is out ! The challenge before the 2020, um, challengers now is what to do with it. Elizabeth Warren came out in the immediate aftermath of the report's unveiling calling on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings. ""Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: 'Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice,"" said Warren. ""The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment."" Staking out that ground puts major pressure on Warren's Democratic opponents -- especially those who are seeking to convince liberals to choose them. None have followed suit -- which, as The New York Times notes here , may be a function of the fact that they don't talk to future primary voters who are demanding it. 1. It's Biden Time (finally): Sometime this week, the former vice president will reportedly enter the presidential race. Took him long enough! Biden held off announcing -- even as the field took shape -- in hopes of differentiating himself from the field as its clear frontrunner. That didn't work -- as Biden was forced to answer allegations about improper touching from several women including former Nevada state legislator Lucy Flores. Biden remains atop polling -- in key states and nationally -- and is likely to roll out a series of major endorsements as he tries to drive the inevitability narrative. But that's a bit of a tough sell at the moment given Biden's struggles of late. Is this week Biden's best one of the race to come?"
Maria Butina's defense attorneys fight against prosecutors' request for 18 months of jail time - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/maria-butina-attorneys-fight-jail-time/index.html,"(CNN) Maria Butina's defense team is fighting back against the prosecutors' sentencing memo in her case , which came in Friday night before her sentencing this week and unexpectedly asked for more jail time for her.
Prosecutors on Friday filed a pre-sentencing memo asking 18 months jail time for Butina, in a case where they've alleged scandalous actions and had to walk back some of them, yet where they still allege the Russian woman sought to hurt the US in her work as a foreign agent. ""Activities at issue in this case are part of Russia's broader scheme to acquire information and establish relationships and communication channels that can be exploited to the Russian Federation's benefit,"" prosecutors wrote in their pre-sentencing memo Friday. They say she was not a traditional spy or ""trained intelligence officer,"" but sought to help Russia at the expense of US national security. In this strongly worded filing, her defense attorneys, who previously had asked the sentence to be the time she has already served, reiterated that she is not a spy or Russian intelligence agent and has helped both the Senate Intelligence Committee as it investigated her contact and former Russian central banker Alexander Torshin, and prosecutors extensively, while asking the judge to throw out some of the prosecutors' discussion of her activities for Russia. Read More ""Maria is not a trained intelligence officer nor a spy in any sense,"" her defense attorneys wrote. ""The government knows that. Its prosecutors and federal agents behind closed doors have all but expressed that. There is no evidence to support that, and they have not charged her with any espionage-linked crime that addresses that."" ""All Maria has done is accepted responsibility for conspiring to act as an 'agent'—not a secret agent, not an intelligence agent—for Torshin, who was a friend but former foreign official of the Russian Central Bank,"" her attorneys continued. Her sentencing is set for Friday."

George Zimmerman removed from Tinder and Bumble - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/george-zimmerman-removed-tinder-trnd/index.html,"Tinder and Bumble remove George Zimmerman from their platforms By Harmeet Kaur, CNN Updated 6:14 PM EDT, Fri April 19, 2019
(CNN) George Zimmerman appears to be looking for a good time. Dating apps don't want any part of it.
Tinder recently removed Zimmerman, who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012, from its platform. According to screen grabs of the profile obtained by Creative Loafing Tampa Bay , Zimmerman went by the alias ""Carter"" and claimed to be looking for ""carefree, fun!"" George Zimmerman.
According to the bio, ""Carter"" was a self-employed consultant who attended Liberty University who also happened to love the outdoors, fishing, camping and hiking. One of the screen grabs shows him shirtless and wearing sunglasses. Another shows him with a dog, and yet another shows him in a cap and gown.
""We take the safety of our users very seriously and acted appropriately once the profile was discovered,"" a spokesperson for Tinder said in a statement.
Tinder wouldn't elaborate on why it removed Zimmerman's profile but said it reserved the right to remove any profile from its platform under the company's terms of use. Tinder lists impersonation as a violation of its policies.
This isn't the first time Zimmerman has ventured into online dating -- Bumble banned him from the platform in December.
""George Zimmerman was blocked and banned in December 2018 when we first discovered his profile and we have blocked and banned him again after we were informed by our users that he had created a new unverified profile,"" a statement from the company read. ""We have thousands of moderators working tirelessly with our users to make Bumble the safest and most empowering social networking platform and this is another example of those efforts.""
In July 2013, a jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin. Martin's death and the subsequent verdict caused national outcry.
Since then, Zimmerman hasn't kept a low profile.
He was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault and domestic violence in 2015, though prosecutors decided not to file charges after the alleged victim backed off her claims.
A year later, Zimmerman again sparked outrage when he attempted to auction off the gun that he purportedly used to kill Martin.
In 2018, he was accused of stalking a private investigator who had been hired by a production company that was working on a documentary about Martin's life. "
Rudy Giuliani is 100% wrong (Opinion),edition.cnn.com,Dean Obeidallah,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/rudy-giuliani-russia-contribution-obeidallah/index.html,"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) There was a time Rudy Giuliani was viewed as a crime-fighting US attorney and later as the valiant mayor of New York in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. But that Rudy is long gone. And all that remains is a man who will be best known for his work as a pathetic shill for Donald Trump.
We saw another example of this on Sunday when Giuliani, appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union"" in his capacity as Trump's personal lawyer, gave a master class in deceit as he discussed Robert Mueller's report. First, Giuliani tried to make Americans think there's nothing wrong with a campaign for president of the United States accepting help from Russians. This came up in the discussion of the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting attended by Donald Trump Jr., then Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner in the hopes of obtaining ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton from Russian nationals. Mueller report is quite the page-turner In fact, the email to Trump Jr. that prompted that meeting promised not just helpful info from foreign nationals but from the Russian government itself, as it offered the Trump campaign, ""some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father"" that was all ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."" Giuliani defended the Trump campaign accepting help from Russians by stating , ""Any candidate in the whole world in America would take information,"" causing Tapper to ask, ""From a foreign source? From a hostile foreign source?"" Giuliani shot back, ""Who said it's even illegal?"" Read More A few moments later when pressed again by Tapper on a presidential candidate getting help from Russians in the 2016 campaign, Giuliani responded adamantly, ""No, no, there's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians! It depends on where it came from."" Congress should initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump Giuliani then suggested the ""dirt"" the Russians offered to the Trump campaign would not be considered a ""campaign contribution"" as defined by federal law. In support, he argued that the Mueller report ""says we can't conclude that [it's a contribution] because the law is pretty much against that."" Giuliani is incredibly wrong. First, it's election law 101 that a federal campaign cannot accept ""a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value"" from a foreign national. In fact, the Mueller report explains the rationale for this law, noting that ""the United States has a compelling interest in limiting the participation of foreign citizens in activities of democratic self-government, and in thereby preventing foreign influence over the U.S. political process."" JUST WATCHED Bharara: Giuliani defending Trump 'at all costs' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Bharara: Giuliani defending Trump 'at all costs' 03:34 And despite what Giuliani wants you to believe, Mueller did not conclude that the information offered by the Russians at the Trump Tower meeting wasn't a ""campaign contribution."" Rather, the report informed us that Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort were in fact provided ""dirt"" from the Russian nationals at the meeting in the way of info about the ""Ziff brothers"" (Americans with business in Russia) who ""donated their profits to the DNC or the Clinton campaign"" and had allegedly been involved in money laundering. Mueller wrote in reaction, ""There are reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a thing of value within the meaning"" of the federal law, meaning it could be considered a campaign contribution. However, Mueller did not charge Trump Jr. and the others in large part because there was insufficient evidence that they acted ""willfully"" to violate federal laws. But apart from the legality, Giuliani's claim that there's ""nothing wrong with taking information from Russians"" is stunning, especially given that it was described in writing to Trump Jr. as ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."" The response of the Trump campaign to such an offer should have been a resounding ""no"" followed by a call to the FBI. Instead, Trump Jr. responded by email less than 20 minutes later, ""If it's what you say I love it."" It's not 1998 anymore. Democrats shouldn't be afraid of impeachment GOP Sen. Mitt Romney may have put it best in his statement Friday in response to the Trump campaign's apparent welcoming of help from Russia -- both directly at the Trump Tower meeting and by the Trump campaign's documented use of the WikiLeaks emails that US intelligence agencies determined in October 2016 had been supplied to WikiLeaks by Russian government hackers. Romney wrote, that he was ""appalled"" that ""fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia — including information that had been illegally obtained."" He then added perhaps the most important comment, ""none of them acted to inform American law enforcement."" Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

But to Giuliani none of this wrong. And Trump apparently agrees since he has defended the Trump Tower meeting as the type of thing ""done all the time in politics"" and he cited WikiLeaks over 100 times in the closing weeks of the campaign. While no one in the Trump campaign was charged with crimes for these actions, clearly the American people will have to decide if they agree with Giuliani that ""there's nothing wrong"" with Trump or any presidential campaign accepting assistance from Russians or other foreign nationals. The hope is that Americans will overwhelmingly agree that the election for President of our nation should be free from foreign interference and instead be decided solely by Americans."
We're losing the war on climate change - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by John D. Sutter,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/world/sutter-earth-day-climate-scn/index.html,"(CNN) For years now, people like environmentalist and journalist Bill McKibben have been screaming from the treetops that we need a World War II-scale mobilization to fight the scourge of climate change.
They're right, of course. And on Earth Day -- that 24-hour sliver of the calendar when we talk about the fact that humans exist on, and because of, a living planet -- it's clear not only that we are losing this war but that we still are failing to recognize it's taking place at all. I mean, yes, I've met Greta Thunberg , the Swedish teen who is "" schooling world leaders "" on climate policy and who started a global school walkout movement. I've read the Green New Deal and seen the videos of young people demanding that US reps adopt it. Just this month, protesters in London shut down parts of the city in their calls for a reckoning. It's true that clean energy sources keep getting cheaper. Electric cars are more popular than ever. But the scale of the outrage in no way matches the magnitude of this disaster, which, like WWII, threatens to cripple or even obliterate human life on the planet as we know it. One suspected driver of the migrant 'caravan': climate change We've known the truth about climate change -- that people are burning fossil fuels and warming the atmosphere, with potentially catastrophic consequences -- for decades now. James Hansen testified about the dangers of global warming when he was an NASA scientist in 1988 . The New York Times headline: ""Global Warming Has Begun, Expert Tells Senate."" Read More Since then, the eco-woke among us have created more than enough deadlines to try to force change. In 1990, as George Marshall wrote in his book ""Don't Even Think About It,"" the magazine Ecologist published a book called "" 5,000 Days to Save the Planet ."" About 5,000 days later, the Institute for Public Policy Research declared that there were ""Ten Years to Save the Planet."" In 2008, he wrote, the New Economics Foundation said it was ""100 Months to Save the World."" As a journalist who's been covering climate for years, I've been part of that deadline trend. In the leadup to the Paris climate talks in 2015, I wrote that there were "" 100 days to save the world ."" The deadlines aren't the problem. It's our failure to heed them. The situation gets only more dire with years of inaction. Last year, the world's climate science experts -- the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- released a report issuing some deadlines based on the harsh realities of science and math. They said global carbon pollution must be cut in half by 2030 and reduced to net zero by 2050 to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, which include drowned coastal cities, worsening storms and the virtual end of coral reefs. How to talk about hurricanes now There is a global push to try to meet those goals. That takes the form of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which urges countries to cut emissions but fails to issue sanctions. The United States, which has done more to cause global warming historically than any other nation, has promised under the Trump administration to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. How far along are we on those pollution-reduction goals? We haven't really started. Global emissions from fossil fuels rose in 2018 -- to an estimated 37 gigatons . Remember, carbon pollution needs to be cut in half in just 11 years. And to net zero by mid-century. That requires a near-total overhaul of the global economy -- a rapid transition to cleaner fuels like wind, solar and, probably, nuclear. It seems increasingly likely that some sci-fi technologies, like aerosols that would reflect heat back to into space, may be needed. Project Drawdown and others have identified and ranked the solutions that work. But to date, there have not been enough carbon taxes or other incentives to scale those ideas globally. Part of the issue is a failure to recognize the magnitude of the problem -- or, as others have written, a failure to care about the massive debts we are pushing onto future generations. Researchers like Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, have argued that people are finally waking up to the climate crisis, particularly in the face of the Trump administration, which has denied the science and enlivened activists, and in light of the apocalyptic-seeming severe weather that has hit parts of the globe. A poll from that Yale group showed in 2018 that 59% of Americans were ""alarmed"" or ""concerned"" about global warming, which is up compared with the previous five years. Those concerns don't necessarily translate into political action, though. A 2018 report from Gallup found that climate change ranked as only the 11th most important issue for American voters -- behind health care, the economy, immigration, the treatment of women in US society, gun policy, taxes, foreign affairs, income and wealth distribution, Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court and US trade and tariff policies. Think about that in terms of the World War II analogy, Imagine the American public ranking WWII as No. 11 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Perhaps you think we haven't seen the global warming version of Pearl Harbor yet. But we have seen it. Remember the European heat wave of 2003? An estimated 70,000 people died, according to a study published in the journal Comptes Rendus Biologies. 'The Maria Generation': Young people are dying and suffering on an island with a highly uncertain future After that disaster, scientists for the first time used ""climate attribution"" techniques to show that human-induced warming very likely doubled the risk of that event . It's now possible to see human fingerprints on these catastrophes. Hurricane Harvey in Texas ; the 2016 floods in Baton Rouge ; Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico , which killed an estimated 2,975 people, according to an analysis by George Washington University. Each was linked to -- or was shown to have been made worse by -- global warming. Not every weather-related disaster is ""caused"" by climate change, of course. But the world is 1 degree Celsius warmer since the Industrial Revolution because of pollution humans are pumping into the atmosphere. And this is a game of probability. As Kerry Emanuel, an MIT climate scientist, is fond of saying: Weather forms in that climate-changed world. Hurricanes intensify more rapidly; wildfires grow larger and more threatening; rainfall is more intense. Coral reefs struggle to survive. There are no truly ""natural"" disasters now . The war may remain invisible to many, even on Earth Day. But we are well into the middle of it. And we are not winning."
Washington Post: State Department to announce all countries importing Iranian oil will be subject to US sanctions - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/state-department-iran-oil-sanctions/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department is set to announce all countries that continue to import Iranian oil will be subject to US sanctions, The Washington Post reported on Sunday.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will announce Monday morning that as of May 2, countries importing Iranian crude or condensate will no longer be granted sanctions waivers by the State Department, two department officials told the newspaper's columnist Josh Rogin, who is also a CNN political analyst. ""The goal of the policy is to drive up the costs of Iran's malign behavior and more strongly address the broad range of threats to peace and security their regime presents,"" a State Department official told the Post. The announcement will come nearly one year after President Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal .

"The 5 biggest 2020 stories to watch this week, ranked - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/2020-campaign-schedule-week-ahead/index.html,"(CNN) With 288 days until the Iowa caucuses and a record number of Democratic candidates, the 2020 election is already in full swing. Every Sunday, I'll tell you the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the #1 story is the most important of the coming week. Subscribe to The Point newsletter to get this delivered directly to your inbox!
5. 20 for 2020: By the time we hit the end of the week we should have 20 announced Democratic presidential candidates in the race. While Joe Biden's entrance will draw the most attention -- scroll down for much more on the former VP's candidacy -- Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton is also expected to officially join the race this week. The 2020 Democratic field is already the largest in modern political history -- passing the 17 people who ran for the Republican nod in 2016. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
The challenges of a big field are myriad: It's hard to know where to put your resources -- or who is aiming at you. (I've compared it to a horse running in the always-crowded Kentucky Derby.) Opportunity exists, too -- particularly for lesser-known candidates. Get to double-digit support in Iowa or New Hampshire and, suddenly, you could find yourself in third place! Read More 4. Hogan gets serious: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan will travel to New Hampshire this week to participate in a Politics & Eggs event at Saint Anselm College -- the most clear sign yet that he is taking a hard look at a primary challenge to President Donald Trump. Every word Hogan utters within the confines of the Granite State will be closely monitored for clues as to whether he's moving toward the race or away from it. Hogan has been relatively open in his criticism of Trump's brand of Republicanism, but has also said he wouldn't run simply to be crushed underneath the incumbent's machine. Quiz: Think this primary is wild? See what you remember about the Republicans in 2016 At the moment, that seems the most likely end for a GOP primary challenge to Trump, given how popular he remains among base Republicans . Unlike Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor already challenging Trump, Hogan has a future within the party and may not want to risk it with a long-shot challenge to the incumbent. 3. You get a town hall! And you get a town hall!: We haven't reached the time when all -- or many -- of the top Democratic candidates will share a debate stage. (The first Democratic debate will be June 26 and 27 in Miami.) But on Monday, you'll get the next-best thing: Five (yes, five!) back-to-back-to-, well, you get the idea, 2020 town halls sponsored by CNN and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics . Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar kicks things off at 7 p.m. ET, followed every hour by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Comparisons will be inevitable -- whether the candidates invite them or not. 2. The Mueller question: The Mueller report is out ! The challenge before the 2020, um, challengers now is what to do with it. Elizabeth Warren came out in the immediate aftermath of the report's unveiling calling on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings. ""Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: 'Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice,"" said Warren. ""The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment."" Staking out that ground puts major pressure on Warren's Democratic opponents -- especially those who are seeking to convince liberals to choose them. None have followed suit -- which, as The New York Times notes here , may be a function of the fact that they don't talk to future primary voters who are demanding it. 1. It's Biden Time (finally): Sometime this week, the former vice president will reportedly enter the presidential race. Took him long enough! Biden held off announcing -- even as the field took shape -- in hopes of differentiating himself from the field as its clear frontrunner. That didn't work -- as Biden was forced to answer allegations about improper touching from several women including former Nevada state legislator Lucy Flores. Biden remains atop polling -- in key states and nationally -- and is likely to roll out a series of major endorsements as he tries to drive the inevitability narrative. But that's a bit of a tough sell at the moment given Biden's struggles of late. Is this week Biden's best one of the race to come?"
Defense Department announces deaths of US service members in Iraq and Qatar - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/us-service-members-iraq-qatar/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The US Department of Defense over the weekend identified two US service members killed in non-combat related incidents in Iraq and Qatar.

New Hampshire senator to call on 2020 Democrats to support repeal of voter residency law - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/2020-democrats-pledge-new-hampshire-voter-law/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, plans to send 2020 Democratic presidential candidates a letter Monday, urging them to sign a petition condemning a state law that would require college students to be a permanent resident of the state to vote.
""I am asking every candidate for President to stand up for these students, condemning these tactics and protecting the integrity of New Hampshire's voting process by signing a petition publicly denouncing this voter suppression law,"" Shaheen, the state's senior senator, writes in a letter she intends to send to all 18 declared candidates Monday morning. Currently, New Hampshire does not require registered voters to prove residency -- only to prove ""domicile."" But the new state law, House Bill 1264, which goes into effect in July, puts the same legal requirements for residents onto ""domicile"" persons. Those from out-of-state living in New Hampshire, like college students, will have to pay fees to obtain a New Hampshire driver's license and register their vehicles within 60 days of established residency, or after casting a ballot. The Granite State also allows same-day voter registration . CNN to host back-to-back town halls with five Democratic presidential candidates on April 22 In her letter, which CNN obtained ahead of its publication, Shaheen argues that the law effectively creates a ""poll tax"" for college students. Read More ""They are being disenfranchised by photo ID requirements, arbitrary challenges to residency, and unfounded allegations of fraud,"" Shaheen writes. President Donald Trump has claimed, without evidence, that thousands of people were bused from Massachusetts to vote illegally in New Hampshire, which he narrowly lost in the 2016 state primary. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner refuted the President's claim, telling the Boston Globe , ""We have never gotten any proof about buses showing up at polling places."" CNN is hosting back-to-back town halls Monday night with five 2020 Democratic candidates in New Hampshire. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will appear in the events beginning at 7 p.m. ET. The presidential hopefuls will field questions directly from students and young New Hampshire Democrats on issues of importance to young voters. Presidential candidate and former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke weighed in on Sunday. ""Don't need to wait until tomorrow on this,"" he tweeted. ""The law is wrong. It must be overturned. And we must enact a new Voting Rights Act so every person is able to cast their vote, have their voice heard, fully participate in our democracy."" Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York also spoke out against the law on Sunday. ""Our democracy is strongest when voters have the freedom to head to the ballot box to make their voice heard,"" she tweeted. ""The efforts of @GovChrisSununu to restrict this right for tens of thousands of students is unconscionable. I strongly support efforts to amend and repeal this bill."" Shaheen's push for 2020 Democrats to reject the bill comes as the candidates barnstorm the state ahead of its early presidential primary -- a key to building momentum for their campaigns. ""With the nation's eyes turned toward our first-in-the-nation primary, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to anyone seeking to subvert voting rights,"" Shaheen writes in her letter. ""I hope that you will join me in standing up for all Americans' right to vote."" The chair of the state's Democratic Party called for every presidential hopeful to sign the pledge. ""Every candidate for President campaigning in New Hampshire should sign Senator Shaheen's pledge and commit to protect the right to vote for everyone in the Granite State, especially the young people now threatened by a new voter suppression law that must be condemned and overturned,"" said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley in a statement provided to CNN. When HB 1264 was passed last year in the state legislature, the state Supreme Court found in a 3-2 ruling that the bill was constitutional and places ""voters and residents on equal footing as New Hampshire citizens,"" according to the Concord Monitor . After initially questioning the bill's constitutionality, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed the measure into law last July following the court's decision. ""House Bill 1264 restores equality and fairness to our elections,"" Sununu said in a statement, adding, ""Finally, every person who votes in New Hampshire will be treated the same. This is the essence of an equal right to vote."" But New Hampshire's Democrats, after taking control of the state House and Senate in the 2018 midterms, have sought to undo HB 1264. The law also faces a legal challenge. The American Civil Liberties Union, on the behalf of two Dartmouth college students, sued the state's attorney general and secretary of state in February, arguing the law is unconstitutional. ""Make no mistake: this is meant to deter young people from participating in our elections,"" Maggie Flaherty, a sophomore at Dartmouth from California and plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a post on the ACLU website. ""For me, the importance of voting in New Hampshire comes down to two factors: the fact that I now spend more time here than anywhere else, and that state and local policies can affect anything from my access to health care to the quality of the air I breathe."""
Maria Butina's defense attorneys fight against prosecutors' request for 18 months of jail time - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/maria-butina-attorneys-fight-jail-time/index.html,"(CNN) Maria Butina's defense team is fighting back against the prosecutors' sentencing memo in her case , which came in Friday night before her sentencing this week and unexpectedly asked for more jail time for her.
Prosecutors on Friday filed a pre-sentencing memo asking 18 months jail time for Butina, in a case where they've alleged scandalous actions and had to walk back some of them, yet where they still allege the Russian woman sought to hurt the US in her work as a foreign agent. ""Activities at issue in this case are part of Russia's broader scheme to acquire information and establish relationships and communication channels that can be exploited to the Russian Federation's benefit,"" prosecutors wrote in their pre-sentencing memo Friday. They say she was not a traditional spy or ""trained intelligence officer,"" but sought to help Russia at the expense of US national security. In this strongly worded filing, her defense attorneys, who previously had asked the sentence to be the time she has already served, reiterated that she is not a spy or Russian intelligence agent and has helped both the Senate Intelligence Committee as it investigated her contact and former Russian central banker Alexander Torshin, and prosecutors extensively, while asking the judge to throw out some of the prosecutors' discussion of her activities for Russia. Read More ""Maria is not a trained intelligence officer nor a spy in any sense,"" her defense attorneys wrote. ""The government knows that. Its prosecutors and federal agents behind closed doors have all but expressed that. There is no evidence to support that, and they have not charged her with any espionage-linked crime that addresses that."" ""All Maria has done is accepted responsibility for conspiring to act as an 'agent'—not a secret agent, not an intelligence agent—for Torshin, who was a friend but former foreign official of the Russian Central Bank,"" her attorneys continued. Her sentencing is set for Friday."

Lyra McKee: Two men released without charges after death of journalist in Northern Ireland,us.cnn.com,Nic Robertson,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/world/lyra-mckee-murder-arrest/index.html,"(CNN) The two teenagers who had been arrested in connection with the killing of investigative journalist Lyra McKee were released without charges on Sunday, police in Northern Ireland said.
The two men, aged 18 and 19, had previously been arrested under the terrorism act, the Police Service of Northern Ireland tweeted. McKee, a 29-year-old prominent freelance journalist who wrote for publications including The Atlantic and Buzzfeed News, was killed in the Creggan area of Londonderry, also known as Derry, on Thursday night in what police described as a terrorist incident. The release of the two men comes the same day that Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O'Neill called on those who brought guns to the streets of Derry to disband and end their actions. ""The people who brought guns onto the street, and those who organize them do not represent any version of Irish republicanism,"" O'Neill said at the Easter Commemoration in Derry. Read More ""They have no politics, no strategy, and no popular support amongst the vast number of ordinary people from this city or anywhere else in the country. ""Their actions are a barrier to Irish unity."" People gather around the floral tributes placed at the site of the killing in the Creggan area of Londonderry in Northern Ireland on Saturday. Bishop Donal McKeown, speaking at St. Columba's Church in Londonderry, also spoke about McKee's death. ""We pray for all those who are heartbroken at the tragic loss of Lyra. As the dead have slipped through our fingers, we pray trust in the risen Jesus they will be at peace and we will find peace at their passing."" Journalist was shot amid street violence On Sunday, detectives from the Police Service of Northern Island asked for anyone who may have information on the killing to come forward. ""We have received very positive support from the community but we need to convert this support into tangible evidence that will enable us to bring Lyra's killers to justice,"" Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said. ""We will continue to work positively and sensitively with the local community to achieve this."" My friend Lyra McKee lost her life seeking the truth Thursday night's violence came ahead of Easter weekend, during which some republicans mark the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, considered one of the most important events in the struggle for Irish independence from Britain. Trouble flared when police entered the Creggan area in Londonderry to carry out searches among dissident republicans who were storing firearms and explosives for a number of planned attacks over Easter weekend, police said in a statement. As the searches began, a crowd gathered and ""upwards of 50 petrol bombs were thrown at officers,"" the statement said. Two vehicles were hijacked and set on fire, it added. McKee was standing close to a police vehicle when she was wounded by the shots fired by a single gunman. She died soon after from her injuries, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told reporters on Friday. Police release surveillance footage Police said the shooting was carried out by dissident republicans, namely the New IRA. Murphy said Saturday that he believed the two teenagers who were arrested were members of the New IRA and were involved in the attack. ""Lyra was killed by shots that were fired indiscriminately,"" he said. ""The gunman showed no thought for who may have been killed or injured when he fired these shots. ""I know there will be some people who know what happened but are scared to come forward. I want to reassure you that we will work with you sensitively."" Murdered investigative journalist 'tirelessly pursued the truth' In addition, the PSNI released footage of the shooting in the hope that members of the public would provide information to assist the investigation into McKee's killing. McKee, who was born in Belfast, is the first journalist to be killed in the United Kingdom since 2001, according to nonprofit organization the Committee to Protect Journalists. During a vigil on Friday, her partner, Sara Canning, said McKee's ""amazing potential was snuffed out by this single barbaric act."" ""Victims and LGBTQIA community are left without a tireless advocate and activist and it has left me without the love of my life, the woman I was planning to grow old with,"" she added. ""This cannot stand. Lyra's death must not be in vain because her life was a shining light in everyone else's life and her legacy will live on and the life that she has left behind."" In a rare joint appearance Friday, Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster and Irish republican Sinn Fein party leader Mary Lou McDonald condemned the killing."
"If your image is online, it might be training facial-recognition AI - CNN",www.cnn.com,Rachel Metz,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/tech/ai-facial-recognition/index.html,"San Francisco (CNN Business) The photo is undeniably cute: a mom and a dad — he with a stubbly beard and rimless glasses, she with choppy brown hair and a wide grin — goofing around and eating ice cream with their two toddler daughters.
The picture, which was uploaded to photo-sharing site Flickr in 2013, isn't just adorable; with a bunch of different faces in various positions, it's also useful for training facial-recognition systems, which use artificial intelligence to identify people in photos and videos. It was among a million images that IBM harnessed for a new project that aims to help researchers study fairness and accuracy in facial recognition, called Diversity in Faces . The woman who shot the image, a librarian in rural Vermont named Jessamyn West, was surprised and angry when she found out the photo was being used by IBM. She had uploaded it to Flickr with a Creative Commons license that lets others use the photo. But something about not knowing that this image, along with other Creative Commons-licensed pictures she took — a self-portrait and about a dozen other shots — were included in a facial-recognition dataset bothered her. ""I think if anybody had asked at all, I would have had a different feeling,"" she said. A link to this image Jessamyn West took in 2013 was included in IBM's Diversity in Faces dataset. For years researchers have turned to the internet to collect and annotate photos of all kinds of objects — including many, many faces — in hopes of making computers better understand the world around them. This frequently means using Creative Commons-licensed images from Flickr, pulling images from Google Image search , snagging them from public Instagram accounts or other methods (some legitimate, some perhaps not). The resulting datasets are typically meant for academic work, like training or testing a facial-recognition algorithm. But increasingly facial recognition is moving out of the labs and into the domain of big business, as companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Google stake their futures on AI. Read More And as consumers are increasingly aware of the power of the data they leave like breadcrumbs across the internet, facial-recognition datasets are becoming a flash point for worries about privacy and a future where surveillance may be more commonplace. As a result, some researchers say they're now rethinking the Wild West atmosphere that pervades the face-gathering status quo, and what it means to give consent for the use of an image of yourself (or of someone else that you photographed) in a world where we constantly share our lives online. Where the faces come from Facial recognition has improved dramatically in recent years due to the popularity of a powerful form of machine learning called deep learning. In a typical system, faces are scanned (from still images, videos, or a live stream), and their features analyzed and then compared with labeled faces in a database. The technology is being used to fight human trafficking and help people speed through airport security; it's also being used for surveillance by law enforcement groups, at concerts , at sports events, and elsewhere. These people do not exist. Why websites are churning out fake images of people (and cats) Yet there are still accuracy issues. Researchers are increasingly concerned about bias in AI systems, which is evident in, say, how well the tech can do things like correctly recognize people of color and women. One reason for this issue is that the datasets used to train the software may be disproportionately male and white; IBM believes Diversity in Faces is more balanced than previous datasets. Diversity is important for training, but so is the sheer amount of data used. Facial recognition systems may be trained and tested on thousands or even millions of faces. The particular images that Diversity in Faces draws on have been available to researchers for years. The dataset includes URLs linking to photos, all pulled from a public list of 100 million Flickr photos that researchers from Flickr and Yahoo (Flickr's owner at the time; it's now owned by SmugMug) released in 2014. Known as YFCC100M, it has aided all kinds of scientific projects, such as estimating where photos and videos were taken without using geographic coordinates. IBM is just one among a slew of companies, research institutions, and individuals that have compiled datasets for facial recognition — some of which include actual images, some of which, like IBM ' s, have image links. Occasionally, these datasets are made by photographing models . But the internet has long been an irresistible resource. These faces are in the dataset Nvidia compiled to train its StyleGAN AI system. Often, such datasets are shared with the stipulation that they be used for non-commercial applications, such as research, but plenty of these datasets can be freely downloaded from websites such as Github, as CNN Business found. David A. Shamma, who helped put together the Flickr dataset when he was director of research at Yahoo Labs, said that for years academics working on computer vision or object recognition were just trying to scrape data wherever they could get it. ""It was just an academic process where people would often say, 'No harm, no foul,'"" he said. By releasing the big Flickr dataset, Shamma, now a senior research scientist at FX Palo Alto Laboratory, felt he and his colleagues had an opportunity to hand a big, licensed pile of images to researchers so they could build upon it. Watch out, Alexa. Artificial voices are starting to sound just like humans Those images had been uploaded to Flickr both by regular people like West, and by pros, all with Creative Commons licenses. These are special kinds of copyright licenses that clearly state the terms under which such images and videos can be used and shared by others, though you may not be thrilled about the specific ways they are used. Creative Commons licenses were first released in 2002, and Flickr in particular has been around since 2004 — way before the current AI boom. While researchers freely use images on sites like Flickr, they also acknowledge that many people posting these photos may be surprised to learn they can be used to train or test AI. ""I think people expect it, but when you confront them with exactly what it's being used for, they won't expect it,"" Shamma said. Changing expectations It took West by surprise. After reading an NBC News story in March about IBM's dataset that included a tool NBC made to look up whether a Flickr user's photos were included in it, she typed in her Flickr username: iamthebestartist. West was upset when she realized the photo she took of her junior-high friend's family and numerous other photos were part of it. She thinks AI will be helpful in the future, but she's concerned about her photos being used to train it without her knowledge. Angry posts on Twitter show plenty of other people are also unhappy to discover the images they shared online, often long ago, are becoming fair game for training facial-recognition and other kinds of AI. West asked IBM to remove her images from the dataset, which can only be done by emailing the company . She also had to authorize IBM to use her Flickr ID so the company could find and remove each of the photos. IBM told CNN Business that it is ""committed to the privacy rights of individuals"" and that anyone who is included in the dataset can opt out at any time. It's not offering a tool of its own to find out if specific images are linked in the dataset, though, so people have to look it up via the one built by NBC. Meanwhile, researchers at graphics chip maker Nvidia are looking at IBM's experience and thinking about how to change their own practices. This AI is so good at writing that its creators won't let you use it In March, Nvidia released an online tool that lets people see if their images are included in the dataset used to train StyleGAN, an AI system unveiled in February that is adept at coming up with some of the most realistic-looking faces of nonexistent people that machines have produced thus far. That dataset contains 70,000 high-quality, Creative Commons-licensed Flickr images. The tool came after NBC published its story, but David Luebke, Nvidia's vice president of graphics research, said it was already in the works for some time. ""We were thinking forward to what this would look like as people become more aware of this,"" he said. ""If some people have objections, we want to make sure we're respectful of that."" The company also included a list of steps users can take if they want their photo removed from the dataset, and if they'd like to avoid having it used for future computer-vision research. These suggestions include making the photo private, changing the license attached to it, or even adding a tag to the photo — a word or phrase associated with the image that's searchable on Flickr — that says ""no_cv"" to show they don't want it to be used for computer-vision research. ""I think a lot of people either don't care or would actively want their photos to go into something like StyleGAN,"" Luebke said. ""But if you don't, there should be a way to opt out."" This self-portrait, along with more than a dozen others taken by Jessamyn West, was included in an IBM dataset meant for facial-recognition research. Some researchers believe a good way to give people more control over how their images are used may be via a license that lets them determine clearly whether individual images they post online can be used for computer-vision or AI. This is unlikely to come from Creative Commons, though. The nonprofit's licenses don't limit or prohibit any use of images for the development of any sort of AI, as long as the terms attached to a work are followed. ""The licenses are not designed as a tool to protect privacy or protect research ethics,"" said Creative Commons CEO Ryan Merkley. Waiting for legislative help Artificial intelligence has been rolled out so swiftly in recent years that regulations have barely begun to be formulated, let alone implemented. And when it comes to gathering and using images for facial recognition, companies and researchers aren't legally obligated to tell people much of anything. There are no such federal rules related to how the technology can be built or used. A bit more has happened at the state level: Illinois, for example, has a law that requires companies get consent from customers before collecting biometric information. And the state senate in Amazon and Microsoft's home state of Washington recently passed a bill that limits the use of facial recognition. That bill still has to pass the state's house of representatives. Google scraps its controversial AI ethics council days after it was announced Merkley and others think legislation concerning how data is gathered for training and testing this kind of technology should be considered. This could happen in the not-so-distant future: in March, a Senate bill was introduced that would force companies to get consent from consumers before collecting and sharing identifying data. It would also require companies to conduct outside testing to ensure algorithms are fair before they're implemented, and let people know when facial-recognition technology is in use. Even in the absence of strict legal boundaries for using images of people to train AI systems, there's an ethical boundary companies and research groups should pass, said Jeremy Gillula, technology policy director for digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In his view, that means getting explicit consent from people whose faces are in those images. Sometimes that will be hard, he said, but that's a reality companies should have to face. ""I definitely think it matters,"" Gillula said. ""I think it matters to the people whose images are being used for purposes they hadn't imagined they'd be used for."" "

Ukraine's comedian president will face serious challenges (Opinion),edition.cnn.com,Michael Bociurkiw,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/opinions/ukraine-comedian-president-challenges-bociurkiw/index.html,"Michael Bociurkiw is a global affairs analyst and a former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his; view more opinions on CNN.
(CNN) On Monday morning Ukrainians will wake up to a President who comes from outside the traditional political elite that has led this country of more than 40 million people since independence in 1991.
Volodymyr Zelensky, a television comic they voted into the president's office on Sunday in an apparent landslide -- he garnered about three times as many votes as his opponent, according to early projections -- will inherit a massive to-do list for a country that is in the midst of a simmering conflict with Russia, has fallen to become one of the poorest countries in Europe , and confronts perceptions of corruption. Michael Bociurkiw As such, Zelensky will likely enjoy an extremely short honeymoon in which to prove that he can ably translate his comedic, on-air persona into a living, breathing president with substantial decision-making powers over foreign affairs, defense, intelligence, and in appointing the nation's top prosecutor. Read More Proving himself capable to skeptical opponents and the international community will be crucial. Well before Sunday's second round of voting, Zelensky's opponent, incumbent President Petro Poroshenko, was painting the 41-year-old self-made entertainment businessman as weak on Russia, inexperienced, and as a puppet of the billionaire oligarch who owns the TV channel that airs Zelensky's show. Figuring out what Zelensky actually stands for in domestic matters isn't easy -- and no less so on foreign matters, including future dealings with Russia. The feared Russian interference and manipulation in the elections appears to have been present, but it didn't make quite as big a splash as some had worried. It could be that the Kremlin opted to just sit back and watch as Ukrainians removed Poroshenko, a man Russia may feel they can no longer do business with. To be sure, one of the first items on the new President's ""to do"" list will be to sort out the simmering conflict with Russia in the east of Ukraine and the return of 24 sailors seized by Russia in the Kerch Strait area in November. If we are to believe a key Russian figure in Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk, Moscow is in a deal-making mood and might be prepared to return the seized lands in the Donbas with the goal of getting relief from Western sanctions imposed after Russia's 2014 incursion. In Ukraine's election, a comedian might be voters' best choice However, this is an area where the Zelensky team will have to tread carefully in order to avoid being branded as inexperienced and naïve -- or at the worst as traitors -- by patriotic Ukrainians who may not like negotiations with Russia. The conflict has cost upwards of 13,000 lives , displaced more than 1.5 million, and weighed on Ukraine's economy. France, where Zelensky traveled recently to meet with President Emmanuel Macron , will be in a position to help guide the new leader as a member of the four-party Normandy Format that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine. Sviatoslav Yurash, a senior member of the Zelensky team, told me a main thrust on the home front will be ""people power"" type actions, such as changing the ways governors are chosen and ""giving more say to everyday people."" A major move, he added, would be stripping the president , judges and members of parliament of immunity from prosecution, which they enjoy to varying degrees. One thing is for sure: Zelensky will have to start negotiating immediately with rowdy and disparate parliamentary factions to gain support for legislation that will have a positive impact. But that won't be easy, observers say. ""For Zelensky, winning was the easy part. The hard part will be building a coalition of parties in the parliament to help him deliver or his administration will not succeed. Forget the claims that he's a clown and knows nothing. He likely won't be able to do much in the next six months because every political party is positioning itself for the October parliamentary elections and will want to prevent Zelensky and his party from any real legislative success. Expect gridlock and massive fighting in the Ukrainian parliament in the next sixth months if the governing coalition holds,"" Melinda Haring, editor of the Atlantic Council's UkraineAlert blog and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told me. At least Ukrainian voters got some last-minute exposure to Zelensky's style when he unveiled his inner circle two days before the election, and in a carnival-like spectacle stadium debate, where he displayed a surprisingly savvy debating style. Zelensky's picks for his team, which were unveiled live on Thursday on the same channel which broadcasts his comedy series, showed that, out of a team of 20, there were only four women, the youngest was 26 and the oldest 62, and most were relatively unknown. But in the crucial area of boosting the Ukrainian economy, the inclusion of technocrats such as former finance minister Oleksandr Danyliuk, former economic development and trade minister Aivaras Abromavicius, and lawmaker and anti-corruption campaigner Sergii Leshchenko is a positive move.

As spectacular as it was, by Election Day, when this overwhelmingly Orthodox Christian nation also observed Palm Sunday, Zelensky's victory felt inevitable. Signs that Poroshenko would head for defeat were apparent well beforehand: he trailed Zelensky by 14 percentage points in the first round. Poroshenko and his team also showed a stubborn tone deafness throughout both campaigns, failing to speak to the bread and butter issues that most Ukrainians care about, including tackling rampant corruption, stemming a brain drain, raising the standard of living and pensions. Facing the nation with a patriotic platform of ""army, language and faith"" failed to resonate with younger voters, but an expected crucial pivot to ""it's the economy, stupid"" never materialized. Zelensky has pledged to be a one-term president. If he lives up to that promise, now that he's busted through the once-exclusive doors, could it be that in five years another fresh face becomes Ukraine's seventh president?"
