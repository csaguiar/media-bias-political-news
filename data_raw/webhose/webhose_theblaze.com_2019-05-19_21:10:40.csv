"Off-duty border patrol agent chased San Diego synagogue shooter, opened fire",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/off-duty-border-patrol-agent-chased-san-diego-synagogue-shooter-opened-fire,"The horrific shooting Saturday at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in San Diego claimed one life, and left three others injured, including the Rabbi, on the last day of Passover.
A 19-year-old man, John Earnest, is under arrest in the attack, that appears to have been an act motivated anti-Semitism and hatred. USA Today, CBS, an other outlets report that the killer authored a ""manifesto"" similar to that of the shooter in the New Zealand mosque massacre, and cited that incident as inspiration, reported Reuters on Saturday evening.
One of the three injured victims is a one-year-old infant.
In a press conference, police said there may be 'digital evidence"" also linking Earnest to a mosque arson last month, also in California.
As the events unfolded, an off-duty border patrol agent, reportedly working as a guard at the synagogue, chased the shooter. The officer drew his weapon and opened fire, hitting the suspect's vehicle as he fled.
President Trump tweeted his gratitude for that agent's heroic actions.
In the document that media are identifying as the killer's manifesto, which was posted online under his name around the time of the attack, the author referred to Trump as a ""Zionist, Jew-loving, anti-White, traitorous, c**ksucker"", and said that ""every Jew is responsible for the meticulously planned genocide of the European race."" There were many more, and worse, things written.
The shooting at the synagogue is a developing story, and this or other articles here may be updated as new information becomes available.

Man in Hong Kong allegedly beaten up for shouting 'Avengers: Endgame' spoilers outside theater,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-in-hong-kong-allegedly-beaten-up-for-giving-away-avengers-endgame-spoilers,"According to media reports out of China and Taiwan, as well as eyewitness accounts on social media, an unidentified man in Hong Kong was beaten up outside a theater this week for shouting out Avengers: End Game spoilers.
The photo (above and below) shared online purports to show the man, bloodied, receiving care after the incident. Witnesses say that he began giving away plot points just after he exited the theater, spoiling them for fans waiting in line for the next showing.
Asia One reports that , in some of the original shares of the story, some Marvel fans online replied with support...tor the people who beat him. ""He got his just desserts served,"" and ""felt good seeing this"" were some of the examples.
Filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo have made several appeals to the fanbase not to spoil the movie for folks who have not yet made it to their showing. Those appeals included an open letter posted on Instagram.
""When you see Endgame in the coming weeks, please don't spoil it for others, the same way you wouldn't want it spoiled for you,"" they wrote.
One can only assume the man in the photo didn't listen. Or, on the chance it could be a hoax, one may assume the hoax was meant as a lesson or warning. That warning: #DontSpoilTheEndgame … or else."
Franklin Graham responds to Pete Buttigieg controversy with powerful statement about Christian faith,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/franklin-graham-response-pett-buttigieg,"Franklin Graham triggered a wave of backlash last week when he called on South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, to repent for being gay.
Buttigieg, a member of the Episcopal Church, announced that he is gay in 2015, more than three years after becoming mayor of South Bend. Buttigieg is married to Chasten.
What did Graham say? In a message posted to Facebook on Saturday , Graham acknowledged the controversy that his message to Buttigieg generated.
While explaining the nuances of ""repentance"" and ""sin,"" Graham used the opportunity to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the world, explaining how, according to Jesus, every human is sinfully guilty before God, yet can be reconciled to God through faith in Jesus.
Graham wrote:
It is important to understand what ""repentance"" and ""sin"" mean. Sin is anything we do that is against God's commands. The Bible says that we are all guilty of sin—every person. God has put the entire human race under a death sentence because of man's sins. But God loves us and has provided a way of escape. He sent His Son Jesus Christ to earth to take our sins to the cross. He took our punishment on Himself, died on the cross, was buried, and by the power of Almighty God was raised to life on the third day.
Whether you're the mayor of South Bend, the president of the United States Donald J. Trump, Franklin Graham, or anyone else—it doesn't matter who you are or what you have done—we're all guilty and need God's forgiveness. God is willing to forgive our sins if we will repent (turn from those sins, leave them, go the other direction). If we turn our back on Jesus Christ and such a wonderful salvation, and continue to live in our sins and don't repent, God will have no choice but to condemn us to an eternity separated from Him at the judgment.
Graham continued: ""My prayer for you reading this is that you will make the decision today to turn away from your sins, ask for God's forgiveness, and put your faith in His Son, Jesus Christ.""
""I'm not condemning anyone, I'm not the judge, I don't make the rules—God does. And His rules are spelled out clearly in His Word, the Bible,"" he wrote. ""It's up to each person to decide for themselves what their response to a loving God will be.""
What is the background? In a series of tweets last week, Graham called on Buttigieg — who has used his faith to attack Vice President Mike Pence and somewhat reshape orthodox Christian teaching to conform to the progressive political agenda — to repent of homosexuality, an act the New Testament refers to as ""porneia.""
""Porneia"" is the Greek word used by New Testament writers, namely the Apostle Paul, that refers to sexual acts outside of God's design.
Although Buttigieg did not respond to Graham directly, Buttigieg has rebuked critics in the past, especially those who believe homosexuality does not align with the teachings of Jesus.
""That if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator,"" he said earlier this month , a message directed at Pence."
Rep. Ilhan Omar responds to Poway synagogue shooting: 'No more thoughts and prayers',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ilhan-omar-thoughts-prayers-poway-shooting,"Controversial Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who has been accused of anti-Semitism, responded to the tragic shooting at Chabad of Poway synagogue in California by calling for ""no more thoughts and prayers.""
The shooting, which left one dead and three injured, came during a Passover service on the final day of Passover.
What did she say? Omar said that ""love is the answer"" to shooting tragedies — as well as fewer firearms, an obvious nod to gun control.
Completing the tweet, Omar posted the hashtag ""nomorethoughtsandprayers.""
Omar's rebuke of ""thoughts and prayers"" is a thinly-veiled slight against those who offer condolences via thoughts and prayers. Politically speaking, gun control advocates denounce ""thoughts and prayers"" as powerless and devoid of meaning, a suggestion that gun control is the only appropriate response to shooting tragedies.
Earlier in the day, Omar said news of the shooting was ""breaking"" her heart. In the same message, Omar said that America ""must confront the terrifying rise of religious hate and violence"" and that ""love trumps hate.""
What was the reaction? Because Omar has been accused of spreading anti-Semitism through repeated use of anti-Semitic tropes, she was widely rebuked for her denunciation of thoughts and prayers.
""[Y]ou do realize people were shot at in their place of prayer and you're saying '#nomorethoughtsandprayers,'"" one person told Omar.
""Guns are not the problem, remember the people that did something? they killed thousands without a bullet. The people that did something in Nice? Almost 100 killed without pulling a trigger, love is not using an attack to promote your anti gun agenda #nomorethoughtsandprayers,"" another person said .
Meanwhile, the Minnesota Democrat was similarly scolded for her initial reaction to Saturday's shooting in which she said her heart was ""breaking.""
""You say anti Semitic things all day long you and your speech causes people to act in violent ways towards Jews. Now all of a sudden because a WHITE man shot up a synagogue with an AR rifle you all of a sudden care about the Jewish community. We don't need your fake sympathy,"" one person told Omar."
New York attorney general launches investigation into NRA. Here's everything you need to know.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-attorney-general-nra-investigation,"New York state Attorney General Letitia James announced Saturday that her office has initiated an investigation into the National Rifle Association's finances.
The announcement came amid internal strife at the NRA, which led to the departure of NRA president Oliver North during the organization's annual convention this weekend.
What are the details? In a statement , James' office confirmed the existence of the investigation, but did not provide additional details.
""The Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James has launched an investigation related to the National Rifle Association (NRA). As part of this investigation, the Attorney General has issued subpoenas,"" the spokesperson for James' office said.
The New York Times reported that James' office also sent letters instructing the NRA and affiliated organizations ""to preserve relevant financial records."" Several businesses connected to the NRA also received the letters.
According to The Times, the investigation is related to the NRA's tax-exempt status. As CNN noted , the investigation comes after Everytown For Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, filed a complaint with James' office urging an investigation into the NRA's finances.
James, who became New York's attorney general this year, vowed to investigate the NRA during her campaign. She even characterized the gun group as ""a terrorist organization"" in an interview with Ebony Magazine .
James' office has ""special jurisdiction"" over the NRA because the organization is chartered in New York, according to The Times.
How did the NRA respond? Attorney William Brewer, outside counsel for the gun rights group, said the NRA will cooperate fully with the investigation.
""The NRA will fully cooperate with any inquiry into its finances. The NRA is prepared for this, and has full confidence in its accounting practices and commitment to good governance,"" he said in a statement."
Ocasio-Cortez wastes no time politicizing Poway synagogue shooting — and it backfires immediately,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-synagogue-shooting-gun-control,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was sharply rebuked Saturday for quickly politicizing the tragic shooting at Chabad of Poway synagogue in California, which resulted in one death and three wounded.
What did she do? Just hours after the shooting, Ocasio-Cortez used the shooting to push for HR 8, gun control legislation passed by the Democrat-controlled House in February . The Republican-controlled Senate has not voted on the legislation.
""We have a responsibility to love + protect our neighbors. The longer the Senate delays holding a vote on #HR8 , the more we put Americans at risk,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter after saying the shooting left her ""heartbroken.""
Heartbroken to hear of the San Diego synagogue shooting, particularly so on this final day of Passover.
We have a responsibility to love + protect our neighbors.
The longer the Senate delays holding a vote on #HR8 , the more we put Americans at risk. https://t.co/ef9FURMFQ5
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 27, 2019 The legislation Ocasio-Cortez referred to would essentially outlaw handgun ownership for Americans aged 18-20, as well as impose strict legal restrictions for the temporary or permanent transfer of handguns.
The legislation would also expand federal background check requirements for all firearm transactions, including private transfers.
Reason explains :
HR8 requires that loans, gifts, and sales of firearms be processed by a gun store. The same fees, paperwork, and permanent record-keeping apply as to buying a new gun from the store. If you loan a gun to a friend without going to the gun store, the penalty is the same as for knowingly selling a gun to a convicted violent felon. Likewise, when the friend returns the gun, another trip to the gun store is necessary, upon pain of felony.
A clever trick in HR8 effectively bans handguns for persons 18-to20. However, it's not clear how HR8 would have prevented Saturday's tragedy. In fact, police say the perpetrator used a legally purchased AR-15 rifle — not a handgun.
What was the reaction? The New York Democrat was harshly criticized for quickly politicizing the tragedy, which came on the final day of Passover."
Fox Host catches multiple illegal border crossings live on air while interviewing Trump,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/foxs-bartiromo-catches-illegal-border-crossings-live-on-air-while-interviewing-trump,"Multiple men, women, and children became unscheduled guests on Fox News, and of Border Patrol, when they attempted to cross the border during host Maria Bartiromo's live broadcast. And not only did the cameras capture the apprehensions, they did so as she was interviewing President Trump about the border.
Bartiromo's show from the border between El Paso and Juarez, Mexico began with pre-recorded footage and an interview with the head of local border enforcement. In that package, she was present for the detaining of a family with very young children as they attempted to enter the United States (video below.)
When Bartiromo returned to her live broadcast, and her recorded phone interview with President Donald Trump, cameras captured people attempting to enter the country illegally.

During that earlier interview with border patrol, Bartiromo and her crew recorded a different border crossing (that makes three during the clips in this article).

Participants in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 'Fun Run' didn't know they'd just become campaign donors - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-5k-campaign-contribution,"On Saturday, men, women and children in Queens participated in a 5k ""Family Fun Run"" with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which was billed as being an event supporting the ""Green New Deal."" What a lot of the runners didn't know, apparently, was that they were also becoming political donors to her campaign.
The New York Post reported on Sunday that the $11,000 raised as ""registration fees"" were actually taken as political donations, and the print on that was very fine, indeed.
The Post interviewed various participants in the run, each of whom expressed their belief that they were running in support of the Green New Deal or to ""raise awareness.""
Not quite.
A vaguely worded notices on AOC's Facebook page — saying that the run would support ""U.S. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez & the Green New Deal"" — worsened the confusion.
But the fine print on a third event-related website revealed the truth.
""Registration fees are contributions to AOC for Congress,"" reads the legal disclosure on aoc5k.com, which lists the Federal Election Commission rules that donors must follow.
""It was a campaign fundraiser,"" Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent confirmed.
The participants paid more than $11,000 all told.
Even kids as young as 3 became unknowing political donors — ponying up $20 fees to join a kids' 1k. Lest you think it a minor difference -- and by the way it isn't, there are many people who believe in supporting causes but not donating money to campaigns -- the extra wrinkle is that it may actually have been a violation of the law, in that parents can't legally contribute to a campaign on behalf of their child. That's an FEC rule to prevent people trying to get around maximum donations.
Of course no one in the Fun Run was in danger of hitting the max on just fees alone (although hopefully no one had already hit it before filing their fee), but in principle it was possible.
Trickery is generally frowned on where campaign donations are concerned, and that is equally true of a lack of transparency that misleads. And some folks did feel misled, as the Post reports.
""The site says it's to benefit her environmental plan,"" said one supporter who would not give his name. ""If it is going to go directly to her campaign they should have said so."" The Post reporter also asked Rep. Ocasio-Cortez about it during the run. Neither she nor her team were too thrilled about being challenged by the media, a common reaction for the New York first-term Congresswoman. Watch:

What happened? During an appearance on CBS' ""Face The Nation"" Sunday, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) said he believes that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should consider brining impeachment charges against Trump.
""Do you personally think impeachment should be considered?"" show host Margaret Brennan asked.
""I think it should. I think it's the best way to get all of the facts out. I also believe that at some point we have to hear from this president whether he's lying to us or not. We need to hear from him under oath,"" Richmond responded.
But Richmond went a step further when he admitted that unseating Trump is, at least personally, his current ""sole focus.""
""Look my sole focus right now is to make sure that [Trump's] not the president next term,"" Richmond said, adding that while Congress should further investigate whether Trump obstructed justice, the primary goal of Democrats should be ""to make sure that [Trump] does not win re-election.""

New York Times finally issues apology for anti-Semitic political cartoon,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-times-finally-issues-apology-for-anti-semitic-political-cartoon,"The New York Times on Saturday issued a note after they deleted an anti-Semitic cartoon attacking President Trump and Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu that ran in the Opinion section of the International Edition on Thursday of last week.
The statement offered neither regret nor apology , but characterized the cartoon as having ""included anti-Semitic tropes"" and called it offensive.
The Jerusalem Post ran a scathing editorial rejecting that note on Saturday, and everyone from CNN's Jake Tapper to White House advisor Kellyanne Conway offered condemnation of the cartoon, and the NYT failure to apologize.
So on Sunday, at last, they offered one, and it even had the word ""sorry"" in it this time. The statement was attached as an image to a Tweet that read, ""We apologize for the anti-Semitic cartoon we published. Here's our statement.""
We are deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon last Thursday in the print edition of The New York Times that circulates outside of the United States, and we are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again. Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it's all the more unacceptable. We have investigated how this happened and learned that, because of a faulty process, a single editor working without adequate oversight downloaded the syndicated cartoon and make the decision to include it on the Opinion page. The matter remains under review, and we are evaluating our internal processes and training. We anticipate significant changes. On social media the apology is still meeting some skepticism, both for the delay in its coming and for laying it to a single editor. However, most responses have been appreciative of the recognition and admission of error, as well as the promise to take steps to make sure something like this doesn't go up under their banner in the future.
In addition to that apology, the paper ran an editorial from one of its own, columnist Bret Stephens, that absolutely blistered them over running it in the first place. ""The paper of record needs to reflect deeply on how it came to publish anti-Semitic propaganda,"" he argues in this article trashing the 'ignorance"" on display in this unfortunate episode.
As anti-Semitism is on the rise, and attacks on places of worship for members of all faiths fill our news screens, it's important that something like this can be called out and called what it is, even as our politics is deeply partisan and polarized."
Tipsters are raking in cash by reporting idling vehicles to the NYC government in the name of fighting climate change,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/tipsters-rake-in-cash-reporting-idling-nyc-vehicles,"Some New Yorkers are raking in some extra cash by squealing on idling trucks and buses in the city.
The city's Department of Environmental Protection issued 1,038 summonses in 2018, a massive increase over the prior year, which saw only 24, according to DEP data reported by the New York Post . The spike followed a reward program implemented by city lawmakers as part of its effort to combat climate change and air pollution.
""Idling vehicles and the air pollution they emit is a serious public health issue and by empowering New Yorkers to document violations on their own we supplement the work of our inspectors,"" DEP spokesman Ted Timbers told the newspaper.
DEP has paid nearly $20,000 to 13 tattlers who've filed official complaints against lawbreakers.The whistleblowers receive a percentage of the fines collected from offenders.
Upper West Side banker George Pakenham spurred the city's reward program following more than a decade of anti-idling and pollution activism. In 2005, he discovered the rarely enforced 1971 NYC law that limits engine idling.
Pakenham was featured in the 2012 documentary, ""Idle Threat: Man on Emission.""
How does the reward program work? Tipsters can file their complaints with DEP by submitting an online form , along with time-stamped photos or videos of the idling vehicle.
Fines vary from $350 to $2,000 depending on the length of idling time, where it was caught idling, and whether or not it was a repeat offense. Tipsters earn about 25 percent of the fine collected by the DEP.
Curbside idling is limited to three minutes in most parts of the city and no longer than one minute in a school zone.
It usually takes three months to receive the payout, Pakenham told the Post.
Who are the top reward earners? Lawyer David Dong raked in the most at $4,912.80 from 47 summonses, according to the Post.
Zachary Tinkelman, a theater worker, netted $4,600, also from 47 summonses.
Pakenham came in third at $4,300 from 34 summonses. His total haul comes to about $10,000, including previous cases he prosecuted himself.
""It's sort of a miraculous thing that's taken place,"" Pakenham told the newspaper. ""Citizens are doing the job that the police don't wish to do and they're being compensated for it, and at the same time they're cleaning up the air in New York City, so it's a trifecta of wins, so to speak.""
The banker also offered to teach others how to join the effort to clean up the city's air.
""I know more about this than anybody, so I'm not stingy about my knowledge,"" Pakenham said."
AOC accuses Kellyanne Conway of stoking 'suspicion' around her faith — but Kellyanne gets the last word,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kellyanne-conway-aoc-twitter,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) sparred with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on social media Sunday where the freshman lawmaker accused President Donald Trump's most trusted confidant of trying to ""stoke suspicion"" around her faith.
What happened?
During a Sunday discussion with CNN host Jake Tapper , Conway noted that Ocasio-Cortez had been quick to condemn the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand last month, yet remained silent after hundreds were slaughtered in terrorist attacks on Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka.
After Conway's interview, CNN analyst Julian Zelizer incorrectly claimed in a now-deleted tweet that Conway said Ocasio-Cortez ""didn't tweet anything about the synagogue shooting"" when, in fact, she had .
In response, Conway corrected Zelizer on Twitter, instructing him to listen ""before spewing.""
That's when Ocasio-Cortez inserted herself into the conversation, accusing Conway of taking pot shots at her Christian faith.
However, Conway never commented on Ocasio-Cortez's faith, neither in her conversation with Tapper, nor on social media.
While later emphasizing the importance of referring to the attacks in Sri Lankan churches last week as ""Easter worshippers,"" Ocasio-Cortez attacked Conway and accused her of stoking ""suspicion"" around her faith.
How did Conway respond? First, Conway explained the reason why she mentioned Ocasio-Cortez during her interview with Tapper, noting that some people ""found it odd a prolific tweeter was silent"" about the Sri Lankan massacre.
Then Conway informed Ocasio-Cortez that she was not, in fact, judging her faith.
She also extended an olive branch toward Ocasio-Cortez, instructing the freshman lawmaker to call her if she is serious about bipartisanship and working with the Trump administration.
Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to Conway's offer."
Musician claims to have drunkenly — and intentionally — brushed his bare genitals on Trump in 2001,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/musician-claims-to-have-brushed-bare-genitals-on-trump,"In his new memoir, musician Moby claims to have brushed his bare genitals on President Donald Trump's jacket during a 2001 party.
Mmm, nope. (Tell me more.) Moby — real name Richard Melville Hall — said that the incident occurred in a post-9/11 world at a New York City party that the two had both been in attendance. The party reportedly took place just a month after the terrorist attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people.
Blaming his fugue on the attacks, the musician said that two friends named ""Lee"" and ""Clariece"" encouraged him to do it, so he did.
In his new memoir, ""Then It Fell Apart"" — as excerpted by The Daily Beast — the Quote: :
I was dared to brush my drunken, flaccid penis up against Donald Trump's suit jacket. Although, in the spirit of alcoholic disclosure, my caveat is this: as I was very drunk and high at the time I'm still not 100% sure it actually happened. But even though this happened almost 20 years ago, I'm still perpetually stunned by the fact that Americans elected as president a dimwitted con man whose only claim to fame is that he once hosted a mediocre reality-TV show.
He went on to point out that he did accept the dare — of course — and went on to brush himself past the future president.
""Moby, go knob-touch Donald Trump,"" Lee said.
""Really?"" I asked. ""Should I?""
Donald Trump was a mid-level real-estate developer and tabloid-newspaper staple whose career had recently been resuscitated by a reality-TV show.
""Yeah,"" Dale said.
""Yeah,"" Clarice said, mischievously.
""S***,"" I said, realizing I now had to knob-touch Donald Trump.
I drank a shot of vodka to brace myself, pulled my flaccid penis out of my pants, and casually walked past Trump, trying to brush the edge of his jacket with my penis. Luckily he didn't seem to notice or even twitch.
I walked back to my friends and ordered another drink. ""Did you do it?"" Clarice asked.
""I think so. I think I knob-touched Donald Trump.""

Combat vet reveals harrowing moment he 'scared the hell' out of Poway synagogue shooter,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/oscar-stewart-hero-poway-shooting,"Saturday's tragic shooting at Chabad of Poway synagogue near San Diego, which resulted in one death and three injuries, could have been much worse if it weren't for the heroic actions of Oscar Stewart.
Stewart, a combat veteran of the Iraq War who served time in the Army and Navy, immediately jumped into action when AR-15 shots rang out. He recalled his story in an interview with The Daily Caller on Sunday.
What did Stewart say? Stewart, 51, recalled that he does not remember a single conscious thought between the time the shots began and when the incident was finally over. He just remembers that he acted on instinct, running toward the shots — not away from them.
""Get down!"" Stewart yelled when shots rang out, according to witnesses. ""You motherf***er! I'm going to kill you!""
""I knew I had to be within five feet of this guy so his rifle couldn't get to me,"" Stewart explained. ""So I ran immediately toward him, and I yelled as loud as I could. And he was scared. I scared the hell out of him.""
Stewart said when the shooter opened fire, he was in the back of the synagogue. Unfortunately, by the time the shooter reached the lobby, he had already mortally wounded one woman and shot three others. That's when Stewart turned the corner and engaged the shooter.
""When I came around the corner into the lobby area, I saw the individual with a gun, and he fired two rounds. And I yelled at him and I must have yelled very loud, and he looked at me, and I must have had a really mean look on my face or something, because he immediately dropped his weapon and turned and ran. And then I gave chase,"" Stewart told The Daily Caller.
Indeed, witnesses recall that Stewart screamed so loud that he made the noise of four or five men.

After engaging the shooter, Stewart said the 19-year-old killer cowardly locked himself in his car. Stewart pounded on the car — determined to deal with the shooter himself — when he saw the shooter reach for another firearm inside the car. That's when the off-duty Border Patrol agent, whom President Donald Trump recognized Saturday night , told Stewart to duck.
The Border Patrol agent, who apparently received the civilian firearm from someone inside the synagogue, fired several shots into the shooter's car, intending to disable it. Unfortunately, the shooter was able to drive away.
Fortunately, the shooter — who said he was inspired by last month's Christchurch massacre in New Zealand — later turned himself in to police.
Does Stewart consider himself a hero? While the military veteran is being hailed as a hero, he told The Daily Caller that he does not consider himself one. Instead, he gave that distinction to Lori Gilbert Kaye, the incident's only fatality. Witnesses say the 60-year-old woman shielded the congregation's rabbi with her body .
""People in the aftermath here have been saying it's important to be strong and defend ourselves. I also think it's important to know that being strong and defending ourselves requires a lot of sacrifice too,"" Stewart said.
""I don't know if I consciously made the choice to potentially sacrifice myself,"" he explained. ""But I did. And this lady, she stood and she jumped in front of the shooter and she saved the rabbi's life. When somebody said I was a hero, I'm like, she was a hero. I just did it instinctively, like an animal. There was no conscious decision. I just did it.""
The funeral service for Kaye is on Monday.
Anything else? Various reports claimed the shooter dropped his firearm , an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, only after it jammed. But Stewart disputes this fact.
In fact, Stewart told The Daily Caller that the shooter dropped the firearm in part because he was frightened by Stewart.
""He was in the act of shooting when I saw him,"" Stewart said. ""When I yelled at him he turned and looked at me, and he like froze. And then the look on his face was one of amazement at first, and then one of fear. He saw me coming, and I was ready to do whatever I had to do to stop him."""
Sri Lanka bans face coverings after terror attack,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/sri-lanka-bans-face-coverings,"Sri Lanka has announced a complete ban on all face coverings following the terror attacks targeting hotels and Christian churches on Easter Sunday.
What are the details? On Easter Sunday , more than 300 people were killed and at least 450 people were injured by coordinated suicide attacks on churches and hotels. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, but local authorities are investigating whether it was carried out by a local terror group known as the National Tawheed Jamath.
The new rule bans ""All sorts of face covers that hinders the identification of individuals in a way that threatens national security."" The declaration did not specifically single out Muslim headscarves, however, it is largely understood to be targeting those. Only last week, a member of Sri Lanka's parliament had suggested a ban on burqas citing national security.
The niqab and burka, which both cover the face, are only worn by a minority of Muslim women on the island, according to the BBC .
According to the CIA World Factbook , around 9.7 percent of the Sri Lankan population identifies as Muslim. Most Sri Lankans (70.2 percent) are Buddhist, and there are significant Hindu and Christian minorities.
According to the statement for Sri Lanka's president, Maithripala Sirisena, the decision was made ""to strengthen national security as well as to not inconvenience any demographic group so as to create a peaceful and harmonious society in Sri Lanka.""
The new rule took effect on Monday.
What else? Several European nations , including Denmark, Belgium, Austria, France, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria, have also banned burqas, citing both safety concerns as well as suggestions that the full coverage garments worn by some Muslim women are a sign of their oppression. Individual cities in other countries like Italy and Spain have also banned these garments."
FBI director warns that 2018 election interference was just 'dress rehearsal' for 2020,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-director-warns-that-2018-election-interference-was-just-practice-for-2020,"FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that Russian interference attempts during the 2018 midterm elections were just a ""dress rehearsal"" for the 2020 presidential election.
What did he say? Speaking to Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations , in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Wray said that while law enforcement agencies had made ""enormous strides"" since the 2016 president election, the toughest fight was still in front of them.
Wray was confirmed as FBI director in August 2017 , replacing James Comey who had been fired by President Donald Trump in May of that year.
Wray said that Russia ""poses a very significant counterintelligence threat,"" particularly when it comes to cybercrime.
""I think we recognize that our adversaries are going to keep adapting and upping their game. And so we're very much viewing 2018 as just kind of a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020,"" he said.
He also praised ""the flow of information back and forth between law enforcement and the intelligence community and Silicon Valley,"" which he said he thought had gotten ""drastically better"" between 2016 and 2018.
""I think those companies recognize that there is a need for them to take action, so that their own platforms are not abused,"" he said. ""And so there was — there were a lot of success stories in the midterms, where some of these companies were taking pretty aggressive action on their own, voluntarily, not at our behest or requirement, to enforce terms of use and so forth on their platforms and shutting down and kicking off various accounts that fit into the kind of category we talked about.""
What else? Wray also said that he thought other countries were ""watching and taking note of what the Russians attempted to do in 2016 and since.""
According to NBC News , applications for internships and jobs as special agents at the FBI have increased this year."
"WATCH: 8-year-old's 'extremely heroic' action, quick thinking saves him and older sister from kidnapping",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/8-year-olds-extremely-heroic-action-and-quick-thinking-saves-him-and-his-sister-from-kidnapping,"""Every time I think about it, I want to cry,"" Nita Coburn told WCPO-TV .
Coburn drove her sick daughter to an emergency room in Middletown, Ohio, on Thursday afternoon, helped her into a wheelchair, and thought she locked her car — which contained her great-grandchildren in the back seat, the station said.
What happened? But a safety feature prevented the car from locking since the keys were still inside — and just like that a man climbed into the driver's seat and began to pull away, WCPO said.
Coburn, 69, told the station it was the ""most morbid feeling in the world.""
Image source: YouTube screenshot
So she ran after the car and grabbed the driver's side door handle before the man inside slammed it shut, WCPO said.
Coburn told the station she tried again to open the car door — and beheld an awful sight: ""The second time he slammed it shut, I saw he had a hold of Skyler.""
Skyler is Coburn's 10-year-old great-granddaughter — and she was in the back seat with her 8-year-old brother Chance, WCPO noted.
Coburn told the station she screamed and grabbed the door handle again, and the man in the driver's seat began dragging her.
'Extremely heroic' But while all that was happening, Chance pulled Skyler away from the man's grip — and surveillance video shows the brother and sister tumbling out of the moving car, WCPO reported.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
""What Chance did was extremely heroic,"" Middletown Police Officer Connor Kirby told the station Friday. ""It shows how extremely brave he was and how much he loves his sister.""
Here's surveillance video of the incident:

As for Coburn, she didn't see her grandchildren's escape from the car and continued hanging on to the driver's side door handle, WCPO said, adding that police estimated she was dragged four car lengths before she let go.
She then saw Sklyer and Chance running toward her, the station said, as the car drove off.
""That car didn't bother me at all,"" Coburn recounted to WCPO. ""It was them two babies. No one needs to feel that fear. No one does.""
What about the alleged car thief? Police told the station that 24-year-old Dalvir Singh didn't get very far after driving away from the hospital — they soon found him and the car a few blocks away and arrested him on charges of kidnapping, grand theft, and felonious assault.

Singh was being held on a $200,000 bond in the Middletown City Jail, the Journal-News reported , and his next court appearance is scheduled for Friday.
Police chief commends 'little guy' ""This little guy is a hero. No question,"" Chief Rodney Muterspaw in a statement to the Cincinnati Enquirer . ""He pulled his sister out of the car with no concern for his own safety. That is incredible at his age.""

What are the details? According to a video shared by Popular Military , which is believed to have been filmed in 2017, a young man can be seen shouting at shoppers outside a store. The young man goes on to approach several people while yelling and gesturing with his hands. After the attacker approached one of the shoppers at his vehicle, the veteran can be seen storming over and grabbing a hold of the young man.
The outlet reported that the crook was demanding that people fork over money. When the veteran refused, the young man purportedly said, ""I know you got some money, white boy.""
The confrontation then turned physical, and the young man went on to make threats against the vet's life, the outlet reported.
Completely unafraid, the vet grabbed the attacker by the shirt, put him in a tight hold, and pinned him against the nearby building facade. The vet can be seen pulling out a Taser gun and threatening the younger man with it.
""You think this is a game?"" the vet demanded. ""When you say you're gonna kill somebody, you kill 'em!""
The unnamed vet went on to explain that he carries a Taser with him for this very reason of ""motherf s"" trying to make threats — so that the vet doesn't have to ""pull out a gun and shoot [them] in the motherf*"
"Norwegian fishermen find beluga whale, suspect it of being a Russian spy",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/suspected-spy-whale-with-russian-harness-found-by-norwegian-fisherman,"Norwegian fishermen discovered a beluga whale affixed with Russian gear last week, sparking fears that the Kremlin is further weaponizing sea mammals to assist in its naval operations.
What are the details? Last week, a fleet of commercial vessels was ""harassed"" by a suspected ""spy"" whale in the waters of Arctic Norway, The Washington Post reported. The animal repeatedly nudged up against the boats, when one crew noticed the beluga was wearing a tight harness.
A team from Norway's Directorate of Fisheries — trained to release sea animals from netting and other foreign objects — responded to the scene and helped a local fisherman free the whale. According to the Daily Mail , the harness was branded with a logo which read, ""equipment of St. Petersburg,"" and had a camera mount.
Martin Biuw of Norway's Institute of Marine Research reportedly told local outlet NRK , ""If this whale comes from Russia — and there is great reason to believe it — then it is not Russian scientists, but rather the navy that has done this.""
The Guardian reported that in 2017, state-owned Russian media outlet TV Zvedzda revealed the Kremlin paid for research and training to measure the effectiveness of beluga whales, seals, and dolphins for military purposes. The navy wanted to determine whether the whales, in particular, could be used to ""guard entrances to naval bases"" and ""assist deepwater divers and if necessary kill any strangers who enter their territory.""
But researchers reportedly discovered dolphins and sea lions made better weapons than beluga whales.
According to the Mirror , Russia President Vladimir Putin has bolstered his fleet of operatives from the animal kingdom in recent years. In 2014, Russian military commanders boasted of taking control of Ukraine's ""13 highly-trained military dolphins and sea lions it claimed were trained to hunt underwater mines, attack enemy divers with special knives and pistols attached to their heads, and plant bombs on boats.""
Anything else? Russia shares a 120-mile border with NATO ally Norway, and in the past three years has stepped up what CBS News called the Kremlin's ""mounting belligerence in the region.""
In regard to the beluga discovered last week, CBS reported, ""If what the Norwegian fishermen found is evidence of a current program by Russia's military, the Norwegians and their NATO partners might need to start looking for much smaller weapons of war, too — weapons with flippers."""
Pregnant Christian teen who refused chemotherapy to save her unborn baby’s life dies - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pregnant-christian-teen-who-refused-chemotherapy-to-save-her-unborn-babys-life-dies,"Dana Scatton, a teen mom who gave birth in January, died last week.
What are the details? Scatton, a Christian who would have turned 18 last week, discovered she was pregnant when she was 17 years old. Months after she discovered she was pregnant, she received news that she had an inoperable brain tumor.
Her options weren't good: She could either begin radiation treatment to possibly prolong her life, negatively impacting the growth of her unborn child, or she could opt to avoid treatment until the baby was born. Scatton's daughter, Aries, was born at 33 weeks in January.
A Facebook page set up to benefit Scatton revealed the sad news last week. A portion of the post said , ""This morning shortly before 4am, Dana left us to be with the lord. We may never have the right things to say to truly honor the amazing, smart, loving, caring, passionate, incredibly beautiful and free spirited mother, daughter, niece, sister, cousin, friend and independent woman Dana was every day.""
The post added that Scatton inspired everyone around her to be ""better than who we are, and to keep God in our focus at every moment.""
""She faced the greatest fear of all, death, and smiled back with a grin only God can instill,"" the post continued. ""She fought harder than the toughest warriors known to man and did it with grace and valor.""
The family's post added that they are unsure how to proceed after Scatton's death.
""Dana started this chapter of her life with a Quote: , and we find it fitting to leave today's post with it,"" the family wrote, and Quote: d Isaiah 41:10.
""So do not fear, for I am your God; do not be dismayed for I am with you, I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand,"" the verse read.
The family's post added, ""Dana was an amazing woman who left a lasting impression on everyone she met and knew.""
The post noted, ""She inspired so many and continues to do so even after she's gone on to heaven. We thank God every day for the time we had with her. We wish nothing more than to have more time with her but we know she's not suffering any more. She's happy. Right where she wants to be. Right next to God."""
Police to begin checking students for knives at some London schools after increase in stabbings - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-to-begin-checking-students-for-knives-at-some-london-schools-after-increase-in-stabbings,"Police will install knife arches at schools across three boroughs in London, following the latest stabbing of a 17-year-old in broad daylight over the weekend.
""Knife arches will be in place at schools over the next two weeks, and officers have increased reassurance patrols around the Balham area in light of last Wednesday's stabbing,"" said Chief Superintendent Sally Benatar of the Basic Command Unit for southwest London, the Sun reported. ""We prioritize effective safeguarding, and our schools' officers are working hard to protect and educate our young people in the dangers of carrying knives.""
Saturday's bloody attack on the teenager occurred aboard a bus in northwest London. No arrests have been made in connection with the crime. The victim's condition is not immediately known.
Metropolitan Police data showed a 16 percent rise in knife-related crimes in 2018 over the previous year, according to the Sun . Since January, at least 1,299 stabbings have occurred in London.
""Following these distressing events, we decided to implement the use of stop and search powers using Section 60 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act,"" Benatar said. ""When it comes to long-term solutions to violent crime, we encourage the proactive use of stop and search where reasonable grounds exist.
""This proves to be one of our most effective means of taking dangerous weapons off the street,"" Benatar added.
Benatar also empowered officers in south London to search anyone for weapons without cause.
Is the problem widespread? Crimes involving knives or other sharp instruments are up 30 percent across the United Kingdom since 2011, according to the report.
A strin g of stabbings over seven hours left a 21-year-old man dead and several others injured last week, the Sun reported."
Another Hollywood superstar admits to raising her two young sons in a gender-neutral environment,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/another-hollywood-superstar-admits-to-raising-her-two-young-sons-in-a-gender-neutral-environment,"Actress Zoe Saldana says that she's raising her three male children in a gender-neutral environment so as to avoid perpetuating gender stereotypes.
What did she say? During a recent discussion with Us Weekly , the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" actress said that she and her husband of six years, Marco Perego Saldana, raise their young boys in a home with both ""female and male toys"" so they aren't confused about their roles as human beings.
Zoe Saldana says that she believes her 4-year-old twins Cy and Bowie, and 2-year-old son, Zen, can only benefit from her decision.
""I'm always gonna be honest and that is always the best way to welcome healthy and truthful discourse, especially around parenthood,"" she said.
""[The twins] made a comment two weeks ago, like, 'Boys are stronger than girls,' because they're in that stage of comparisons,"" the 40-year-old actress admitted. ""And you have to take a moment and kind of put together an answer that they will understand.""
Saldana says that her goal in parenting is ""[to] not bring all this charge that you have as an adult and as a woman into their lives.""
""They're a blank slate,"" she added.
What else? In 2018, Saldana told the outlet that her household is strictly gender-fluid.
""We have a very gender-neutral environment where my husband participates in a lot of tasks that were normally given to women and vice versa,"" Saldana said . ""I get to do a lot of male things, which is, I don't know, put the TV together, fix things that break. We're sort of a very gender-fluid household. I think it's important to raise boys in that environment, and girls as well.""
Saldana and her husband are apparently cut from the same cloth: when the couple tied the knot in 2013, he opted to take her last name in an unconventional move.
""He liked [my last name],"" she explained. ""He wanted to really represent being a part of my family and represent my father's legacy. He respected the fact that he didn't want me to have to give up my name just because that's the norm."""
"Young adult migrants sue Trump administration, allege unfair denial of immigration status",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/young-adult-migrants-sue-trump-administration,"A group of migrants in New Jersey sued the Trump administration Monday, saying they were unfairly denied legal immigration status in United States as minors after allegedly fleeing abuse or neglect in their native countries.
What are the details? According to Reuters , the complaint claims ""The government has imposed a new requirement for eligibility, resulting in the delay and denial of scores of meritorious petitions and placing young people in jeopardy of deportation."" The plaintiffs are four unnamed migrants from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador who came to America through the southern border during a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing in 2014 and 2015.
The issue at hand is the interpretation of what's known as Special Immigrant Juvenile status, which can be used to obtain green cards for ""a child who's a non-citizen and has been abandoned, neglected or abused by one or both parents,"" according to the law firm Rumbold & Seidelman, LLP .
In the New Jersey suit, the plaintiffs argue they were unfairly denied this form of asylum because they are now between the ages of 18 to 21, whereas as younger applicants are granted special favor.
The Trump administration has determined that state courts ""lacked jurisdiction and authority to enter findings for young adult immigrants"" the New York Law Journal reported, and argues it's adhering to the laws of a majority of states which recognize 18 as the age of majority.
So far this year, the federal government has also been hit with court challenges against its administration of the Special Immigrant Juvenile statute four times. Attorneys representing the New Jersey migrants speculate there are more than 100 other people who would be eligible to join in on their class action lawsuit.
Anything else? According to the Los Angeles Times , the Special Immigrant Juvenile status was implemented by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990.
While critics of the SIJS say it's a loophole used by illegal immigrants to gain asylum, migrants over the age of 18 say they're being mistreated. One plaintiff who sued in California last month told the Times of the Trump administration, ""I think they're just trying to find loopholes, honestly, to not let people have what was once provided to them.""
He added, ""The small possibility that we have to become U.S. citizens...is getting smaller and smaller. I feel like that's their goal: to make it almost impossible for one to be legally in the U.S."""
Here's how many Americans support Liz Warren's plan to put taxpayers on the hook for student loan debt,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-on-warren-loan-plan,"A new poll sets out what percentage of Americans support a plan by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to put the taxpayer on the hook for all student college debt.
According to the new Harris-X survey, 64 percent of Americans polled, nearly two thirds, say that they would support a plan like Warren's.
The poll, however, presented the provisions of her plan, and did not identify it as the Senator's plan.
36 percent of Americans polled said they opposed the plan.
The presidential candidate detailed her plan to tax wealthy Americans in order to cancel most student loan debt, which is thought to top $1.5 trillion, and pay for tuition at state and community college.
""Student loan debt is crushing millions of families,"" she tweeted. ""That's why I'm calling for something truly transformational: Universal free college and the cancellation of debt for more than 95% of Americans with student loan debt.""
Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) criticized the proposal, which he called ""clumsy and unfair.""
""This plan effectively asks all Americans,"" he tweeted, ""many of whom never got a degree, to give their tax dollars to people who CHOSE to take out a student loan so that they COULD get a job paying $250k a year.""

GOP senator demands that Trump end tariffs if he wants his trade deal with Mexico and Canada to survive,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chuck-grassley-tariffs-threat-trade-deal,"Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has called for President Donald Trump to lift his steel and aluminum tariffs if he wants his new trade deal with Canada and Mexico to survive.
What tariffs? On March 1, 2018, President Donald Trump announced that he was imposing a 25 percent global tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent global tariffs on aluminum imports. Initially, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union had exceptions to this rule. On June 1 , these exceptions expired and they were hit by the tariffs as well.
In late November, Trump, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, to replace the former deal, NAFTA. Trump had repeatedly criticized NAFTA, calling it "" the worst trade deal in history.""
Despite the signing ceremony, the USMCA deal still needs to be approved by Congress before it can go into effect.
What did Grassley say? In a piece that ran Sunday in the Wall Street Journal , Grassley accused Trump of bucking ""decades of Republican orthodoxy by railing against free trade agreements.""
The tariffs, Grassley argued, were ""a tax on Americans."" He said that they also ""jeopardize"" the ability of not just the U.S. Congress, but the Mexican Congress and Canadian Parliament as well.
""Canadian and Mexican trade officials may be more delicate in their language, but they're diplomats. I'm not,"" he said. ""If these tariffs aren't lifted, USMCA is dead. There is no appetite in Congress to debate USMCA with these tariffs in place.""
Why do we have tariffs? Trump said that these tariffs were put into place in order to combat the U.S.'s trade deficit with other nations. While the trade deficit is down for the first two months of 2019, it hit a record $796 billion in 2018 . Even the first two months of 2019, while lower (by $1.5 billion and $5.0 billion) than January and February 2018, are substantially higher (by $5.5 billion and $6.6. billion, respectively) than those same months during 2017.
Critics of Trump's tariff policy point out that tariffs are paid by the consumer , not the country doing the exporting. The Trump administration has also paid out $7.7 billion to farmers hurt by decreasing foreign demand for their products caused by reciprocal tariffs imposed on the United States by other countries in direct response to U.S. tariffs."
'I am proud to be a gay son of God': Brigham Young valedictorian comes out during graduation speech,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/i-am-proud-to-be-a-gay-son-of-god-brigham-young-valedictorian-comes-out-during-graduation-speech,"Brigham Young University's 2019 valedictorian announced during his convocation speech that he is a gay man, drawing cheers from the audience at the school founded by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
What are the details? Matt Easton, 24, made the declaration on Friday during a graduation address to a crowd of around 10,000 people, the Daily Mail reported. ""I stand before my family, friends, and graduating class today, to say that I am proud to be a gay son of God,"" he said from the podium.
""I am not broken. I am loved and important to the plan of our great creator. Each of us are,"" Easton added.
The admission drew international headlines, given the church's stance that ""sexual relations...between people of the same sex violate our Father in Heaven's most important laws and get in the way of our eternal progress.""
The LDS and Brigham Young University both make a distinction between having homosexual feelings and acting on them.
The school's honor code says that ""one's stated same-gender attraction is not an Honor Code issue,"" but ""homosexual behavior is inappropriate and violates the Honor Code.""
Following his speech, Easton was asked by a local television station whether he can see himself living as an openly gay man while remaining a member of his church.
He responded, ""There comes a time when I'm going to have to start thinking about these questions, you know? Am I going to get married? Am I going to have children? Those are some pretty hard questions and I don't have the answers to all of them.""
Anything else? Easton told The Washington Post he has been inspired by Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who has spoken extensively about being a Christian and a gay man. In particular, Easton praised the speech Buttigieg recently gave where he accused Vice President Mike Pence of having "" a problem "" with homosexuals."

The bus driver, 25-year-old Shane Piche of Watertown, New York, was sentenced to 10 years of probation and ordered to register as a Level 1 sex offender, the lowest classification reserved for those considered to be at a ""low risk"" of committing a sex crime in the future.
Although he pleaded guilty to third-degree rape, he had also been charged with endangering the welfare of a child for giving her alcohol, and first-degree unlawfully dealing with a child.
""I wish Shane Piche would have received time in jail for the harm he caused to my child,"" said the victim's mother in a statement to WWNY. ""He took something from my daughter she will never get back and has caused her to struggle with depression and anxiety.""
Piche's defense attorney, Eric Swartz, told WWNY that he felt the punishment was sufficient for his client's crime.
""He'll be a felon for the rest of his life,"" Swartz said. ""He's on the sex offender registry for a long time. Maybe not the rest of his life because of the level but this isn't something that didn't cause him pain and this isn't something that didn't have consequences.""
Police say he met the victim through his job as a bus driver for the Watertown City School District, and the assault occurred at his residence.
Piche will be requred to pay $375 in court fees and $1,000 to register as a sex offender, although he will not be included in sex offender databases due to the level 1 designation.
He will not be allowed to be alone with anyone younger than 17 years old, with some exceptions, and he was fired from his bus driver job as a result of his crime."

""When we're having conversations about anti-Semitism, we should be looking at the most extreme on both sides,"" she said while addressing the topic of Saturday's deadly synagogue attack in Poway, California . ""I would bring up Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and some of her comments that got so much attention, and in my opinion Nancy Pelosi wasn't harsh enough on her for trafficking in anti-Semitic language, talking about, 'All about the Benjamins,' and how Jewish people had 'hypnotized' the world.""
The attack left one person dead and three others injured, and occurred during a Passover service.
Just hours later, the freshman congresswoman tweeted her apparent thoughts on McCain's appearance on the ABC network show.
Tweeting a clip of McCain's interview, Omar wrote, ""Oh, bless her heart!""
After the Saturday attack, Omar tweeted, ""My heart is breaking after today's deadly shooting at Chabad Congregation in San Diego—on the last day of Passover and 6 months to the day after the Tree of Life shooting.""
She added, ""We as a nation must confront the terrifying rise of religious hate and violence. Love trumps hate.""
McCain wasn't the only one to call out Omar after Saturday's synagogue attack. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) made a similar statement on Twitter.
He wrote, ""The anti-Semitic Left — whether @IlhanMN repeated anti-Israel slurs or @nytimes apologizing for Hamas terrorists (eg, on 3/14/18) & running racist cartoons — is getting worse. And the House can't even pass an anti-Semitism resolution. Responsible dems need to say Enough is Enough."""
Breaking: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein hands in his resignation,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/deputy-ag-rosenstein-resigns,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has handed in his resignation to President Donald Trump, according to the Washington Post.
The resignation letter says that he will leave the office effective May 11.
Rosenstein praised the president in his letter of resignation, first for his sense of humor, and second for the goals he set forth in his inaugural address.
""We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls,"" said Rosenstein.
""We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle,"" he continued .
Rosenstein became the focus of much ire after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference and collusion with the Trump campaign. The oversight fell to Rosenstein, and many were angered that he did not dismiss the investigation.
Later a report said that he had offered to record the president surreptitiously in support of an effort to oust him from office, which he denied vehemently.
The accusation led the president to imply during a rally in September that he was going to fire Rosenstein and others in the Department of Justice.
""We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first,"" Rosenstein concluded in the resignation letter.

Beto O’Rourke wants to spend $5 trillion in taxpayer money fighting climate change,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/beto-orourke-5-trillion-climate-change-plan,"Democratic presidential candidate Robert ""Beto"" O'Rourke has finally revealed his first concrete policy proposal of the 2020 primary bid, and it's a plan to address global warming with a whopping $5 trillion price tag.
The sweeping environmental plan, which was announced Monday and is hosted on O'Rourke's campaign website , calls for a four-pillar framework of cutting pollution and executive action, a massive infrastructure investment, reaching net-zero carbon emissions nationwide by 2050, and preemptive measures for communities expected to face ""extreme weather.""
""The greatest threat we face — which will test our country, our democracy, every single one of us — is climate change,"" reads a statement that accompanied the policy outline. ""We have one last chance to unleash the ingenuity and political will of hundreds of millions of Americans to meet this moment before it's too late.""
The first portion of the plan includes the United States re-entering the Paris climate accord, addressing methane leakage in the energy industry, increasing efficiency regulations for buildings and appliances, and increasing regulations on power plants.
The infrastructure portion would spend trillions on efforts to ""accelerate the scale up of nascent technologies enabling reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,"" on research and development on green technology, and on public grants for things like public housing and public transportation.
Part three promises that as president, O'Rourke would work with Congress to pass a legally enforceable standard to reduce carbon emissions in his first 100 days. Part four lays out plans to increase natural disaster spending and change federal disaster responses to ""to make sure that we build back stronger after every disaster.""
""The costs of climate change will measure in the tens of trillions of dollars, in lives lost, and livelihoods devastated and destroyed,"" reads the introduction section. ""We are the first generation to feel the climate crisis, and the last generation with the ability to avert its worst impacts.""
The $5 trillion cost may seem a bargain compared to the estimated $93 trillion price tag on the Green New Deal proposal put out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), but keep in mind that the GND was an aspirational resolution, not actual policy proposal legislation right now. The estimate comes from the widely mocked supporting documents for the resolution rollout.
But in real terms, the proposed cost (which is an estimated total drawn up by O'Rourke's campaign) is less than a cool trillion south of the total estimated cost of our post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — that started almost 20 years ago.
But that's still not enough for some climate activists. The Sunrise Movement, a far-left environmental group, has criticized O'Rourke's proposal for being too weak on carbon emissions and walking back more extreme promises that he already made.
""We're glad to see Beto release a climate plan as his first policy and commit to making it a day one priority for his administration,"" reads a statement from Sunrise Executive Director Varshini Prakash, who says that the plan is ""out of line"" with the emissions timeline laid out in the Green New Deal.
O'Rourke touted the ""historic"" climate change proposal at a campaign stop in Yosemite National Park, which he chronicled on Twitter."
Left-wing activist who said Bible believers 'deserve to be locked up' invited to speak at Harvard 'diversity conference',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-activist-who-said-bible-believers-deserve-to-be-locked-up-invited-to-speak-at-harvard-at-a-diversity-conference,"Harvard University's Faculty of Arts & Sciences invited left-wing activist and writer Tim Wise to deliver the keynote address at its Decade of Dialogue ""diversity conference"" last week .
""Join us for a retrospective look at diversity and inclusion, a discussion of current issues, and practical guidance on how we can move toward greater inclusion and belonging at Harvard,"" the event description reads.
Speaking of 'diversity and inclusion' Wise noted a few years back that Bible believers ""deserve to be locked up.""
And while he kinda, sorta, maybe relented later on in the same 2015 Facebook post, his message seemed clear: ""I don't believe lunatics like this should be locked up, but I do think they have to be politically destroyed, utterly rendered helpless to the cause of pluralism and democracy ...the world is not theirs. They have no right to impose their bulls**t on others. They can either change, or shut the hell up, or practice their special brand of crazy in their homes...or go away.""
Wise also called Christians "" fundamentalist extremist Jeezoids "" earlier in 2015 and also said back in 2008 that ""fascism ... will be welcomed, lock stock and barrel by persons who pray at every meal to a God they visualize as white, whose son they also think was white, and who they believe is going to rapture them all into the sky upon the blowing of some heavenly trumpet, after which point all those who don't think as they think will be burned in an eternal lake of fire.""
He also tweeted in 2012 that ""people who believe in a God of hell/damnation deserve to be mocked viciously and run out of public square.""
And after sweeping Republican victories in the 2010 midterm elections, Wise posted ""An Open Letter to the White Right, On the Occasion of Your Recent, Successful Temper Tantrum"" for his blog.
A different tune for his speech
Wise — author of ""White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son"" and ""Dear White America: Letter to a New Minority"" — didn't use anti-religious language at the Harvard conference but rather ""emphasized his own wokeness,"" the College Fix said .
During his address, he spoke favorably of black reparations, saying it's ""fabulous"" that the conversation is taking place, that it's a ""victory"" that prominent Democratic presidential candidates are formulating stances on reparations, and that it's a ""win"" that colleges are considering reparations, the outlet reported.
Wise also said President Donald Trump is and ""always was"" racist, the College Fix noted, and that his election shows that America ""is more sexist and more racist than I realized.""
More from his address, according to the outlet:
Academic institutions have an obligation to embrace the struggle for social justice and solidarity, ""not just at the level of rhetoric but policy"" as well, Wise said.
""Schools must make mission statements up to date,"" and be ""willing to say what it means to operationalize"" the implementation of inclusive ideals.
He set out vague admission and graduation requirements in order to achieve this mission. Admissions offices must consider applicants under the mind-set that ""if you're not down with this mission, then you don't actually fit in with us as an institution.""
Current students should pay their dues by proving that they're committed to ""this mission"" by way of ""community service requirements … relevant to solidarity."" If they don't meet this standard, ""then you don't graduate,"" he advocated. Here's video of the Harvard conference. Wise's keynote begins just after the 2-hour mark:

"Mom thanks God, American Airlines flight crew, and passengers for saving her baby's life during a midair medical emergency",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-thanks-airline-god-passengers-for-saving-baby,"A scheduled layover during a flight from Tampa, Florida, to San Antonio quickly turned into an emergency trip to the hospital for a mother and her 11-month-old daughter.
Shortly before American Airlines Flight 607 landed in Dallas on Thursday, Janay Flowers' daughter developed a high fever and suffered a seizure.
""My precious baby girl had a febrile seizure when we were 10 minutes out from landing in Dallas,"" Flowers wrote in an Instagram post, where she thanked God, the flight crew, her fellow passengers, first responders, and the medical staff at the hospital for saving her daughter Nevaeh's life.
""Nevaeh is doing well now, but on that flight the scariest moment of my life unfolded before my eyes,"" the 28-year-old mother wrote.
Mom and daughter were traveling to San Antonio where Flowers' husband will be stationed with the U.S. Air Force.
What happened? During the flight, Nevaeh's toes turned blue, and she struggled to breathe, Flowers wrote.
""I was traveling alone with Nevaeh and did not have a clue what to do but cry out for help,"" Flowers continued. ""Two people immediately came to aid my baby and found that she was burning up.
""They called out for any doctors on the plane and about 3-4 additional people came running to help also,"" she wrote. ""God had His hands on us. All of these people worked diligently to cool my baby down while she was having a seizure.
""One man went to the front of the plane to ensure that the EMS was at the gate as soon as we landed. Another man got an oxygen tank and administered it to Nevaeh. Another man was taking her pulse.
""As soon as our plane landed, we all rushed to the front of the plane while they grabbed all of my belongings,"" Flowers wrote. ""One man carried my baby, one man kept thumping her foot to make her cry, I sang you are my sunshine and prayed like I never prayed before. It seemed to last forever.""
Paramedics immediately took Flowers and Nevaeh to the Baylor Scott & White Hospital in Grapevine after landing at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
It was the first time Nevaeh had suffered a seizure, Flowers told USA Today .
""If no one was able to help me on the flight, I don't know what I could have done for my baby, because I was in shock,"" Flowers said, according to The Dallas Morning News . ""I believe that they helped save my baby's life.""
What did the airline say? A spokesman for American Airlines commended the flight crew for their handling of the situation.
""This medical emergency last week highlights the tremendous professionalism of American's team members, and specifically, in this situation, our flight attendants and DFW team,"" spokesman Ross Feinstein told the Morning News in a written statement. ""We are proud of our colleagues and are grateful to them for their quick actions.""
American also made sure that the family's luggage made it to San Antonio.
Is the little girl OK? After Nevaeh's release from the hospital, the family continued their journey by car.
Flowers told the Morning News that the little girl's appetite is still low, but that she started smiling and giggling during their drive to San Antonio.
""My family and I are beyond grateful for all of the care and treatment given to our baby,"" the girl's mother wrote. ""I am so thankful to God that He put the right people in the right place at the right time! God kept us and worked through those angels who cared for Nevaeh."""
Israeli cartoonist hits back with powerful cartoon after NY Times runs anti-Semitic drawing,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/israeli-cartoonist-responds-new-york-times,"The New York Times faced intense backlash over the weekend after the newspaper's international edition published a vehemently anti-Semitic cartoon last week. Over the weekend, an Israeli cartoonist hit back with a drawing of his own.
What happened? The cartoon, published in the Thursday's international edition, featured the face of Benjamin Netanyahu on a dog with a Star of David collar leading a fat, blind President Donald Trump, who was wearing a yarmulke, the traditional head-covering worn by Orthodox Jews.
After the cartoon generated outrage, and obvious accusations of anti-Semitism, New York Times editors released a statement Saturday that announced the cartoon's retraction . The editors said a syndicate was responsible for the drawing, not a staff cartoonist.
The statement said:
A political cartoon in the international print edition of The New York Times on Thursday included anti-Semitic tropes, depicting the prime minister of Israel as a guide dog with a Star of David collar leading the president of the United States, shown wearing a skullcap. The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it. But as many quickly pointed out, something important was missing from the statement: a formal apology.
How did the Israeli cartoonist respond?
Israeli cartoonist Shay Charka, who works for Israeli publication Makor Rishon, published a cartoon of his own mocking The New York Times .
The cartoon features The Times as the blind one being led by a dog whose head is the book of ""The Protocols,"" an infamous anti-Semitic book that describes an alleged Jewish plan for world domination. The book was widely disseminated in the early 20th century, and was even used as propaganda by the Nazi regime.
Meanwhile, Charka gave his dog a collar with ""BDS"" on it, a reference to Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, a deeply anti-Semitic movement that seeks to undermine Israel's economy.
Did the Times ever apologize? By Sunday afternoon, the Times finally issued a formal apology for publishing the cartoon, explaining a single editor had made the decision to publish it.
The statement said:
We are deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon last Thursday in the print edition of The New York Times that circulates outside of the United States, and we are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again. Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it's all the more unacceptable. We have investigated how this happened and learned that, because of a faulty process, a single editor working without adequate oversight downloaded the syndicated cartoon and make the decision to include it on the Opinion page. The matter remains under review, and we are evaluating our internal processes and training. We anticipate significant changes. However, the Times' apology did not come before Bret Stephens, a staff columnist at the newspaper, rebuked the paper in his Sunday column for its obvious promotion of anti-Semitism.
""As prejudices go, anti-Semitism can sometimes be hard to pin down, but on Thursday the opinion pages of The New York Times international edition provided a textbook illustration of it,"" Stephens wrote. ""Except that The Times wasn't explaining anti-Semitism. It was purveying it.
""But the publication of the cartoon isn't just an 'error of judgment,' either. The paper owes the Israeli prime minister an apology. It owes itself some serious reflection as to how it came to publish that cartoon — and how its publication came, to many longtime readers, as a shock but not a surprise,"" Stephens said."
Trump reportedly wants to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-2-trillion-infrastructure-spending,"President Donald Trump reportedly wants to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure projects.
Here's what we know According to Axios , Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) has been telling people that Trump told him that he wants to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure. Neal is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which would have to come up with any new spending.
Trump's own publicly released 2020 spending plan, according to a Budget Fact Sheet published by the White House, ""called upon the Congress to pass legislation that generates at least $1 trillion in infrastructure investment.""
Axios also reported that Trump has said he does not like public-private partnerships and would rather have the federal government control infrastructure development than to outsource it.
The U.S. Treasury expects that during the 2019 fiscal year the U.S. will borrow more than $1 trillion. It already did this in 2018.
By 2020, the Treasury Department expects the U.S. to run a $1 trillion deficit for the first time since the end of the recession. The deficit occurs when the federal government spends more in one year than it raises in revenue. This, along with interest, is what contributes to the growing national debt. The national debt has already passed $22 trillion and continues to climb.
What else? Trump will talk with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday about infrastructure spending.
In March 2018 , Trump said he was ""forced"" to sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill into law and promised ""never to sign a bill like this again."" He said that he had seriously considered using his veto power. That bill contained a substantial amount of military funding and did not cut any of Planned Parenthood's funding.
TheBlaze has reached out to Neal's office for comment."
Congress sends bill to President Trump's desk encouraging more public shooting ranges,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/congress-sends-bill-to-president-trumps-desk-encouraging-more-public-shooting-ranges,"The U.S. House and Senate have passed a bill aimed at encouraging the creation of more public shooting ranges throughout the United States.
In a Monday afternoon voice vote , the House passed, HR 1222, The Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act, which was co-sponsored by Reps. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) and Ron Kind (D-Wis.)
""This is something that's been long sought by the sports community,"" Bishop said on the House floor in support of the legislation.
""As this nation becomes more urbanized,"" Bishop added, ""the ability of having people a safe place where they can go and they can practice — target practicing, it becomes even more significant that these ranges have to be maintained, they have to be improved in some particular way.""
Since the passage of the Pittman-Robertson Act in 1937, federal conservation efforts have been largely funded by sportsmen and women who pay excise taxes on guns and ammunition, as well as other sporting goods and outdoor licenses. The Department of Interior takes up the funds and then gives them to state wildlife agencies .
Under current federal law, state governments have to come up with 25 percent of the construction, maintenance, and operation funding for a public shooting ranges while the PRA's specially designated excise tax funds cover the rest.
But even just 25 percent of the total cost can be pretty steep for a state-level wildlife agency's budget. This bill aims to lower the state threshold to 10 percent to make it easier for them to put together shooting range builds and projects.
And since the extra money involved comes from within the ""user pays"" framework for federal wildlife funding, a CBO report on the Senate version of the bill found that enacting the legislation ""would have no significant effect on direct spending.""
""What we're doing here is, I think, taking the right approach: With a fund that already exists, giving states flexibility and encouraging the sporting community,"" Bishop said on the House floor. ""That's why the sportsmen of our country have long sought for this particular provision; they look at this as a major and important win.""
But target ranges aren't just for fun; they can also play a big part in gun safety.
""Public shooting ranges provide hunters a place to sight in rifles and shotguns before hunting seasons, for people to take firearm safety and hunter education courses and, for recreational target shooters to enjoy their sport,"" a statement in support of the measure from National Shooting Sports Foundation Vice President and General Counsel Lawrence Keane said.
The Senate version of the bill, sponsored by Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) passed out of the upper chamber earlier this month.
""Providing states more flexibility to develop shooting ranges gives sportsmen new opportunities for target practice and boosts the outdoor recreation economy,"" Bennet said in a statement accompanying the bill's introduction."
Linda Sarsour to keynote fundraisers for radical terror-tied group,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/linda-sarsour-to-keynote-fundraisers-for-radical-terror-tied-group,"Women's March leader Linda Sarsour is set to keynote several fundraisers across the country for Islamic Relief USA, an Islamic advocacy organization that is banned in many countries and has increasing ties to international terrorist organizations.
Over the past few years, the controversial progressive activist has faced increasing scrutiny over her Islamist ideology and ties to radical extremists, in addition to her virulent anti-Semitism. Nonetheless, she remains a board member of The Women's March, which claims to advocate for the rights of all women.
The Sarsour keynote series for Islamic Relief will kick off May 12 in the Atlanta area, where she will be joined by radical New York-based preacher Imam Siraj Wahhaj, whom Sarsour considers her closest mentor. Last year, several of Wahhaj's children were arrested after they attempted to set up a terrorist training camp in New Mexico.
The week after the Atlanta gala, Sarsour will travel to Chicago and Orlando to speak at other Islamic Relief fundraisers.
Several countries have listed Islamic Relief Worldwide — the parent organization of Islamic Relief USA — as an international terrorist organization.
IRW is listed as a designated terrorist group in the United Arab Emirates.
Israel has banned the group from the country, alleging that it provides material support for Hamas. In 2016, Israeli authorities arrested an Islamic Relief worker for assisting Hamas.
Bangladesh has banned IRW as well, claiming that it supports radical Islamists.
Additionally, Russian and Swiss authorities , along with British and Swiss banks, have cracked down on the group for terrorist-financing efforts. Banking giants UBS and HSBC have closed Islamic Relief's bank accounts due to terrorist-financing concerns.
Under the guise of a humanitarian mission, IRW is known to support and prop up radical Islamist groups and individuals in the nations where its network operates. There is currently an ongoing U.S. federal criminal investigation into Islamic Relief, according to a 36-page investigative report by the Middle East Forum that was published in 2018.
The think tank has described Islamic Relief as an outfit that ""was founded — and continues to be managed — by prominent Islamist operatives"" who are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and other international terrorist organizations.
Moreover, the Clarion Project has described Islamic Relief as an entity "" joined at the hips"" with the Muslim Brotherhood. The current chairman of the group appears to openly support the Muslim Brotherhood, according to photographs publicized by The Investigative Project on Terrorism.
Linda Sarsour has previously spoken at fundraisers for the controversial terror-linked organization. In 2016 and 2017, she spoke at several Islamic Relief events as part of the group's ""Promise for Palestine"" tour. Islamic Relief is just one of the many U.S.-based Islamist outfits that the Women's March leader has cozied up to."
'God Bless America' singer Kate Smith told millions that 'race hatreds' must be 'exterminated'; pioneered racial integration on TV,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kate-smith-told-millions-that-race-hatreds-must-be-exterminated,"The New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Flyers made big headlines recently for banning singer Kate Smith's rendition of ""God Bless America"" at games after getting word she sang racist lyrics nearly 90 years ago.
The Flyers arguably had a deeper association with Smith, who sang ""God Bless America"" at the team's important games during their Stanley Cup-winning days in the early 1970s. But the Flyers went so far as to cover Smith's statue in front of the team's arena before removing it altogether .
Image source: KYW-TV video screenshot
The team also erased her ""God Bless America"" rendition from its archives after the songs she sang in the early 1930s came to light.
Well, another bit of history has surfaced Turns out Smith gave a radio address heard by millions in January 1945 titled, ""The Value of Tolerance."" The magazine Tune In excerpted Smith's speech on page 41 of its May 1945 issue , adding that her words attracted nearly 20,000 reprint requests. Here's what Smith told her World War II audience:
It seems to me that faith in the decency of human beings — is what we must have more of, if there is to be a future for all of us in this world. We read in the papers every day about conferences on the best way to keep the peace. Well, I'm not an expert on foreign affairs — and I don't pretend to know all the complex things that will have to be done for a lasting peace. But I am a human being — and I do know something about people. I know that our statesmen — our armies of occupation — our military strategists — may all fail if the peoples of the world don't learn to understand and tolerate each other. Race hatreds — social prejudices — religious bigotry — they are the diseases that eat away the fibers of peace. Unless they are exterminated it's inevitable that we will have another war. And where are they going to be exterminated? At a conference table in Geneva? Not by a long shot. In your own city — your church — your children's school — perhaps in your own home. You and I must do it – every father and mother in the world, every teacher, everyone who can rightfully call himself a human being. Yes, it seems to me that the one thing the peoples of the world have got to learn if we are ever to have a lasting peace, is — tolerance. Of what use will it be if the lights go on again all over the world — if they don't go on … in our hearts? What else did Smith do? Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby said Smith invited Josephine Baker to appear on her popular TV program in 1951, which was ""the first time the controversial black entertainer was on American television.""

She also had the Billy Williams Quartet — a black vocal group — on the ""Kate Smith Evening Hour"" in 1952 . Here's one of the groups's notable recordings:
Billy Williams Quartet ""Sh-Boom"".mov www.youtube.com
Anything else? And as has already been reported, one of the songs Smith sang in the early 1930s — ""That's Why Darkies Were Born"" — was viewed as satire against white supremacy and bigotry, and Jacoby in his Globe piece said that ""explains why it was also recorded in 1931 by Paul Robeson , the formidable African-American baritone."" The other song in question Smith sang, ""Pickaninny Heaven,"" was part of an early 1930s movie called ""Hello Everybody.""
The question is: Will the Yankees or the Flyers rethink their stances? Either way, sports commentator Jason Whitlock gave the teams quite the spanking:
Smith's 1986 New York Times obituary states : ""No single show-business figure even approached her as a seller of War Bonds during World War II. In one 18-hour stint on the CBS radio network, Miss Smith sold $107 million worth of war bonds, which were issued by the United States Government to finance the war effort. Her total for a series of marathon broadcasts was over $600 million.""
The obit added that Smith and ""God Bless America"" writer Irving Berlin both waived royalties for the song, which go to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations. President Ronald Reagan awarded Smith the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1982.
Here's CNN's Michael Smerconish noting Smith's 1945 speech against ""race hatreds"" and much of what's already transpired:"
Joe Scarborough says 'the blood that is spilled' in hate crimes is on President Trump's hands,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-scarborough-says-the-blood-that-is-spilled-in-hate-crimes-is-on-president-trumps-hands,"MSNBC commentator Joe Scarborough claims ""the blood that is spilled"" in hate crimes is on the hands of President Donald Trump, blaming the president's rhetoric for inciting politically-motivated violence and threats.
What are the details? Speaking on his show, ""Morning Joe,"" on Monday, Scarborough went on a tirade over comments President Trump made at the National Rifle Association convention over the weekend.
""They tried for a coup, didn't work out so well. And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I?"" President Trump says in a clip, presumably referring to allegations that people within the intelligence community targeted him and his administration. ""Corruption at the highest level — a disgrace. Spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrow; and we caught 'em. We caught 'em,"" he added.
Scarborough reacted by saying of the president's comments, ""I mean, I've just gotta say, everything he said there was a lie,"" while his wife and co-host, Mika Brzezinski, agreed.
""An overthrow was a lie,"" Scarborough asserted. ""That's the sort of inflammatory rhetoric that we've been talking about, where the president is trying to move people to violence. An overthrow? That's a lie,"" the host continued, arguing it was the president's own Justice Department that launched the Mueller investigation into alleged Russian collusion.
""So, I'm not really confused, I know you're trying to stir up hate and maybe even violence, because, your words, they certainly go on the border an awful lot"" the former Republican congressman said, speaking directly to the president. ""But, a coup? That's just a lie, you know it's a lie, you know it's irresponsible, you know it's as irresponsible as when you say 'enemy of the people.'""
""That's kind of like when you talked about a Second Amendment solution to stopping Hillary Clinton from appointing federal judges that people didn't like, Second Amendment solution, the killing of Hillary Clinton. We are so far beyond dog whistles here, Donald,"" Scarborough continued. ""The blood, the blood that is spilled is on your hands. From white nationalists, from people that listen to that sort of rhetoric, any violence to journalists, enemy of the people. The kill list.""
Scarborough went on to tell the president, ""You are unfit to be president of the United States, but you can do something about that. You can restrain before there is more bloodshed, because, let me tell you, the synagogue shootings are not going to stop until you call out white nationalism by its name, and allow the federal government to actually see white nationalism as a threat,"" in light of the mass murder at a synagogue near San Diego on Saturday.
The pundit further urged the president to condemn white nationalism.
""For the sake of Jews that keep getting gunned down, and for the sake of others who are put in danger by your words,"" he said.
Anything else? Over the weekend, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the president spoke out against white nationalism after the 2017 tragedy in Charlottesville, Virginia, telling CNN 's Jake Tapper, ""When President Trump condemned racism, bigotry, evil violence, and then took it many steps further and called out neo-Nazis, white supremacists, KKK, that was darn near perfection."""
"Biden comes after Trump, recycles Obama's 'hope' message in first campaign rally",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-comes-after-trump-recycles-obamas-hope-message-in-first-campaign-rally,"Former Vice President Joe Biden used his first campaign rally to squarely target President Donald Trump, and to embrace his status as an ""Obama-Biden"" Democrat by using the former president's message of ""hope.""
Biden officially entered the 2020 Democratic presidential primary late last week, and unlike most of the other candidates, he has focused his attention more on President Trump than on his primary opponents.
""The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself,"" Biden told the Scranton, Pa. audience. ""Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. And I believe — I believe in hope. We have to let them know who we are. We Democrats, we independents who have the same view have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, and most importantly truth over lies.""
Biden is, interestingly, also using some of the same messaging as President Trump used in 2016. Biden is trying to portray himself as a friend to the working and middle class voters, decrying policies that allegedly benefit the wealthy while leaving everyday Americans behind.
He framed President Trump's tax cuts as one of those policies that has overlooked the middle class, and also aligned himself with labor unions. President Trump took notice of Biden's rally and responded on Twitter.
""I'll never get the support of Dues Crazy union leadership, those people who rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues, medical and other expenses while being paid a fortune,"" Trump wrote. ""But the members love Trump. They look at our record economy, tax & reg cuts, military etc. WIN!
""The Media (Fake News) is pushing Sleepy Joe hard,"" the president continued. ""Funny, I'm only here because of Biden & Obama. They didn't do the job and now you have Trump, who is getting it done—big time!""
Biden has been considered a front-runner in the Democratic primary, polling as a leader along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for months."

The sticker at the Gross Burgers restaurant points to writing in Arabic and says, ""If you can't read this, thank a Marine.""
Some took it to foment racial animus against Muslims and others.
""F*** Grossburgers. Absolutely disgusting,"" read one comment on Facebook.
""If you can read it, thank yourself for being a multicultural human and not a xenophobic garbage human,"" read another irate commenter.
Brad Gross, the owner of the restaurant, responded to the accusations by noting that many in the community supported his message.
""The bumper sticker has been in my restaurant for more than a decade from a Marine that served in Iraq,"" he explained to WCIA.
""He brought it in and asked me to put it up, and I said sure go ahead and put it up and it's been there for all these years,"" he added.
According to one customer angry about the sticker, the manager told them they would ""certainly not"" be taking the sticker down.

Cop: Suspect 'butt dialed 911.' Then police receive Best Buy alarm call. It gets even better.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cop-suspect-butt-dialed-911-then-police-receive-best-buy-alarm-call-it-gets-even-better,"Things started off suspiciously enough.
Police in Sugar Land, Texas, got a cellphone call around 3 a.m. Saturday — but no one was speaking on the other end of the line, KPRC-TV reported .
Image source: KTRK-TV video screenshot
Then police pinged the cellphone's location, it turned out to be coming from a local Best Buy, the station said.
It got a bit more interesting a few minutes later when police were notified of a burglary alarm at the same store, KPRC said.
Turns out, one officer said, that the first call came from a suspect who ""somehow butt dialed 911"" — which certainly made things easier for cops.
Image source: KTRK-TV video screenshot
What happened next? Officers were en route to the Best Buy and ""put it all together,"" the officer told KPRC, adding that the same Best Buy was broken into three weeks ago, which resulted in a car chase — but cops didn't catch the suspects.
This time, things were different.
After arriving at the scene, police said three burglars high tailed it away and sent them on a 40-minute chase, the station said. KTRK-TV said the chase reached speed of 120 mph.
Houston officers joined in — and help also came from a police helicopter and K-9s, the officer told KPRC.
The chase ended in northeast Houston when the suspects bailed out of the getaway truck — which police believe was stolen — and ran along a bayou, the station said.
Two of the three suspects were captured, KPRC said. The officer added to the station that Best Buy laptops and electronics were found inside the truck."
Mark Zuckerberg creates 'sleep box' for his wife because 'being a mom is hard',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-sleep-box-for-wife,"Mark Zuckerberg has created a ""sleep box"" to help his wife Priscilla Chan get more sleep because ""being a mom is hard,"" the Facebook CEO wrote on the social media platform.
""Being a mom is hard, and since we've had kids Priscilla has had a hard time sleeping through the night,"" Zuckerberg, 34, wrote Saturday, alongside a photo of his invention. ""She'll wake up and check the time on her phone to see if the kids might wake up soon, but then knowing the time stresses her out and she can't fall back asleep. So I worked on building her what I call the 'sleep box.' ""
The wooden box lets her know whether or not she should go back to sleep or if one of them should get up and check on their daughters, Maxima, 3, and August, 1.
How does it work? The box, which sits on Chan's nightstand, doesn't display the time. Instead, a soft light shines between 6 and 7 a.m.
""It sits on her nightstand, and between the hours of 6-7 am it emits a very faint light — visible enough that if she sees it she'll know it's an okay time for one of us to get the kids, but faint enough that the light won't wake her up if she's still sleeping,"" the billionaire continued.
If the 34-year-old pediatrician wakes up in the middle of the night, she can go back to sleep without knowing the time.
""So far this has worked better than I expected and she can now sleep through the night,"" he wrote. ""As an engineer, building a device to help my partner sleep better is one of the best ways I can think of to express my love and gratitude.""
What else? At the end of his post, Zuckerberg tossed out an offer to allow someone to take his idea and ""run"" with it.
""A bunch of my friends have told me they'd want something like this, so I'm putting this out there in case another entrepreneur wants to run with this and build sleep boxes for more people!"" he wrote.
The post that has garnered more than 13,000 comments and nearly 10,000 shares."

A doctor was trying to save synagogue shooting victims—then tragically realizes his wife was one of them,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-doctor-was-trying-to-save-synagogue-shooting-victims-then-tragically-realizes-his-wife-was-one-of-them,"Dr. Howard Kaye was at Chabad of Poway synagogue with his family when Saturday's shooting occurred. In the aftermath, the physician was called upon to treat injured victims.
He was overwhelmed and devastated when he went to perform CPR on a woman and discovered it was his wife, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune . He then fainted.
Lori Gilbert Kaye was killed in the shooting. According to Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, Kaye threw her body in front of him, shielding him from bullets and saving his life — giving her own in the process. Her sacrifice allowed the rabbi to safely escort a group of young children out of danger.
""In my own interpretation, Lori took the bullet for all of us,"" Goldstein said. ""She died to protect all of us. This is Lori. This is her legacy, and her legacy will continue. It could have been so much worse.""
Goldstein said when he re-entered the synagogue, he saw Howard and Lori Kaye on the ground, and their 22-year-old daughter screaming at the horrific scene. He called it ""the most heart-wrenching sight"" he had ever witnessed.
According to other members of the synagogue and those who knew Lori Kaye, she had a reputation for kindness and good deeds, leaving no one surprised that she would have been willing to sacrifice herself to save others.
""God picked her to die to send a message because she's such an incredible person, "" said Dr. Roneet Lev, a friend of Kaye's. ""He took her for a higher purpose to send this message to fight anti-Semitism.""
Kaye was the only one killed by the gunman, 19-year-old John T. Earnest. Three others were wounded.
Earnest is currently being held without bond on a charge of first-degree murder and three counts of first-degree attempted murder for the crime, which according to his own words was motivated by a deep and violent anti-Semitism.

According to Crowder, YouTube flagged his ""Dr. Trump"" parody for copyright infringement, placing Crowder's channel in jeopardy of being permanently removed.
""I know that you hear a lot about shadow banning, demonetization, or a lot of Chicken Littles out there, but I do want to at least inform you in case this channel goes away for good as to why,"" Crowder said.
Crowder explained that his ""Dr. Trump"" parody video received the three strikes within the span of one week, prompting YouTube to flag the video, which could potentially lead to a permanent ban.
According to Crowder, YouTube claims they want conservatives on their platform because it promotes ""a healthy discussion,"" but has banned, demonetized and restricted his ""Change my Mind"" videos on several occasions in the past.
Crowder said if demonetizing his videos would solve the issue, then YouTube should demonetize them, adding that he created # MugClub so that his content doesn't end up at the mercy of big tech.

""We found a 'blueprint' for how to take over a country,"" Jason explained. ""[How to] do it legally within the range of their own system, within the range of their own Constitution, Congress, everything, and take over their country.""
The discovered document dates back to the late 1940s and, according to Jason, gives a step-by step breakdown on how to take over a free market republic and flip it to socialism then to communism.
""There were about five different steps that they needed to pull off ... and by the end of it they would have completely flipped a country from a capitalist democracy to full-on socialism to communism,"" Jason explained. He noted that as he read through the document he realized that several of the steps are already happening or have happened in America.
Glenn added the ""frightening"" document specifies a time frame of only three years.
""Something's happening, something's wrong, and it's happening faster and faster, and getting crazier and crazier. That's what this blueprint describes, and shows how it's done,"" Glenn said. ""And it's all being done to us right now.

WTF MSM!? Brian Stelter proves he’s just a propagandist with this wildly inaccurate take on Trump’s anti-infanticide comments,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/wtf-msm-brian-stelter-proves-hes-just-a-resistance-propagandist,"Wildly inaccurate take on infanticide … On Saturday night, President Donald Trump offered counter-programming to the White House Correspondents' Association dinner. During that event, Trump said that Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's version of infanticide wouldn't come to pass under his watch . That's when the #Resistance's chief propagandist, CNN media critic/cheerleader Brian Stelter, weighed in, straight-up falsely claiming that Trump lied about what currently happens.
This was classic Stelter, claiming that a Republican lied when he clearly didn't.
It is absolutely clear from watching the entire video of Trump's remarks that Trump was talking about proposals Democrats like Northam actually stated. Trump began this segment of his speech by saying, ""They're aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb, right up until to the moment of birth.""
During the speech, Trump focused on Northam's remarks by saying, ""The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully, and then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby. I don't think so.""
This is clearly a paraphrasing of Northam's remarks on the radio . This was not a ""wildly false claim"" by Trump, as Stelter said it was . It was a pledge to not let what Northam described happen.
Stelter's remarks proved once again that he's not a reporter, he's not a media critic, and most importantly, he's not an honest broker of facts. Stelter is a propagandist for the #Resistance in the mainstream media against Trump.
Laughably praising fact-checking … Over the weekend, the Washington Post bragged about finding the 10,000th ""misleading"" Trump claim. So Stelter had the Post's lead ""fact-checker,"" Glenn Kessler, on his television program to take a celebratory lap . In his newsletter Sunday evening , Stelter lamented that ""untold millions of people won't believe the Post's research."" Because of course only the gatekeepers at the Post know the real truth.
It's telling that Stelter's comments about Kessler appear right above his own massively misleading passage on Trump and his infanticide comments. To Stelter and his allies in the #Resistance, there is only one truth, and that is that Donald Trump is a singular threat to society, so anything you say about him is fair game.
Rampant anti-Semitism … In California, a 19-year-old man allegedly walked into a synagogue at the end of Passover and opened fire , killing one before his rampage was stopped by congregants. The New York Times had to apologize for a blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon of Bibi Netanyahu and President Trump .
These two incidents can be seen against the backdrop of a stunning rise in anti-Semitism both here in the United States and worldwide. Of course, Brian Stelter was quick to blame the shooting on ""right-wing message boards."" But the recent uptick in anti-Semitism comes from a variety of places, including the Times.
Blaze Media's Jordan Schachtel writes in his newsletter, ""The Dossier,"" that the anti-Semitic tropes about Jews controlling the world that the shooter allegedly wrote about were also explored in a Politico article in 2017 . Schachtel noted, ""The piece circulated the internet widely, and it was promoted by the likes of top 'journalists' at the New York Times and Washington Post.""
Then, of course, there's Rep. Ilhan Omar's use of anti-Semitic phrasing over and over again, which Stelter, of course, has downplayed .
Are there anti-Semites on the right? Yes. But there are also virulent anti-Semites on the left. Oh, and about that New York Times apology? After the publication of the first cartoon, the New York Times International Edition published another anti-Semitic cartoon of Bibi Netanyahu .

"Professor calls unborn babies ‘legitimate parasite,’ compares them to cancer",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-unborn-babies-parasite-cancer,"A professor at the University of California San Diego's School of Medicine drew outrage on social media after reportedly comparing unborn human babies to parasites, cancers, and more.
What are the details? According to Campus Reform , a photo of one of the professor's slides made its way onto Twitter, where it sparked anger in many social media users.
The slide, photographed by user Dylan Griswold, explained ""parallels between fetuses and cancers.""
The slide stated that fetuses are similar to cancers in that the fetus — a ""legitimate parasite"" — ""rapidly grows, invades, manipulates [the] immunity of [the] mother"" and ""reshapes blood vessels.""
Cancer, the slide said, ""crashes the party"" and is also responsible for the aforementioned effects.
Griswold, a Stanford medical student, captioned the tweet, ""No joke, a friend just sent me this slide from her upper-level biology course. I'm speechless. Create your own caption.""
Campus Reform was able to obtain the full presentation, which was reportedly titled, ""Evolution of Human Disease.""
What else? Griswold told the outlet that it's important to place priority on mothers and unborn children, protecting the rights of both.
""In a country where abortion on demand/till birth is becoming the norm, it becomes increasingly important to recognize both the dignity of both the mother and her unborn child,"" Griswold said. ""This slide, while intended to show similar mechanisms of invasive processes, both implicitly and explicitly pathologizes pregnancy.""
""It is no wonder why Planned Parenthood performs over 300,000 abortions each year — we treat pregnancy as a disease to be avoided at any cost — often at the highest expense: the life of an unborn child,"" Griswold added."
"Stephen Hicks: philosopher, highwayman",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/profile/stephen-hicks-and-the-philosophy-of-everything,"I took a trip offshore. Took the whip offshore. — Rae Sremmurd The philosopher navigates from the passenger seat of our Mazda CX-3 as we cross Stone Arch Bridge in deepening afternoon, over the North Mississippi with its polluted blue water.
""Everything is connected,"" he says. ""Everything has implications.""
When he talks, he floats his hands. Throughout the day, random objects will fumble toward him: a pen, a button, a coaster. Each time, he will snatch them before anything falls.
""I think language first should be cognitive, connecting your mind to reality,"" he says. ""What are you trying to communicate? How are you trying to connect with people?""
His work has been published in 16 languages, on every inhabitable continent. He's the influence behind the influence. His ideas guide some the most renowned (and often most controversial) thinkers of our time. Jordan Peterson has heartily endorsed the philosopher's most well-known book, and has even been known to hoist it into the air while saying ""you need to read this! I'm not kidding!""
The philosopher travels all over the world giving lectures, and has served as an honorary professor at multiple universities, including Georgetown and Oxford. Recently, during a stint at the University of Kasimir the Great in Poland, he toured Auschwitz and Treblinka Concentrations camps. It was January, and the air at Treblinka was frigid.
""Auschwitz, the older part, was worse,"" he says, ""with its torture chambers and execution wall and evil-looking gas chamber."" He tried to imagine how prisoners survived in that relentless cold. ""Overwhelming to be where humans did such brutal acts upon other human beings.""
Last week, at the annual Atlas Society Gala in New York City, he donned a tuxedo and gave a speech about superheroes and said that young people are full of undiscovered good. Today, he spoke at a regional conference held by Students for Liberty (SFL), an international nonprofit for students devoted to libertarian and classical liberal values.
Ep. 15 Dr. Stephen Hicks | The Glenn Beck Podcast youtu.be
""You could say there are two types of people,"" he says. ""There are those who are true believers in whatever narrow set of readings and ideology that they've been exposed to, and they just want to be activists — but there is a lot of nihilism in these sub-circles as well, and they're deeply resentful, and it's not just a political resentment, it seems to be a resentment against reality.""
He adds that Jean-Jacques Rousseau's socialist ideology led to the French Revolution, and isn't it incredible yet terrifying that ideas can provoke a revolution to begin with?
Then he wanders back to the subject of post-World War II philosophy before he can describe the second type of person, but, as the months unfold in my reporting, as this story drifts along, the second type of person will emerge. Wide-eyed, the philosopher keeps the posture of a well-mannered child at a piano lesson. Clean-shaven, smooth-featured, 6-or-so feet tall, 58 years young, distinguishably thin— a safe 15 pounds from the scrawniness of a young David Byrne — with a black woolen sweater tied in a Parisian knot around his shoulders, he talks at a steady pace, not rushing but not wasting time. He trenches so deeply into descriptions of Existentialism that he keeps forgetting to look at the GPS on his phone, and we veer off in every direction.
* Philosopher Stephen Hicks thrives on information. Art, economics, religion, humor, language. One conversation, he talks about trade unions. Next, the Lake District Poets and their sad, still music of humanity. Next, the four forces of physics. Next, predictions about geopolitical relations, concerning-but-not-limited-to:
the ethnic solidarity of Russian Slavism, the wild-card potential of India, the illusion of free-market liberalism in China (""When push comes to shove, where will the Chinese end up?""), and the possibility of what he describes as ""a resurgent, smart-people-on-the-right repackaging some sort of authoritarianism rightism that will be a 21-Century fascism."" Hicks during his appearance on the Glenn Beck Podcast Photo by Kevin Ryan
In a phone interview, Khalil Habib, associate professor of Philosophy at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island, described Hicks' ability to make connections: ""It's always, 'Here's a great figure, and here's why they matter, and how they have mattered in our lives.'""
During a lecture on Marxism, Hicks might allude to Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot,"" a strange play about two men at a crossroads. Maybe he'll use a quotation from Apple founder Steve Jobs to explain the notoriously convoluted arguments of German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Hicks' website is a veritable treasure trove of ideas. Video lectures, guided notes, audiobooks, translations, book reviews, PowerPoints, and, most recently, his podcast series, ""Open College with Dr. Stephen Hicks."" He even provides materials from the courses he's taught, an entire PhD worth of philosophy. There are links to the documents, poems, short stories, essays, and articles that he deems valuable — all the primary sources — and a page with quotations about the meaning of life, compiled with the everyman spirit that defines Hicks overall. Lines from ""Dust in the Wind"" by Kansas next to a passage from Psalms and excerpts from a speech by author John Steinbeck, comedian Robin Williams and ""Macbeth"" and philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, all in the one place.
But Hicks is best known for his book "" Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault ,"" which has become a handbook for critiquing early postmodernism — the vast, web-like political and cultural movement that emerged from 1960s French literary theory, guided by rebellion, by protest and skepticism and a rejection of institutions and a distrust for the status quo and the world of tradition. Postmodernism is driven by the notion that objective truth does not exist, or at least not the way it used to.
For Hicks, truth does exist. Reason does exist.
In ""Explaining Postmodernism"" he argues that our understanding of shared life — technology, economics, science, politics, language, art, taste — is shaped by philosophy, so the dominant philosophy, in Hicks' view postmodernism, has the potential to harm society. As he sees it: skepticism, nihilism, relativism. He believes that you can replace bad ideas with good ideas, and that as a result human life as a whole will improve.
In an email, Eduardo Marty, founder and executive director of the Argentina branch of Junior Achievement, described Hicks as ""one of the few able to discover intellectual mistakes that laid deep down at the bottom of our culture."" Hicks is optimistic about the future of humankind, our collective potential to face reality, to maintain faith in one another, to find beauty and create art. He counters what he sees as the nullity of postmodernism by tracing the history of philosophy.
""The problem with politicization is that drawing out those political implications much too quickly, and not being aware that there are other forks in the roads and other alternatives that one can pursue,"" Hicks says. ""And then also the other problem is starting with the politics, and just using the philosophy and everything else as a cover story or a rationalization for political conclusions that you want to get to anyways — that's probably the bigger sin.""
In an email, Kevin Hill, associate professor of Philosophy at Portland State University, described Hicks as a defender of the idea that philosophy actually matters: ""That the ideas of the great philosophers, for better or worse, eventually have enormous effects on all aspects of life."" Eduardo Marty added that ""civilization and modern life have more chances of survival after Stephen's book."" The adage goes something like, ""academia is upstream of culture, and culture is upstream of politics,"" i.e. theory leads action that leads to policy which inspires new theory, ad nauseam.
Many of the reviews of ""Explaining Postmodernism"" are as steeped in academic jargon as you might imagine. But one reviewer said it well:
""This is not a purely historical work. It is also a critique, and in many places it is vigorously polemical. Hicks makes a commendable effort to provide a balanced account of the philosophers he discusses, but his emphasis is clearly on aspects of their thought of greatest relevance to the development of postmodernism. In any case, it takes courage for a philosopher at an American university to say some of the things Hicks says in this book. ""Explaining Postmodernism"" is read more outside than inside academia, so, as a friend of Hicks put it, Hicks ""has made a cultural impact far beyond the impact that most academic philosophers ever have,"" largely because academic philosophers tend to talk to each other exclusively.
Meaning, Hicks resides in the weird territory between academia and the mainstream. But it's a natural harmony for him. All his life, he's hovered between the world of ideas and the world of grit and ordinary commotion. His mother was pregnant at 17. She and Hicks's dad were just out of high school. Occasionally, they had to raid the couch for loose coins.

Hicks grew up surrounded by books: his mom more interested in literature, his dad more of a ""hard-headed entrepreneurial businessman."" In his late teens, Hicks worked at an iron foundry in Ontario. Glass furnaces. Eddying, torrid waterfalls of orange-gray muck. He admired the way liquid iron — boiling and deadly — can be molded, re-shaped into whatever you want.
— ""It's not like we're actually in the Cold War, where there's nuclear weapons pointed at us."" — At night, at home, he read everything he could.
Then came the oil boom in Western Canada, when there was a need for, in his words, ""ignorant kids who would get paid well for dangerous labor."" He made good money roughnecking. Bought a motorcycle. Then he traveled around Europe and North Africa. When he describes Morocco and its narrow market lanes and calibrated ruins and wavering sand, a calm wideness overtakes his pupils.
While taking night classes, Hicks spent two years at construction companies around Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. He loved carpentry. He found concrete fascinating. Felt like a kid in a sandbox, sculpting formless mud into something permanent, something solid, something that makes highways and sidewalks and roads.
* ""The postmoderns are smart,"" Hicks says, on his second coffee. ""They're connected, they're organized. They have the awesome financial resources that can be marshaled in the U.S. and Canada at their disposal. They're loud, there's lots of them, and they are in positions of cultural importance, in a lot of the institutions that they are dominating.""
Obstacle one: postmodernism is head-spinningly dense and elusive. In its three generations, it has evolved into a multitude of differing, often-contradictory forms, making it nearly impossible to define. Many on the left and in academia insist that postmodernism is dead and that there is no such thing as a postmodernist anymore, only a boogeyman fabricated by conservatives who have a grudge against academia, which they consider leftist, rooted in hostile attribution bias.
Others claim that, while postmodernism is dead within academia, it survives in practice via activism, politics, and art. (Or vice versa: that it still holds sway among the professoriate, but practical postmodernism is nonexistent.) Others still claim that postmodernism has sewn itself into every aspect of life, has become so powerful that we can't even see it anymore, despite its being everywhere. According to the tenets of postmodernism, all the above assertions are correct. But also not.
Jean-Francois Lyotard, the first official postmodernist, defined ""postmodernism"" as ""incredulity towards meta-narratives,"" i.e. the explanation behind any system, theory, belief, or movement that claims to have a solution or answer for everything. Freudianism, religion, capitalism, Marxism. Even Philosophy ... including postmodernism, i.e., it denounces itself in its own definition. But is that any stranger or more chaotic than everyday life has become? When's the last time you looked at the world and thought, ""all of this makes perfect sense""? We live in a postmodern world. For postmodern reasons. As humans, we've reached a level of awareness that constantly topples us. This is partly what early postmodern philosopher Michel Foucault meant when he described man as ""a recent invention.""

Hicks rejects any such allure. He sees postmodernism as a purely negative force.
""If you're a skeptic, then all you're left with is various kinds of subjective values,"" he says, ""[so that] nobody can ground their values. Language itself becomes a tool, which they need for confrontation. They use it as a weapon. And anyone who is an enemy — an ideological enemy or a political enemy — you want weapons that will put people on the defensive.""
This idea, that postmodernists will say anything (e.g. ""postmodernism doesn't exist, it's a right-wing conspiracy theory""), hurls us into the ultimate liar's paradox: who do we trust? It's ""Alice in Wonderland"" played out every day using shade and conjecture. The solution, according to Hicks, is ""a lot of good, healthy activism of the right sort.""
Over the past few decades, there has been plenty of this activism, as various scholars have protested and confronted postmodernism using the academic equivalent of a Sacha Baron Cohen prank. In 1996, physics professor Alan Sokal successfully Trojan-horsed into a peer-reviewed postmodern journal with an article claiming that gravity is a social construct.
More recently: the ""Grievance Studies affair"" — scholars Peter Boghossian, James Lindsay, and Helen Pluckrose targeted academic journals in the fields of gender studies, queer studies, fat studies, and something called ""feminist geography."" Their articles examine female penises, ""fat bodybuilding,"" ""breastraunt masculinity,"" and canine rape culture/""queer performativity"" among dogs. Elsewhere, they argued that the solution to ""trans-hysteria"" is the sexual act of pegging. In another, titled, ""Our Struggle is My Struggle,"" they translated passages of Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" into postmodern feminist lingo.
Like Hicks, like so many other postmodern critics, they use versions of the word ""liberal"" to describe themselves, and, while far from conservative, they have found the center-left, center, center-right, and right to be oddly welcoming as of late, and the far-left and far-right to be ugly and loud.
""Liberals are suddenly feeling the need to distinguish themselves from progressives,"" Hicks says. ""Because progressives are one step closer to a sort of authoritarianism. But the progressives are saying, 'no no no, we need to distinguish ourselves from the postmodernists. Because if we're progressives on the left we actually believe in equality and justice and these are real values and government authorities should do good work.' So they're still arguing on realist grounds for that chunk of the political spectrum. Whereas the postmoderns are saying, 'everything is crap, there is no truth, there is no justice.""
When I spoke with Boghossian and Lindsay, they both eagerly noted that Helen Pluckrose's work complements Hicks' to give a full diagram of postmodernism. Hicks' ""Explaining Postmodernism"" examines the philosophy's predecessors and its early days, then hands it off to Pluckrose, who traces postmodernism through the '80s and '90s, as it splintered and grew.
In an email, Pluckrose spoke fondly of Hicks: ""I think he connects the politics to Marxism a bit too neatly but even there, he is nuanced and acknowledges that postmodernism replaced Marxism for many and isn't really a continuation of it."" She added that the point of postmodernism is to take things apart, not build them. ""It will destroy itself at some point,"" she wrote, ""but it can do much damage to society before that happens.""
— ""Anything that holds out any possibility for positivity in the world, or in the next world, just does not speak to them. For them, the goal is a matter of shutting down an alien psychological and intellectual framework."" — Hicks considers postmodernism the major intellectual threat of our time.
""At the same I step back sometimes and say, the enemies that we're facing right now are relatively small and shabby, by historical comparison,"" he adds. ""It's not like we are in the 1930s, going through a Depression, and it's not like we're in the 1940s and we're actually fighting the Nazis and the Japanese and their huge war machines. It's not like we're actually in the Cold War, where there's nuclear weapons pointed at us.""
Hicks' critics are almost uniformly — and vocally — left-leaning, and tend to be the same people who criticize psychology professor and author Jordan Peterson. They seem to hate that he aligns with Objectivism, the capitalist philosophy created by Ayn Rand. (Interestingly, Hicks said in an email that Rand receives criticism from both the far-left and the far-right.)
For the most part, his fellow academics have praised his work, at times exuberantly. But, as has become the norm, social media reactions have less nuance. A sign of the times that the most vociferous responses to Hicks' work appear online, in bombastic posts by armchair philosophers — anonymous, of course — whose qualifications (""I minored in philosophy"" or ""I have two bookshelves for books by and about Kant alone"") are as shabby as their invective is pompous. They weirdly match Hicks' definition of modern-day postmodernists better than anyone else.
Mostly, though, people have positive things to say. Call it the Jordan Peterson effect. Either praise or venom, no in-between. All bad or all good. Interpretation, in other words. Because how can something be true and untrue at the same time? How can the same passages of the book be considered false by one group yet faultless by another?
""The facts of reality exist,"" Hicks says. ""But truth — the cognitive grasp of the facts — takes effort.""
For Hicks, this is a human effort, and it encompasses everything. For example, earlier, on this mid-October Saturday, at the Hilton on Marquette Avenue in Minneapolis, Hicks cramped into a bony-necked chair at a high-top smushed against the wall, 20 feet from a breakfast buffet, and pricked at a mound of eggs and toast and sausage as he spoke about the nasty critics of singer-songwriter Bob Seger.
""I think there should be a benevolence: 'Look at this wonderful thing that we share.' But then for some people, in the social one-upmanship, pecking order becomes more important to them than the foundational love of music that they all share,"" he said. Hicks, always on the prowl for meaning, is even able to philosophize about the man who sings ""Like a Rock"" in the Chevy commercials.
* Since 9 a.m. , attendees of the Students for Liberty conference have occupied the second floor of Tate Hall, a sleek medical building full of eye-wash stations and laboratories. As soon as Hicks arrives at the card-table check-in that is covered with name tags, a young woman in a prim beige dress and a young man in a box-like suit wave and smile deferentially and shake Hicks' hand and say ""thank you, thank you so much for coming, thank you,"" then lead him down a weave of yellowish stairs and out a backdoor, giving him the rundown as they pace to the broad stairway of an adjacent building, where a hundred-odd students are posed for a group photo.
Back inside, students flood into a classroom that serves as the conference hub. Oblong tables crowd with books and supplemental reading and pamphlets of every size and quality, including none other than the Constitution of the United States of America. There are rows of booths. Republican Liberty Caucus, with yards signs that say ""Vote Republican"" in aggressive red. Minnesota Campaign for Full Legalization (weed). Ladies of Liberty Alliance. Atlas Society. And lots of Libertarians, some of whom happen to be the only people in attendance you could call shaggy.

The room designated for Hicks' talk is clearly meant for chemistry classes: All the chairs face a long smooth table with sinks and microscopes and notecards smeared with pudgy, handwritten formulas. Hicks chats with the conference organizer/Regional Director Charlie Gers, who ran as the sole Libertarian candidate in the 2017 Minneapolis mayoral election. He lost, but he's still barely 23 years old. And he has the calm disposition of someone twice his age. He'll be fine! Then ""The Moral Case for Liberal Capitalism"" appears on two giant screens at each side of the comically long whiteboard and Hicks begins. Never has a group of students been as penitent and respectful! Like 45 minutes of church, it felt like. And all looking sharp in their suits and dresses.
The entire scene complicates the ongoing debate about the state of academia. For people on the right, this gathering of politically-diverse young people proves the ""silent majority"" narrative, a confirmation that anti-conservative bias in academia is real, so real that conservative students feel the need to gather in safety. For people on the left, it could serve as a counterargument to the conservative narrative that leftist operatives masquerading as professors have seized higher education in order to indoctrinate young people, organizing into a cult-like social force with a radically leftist purview. Sure, the data indicate that professors have gotten far more liberal. But nobody can agree on what this means exactly. Either way, the civility of today's conference — no protesters, no yelling, no tantrums, no petitions — feels encouraging. Suppose it's a sign that the bickering is almost over, that divisiveness is on the wane, that hatred is losing power, that politics is receding, that life as we knew it might even resume.
* After the speech , a crowd gathers around Hicks, and one student head-down shoves his way to the front like a linebacker.
""I'm a socialist,"" he says, then hoists a few accusations at Hicks, who hardly blinks as the student twitches his words. Then Hicks tells the student that he learned about socialism by studying economics, history, philosophy, ethics, but do you know how most socialists learn about socialism? Yes, through romantic notions, cinematic fantasies, maybe a flighty biography of Che, and meanwhile wouldn't they be the first to starve?
The student wants to argue against loyalties to truth. Hicks is having none of it. He challenges the student for contradicting himself, then, leaning down a bit, says, ""See, now that's the third time you've backtracked and completely reneged and, I have to wonder, what exactly do you stand for?""
* Kevin Hill described Hicks's public demeanor as reminiscent of Mister Spock, from ""Star Trek."" Not that he is ""suppressing his emotions in some stoical sense, but in his unflappableness, his reasonableness, and a wry, amused sense of irony,"" and that he ""is fired by a tremendous moral passion."" In my reporting, I encountered metaphors like these a lot. Khalil Habib admires ""the way that Stephen reasons with you like a calm parent, explaining to you why putting your finger in the light socket is just not really in your best interest. And he just walks you through very soberly those ideas.""
Back in the car, facing the blue-grooved silhouette of Minneapolis, I ask Hicks about the socialist student. Hicks says he tends to give students the benefit of the doubt.
""When you're 18-to-22, in many cases you've had a partial education, and that's fine, but you should be trying out all these ideas and almost any political ideology can be given a nice initial spin. If you're open-minded and that's the first one you hear, then it makes sense that you'd be attracted to it and you'd want to explore it further, then you start looking at the world from that lens. That's also what a university education should be doing, is putting you in contact with people who have other ideologies, so you have to do the compare-and-contrast, and if you're a professor that's what you live for.""
He reclines in thought, in his purple-chalk dress shirt and tailored suit but no tie and his black leather boots that zip up at the sides and his Danjue Leather satchel.
""I think he'll be fine. It didn't strike me that he was attracted to socialism for the wrong reasons, it's not like he wanted to be a Stalinist, he just hasn't thought it through,"" Hicks says.
Then he talks about the importance of meaning. He finds meaning in everything. Even the most seemingly mundane events.
""Everything is connected,"" he says, as we cross Stone Arch Bridge. ""Everything has implications.""
He points out at the open sky, hatched in grey. What does that mean? Precipitation, of course, but what does it mean on a deeper level? This morning, the weather was biting and quick like Spring. Then, it got warmer, and now it falls into evening. Tomorrow, snow will blanket the entire city, the entire upper hulk of North America. Yet, the snow won't be winter-like or deathly or confining. It will not signify an end. The same thing will happen when Hicks and I meet a month later, and he'll smile a little crosswise and say, ""Again? It must be a sign.""
* Slumped in gaudy chairs in the hotel lobby, we wait around, 30 minutes until the SFL social. Hicks has been philosophizing for 10 hours now. Dark light murmurs through the din of people talking. Marble floors bounce each consonant farther. The clatter of plates, the plink of glasses, the 80-decibel blare of ""Mirrors"" by Justin Timberlake. It's an odd setting for a philosopher's session, especially now, as the philosopher is hitting stride, finally cornering the argument he has built all day.
""A certain amount of what has allowed postmodernism to spread as much as it has must to be chalked up to a sort of low-grade cowardice,"" he says. ""You don't want to have to confront people in faculty meetings? or take a stand? Well — especially if you're a tenured professor — what have you got to be afraid of?
""My goodness!
""So we now have a generation of intellectuals who are third- or fourth-generation postmodern, and they're anti -intellectual. Anything that's too difficult for them, they haven't engaged with it, they don't really understand it, and, of course, in addition to their anti-intellectualism, they have a brutalist psychology. Anything that holds out any possibility for positivity in the world, or in the next world, just does not speak to them. For them, the goal is a matter of shutting down an alien psychological and intellectual framework. It's an intellectual and a political territory that they've staked out for themselves, and they know how to check the right boxes, but really they are activists.""
Hicks in 1999, while on sabbatical in New York to write Explaining Postmodernism Courtesy of Stephen Hicks
He pauses. ""Confronting power is also an important theme of the Western tradition. Reflecting on power, reflecting on authority, and the whole idea that questioning authority and jealously guarding prerogatives or rightness — that whatever power is in play, it ultimately needs to be grounded in a respect for human individuality, human dignity. So speaking truth to power, challenging authority, being willing to revolt, rise up radically against authority when it's wrong — I'm entirely in favor of all of that. But they have to be in the service of truth, in the service of justice, goodness, and so forth. So that then is to say, if you think there are such things as universal principles that are true and just, that you then have every right to challenge those who are in positions of power.
""But, with the postmodernists, you end up with a naked power struggle which comes out in the most ugly form in the victim movement as 'The powers that be have abused us, and victimized us,' and s ometimes there are large grains of truth in those claims . But when you convert victimization into your primary trump card, and you think that gives you the moral right to do anything that you want in response, then it becomes transparent. Because you over-exaggerate your victimization, and the purpose of that is to give a pretend justification for the kinds of power plays that you're going to engage in. I think the game becomes transparent when the previously self-identified victims then get into positions of power and become terribly authoritarian and politically correct in the worst ways, which always indicates that a commitment to protecting the vulnerable and the weak is not really what's driving them.
""This is why I think Jonathan Haidt, Steven Pinker, Jordan Peterson and others, and if I can include myself in that company — we're all on the same side. And the issue is being an enlightenment liberal against a postmodern authoritarian. And the 'enlightenment' part is a bottom-line respect for reality, and reason, and both of those are being jettisoned by the postmoderns, who are anti -realistic, anti -reason. And then the 'liberal' is in that broad, classically-liberal sense. So that while Haidt would describe himself as an American liberal; Pinker puts himself more on the liberal left; Jordan Peterson, I think he's understandably cagey about a lot of his political views, but he strikes me as a little more culturally conservative; and then I'm more libertarian.
""But all of those political differences are just an internal argument in a classically-liberal individualistic framework that we all have. And all that's against what is very clearly an authoritarian, 'take-it-to-the-streets', 'punch-people-in-the-face' left.""
* Breeze drifts past a runaway sky. The last scud of day. The pale, tepid final winnows of day.
In the car, as we glide toward the SFL social, Hicks talks about Albert Camus, the moody French philosopher who was obsessed with death and suicide but who came around, then died in a car accident at 46. With a gasp, I flinch, then splinter the wheel to the left to avoid an animal carcass in the road, unalterably red and barely larger than a squirrel. Then, we turn, and a vibrant clutch of oak trees sharpens together like a chapel — call it a heartening coincidence — then opens into the sprawling, ornate campus of the University of Minnesota.
I say it's like a prayer and quote a poem:
you can't beat death but
you can beat death in life, sometimes.
and the more often you learn to do it,
the more light there will be. The downstairs portion of Burrito Loco is humid and pitiful. Rankled and useless and lacking in customers, of activity of any kind. Half bar, half Mexican restaurant. Cheap beer on tap. Upstairs — that's where the life is! Most of the SFL conference attendees and staff are there. And as soon as Hicks rounds the stairhead, everyone bobbles their heads toward him and grins. Most people grip some weird pink vodka cocktail — which it turns out is the only complimentary drink available to SFL attendees. Upside is, unlimited refills. Many of the students bobble around with a silly ruddiness, shouting conversationally as they bumper-car from discussions about Austrian economics to plates of fried cheese, then back to the bar for more of that pink stuff.
Hicks is immediately stopped by a 23-year-old-ish guy with his tie loosened. He brought ""Explaining Postmodernism"" and would Hicks mind signing it? As Hicks glides the pen along the blank page, the student chatters and chatters, like a kid describing their favorite movie, only he's talking about Objectivism or something or other. He says, ""Dr. Hicks, you are going to change the world,"" then asks ""What endless problems do we face as a culture?""
""There are two regularities in human experience that strike me,"" Hicks answers. ""Every generation has those who don't think much and so who fall into the same easy mistakes of previous generations. And every generation has those who think much and find clever ways to talk themselves into denying easy truths.""
The student leans into Hicks and shouts over featureless music.
""Yes, yes,"" Hicks replies. ""It's a faith-in-humanity kind of thing. You young people, when you come along, you want to live a real life. You are not yet corrupted. And you are out there, always.""
An hour later, we taper down the planking stairs, through the old world doorway into the cold. The sky lingers in that oversized way when every color has a toe in the pond, full of God's creations. Icy and brittle, the air weighs more than it did earlier, smelling neutral like used dryer sheets."
AOC uses California synagogue shooting to push for a gun control bill that wouldn’t have prevented it,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/aoc-synagogue-gun-control-bill-would-not-have-stopped-it,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has already taken a heap of criticism for, as Republican strategist Arthur Schwartz put it, "" using Jewish blood to push for a vote in the Senate"" in her politicized response to Saturday's synagogue shooting near San Diego.
But the factually challenged substance of her demand was almost as bad as her ghoulish timing.
After a gunman at Chabad of Poway synagogue in California left one dead and three wounded, AOC responded by calling for the Senate to vote on HR 8 , a gun control bill passed by the House earlier this year.
She probably should have waited to get the facts of the shooting, because they show that HR 8 wouldn't have done anything to prevent this atrocity from happening.
HR 8 is a ""universal"" background check bill that merely extends federal background check requirements to private firearms transactions that do not extend across state lines.
While there are still questions about whether or not the features of the modern sporting rifle allegedly used in the shooting were compliant with California regulations, the gun appears to be perfectly legal under federal law.
Even if it wasn't, HR 8 focuses on background check restrictions, not types of guns. And the shooter had reportedly no previous encounters with law enforcement that might have led to something that would have popped up on a NICS check.
And yes, HR 8 is also a back-door, de facto handgun ban for people ages 18-20. But the 19-year-old suspect used a rifle.
It's political moments like this that really highlight the naked reality of the gun debate.
As I've written before , given the current structure of our gun laws at the federal level, there isn't a proposed top-down federal proposal that:
Is a legitimate policy innovation over what's already on the books (i.e. isn't just better enforcement of already existing law or stiffer penalties for breaking it). Passes muster with the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendments. Isn't completely ignorant of how guns work in the first place (e.g., defining ""assault weapons"" by common cosmetic features). Would actually deter or reduce mass shootings or gun violence in quantity or severity, rather than just creating more soft targets — by disarming them — for those who were already going to break the law anyway. We can sit around and theorize about possible piecemeal ""gun safety"" bills that would make politicians and activists feel good while making things more difficult for law-abiding gun owners. But when things get real, that's all those piecemeal measures are likely to do. Once all those measures have been shamelessly promoted, tried, and found wanting, then what?
At that point, the real choices remaining are to realize that real gun safety involves trained and responsible self-defense, or to try to take law-abiding Americans' guns away in a country that owns 40 percent of the world's firearms and where a repeal of the Second Amendment is little more than an anti-gun politician's fever dream .
Indeed, if a politician is going to exploit atrocity to push for her preferred policies, she probably should pick policies that would actually have prevented the atrocity. But the difficulty of that, when it comes to gun control, is finding policies that work to begin with."
Journalist says she 'yelled at a prick with the audacity to wear a f***ing' MAGA hat during concert — and the backlash is bigly,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/journalist-says-she-yelled-at-a-prick-with-the-audacity-to-wear-a-f-ing-maga-hat-during-concert-and-the-backlash-is-bigly,"A sportswriter tweeted Sunday that she ""just yelled at a prick with the audacity to wear a f***ing Make America Great Again hat in the middle of a jazz festival"" — and received major ridicule for her declaration.
The iconic red cap was the symbol of President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and has become a lightning rod for a growing number of those on the left who say the MAGA hat is synonymous with racism, bigotry, and hatred .
Natalie Weiner, a writer for SBNation , appears to have been attending the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival at the time of her tweet. She added in the thread that the MAGA hat-wearer ""doesn't deserve to be within a 10 mile radius"" of singer Irma Thomas, who was performing at the festival.
""I don't understand how people can be so hateful,"" Weiner also noted.
Image source: Twitter, redacted
What did folks think of the journalist's MAGA hat tweet? As of Tuesday morning, Weiner's initial tweet garnered over 800 likes but also 3,500 comments, meaning it was ""ratioed"" — negative Twitter-speak for when replies far outnumber likes.
A cursory glance at those comments indicates that not everybody was down with the journalist's announcement that she yelled at a MAGA hat wearer and called him a ""prick"":
""There's definitely a problem here. It isn't with the guy wearing a hat."" ""Imagine screaming at a stranger in public because of a hat and thinking THEY'RE the hateful one. You're not cool, brave, dignified, or justified in doing this. You're just a c***."" ""'Sports journalists' are the new vanguard of the SJW asshattery."" ""So you were the concert police, who can't seem to have control over yourself when seeing an article of clothing? Now I know why people like you are for control over everything. Newsflash, not everyone is like you. Thank the Lord for that."" ""What a truly putrid series of tweets. You deserve the ratio, you intolerant dullard."" ""I hope you explained to him that jazz concerts are safe spaces, free from the pesky First Amendment."" ""Tolerance at its finest I see."" ""The self-righteousness is nauseating."" ""Nice to see you liberal fascists at work. You make POTUS Trumps re-election more certain by the hour."""
President Trump wants asylum-seekers to pay a fee before their application can be considered,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-wants-asylum-seekers-to-pay-a-fee-before-their-application-can-be-considered,"President Donald Trump has signed a presidential memorandum to make changes to the current system processing asylum applications. This includes requiring asylum-seekers to pay a fee before their application can be considered.
Here's what we know According to a news release issued by the White House on Monday, the new rules would ""[r]equire fees for asylum applications and work permit applications.""
In addition to a fee, the new guidelines would disqualify any asylum-seekers who enter the United States illegally and prevent them from getting work permits. Currently, asylum-seekers are allowed to work while their claims are being processed. It would also orders U.S. officials to process any application for asylum within 180 days. These court proceedings would be streamlined.
U.S. officials will have 90 days to figure out how to implement the new rules.
The president also promised to fix asylum laws. The news release called out asylum-seekers who make ""meritless claims"" in order to enter the United States and ""remain here indefinitely."" ""The biggest loophole drawing illegal aliens to our borders is the use of fraudulent or meritless asylum claims to gain entry into our great country,"" the news release Quote: d the president as saying.
It also said that the U.S. ""immigration system has reached a breaking point.""
The current asylum system has been plagued by backlog , in part because of the increase in the number of people seeking asylum. According to the BBC , more than 800,000 asylum cases are currently being considered in the United States.

The report also found that youth suicides are up 29 percent after Netflix debuted 2017's ""13 Reasons Why"" — a teen-centric drama series based on youth suicides. The series' season finale culminated in a teen — who'd crafted 13 videos explaining why she'd decided to take her life — slitting her wrists in a bathtub and dying.
What are the details? Following the release of the popular Netflix show, the U.S. youth suicide rate was 28.9 percent higher among children ages 10-17 when compared to previous years, according to the study. The surge was primarily attributed to adolescent males, the study found.
Researchers in the study, which was released on Monday and backed by the National Institute of Mental Health, did add that the findings did have limitations and that they could not make a definitive and direct link to the popular Netflix show.
Researchers concluded that their findings ""should serve as a reminder to be mindful of the possible unintended impacts of the portrayal of suicide, and as a call to the entertainment industry and the media to use best practices when engaging with this topic.""
A spokesperson for Netflix told Reuters that they were aware of the study and are in the process of reviewing it.
""It's a critically important topic, and we have worked hard to ensure that we handle this sensitive issue responsibly,"" the spokesperson said.
A third season of the show is in production.
In 2018, Chief Executive Reed Hastings told shareholders that the company would renew the series for a third season.
""'13 Reasons Why' has been enormously popular and successful,"" Hastings boasted. ""It's engaging content. It is controversial. But nobody has to watch it.""
Anything else? In 2017, two families blamed the hit Netflix show for the suicides of their respective teens.
Two 15-year-old girls from two different families committed suicide following screenings of the show. One of the teens' moms said that the show was basically offering up a blueprint for suicide.
Both families voiced their disgust with the fact that the network decided to continue airing the controversial show.
A few months after the girls took their own lives, web searches on how to commit suicide spiked . A study found that in the 19 days after the show's debut, internet searches for ""suicide"" shot up 20 percent.
In 2018, parents blamed the show for another teen suicide, and demanded that Netflix pull the show from its streaming library altogether."
Students learn their socialist savior Bernie Sanders is actually a millionaire. They don’t react well. - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/students-learn-bernie-sanders-is-a-millionaire,"Campus Reform's Cabot Phillips visited the campus of the University of New Hampshire in Durham, New Hampshire, to tell students that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is a millionaire.
Many of the students were disappointed to find that the senator and presidential candidate had such big bucks, and some even went as far as to call Sanders a ""hypocrite.""
Here are some of the more interesting responses below:
""You have a ton of extra money that you could be shoveling out, but you're gonna take it away from people who might actually need it?"" ""I think it is very hypocritical."" ""I had no idea."" ""He doesn't seem like the type."" ""That definitely sounds hypocritical to be advocating for those type of things but to also be a millionaire."" ""He's constantly preaching about the, you know, billionaires and millionaires being the problem, but he himself is one."" ""[Sanders] is just like a classic career politician, I feel like obviously he's got to be a millionaire."" ""He's the 1 percent, man."" Sanders announced that he was running for president in February, vowing that the socialist revolution is ahead if he has anything to say about it. He also pledged to use his campaign in an effort to fight wealth disparity and inequality.
In his campaign video, Sanders said, ""Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history. It is not only about winning the Democratic nomination and the general election. Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial, and environmental justice.""
He made the announcement that he planned to run for president once again on Vermont Public Radio.

"Trump family sues Deutsche Bank, Capital One in order to block their compliance with congressional subpoenas - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-family-sues-deutsche-bank-capital-one-to-block-subpoenas,"President Donald Trump and his three oldest children are suing to stop two banks from turning over financial records in response to congressional subpoenas.
Here's what we know The president, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump are suing both Deutsche Bank and Capital One. The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York. They argue that since the financial records are not relevant for legislation, the subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives are illegal and in violation of privacy laws. Lawyers for the family members called the subpoenas ""unlawful and illegitimate.""
The House Intelligence Committee , which is chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and the House Financial Services Committee , chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), have issued subpoenas to both banks for the Trumps' financial information.
According to the lawsuit filed by the Trump family, in addition to the president and his three oldest children, the subpoenas are requesting records ""going back decades from anyone with even a tangential connection to the President, including children, minors and spouses.""
According to a complaint written by the president's attorneys:
The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family, and to ferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage. No grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one. Trump's businesses have long invested in Deutsche Bank .
In a statement to CNN, Deutsche Bank said that it was ""committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.""
What else? In January 2017 , Deutsche Bank agreed to pay the Department of Justice a $7.2 billion fine for its role in the 2008 financial crisis. It was also accused of helping facilitate financial transactions for Russian organized crime . In November , its offices were raided by the German police who suspected that some of its employees were engaged in a money-laundering scheme."
Former Gateway pundit writer allegedly involved in plot to frame Pete Buttigieg for sexual assault,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-gateway-pundit-writer-allegedly-involved-in-plot-to-frame-pete-buttigieg-for-sexual-assault,"Jacob Wohl, a former writer for the website Gateway Pundit, is accused of trying to fabricate sexual assault allegations against 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
What's the story? According to the Daily Beast , Wohl was looking for someone willing to say that they had been sexually assaulted by Buttigieg. One of these people recorded his conversation and turned it over to the Daily Beast. In this conversation, Wohl tries to convince this anonymous person, who Daily Beast reporter Lachlan Markay described on Twitter as a ""die-hard Trump supporter,"" to say that he had been drunk and Buttigieg had taken advantage of this and assaulted him. The source said that he refused Wohl's offer.
Another person, a college student from Michigan named Hunter Kelly , said that Wohl wrote a Medium post under Kelly's name accusing Buttigieg of sexual indiscretion. Kelly said that the entire incident was fabricated without his consent, and that he had never even been to Washington, D.C., where the assault was supposed to have taken place. There was also a fake Twitter and Gmail account in Kelly's name.
Kelly said that Wohl had tried to get him on board with this plan by claiming to that it was a ""task force"" sanctioned by the Trump administration. This appears to have been complete nonsense. Longtime Wohl collaborator and lobbyist Jack Burkman was also involved in this scam.
This Medium post has since been deleted. Kelly has since publicly denied ever being sexually assaulted.
Haven't we heard something like this before? In October , Wohl was allegedly involved in a similar scheme, in which he and Burkman tried to fabricate sexual assault allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller. During that incident, Wohl reportedly created a fake investigative firm called Surefire intelligence. The phone number for this fictional firm went to Wohl's own mother's answering machine. The LinkedIn account for the company had been hastily populated with fake profiles featuring pictures of Wohl and other people who seemingly had their photos selected at random, all under fake names.
It was after this incident that Gateway Pundit chief Jim Hoft decided that not even his website could employ Wohl.
Wohl has also been permanently banned from Twitter, a platform he would often use to post dubious stories about Trump praise he claimed to have heard from liberals in a ""hipster coffee shop."""
Watch: Chaos in Venezuela as armored vehicle plows into crowd amid uprising against Socialist dictator Maduro,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-chaos-in-venezuela-as-armored-vehicle-plows-into-crowd-amid-uprising-against-maduro,"Protests are underway in Venezuela, as citizens took to the streets in response to U.S.-recognized President Juan Guaido calling for an uprising to end Socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro's regime. But Maduro is fighting back, and footage shows an armored vehicle plowing into a crowd of pro-Guaido supporters.
What are the details? Guaido posted a video on Twitter shortly before dawn on Tuesday, showing him flanked by armed troops outside the La Carlota airbase in the capital of Caracas. The opposition leader called on Venezuelans and the military to back him in what he called the ""final phase"" of toppling Maduro, Reuters reported.
Guaido was also joined by his mentor, politician Leopoldo Lopez, who was meant to be under house arrest, according to Newsweek . Lopez tweeted, ""I've been freed by soldiers following the constitution and President Guaido. I'm at the base. Let's all mobilize. It's time to win Freedom.""
Hundreds of civilians descended on the base, and were met with tear gas. Troops loyal to Guaido exchanged gunfire with troops loyal to Maduro, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
Meanwhile, The Guardian reported ""there were signs that the rebellion was spreading across the country, with reports of pro-opposition protests in [other] major cities including Valencia, Puerto Ordaz,"" and Barquisimeto.
Several hundred people also rallied outside Maduro's palace in support of the dictator. While Maduro did not make a public appearance, he issued a statement saying he had spoken with military leaders who reassured him of their ""total loyalty."" Maduro's second in command told the media that Venezuela was in a state of ""absolute calm,"" despite the uprising staged by what he referred to as ""the coup-mongering, murderous far right.""
CNN reported Tuesday that a full-on overthrow attempt was underway, with pro-Guaido supporters tossing Molotov cocktails, joined by armed members of the Bolivian National Guard who were fighting against Maduro's troops.
Footage posted by NBC News purportedly shows a military vehicle ""slamming into pro-Guaido protesters"" outside the La Carlota base on Tuesday."
'Someone is not being truthful': Questions raised over missing bodycam footage from multiple police raids of wrong homes in Chicago,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/questions-raised-over-missing-bodycam-footage-in-chicago,"Politicians, journalists, and law enforcement experts are joining Chicago families in demanding answers for how police have not only repeatedly conducted SWAT raids on the wrong homes, but why critical body camera footage from officers has gone missing or was never recorded as evidence.
 WBBM-TV has covered numerous recent instances where Chicago police have stormed addresses incorrectly cited on warrants, subsequently holding innocent residents — including children — at gunpoint before discovering the mistake.
Such was the case in February, when a 4-year-old's birthday party was interrupted by at least 17 of Chicago's finest on the hunt for a suspect who had lived in the same residence some five years ago. In that scenario and others, adults allege they were wrongly manhandled and handcuffed by officers, and in at least one instance, police are accused of continuing to search and ransack a home even after learning they were in the wrong place.
Now, lawsuits filed by several families against the department are making their way through the court system, revealing that footage from police body cameras is unavailable to corroborate the events. In some instances, officers had been issued body cameras, but either failed to wear them or allegedly failed to turn them on.
In 2015, Illinois passed a law requiring police wearing body cameras to activate them during encounters with civilians, following allegations of deleted footage purportedly showing the high profile shooting death of Laquan McDonald .
State Sen. Jacqueline Collins told WBBM that Chicago police are not operating in accordance with the law.
""Someone is not being truthful,"" she said in regard to the missing footage, explaining that the legislation dictates, ""before they even enter the residence they need to activate their cameras.""
Anything else? The Chicago Police Department does not require SWAT officers to wear body cameras, and its current policy does not include disciplinary measures for officers who fail to utilize the cameras when required.
WBBM reported that the CPD has refused to reveal how many wrong-address raids the department has conducted."
"Professor: 'Vile little s**tlord' college students who back free speech should be fired from jobs, chased out of restaurants",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-fire-students-who-back-free-speech,"In the wake of Saturday's deadly synagogue attack near San Diego reportedly fueled by anti-Semitism , a professor tweeted that ""vile little s**tlord"" college students who stand up for free speech should be publicly exposed, fired from their jobs, and run out of restaurants.
The declaration from Matthew Sears of the University of New Brunswick in Canada came in two tweets. His first tweet indicated that ""we should name every white supremacist. Name every writer, blogger, YouTuber, and politician that inspires them. Plaster their faces in public. Fire them from their jobs. Hound them from restaurants. Expose them and those that fuel them for the hateful pathetic wretches they are.""
Sears' second tweet — which appears to have been deleted — said college students who advocate for free speech should suffer the same treatment, Campus Reform said : ""And that includes every vile little s**tlord in a campus 'free speech' club who spends his time platforming white supremacist trolls under the banner of 'free speech,' and every grifting liar that goes on about campus 'censorship' and the 'marketplace of ideas.'""
What happened next?
Trial lawyer Robert Barnes pushed back against Sears' second tweet attacking college student free-speech advocates, and Sears replied that ""there's a difference between free speech and those who use 'free speech' as a deliberate strategy to put hateful and discredited ideas into the mainstream and give them academic credibility. But you know that, you liar.""
Image source: Twitter screenshot
What else did Sears say? Campus Reform said Sears clarified to the outlet that his second tweet calling for the harassment of college students was directed at those who ""invite bigoted provocateurs like Richard Spencer and Milo Yannopoulos"" to speak at schools.
But Campus Reform also discovered Sears approved of the left's harassment of Trump officials in public places last year, noting the headline-grabbing June incident when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant.
""Forget 'respectability politics,' forget the 'politics of division,' forget 'civility,'"" Sears tweeted . ""Let's denormalize these folks and their ideas every single chance we get, including throwing them the hell out of restaurants. Like we should have done *from the very beginning*.""
The professor told Campus Reform in regard to his Sanders tweet that ""I reject the notion that civility is the ultimate goal, especially in the face of what are some pretty outrageous human rights abuses, such as what we see along the U.S.-Mexico border. If someone like Sanders provides cover and routinely lies for someone like Trump, even if he is the most powerful person on earth, I fail to see how mouthing off to them in restaurants is beyond the pale. Yes, this could go both ways. But appeals to civility often only manage to maintain the status quo, and benefit those in power.""
Sears also tweeted in February 2018 that ""a Klan hood was a way to signify pretty much exactly the same values as MAGA signifies."" MAGA refers to the phrase ""Make America Great Again,"" which is emblazoned upon the iconic red cap that symbolized President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The cap has become a lightning rod for a growing number of those on the left who say it's synonymous with racism, bigotry, and hatred .
Campus Reform said the University of New Brunswick didn't reply to its request for comment in time for publication."
"Community outraged after high school boys in blackface post video of themselves disparaging black girls, harassing McDonald's workers",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/parents-students-outraged-after-a-group-high-school-boys,"A group of Illinois students sparked outrage from parents and classmates after they posted blackface photos and a video of themselves making derogatory comments about black girls and harassing workers at a McDonald's drive-through, WLS-TV reported.
The video posted Sunday featured four white males riding in a car with black paint smeared on their faces. The teenagers attend Homewood-Flossmoor Community High School near Chicago.
Some students planned a walkout, dubbed ""boycott against racism,"" over the incident. Nearly 70 percent of the school's population is black.
What did school administrators say? School administrators issued a statement ensuring parents and students that it was handling the situation with those involved.
""The administration immediately requested a meeting that afternoon [Sunday] and met with all of the families and students involved. Due to student confidentiality laws, we are unable to discuss individual students and actions taken,"" school officials wrote, WLS reported.
""Though this behavior occurred outside the school setting, this type of behavior is contrary to our expectations, is being addressed quickly and appropriately and will not be tolerated,"" the statement continued.
Privacy laws prevent the school from releasing the names of the students involved or discussing punishment.
On Tuesday morning, administrators sent another letter to parents that guaranteed their support for students who planned to participate in the walkout, according to WLS :
We have been made aware that some of our students may participate in a walkout some time today to express their frustration with the social media posts and actions of a few students this past weekend. We support their right to express themselves, and we will work to ensure that all students are safe and respected.
We will be working in cooperation with the Flossmoor Police Department. Our administrators addressed all students via the school TV news channel this morning, sharing with them the importance of their voice, participation and plan to move forward as a school and community.
We will be having a school-wide conversation with all students during English classes tomorrow, when the principal and superintendent will join in an interactive discussion with the student body. During the walkout today, access to the campus will be closed. Students may choose to participate in the walkout or choose to stay in classes and continue to process with their peers and teachers. Students are being asked to stay on campus for their safety. What did parents say? Some parents hope the situation can start a conversation regarding racial issues.
""I know these kids, I know these parents, these are my daughter's classmates, this is going to cause more tension to an already tension-riddled community,"" parent Nicole Brookens told WLS. ""I hope that I can do something to help this conversation get started.""
But others want the students kicked out of the school.
""I would like to see the students expelled. I would like to see some cultural sensitivity training. It should have been done proactively but now that we're dealing with it — let's face it head-on,"" Dr. La-Shawn Latrice, whose child attends the high school, told WMAQ-TV .
Still, some including former student Janet Lawrence, whose children and grandchildren also attended the school, were surprised by the whole incident.
""I've never seen anything like this before in our community, so I don't know, these are a couple of kids, I don't know who they are,"" Lawrence said. ""They are not responsible for the rest of us. They are only responsible for themselves.""
What about the parents of the students who were involved? A mother of one the boys involved told the Patch that the teens didn't understand the meaning of blackface until after the fact.
""This is a very serious thing,"" she said. ""As crazy as it sounds, it is not about race. We are not racist. The students didn't even know what 'blackface' meant until they Googled it later. It was a complete dumb and childish act.""
The woman, who asked for anonymity, said her family has received death threats since the story broke."
Transgender female weightlifter smashes multiple women's world records in single day — and female Olympic medal winners cry foul,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-female-weightlifter-smashes-multiple-womens-world-records-in-single-day-and-notable-former-athletes-cry-foul,"Powerlifter Mary Gregory — a biological male competing as a transgender female — announced Saturday on Instagram setting four women's world records in one day at a Raw Powerlifting Federation event: Masters world squat, open world bench press, masters world deadlift, and masters world total.
""As a transgender lifter I was unsure what to expect going into this meet and everyone — all the spotters, loaders, referees, staff, meet director, all made me welcome and treated me as just another female lifter,"" Gregory added. ""Thank you!""
But not everybody cheered for Gregory However, a pair of Olympic medalists — who happen to be biological females — decried Gregory's world record-setting efforts.
First up was former swimmer Sharron Davies who won a silver medal for Great Britain in the 1980 Summer Olympics. Davies — who's been outspoken against transgender females competing against biological females — tweeted that Gregory has a ""male body with male physiology"" and that a ""woman with female biology cannot compete. It's a pointless unfair playing field.""
Replying to Davies' tweet was Dame Kelly Holmes, who won a pair of gold medals — the 800-meter and 1,500-meter races — for Great Britain at the 2004 Athens Olympics.
Holmes noted that ""it's a bloody joke and all getting ready for biological women to boycott certain events. Have a trans category if need be but even better a trans games. Otherwise I'm starting to worry about the backlash and abuse that the trans community will get from spectators. It will happen!""

Smart car maker plans to cease US production amid sales struggles,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/smart-car-maker-plans-to-cease-us-production-amid-sales-struggles,"Whether one considers it an an icon, a punchline, or just incredibly easy to park, few automobiles on the American road have been as easily recognizable over the past 11 years as the notoriously small Smart car.
But, after struggling to make sales for years, there won't be any new ones rolling off production lines in the United States any time soon. Smart car maker Daimler announced plans to shutter all production of its famously tiny, two-door micro cars by the end of this model year, Car and Driver reported .
""After much careful consideration, Smart will discontinue its battery-electric Smart EQ fortwo model in the U.S. and Canadian markets at the conclusion of MY2019,"" Mercedes spokesman Robert Moran said in an emailed statement Monday. ""A number of factors, including a declining micro-car market in the U.S. and Canada, combined with high homologation costs for a low volume model are central to this decision.""
This may not come as a surprise to those who found the Smart cars' presence in the U.S. market (as well as their hallmark diminutive size), a little absurd, but the automaker has been struggling for a while now.
The subsidiary of Mercedes-owned Diamler already made the call to stop producing gas-powered micro cars in 2017, leaving only the battery-powered Fortwo models on the market. The remaining battery-powered offerings boast just 80 horsepower and 118 pound-feet of torque while enjoying a grand total of 70 to 80 miles of range off of a single charge.
And that decision was also unsuccessful. Sales of the Fortwo dropped to just under 1,300 in the United States last year, which Automobile Magazine notes is a ""a precipitous 58 percent fall.""
The company's financials aren't public, but analysts have estimated that the subsidiary loses somewhere between $550 million and $800 million annually.
The Financial Times recently reported that Daimler was set to selling off a 50 percent stake in the company to a Chinese automotive group .
""We can't see how a German microcar business can generate a profit, costs are simply too high,"" an analyst for investment researcher Evercore ISI said .
Initially dreamed up by Lebanese-born Swatch (yes, the Swiss watch company) CEO Nicolas Hayek, the first Smart car was released in 1998 and the company released its Fortwo model the United States a decade later in 2008. Hayek passed away in 2010.
MotorTrend noted that news of the discontinuation coincides with Mercedes' planned introduction of the EQC electric SUV to the North American market in 2020 and that the German automaker will focus its American efforts on the new release."
Atheist group complains 'God bless America' is said at elementary school after daily pledge. District quickly falls in line.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/atheist-group-complains-god-bless-america-is-said-at-elementary-school-after-daily-pledge-district-quickly-falls-in-line,"National atheist advocacy group the Freedom From Religion Foundation said it got quick results after complaining that the phrase ""God bless America"" was stated over a loudspeaker after the daily Pledge of Allegiance at a Pennsylvania elementary school.
What happened? As is common with these types of cases, a ""concerned Springfield School District parent"" told the FFRF of the goings on at Sabold Elementary School — and the organization jumped into action and asked school officials to nix the practice.
""The repeated recitation of a religious message in the school setting violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits public schools from advancing, supporting or promoting religion,"" FFRF Legal Fellow Chris Line wrote to Superintendent Anthony Barber , the FFRF said. ""'God Bless America' is a prayer. The song that the phrase originates from begins, 'As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.' A prayer hosted by a publicly supported school does not pass constitutional muster.""
The FFRF added that when a public school regularly proclaims, ""God bless America,"" that tells students that the school is ""endorsing and compelling belief in God,"" which in unfair to students who don't believe in God.
How did the school district respond? The FFRF said its directive was followed.
""After the school district's receipt of your letter, Sabold Elementary School has ceased its practice of announcing the slogan 'God Bless America' over the loudspeaker immediately following the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance,"" the district's legal counsel replied , the FFRF said. ""None of the schools in the school district currently engage in this practice.""
How did the FFRF react to the district falling in line? ""We're gratified that Springfield officials listened to us so clearly,"" FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor said, according to her organization. ""Young elementary school children don't need to be coerced into affirming God's name every morning.""
More from the FFRF:
However, Gaylor adds, FFRF receives constant complaints over the addition of ""under God"" into the previously secular Pledge of Allegiance. The pledge was tampered with in 1954. Unfortunately, attempts to litigate this addition into the pledge, which equates piety with patriotism, have been unsuccessful. That is why FFRF's complaint letter focused on the ""ad hoc"" godly slogan appended to the Pledge at Sabold Elementary School. What else has the Freedom From Religion Foundation been up to? The FFRF demanded that a Texas high school remove a Christian flag flying on campus in 2017 — which resulted in some students flying the same flag from their vehicles in the school parking lot. It demanded that an Alabama high school marching band cease it's ""religious"" halftime performances at football games in 2017. The school said it would consider removing some props but that the show would remain the same. The FFRF demanded that a different Alabama high school stop loudspeaker prayers at football games in 2017. But after the school complied, students ended up praying out loud in the stands. In March 2018, the FFRF said it got rid of prayer said by an Oklahoma City pastor for a local high school football team. Last fall the group convinced a state college in Utah to remove Bibles and copies of the Book of Mormon from rooms of a hotel it owns. Last December, the FFRF at first convinced an Arkansas town to remove a giant lighted cross display — but then residents made their voices heard, and the move was put on hold. In January, the atheist group forced New Mexico Junior College to remove Christian crosses it displayed on campus."
FBI report says Antifa activists tried to buy weapons from Mexican cartel to stage 'armed rebellion' at border,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/antifa-activists-mexican-cartel-border,"The FBI investigated ""anti-fascist"" activists who planned to buy weapons from a Mexican drug cartel in order to ""stage an armed rebellion"" and sow renewed chaos at the southern United States border amid the ongoing crisis there.
Documents obtained by the San Diego Union-Tribune revealed the alleged plot and the government's subsequent investigation.
What are the details? The FBI document, dated December 2018, detailed an alleged plot where Antifa activists planned to buy weapons from an alleged Mexican cartel gunman, alias ""Cobra Commander,"" in order to ""stage an armed rebellion at the border"" hoping to ""disrupt U.S. law enforcement and military security operations at the US/Mexican border,"" according to the Union-Tribune.
The FBI learned of the plot while collecting intelligence on American journalists, lawyers, and activists working with migrants in the Tijuana region, a popular destination for migrants heading north from Central America.
The six-page document is an ""information report, not finally evaluated intelligence,"" the Union-Tribune reported. However, the FBI forwarded the document, which it marked ""priority,"" to numerous federal law enforcement agencies, including:
Department of Homeland Security Central Intelligence Agency Drug Enforcement Agency National Security Council Customs and Border Protection Immigration and Customs Enforcement Anything else? Two people named in the report — Ivan Riebeling and Evan Duke — also allegedly plotted to establish camps in Mexico that would be used to train activists to become ""community defense militias.""
""Organizers planned for the camps to be used as staging platforms from which five person units would form to train anarchists in fighting, combat, and conducting reconnaissance, and then launch to disrupt U.S. government operations along the border,"" the report stated, according to the Union-Tribune.
However, both men denied involvement.
""Here I find the government again trying to tie me into some (stuff) I wasn't involved in,"" Duke told the Union-Tribune.
Meanwhile, Riebeling told the newspaper he once helped migrant caravans but later decided to attack them instead, calling them his ""enemies."" He also denied being associated with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel to which the FBI's report connected him.

As the story initially pointed out, the company at issue is Cynet Systems. Cynet, Inc. has apparently been the recipient of numerous hostile emails since this story broke, despite having nothing to do with this story. Please do not contact them about this story, as they have nothing to do with it.
A staffing firm has apologized after it posted a job listing that described the ideal candidate as ""preferably Caucasian.""
Cynet Systems posted the listing for an account manager position on Saturday across multiple websites, including LinkedIn.
""First, we would like to say simply that we truly regret the fact that individuals formerly employed by Cynet Systems went outside of company policy and included an inappropriate requirement in a job listing,"" Cynet Systems Co-CEO Ashwani Mayur wrote in a statement on Monday. ""We understand why some may have been upset seeing this listing, because we were too.""
In an earlier post, the company said it had fired the people responsible for the ""offensive job post,"" adding that the listing ""does not reflect our core values of inclusivity & equality.""
The Washington, D.C.-based firm describes itself as ""a top talent supplier for companies across North America.""
What exactly did the job listing say? The listing said it was seeking someone to fill a mid-to-senior level management position with an undisclosed pharmaceutical company, according to USA Today .
The first bullet under the listing's job description read: ""Preferably Caucasian who has a good technical background including knowledge of RPA.""
Social media users quickly called out the company, took screenshots, and started sharing the listing.
What else did Cynet say? More than 60 percent of the firm's employees are minorities, according to the company.
""Further, Cynet Systems itself is proud to be an immensely diverse company,"" Mayur wrote. ""Both of our owners are Indian-Americans, our workforce is over 60% minority, and we are certified as a diversity supplier by the National Minority Supplier and Development Council.""
Mayur said that the firm was reviewing all ads – ""existing and upcoming"" – to make sure there were no similar issues, adding that it would be looking at measures that could help us catch offensive or outside of policy ads before they ever go live to ensure this can't happen again.""
What else?
Screenshots shared online showed Cynet had posted another listing for an account management position in Virginia that called for a ""female candidate only.""
""In another job posting the same company: 'Female Candidates Only.' Sales. Wonder if they are required to wear pantyhose,"" one Twitter user wrote.
The listing is no longer active or has been modified.

Seattle's city attorney actually wants a judge to resign for sending a 72-time convicted criminal to jail,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/seattles-city-attorney-actually-wants-a-judge-to-resign-for-sending-a-72-time-convicted-criminal-to-jail,"Seattle's city attorney actually wants a judge to resign because he chose to put a 55-year-old man, who had just racked up his 72nd criminal conviction, in jail.
Here's what happened In November, Francisco Calderon, a 55-year-old homeless man, punched complete stranger Mat Xavier in the mouth. Calderon was arrested and charged with assault after the victim called 911. Calderon eventually pleaded guilty to the crime.
This was Calderon's 72nd criminal conviction. According to a report from KOMO-TV , 14 of the 72 were felonies.
The local outlet reported that despite the circumstances of the arrest, third-term City Attorney Pete Holmes recommended that Calderon get a plea deal that would have kept him out of jail by giving him two years of probation and requiring him to get a mental health check and enroll in substance abuse treatment.
""I think it's in the community's best interest to receive this kind of treatment and rehabilitation,"" Calderon's public defender told the judge. He added that his habitual re-offender client ""clearly got the message that's he's on thin ice.""
How the judge responded Municipal Judge Ed McKenna didn't see the agreed-upon plea bargain as the best course of action for the safety of Seattle's law-abiding population, given Calderon's very lengthy criminal history and the fact that he had to literally be dragged out of his jail cell into court at one point.
""As a judge, I have a duty and responsibility to protect the citizens of Seattle and impose a sentence that I think is going to provide protection,"" McKenna said in court before sentencing Calderon in January . ""I don't think this court is willing to risk having someone else assaulted.""
McKenna then gave the defendant the maximum allowable sentence for fourth-degree assault: 364 days in prison.
As a result, Holmes wants McKenna to resign.
A letter from Holmes and Seattle Director of Public Defense Anita Khandelwal says that, by sentencing Calderon to jail despite the plea bargain, McKenna violated judicial ethics rules and should step down. The letter also calls the 364-day maximum sentence ""extraordinary.""
""The City Attorney and the Public Defender are adversaries in the courtroom and disagree on many matters of criminal justice policy; rarely do we stand together on issues,"" the letter reads. ""We do so today because of our shared concern that you are disregarding your duty to act with impartiality and integrity.""
In turn, McKenna responded with a letter of his own, writing that, ""The citizenry of Seattle expects and demands that elected leaders work together to solve problems facing our city.
""I intend no actions and I'm not asking you for an apology,"" McKenna added. ""I simply ask that each of you initiate an effort to publicly correct your errors.""
What else? McKenna also found support in the form of an editorial by the Seattle Times, criticizing Holmes's actions.
""This was a political hit,"" the newspaper's editorial board wrote . ""Public confidence in Seattle's criminal-justice system is at a low point and not because McKenna is discussing problems from his vantage point, presiding over the state's busiest courtrooms.""
The effects of Seattle's drug, homeless, and crime problems have become an issue of nationwide discussion and were the subject of the recent KOMO documentary, ""Seattle is Dying.""

Liberal activist reportedly deploys smoke bomb at pro-life speaker’s university event about abortion,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/smoke-bomb-during-pro-life-event,"A smoke bomb interrupted a pro-life speaker's presentation Monday night at the University of Texas at Austin. The university's Gearing Hall had to be evacuated, and the speaker's presentation was moved to another venue as a result of the smoke bomb.
A conservative campus group said that the culprit who set off the smoke bomb was a liberal activist.
What are the details? Speaker Ryan Bomberger, president of the Radiance Foundation, was invited to speak at the school on behalf of the school's Young Conservatives of Texas chapter.
Bomberger was in the middle of a pro-life presentation titled, ""Should Have Been Aborted,"" when the smoke bomb went off.
Saurabh Sharma, chairman of the Young Conservatives of Texas, told KTBC-TV , ""We were hosting a speaker by the name of Ryan Bomberger, the President of Radiance Foundation. a pro-life advocacy group, called 'Should Have Been Aborted.' The event was going normally and then we heard the fire alarm and evacuated, as we were leaving we saw smoke. Shortly after evacuating, the police informed us it was a smoke bomb. We went to a nearby lecture hall to complete the event.""
A Facebook post describing the incident explained that ""leftist cowardice [struck] again.""
""If you can't (intellectually) beat 'em, smoke 'em out,"" the post added. ""The tolerance brigade smoke bombed our event at The University of Texas at Austin. Young Conservatives of Texas at the University of Texas' and Trotter House Community Outreach (amazing pregnancy care center located on campus) sponsored us to come speak about abortion in a presentation entitled, 'Should Have Been Aborted,' tackling the broken worldview that some humans have less worth than others.
""On campuses across the country, leftist activists can't handle that others are able to peaceably assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights,"" the post continued. ""The Radiance Foundation has been protested on numerous campuses, but we've never experienced a hit and run like this. The entire Gearing Hall had to be evacuated and our event moved to another building. Thankfully, no one was hurt. But freedom is injured every time liberal activists try to shut down #freespeech. Police are investigating the incident.""
Bomberger said, ""[I]t just reminds me that there are some students who would rather fear than think. And it's a shame because they could have come in and they could have learned a lot and they could have asked all kinds of questions. It's a non-threatening sort of environment where you get to ask questions even if you're on the other side ideologically.""
KTBC reported that a criminal investigation in connection with the incident is underway."

The Afghanistan war veteran was reportedly seeking retribution for the 50 Muslim worshippers murdered last month in New Zealand.
 The suspect — whose name is intentionally being omitted by TheBlaze — is a 26-year-old man who caught the attention of law enforcement after he posted a video on social media saying, ""America needs another Vegas event,"" to give ""a taste of the terror they gladly spread all over the world,"" referring to the 2017 attack in Las Vegas that left 58 concertgoers dead with no clear motive .
NBC News reported the ex-soldier mulled various attacks with a confidential FBI informant over a six-week period, 'fantasiz[ing] about murdering a laundry list of perceived enemies, including Christians, Jews, white supremacists, police officers, even his next-door neighbor,"" before deciding on his target.
According to a release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California, the trained combat veteran allegedly sought out and obtained what he believed were functioning pressure cooker bombs, and purchased several hundred nails to be used as shrapnel.
When asked by the undercover source whether he intended to get caught, the recently converted Muslim casually replied, ""Martyrdom, bro."" He also ""expressed support for violent jihad,' and told the informant that if ISIS ""came here"" he would swear allegiance to the terrorist organization.
Anything else? The suspect planned to detonate improvised explosive devices at a ""free speech"" rally in Long Beach, California, last weekend, and was taken into custody after he surveilled the site of the would-be attack.
The event was planned by the United Patriot National Front, a right-wing organization several media outlets referred to as "" white supremacists ,"" which the group denies .
According to the Press Telegram, the UPNF ultimately did not hold a rally, but a few hundred counter-demonstrators gathered to ""stand up to protect people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and all others who suffer from violence promoted by far-right and white-nationalist groups."""

John spoke with several top Ukrainian officials who acknowledged that they released a ""black ledger "" file during the 2016 election in an effort to sway the election in Hillary Clinton's favor.
""They admitted that the goal was to help Hillary Clinton,"" said John. ""The evidence is clear. There is a court ruling in Ukraine, which says the Ukrainian government wrongly released this document in an effort to sway the 2016 election. And then there was a tape recording released by that court ... in which a top member of what you would call the FBI of Ukraine ... he was captured in the tape recording, bragging that he was trying to help Hillary Clinton.""
But that was just the tip of the iceberg. After learning of the black-ledger leak, John continued to look into the connections between Obama-era White House officials, Ukraine and the origins of the Russia-Trump collusion narrative. He discovered ""a series of events where you have a foreign government now admitting on the record that they tried to intervene in the 2016 election -- but it wasn't Russia. It was Ukraine.""

Robert Mueller sent a stunning letter to AG Barr over his report – here's what it said,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mueller-letter-to-barr,"The Washington Post reported Tuesday that they obtained a letter sent from Robert Mueller to Attorney General William Barr implying that he misled Congress about the conclusions in his report.
According to the letter , Mueller said that Barr's summary of his report ""did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance"" of the investigation into accusations against President Donald Trump.
""There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation,"" the letter reportedly read .
""This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations,"" continued Mueller.
If accurate, the report on the letter confirms accusations from many Democrats and suspicions by critics of the president that Barr had misinterpreted the conclusions of the Mueller report.
The letter also requests that Barr release the executive summaries and the introductions from the report to clarify the conclusions Mueller made from his investigation.
The report was later released in a redacted form to the public and to Congress. Many members of Congress demanded an un-redacted copy of the report when they were dissatisfied with what they read.
Democrats called for Barr to testify before Congress about the accusations made in the report.
Republicans concluded from Barr's summary that Mueller's investigation did not find enough evidence to indict the president or bring impeachment charges over accusations of collusion with the Russian government to interfere with the 2016 election.

The three leaders agreed to pursue a deal on a $2 trillion infrastructure bill, setting a foundation on which to build future negotiations and surprising some observers who expected another contentious meeting with the trio.
Schumer said Pres. Trump was more agreeable than he has been in past meetings, and that he didn't bring up the issue of Democratic investigations as an obstacle to negotiations like he has in the past.
""That was different than some of the other meetings that we've had,"" Schumer told reporters afterward. ""This was a very, very good start. … We hope it will go to a constructive conclusion.
""In previous meetings, the president has said 'if these investigations continue, I can't work with you.' He didn't bring it up,"" Schumer said. ""The two are not mutually exclusive and we were glad he didn't make it that way.""
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had expressed doubt that the president would overlook the Democrats' aggressive investigations in to his administration and campaign.
""It's not reasonable to expect the president to work with you on Monday on a big infrastructure bill and have you punching him in the face on Tuesday on 15 investigations,"" Mulvaney said during a Tuesday speech in California.
There is a good chance of conflict still to come on infrastructure however. Agreeing on how much to spend is one thing; agreeing on how to pay for it is another entirely.
A point of contention will be a desire from some Democrats to raise taxes and roll back Pres. Trump's 2017 tax cuts in order to fund the infrastructure bill.
""The common denominator, no matter what the subject the Democrats bring up, is a tax increase,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters before the meeting. ""[On] infrastructure, they'll only agree to something unless they're able to raise taxes."""

Come again? At the outset of her mini-speech, Behar ripped Trump for defending his post-Charlottesville, Virginia, statements — and not surprisingly she invoked debunked left-wing talking points claiming he called neo-Nazis at the deadly riots ""good people.""
Problem is, the Los Angeles Times' transcript indicates Trump said, ""I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally."" Even CNN's Jake Tapper acknowledged it .
Behar then condemned Trump's consoling words following the synagogue attack: ""He talks out of both sides of his mouth. He's provocative. He gives dog whistles constantly to these people, and then [Trump counselor] Kellyanne [Conway] goes out there and defends him ... Take responsibility for your actions, Mr. President. You are the culprit.""

Investigators uncovered the students' plan after a school resource officer at South Cumberland Elementary School in Crossville alerted authorities about a rumor of a possible ""hit list,"" according to a news release.
""We take any threat to students and school faculty very seriously, and we will respond, investigate and take swift, appropriate action to manage each threat,"" Cumberland County Sheriff Casey Fox said in the release.
Police arrested the students on Friday. They were placed in the Cumberland County Juvenile Detention Facility where they remain. Since they are juveniles, authorities have not released the names, ages, or gender of the students involved.
What was their plan? School officials said on Monday in a release that the students had planned to hide the weapons in the school's locker room.
On May 31, they intended to enter the school through its back door, retrieve the hidden weapons, and start shooting students and staff members. A hit list was not found.
The pair planned to commit suicide after completing the plot.
According to officials, the children had discussed their plan multiple times over the previous two weeks.
What did school officials say? The school's director Janet Graham said in a release that safety is the school's top priority.
""Our first and most important responsibility is to ensure the safety of our students and staff,"" Graham said. ""It was determined that at no time during the investigation students or staff were believed to be in any immediate danger.""
What else? The students' parents have cooperated with authorities and school officials, the sheriff said.
Authorities searched the homes of the students and found no weapons or other evidence.
District Attorney General Bryant Dunaway said the cases would be handled in juvenile court. It's not immediately clear when the students are expected to appear in court."
MSNBC accidentally stumbles on defense of 2nd Amendment over gov't violence in Venezuela,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/msnbc-on-gun-control,"Viewers of the progressive cable news network MSNBC were stunned to hear a justification for 2nd Amendment gun rights after violence broke out in Venezuela by the government against their unarmed citizenry.
MSNBC news anchor Andrea Mitchell was speaking to their correspondent Kerry Sanders when he made what sounded like a common gun rights argument.
""This is taking longer than they thought,"" said Mitchell of the U.S. efforts to unseat Venezuelan dictator Maduro, ""despite the sanctions, despite the pressure, with the help of Russia and other outside forces, Maduro is hanging on.""
""Not only hanging on,"" agreed Sanders, ""but he appears to still control the military. You have to understand that in Venezuela, gun ownership is not something that is open to everybody, so if the military have the guns, they have the power. And as long as Nicolas Maduro controls the military, he controls the country.""
Sanders was unwittingly making the argument for gun rights in order to secure the liberty of the people against what often veers into government tyranny.
""And Juan Guaido and his supporters have tried to peacefully protest,"" Sanders explained, ""they have gathered in large numbers. What we saw today when he met early this morning and stood there in front of those wearing uniforms, appear to be rank and file members who have switched their allegiance. We have seen over the recent months, those who have switched their allegiance, but not en masse.""
The surprise defense of gun rights from a network that often defends and advocates for greater gun control was widely celebrated on social media by proponents of the 2nd Amendment.

The U.S. is backing Guaido as the rightful constitutional leader of Venezuela, as are 54 other countries.
Cuba has been allied with the socialist dictatorship in Venezuela, which critics blame for the explosion in inflation and the devastating shortages in food, medicine, and other supplies.
Allies of the Maduro dictatorship have accused the U.S. of ""colonialism"" and meddling in foreign affairs, but supporters of Guaido counter that his leadership was confirmed by the National Assembly of Venezuela, and as such is the only true president of the country.

The vandals put a garden hose through the front door mail slot of the office sometime over the weekend and left the water running until it was discovered by an employee Sunday afternoon.
The office belonged to ICE union lawyer Sean Riddell and Christine Mascal, who runs a separate practice in the same office. Riddell wasn't sure at first whether he or Mascal was being targeted, until an email sent to the Willamette Week provided some answers.
The letter was also published on the anarchist news site, It's Going Down. It reads:
Sean Riddell currently provides legal representation to the National ICE Council, the union which represents ICE agents, in a lawsuit against the city of Portland in response to the Occupy ICE PDX encampment last summer. Sean's new law office, located in Portland, was purchased partially with the money he's made from the work he's done for the National ICE Council. We decided to congratulate him on his new building by unraveling is garden hose, pushing it through his mail slot, and turning on the water. Our goal was to cause maximum economic damage, that should serve as a warning to all individuals and businesses that profit off the human misery perpetrated by ICE…
For a world without borders and prisons. For the free movement of all people. Smash ICE Workers are trying to dry out the damaged wooden floors and remove the soaked carpet from the office this week to prevent an accumulation of mold. Riddell said insurance should cover most of the damage. He also called out the vandals for hiding in anonymity.
""I have the courage of my convictions,"" Riddell said. ""I put my name on what I do."""

Smollett, who is gay, portrayed singer-songwriter Jamal Lyon on the show, a character who is also gay.
The actor has been at the center of a public firestorm after he said that he was the victim of a racial and homophobic attack in January. His alleged attackers were later apprehended by the Chicago police, but they said that Smollett had paid them to fake the attack in order to garner sympathy for the actor.
He was later charged with 16 felony accounts related to filing a false police report, but many were stunned when those charges were dropped after he forfeited a $10,000 bond and completed community service.
A spokesperson for Smollett released a statement about his release from the show, saying that he was ""grateful to Fox and 'Empire' leadership, cast, crew and fans for their unwavering support.""

Despite its stated goal of breaking down the stereotype that black people have to be Democrats and seeking to convert people, Blexit ends up insulting its target audience and neglecting to highlight specific reasons why a black Democrat should join the Republican Party.
Instead, speakers at the Blexit Dallas conference mock and demonize those who hold opposing political beliefs, resulting in a message that is only appealing to those who already agree with it, and attracting a crowd that is representative of the current Republican Party: mostly white.
White people are, of course, welcome at any event promoting the uplifting of the black community. It is not the presence of white people that was troubling to me, but the relative absence of black people. If Blexit's goal is winning black people to the conservative cause, it appears to be missing the mark.
Blexit presents the style of rhetoric that portrays America as a clear-cut battleground between reasonable, logical Republicans and ignorant, manipulative, morally-bankrupt Democrats. It's the way someone might view the country if they only watched cable news and never actually spoke to anyone from another political party.
Volunteers at the event posted signs on the walls and placed them in the seats for audience members. ""Robert Francis O'Rourke is not Hispanic."" ""Liberals can't bully me."" ""Joe Biden's mentor was in the KKK."" Blexit might be more accurately described as an anti-Democratic movement than as a pro-Republican one. It's Donald Trump's "" What the hell do you have to lose "" quote expanded into a nationwide conference.
This polarized perspective doesn't allow for or empathize with the possibility of well-meaning Democrats, which is a problem when you're trying to win people who.... are currently Democrats. Maybe there are people who change their minds when the opening gambit in a debate is a bevy of insults, but they can't be all that common.
This doesn't seem to matter to the people who put Blexit together. It doesn't seek to engage in civil dialogue with ideological opponents. There's no time for that, when liberals are trying to destroy America.
What is the goal of Blexit? Not the stated goal on the website, but the real goal, as exhibited by public words and actions? That was the question I had on my mind as I prepared to attend Blexit Dallas. I hoped to experience a movement fueled by a desire to engage political debate and black culture in a fresh and positive way, with the goal of showing people the value of conservatism.
Instead, I saw more vitriol. More antagonism. More division. And an ideology that tells black people they should leave the Democratic Party and become Republicans, and that they should break free of viewing themselves as helpless victims of racism. But joining Blexit just means trading the chains black victimhood for those of conservative victimhood. Several of the event's speakers spent a significant amount of time decrying how severely they've been opposed for being conservative.
In Blexit, it's okay to say that you're a victim of systemic discrimination, as long as you're not saying it's because of race. It has to be discrimination by the mainstream media or by higher education or by Hollywood against conservatism.
""For the last decade, and increasingly over the last two years our media has been trying to inspire a race war,"" the event description reads . But Blexit doesn't seek peace. It just seeks a war on different terms. It seeks to mobilize black people, calling to abandon race-based struggles in favor of a war against liberal narratives in mainstream media. Getting people to change teams isn't the same thing as trying to create unity.
""I think Candace Owens is our Martin Luther King,"" said Blexit Dallas speaker Rogan O'Handley . Inspiring as Owens might be to some, she and Dr. King chose vastly different methods to pursue their respective ""revolutions.""
King's perspective on how to treat one's enemies, which he derives directly from the words of Jesus Christ as recorded in the gospel of Matthew, was not reflected at Blexit Dallas. King's ideas about how to transform or win over an opponent would have seemed out of place at the South Side Ballroom in downtown Dallas on that Sunday evening.
King spoke on this topic in a November 1957 sermon (emphasis mine):
Now there is a final reason I think that Jesus says, ""Love your enemies."" It is this: that love has within it a redemptive power. And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals. That's why Jesus says, ""Love your enemies."" Because if you hate your enemies, you have no way to redeem and to transform your enemies. But if you love your enemies, you will discover that at the very root of love is the power of redemption.
You just keep loving people and keep loving them, even though they're mistreating you. Here's the person who is a neighbor, and this person is doing something wrong to you and all of that. Just keep being friendly to that person. Keep loving them. Don't do anything to embarrass them. Just keep loving them, and they can't stand it too long. Oh, they react in many ways in the beginning. They react with bitterness because they're mad because you love them like that. They react with guilt feelings, and sometimes they'll hate you a little more at that transition period, but just keep loving them. And by the power of your love they will break down under the load.
That's love, you see. It is redemptive, and this is why Jesus says love. There's something about love that builds up and is creative. There is something about hate that tears down and is destructive. I do not claim to know how Candace Owens or anyone else associated with Blexit conducts him or herself in daily life, in daily interactions. I make no moral judgement against individuals who believe in the Blexit cause. I do not even profess total innocence of having participated in or contributed to toxic or divisive political rhetoric with words I have written or spoken.
But I will say that any movement that is truly concerned with changing people's hearts and minds from what it believes is wrong to what it believes is right must be defined by love, compassion, empathy, and kindness. Especially for those with whom there is the most disagreement. Especially for those from whom the strongest opposition comes.
A black Democrat who wandered into the Blexit conference out of curiosity would not have felt welcomed or cared for. They would have felt insulted and attacked. People are rarely convinced of anything by being told how stupid they are for how they think and what they believe.
Owens is a young activist, and Blexit is a young movement. Both could, and likely will, evolve over time as they grow in age and stature. And I hope they do. I believe there is value to be found in the content of the movement, even with the presentation currently leaving something to be desired.
Black people don't have to be Democrats. Many black people do inherit an affiliation with the Democratic Party without much critical thought because of their race. And there needs to be more dialogue about why that is and how to respond to it within the black community.
But that conversation can't only happen with conservatives among themselves. We can't just huddle up in conferences and rallies to discuss how bad the other side is. That other side has to be reached out to and welcomed with love and good faith, regardless of whether that love is reciprocated."

Crowder explained that he takes issue with the disproportionate power wielded by an ever-decreasing minority that has been over-represented in the media and academia.
Hundreds of students attended Crowder's ""Change My Mind"" event, and there were only three incidents that involved triggered protesters who sought to disrupt the event. One protester in particular came dangerously close to assault when she snatched a man's MAGA hat from his head, and proceeded to tell campus police that she felt unsafe and told every one that she felt triggered and unsafe.
Crowder questioned her decision to attend the event if the atmosphere made her feel unsafe and explained that in his recent experience, the college campus climate seemed to be evolving into far fewer triggered protesters, and far more students who sought productive conversations with fellow students on the opposite side of the political aisle.
""She sought this place out,"" Crowder said.
The dean of students also approached Crowder and attempted to shut down the event on the grounds that students felt unsafe and that in her opinion, Crowder did not have a permit for the two speakers.
The takeaway
Ultimately, Crowder noted there is a silver lining to this video. He said the vast majority of students displayed a genuine desire to engage in dialogue, and the vast majority showed they were not aligned with the triggered protesters who were trying to shut down freedom of speech.

Shocking: Joanna Rodriguez explains the tragic reality in Venezuela - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/why/shocking-details-from-venezuela,"Tuesday, on ""The News & Why it Matters,"" Joanna Rodriguez, a political commentator who grew up in Venezuela, joined to share some insight on what is really going on in Venezuela today.
In this clip, graphic video footage showed protesters being run down in the street by military tanks. Host Sara Gonzales asked Joanna about the fear she must live in considering that her family lives in Venezuela. Rodriquez replied:
What is scary is that you don't have connection with them (family) because the internet connection is spotty, they can only communicate really through What's App whenever they have the ability to communicate with us ... after that image was shown, it was being broadcast on CNN and I think that it is important to note that CNN International was cut off after that in Venezuela, so they did a blackout and I believe that BBC International was as well. Watch the full episode here .
Rodriguez added she had been berated on Twitter for speaking out against Venezuela and had faced questions about why she did not support American intervention in Venezuela.
Rodriguez said also that, though many Democrats are speaking out against the dictator in Venezuela and have called for him to step down, far-left Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders are remaining silent."
US Secretary of State Pompeo threatens military action in Venezuela 'if that's what's required' - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pompeo-threatens-military-action-in-venezuela,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that U.S. military action in Venezuela was ""possible"" if the U.S. government determined that it was ""required.""
What's happening in Venezuela? Venezuela has been suffering from a cycle of increasing poverty exacerbated by the socialist policies of the country's dictator, Nicolás Maduro. Although Maduro was legally elected in 2013 to replace his mentor, Hugo Chavez, his 2018 election was denounced by both Venezuelan opposition leaders and the international community as being a sham.
After the election, the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, declared himself to be the rightful interim president , according to the rules laid out in the Venezuelan constitution. The U.S. government has expressed support for Guaido.
On Tuesday , Guaido called for Venezuelan citizens and the military to rise up and overthrow Maduro. Maduro's forces began fighting back against pro-Guaido supporters.
What did Pompeo say? So far, the United States has avoided getting directly involved, but Pompeo indicated that this could change if the U.S. determined it was necessary.
On Wednesday morning, Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo asked Pompeo if the U.S. might at any point decide that military action was necessary.
""The president has been crystal clear, and incredibly consistent,"" Pompeo responded. ""Military action is possible. If that's what's required, that's what the United States will do. We're trying to do everything we can to avoid violence.""
He also said the U.S. prefers ""a peaceful transition of government there, where Maduro leaves and a new election is held"" but added that the president was prepared to authorize military intervention ""if that's what's required.""
Pompeo also told Fox News on Tuesday that Maduro had been trying to flee Venezuela rather than risk facing opposition forces.
""He had an airplane on the tarmac, he was ready to leave this morning as we understand it and the Russians indicated he should stay,"" Pompeo said, adding that Maduro had been ""headed for Havana.""
Russia and Cuba have been among Maduro's few allies through the recent events. The U.S. has been urging Russia not to get involved in the Venezuelan conflict, following a longstanding U.S. policy of trying to prevent European influence in Latin America dating back to the President James Monroe, and the Monroe Doctrine."
HS students blasted for dressing as Mexican 'aliens' on 'Extraterrestrial Day': 'They knew d**n well it was potentially offensive',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/hs-students-blasted-for-dressing-as-mexican-aliens-on-extraterrestrial-day-they-knew-d-n-well-it-was-potentially-offensive,"Administrators at a Florida school district blasted a pair of students who wore sombreros — and one of them a mustache — for Seminole High School's ""Extraterrestrial Day"" last week, calling them out for ""cultural insensitivity"" and saying the costumes were ""offensive,"" Bay News 9 reported .
Pinellas County School District spokeswoman Lisa Wolf-Chason added her statement to the station that the students exercised poor judgment.
What happened?
Photos of the students spread on social media, with one including a caption that reads: ""Was it wrong of us to dress as Mexicans for extraterrestrial day/alien day? Yes, are you dumb / No, that's funny,"" Bay 9 News said.
Image source: Bay News 9 video screenshot
Administrators confiscated the sombreros and the mustache, the station reported, but they were allowed to finish the school day, Wolf-Chason told the station.
It isn't clear what, if any, discipline will follow, but Wolf-Chason told Bay News 9 that the district will ""follow the Student Code of Conduct to address this issue.""
""Extraterrestrial Day"" was part of the school's prom week during which each day featured different festivities, the station said.
Image source: Bay News 9 video screenshot
What did one activist have to say?
Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, told the station he hopes the students get sensitivity training.
""We need to make sure that they understand that it's not just a joke,"" Garcia told Bay News 9. ""Bullying and especially bigotry bullying is not a joke. It's better just to say, 'You know what? We're going to respect our differences.'""
Image source: Bay News 9 video screenshot
He added to the station that the phrase ""illegal alien"" is outdated and no longer should be used.
""We're talking about immigrants, refugees, who are coming across the border, women and children,"" he said. ""To try to put them in that category of 'aliens,' somebody different, somebody not like us, again plays to that division and that bigotry that we've seen too much in this country.""
What did students and former students have to say? ""They knew damn well it was potentially offensive to do what they did,"" graduate Denni Romulo told Bay News 9. ""This is racist and demeaning, and I won't shut up about it.""
Student Madeline Harnisher added to the station that she's ""not allowed to wear holes in my jeans or leggings to school, but kids are allowed to dress completely racist? It just amazes me how messed up our school is.""
""This is not OK,"" graduate Brandi-Shea Figueiredo told Bay News 9. ""I'm ashamed to say that I graduated there."""
Black professor who once said first responders should let white victims ‘f***ing die’ now says ‘whiteness is terrorism’,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-professor-whiteness-is-terrorism,"Trinity College professor Johnny Eric Williams believes that ""whiteness is terrorism,"" if we're to believe sentiments on his Twitter feed.
According to Campus Reform , Williams — a professor of sociology — posted the tweet on Sunday. Williams has since made his Twitter account private, but The Hartford Courant has a record of his remarks.
The college in Hartford, Connecticut, previously placed him on leave after making inflammatory comments across his social media platforms.
What did he say? On Twitter, the controversial professor wrote, ""All self-identified white people (no exceptions) are invested in and collude with systemic white racism/white supremacy.""
The outlet also reported that Williams followed up the tweet with ""all self-identified white people (no exceptions) are invested in and collude with systematic white racism/white supremacy.""
That wasn't all: Williams also pointed the finger at former President Barack Obama and wife, Michelle. The Courant reported that Williams wrote, ""I'm referring to [Candace Owens] and other less brazen but more insidious dangerous 'white' kneegrows like Barry and Michelle Obama and many other white kneegrows you encounter daily.""
Williams received heavy fire in 2017 after he tweeted that first responders should just let white victims ""f***ing die"" simply because they are white.
What else?
Campus Reform spoke to a member of the school's College Republicans about the professor's latest incendiary remarks.
""Everyone really questions, even liberals, why is he still here?"" the unnamed student said. ""I think that's kind of a question a lot of people are asking is, he advocated for white genocide, why is he still here?""
The student added, ""I think if you ask anyone on campus that is not as radical as he is, they will be like 'He needs to go,' which is interesting because at Trinity College, most students are pretty apathetic toward really everything, so to have such a high defensive that an individual needs to go, that really says something.""
The student said that Williams' ""behavior is horrible,"" adding that he ""needs to be checked by the administration.""
According to the student, who said they have taken a class with the professor before, Williams is known for failing students for no reason and requiring students to sign a waiver stating they may not discuss or email about what is said in class.
Trinity College President Joanne Berger-Sweeney told Campus Reform that it's important to foster debate when it comes to ""controversial"" speech.
""Trinity College supports academic freedom and free expression and inquiry, which are hallmarks of academia and democratic society,"" Berger-Sweeney said. ""When speech proves controversial, our responsibility as educators is to promote more debate and discussion, not less. Twitter is a challenging place for a thoughtful discourse, which is clear from this example."""
Trump administration changes rules for federal employees taking time off for religious observation,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-administration-changes-rules-for-federal-employees-taking-time-off-for-religious-observation,"The Trump administration has changed the rules governing federal employees taking time off for religious observances. These new rules should make it harder for federal employers to arbitrarily refuse to approve religious leave.
What are the details? The Office of Personnel Management has issued new rules regarding federal employees who request time off for religious observance.
Former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama tried unsuccessfully to implement similar policy updates.
In a memo announcing the new regulations, OPM Acting Director Margaret Weichert said that the clarifications in the new rules would ""help agencies to become careful stewards of taxpayer dollars."" She also said the new rules would ""serve to highlight an important flexibility that can be used to help agencies recruit and retain employees that want to attend religious observances,""
Some of these guidelines, including allowing employees to make up time spent on religious leave with overtime work, had already been in practice, but OPM decided that they needed to be further clarified.
Under the new rules, employers will have to put in writing why they denied requests for religious time off. Employees will also have to write down the ""name and/or description"" of the religious event that requires them to take off of work. This, OPM argued, ""will balance the religious needs of the employee with the agency's ability to accomplish its mission."" Employees can then make up the time they took off for their religious observance.
What else? Notably, federal employees who apply for time off don't need to list a religious reason in line with any particular religious group. Instead, these decisions can be left up to the employee's personal conviction.
""It is sufficient that the employee's sincerely held personal religious beliefs cause the employee to feel an obligation that he or she should be absent from work for a religious purpose,"" Weichert noted.
It also slightly changed the definition of overtime to make religious leave more accessible to employees who may not get paid for additional hours of work.
The new rules will take effect on May 29."
Marines looking to integrate male and female recruits during boot camp,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/marines-looking-to-integrate-male-and-female-recruits-during-boot-camp,"The U.S. Marine Corps is considering scrapping its longstanding practice of having male and female recruits train separately during boot camp, after its first coed class reportedly graduated without a hitch.
What are the details? On March 29, the Marine Corps' first mixed-gender training battalion graduated from boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina. According to Military.com , the experiment of weaving female recruits into traditionally all-male units ""could serve as a model for more co-ed training companies moving forward.""
Lt. Gen. David Berger — the nominee for incoming Marine Corps commandant — addressed the issue during his Senate confirmation hearing before the Armed Services Committee Tuesday, saying such a policy change could occur sooner rather than later.
During the hearing, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) requested that Berger provide a brief summary of how the Parris Island experiment went, and asked, ""If confirmed, based on those results, would you pursue further gender integration during Marine Corps basic?""
""That company graduated a few weeks ago,"" Berger replied, ""We started with about 50 females as part of the company, as you're probably aware, ma'am. We measure the same things in every company that goes through there: how well they did physically, how many injuries they had, all those sorts of things.
""The statistics — to answer immediately, your question — for this company were the same as any other company,"" the nominee continued. ""There were a few areas higher, a few areas lower, but it went great. The program of instruction that we use in the Marine Corps, we didn't change. We just changed where they were billeted, and it all worked out.""
Berger said he had just spoken with the acting commandant about further gender integration.
""What I asked him is, we need to look at this perhaps for next year and he said 'absolutely.' So, I think it's a discussion he and I will have and the Marine Corps will have, but the class that entered in January and graduated a few weeks ago did very well,"" Berger said.
Anything else? Military.com noted that Marine officer candidates already train together, but ""the service remains the only branch to train its female and male enlistees in separate units."""
Fire chief in small Georgia community — uncomfortable as a man — began 'medically transitioning' three years ago,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/georgia-fire-chief-transitions-to-female,"The city of Byron in Peach County, Georgia, is described by WMAZ-TV as ""small."" Indeed, the 2010 census shows its population is just over 4,500 .
But one individual from Byron is making headlines: The city's transgender fire chief, Rachel Mosby, who's led the department for the last 11 years but began ""medically transitioning"" in 2016.
The station noted that Mosby was uncomfortable as a man.
""I mostly grew up in a small town, smaller than the one I live in now, and information wasn't available, and it wasn't something you just went and asked grownups about,"" Mosby told WMAZ. ""There just wasn't information sources for this stuff.""
Image source: WMAZ-TV video screenshot
Mosby didn't want to go into details about life before the transition, saying the man during that period simply doesn't exist anymore, the station said.
How did the chief's fellow fire station employees react? ""I needed to be able to trust them with this the way that I ask them to trust me every day when they come to work,"" Mosby told WMAZ. ""These people are like my family here at the fire department. We're all family, and it's the same thing like going to family with that, and I think that the majority of the reluctance on my part had to do with my own underestimation of their character, and in the end, it wound up not being as big of a deal as I thought it was.""
Image source: WMAZ-TV video screenshot
Firehouse sleeping arrangements haven't changed, WMAZ said, noting that everyone changes clothes in the bathroom, both of which are unisex.
Mosby also talked about the transition to city department heads, which the station characterized as a ""perceived tough task in a small town in the Bible Belt.""
But Mosby told WMAZ that wasn't the case: ""What I've found is that allies and friends have come from some of the most unexpected places.""
Why is Mosby speaking out? ""It's important to have visibility for those that can't. There [are] a lot of folks that are unable to be visible with their transition because of a lot of different reasons,"" Mosby noted to the station. ""And then there's people that are afraid of everything that goes with it — it's not always smooth for everyone that follows this path.""
Image source: WMAZ-TV video screenshot
'I've never seemed happier in my life' Mosby added to WMAZ that life is better following the transition, and it's been rewarding to be a leader in the transgender community.
""Everybody who knows me or has known me for some time says I've never seemed happier in my life,"" Mosby said.

Alabama House passes strictest anti-abortion law in nation — with hopes it could overturn Roe v. Wade,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/alabama-abortion-bill,"The Alabama House overwhelmingly passed a bill Tuesday that would become the nation's most strict law against abortion to date.
What are the details? The bill, dubbed the ""The Alabama Human Life Protection Act,"" seeks to criminalize all abortions except in rare cases where the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother.
If the life of the mother is not at stake, then doctors who perform abortions would be guilty of a Class A felony, while doctors who attempt abortions would be guilty of a Class C felony under the law.
The Alabama House approved the legislation by a vote of 74-3, according to AL.com . The vote took place after most Democrats left the legislative chamber following heated debate with Republicans.
""Abortion advocates speak to women's rights, but they ignore the unborn child, while medical science has increasingly recognized the humanity of the unborn child,"" the bill states. ""Recent medical advances prove a baby's heart starts to beat at around six weeks. At about eight weeks, the heartbeat can be heard through an ultrasound examination. A fetal Doppler can detect a fetal heartbeat as early as 10 weeks.""
The bill also highlights the importance of protecting unborn lives, explaining that abortion in the U.S. is one of the greatest acts of genocide the world has witnessed.
""[M]ore than 50 million babies have been aborted in the United States since the Roe decision in 1973, more than three times the number who were killed in German death camps, Chinese purges, Stalin's gulags, Cambodian killing fields, and the Rwandan genocide combined,"" the bill says.
However, the bill would not punish women who receive abortions. In fact, it would protect them from both legal and civil recourse.
Alabama currently has only three health clinics licensed to perform abortions.
The bill heads next heads to the Alabama Senate for approval.
What's the purpose of the bill? Aside from extending protections for unborn lives, and outright criminalizing abortion, Alabama state Rep. Terri Collins (R) said the legislation's major goal is to force litigation before the Supreme Court with hopes Roe v. Wade will finally be overturned, AL.com reported.
And there is a good possibility of that happening.
In additional to controlling the Alabama State Legislature with super-majorities, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) is almost guaranteed to sign the bill into law, forcing instantaneous litigation from civil rights groups who advocate for abortion rights, and eventually, a challenge before the Supreme Court.
The American Civil Liberties Union has already vowed to fight the law."

Is the calendar available now? The September 2018 to December 2019 version is available now.
But since some from the younger generation need extra direction, this is your reminder that the September 2019 to December 2020 calendar comes out next month.
Sorry, but I don't have a sticker to send you for remembering to buy one.
What else? Calm down. We know it's supposed to be tongue-in-cheek."
Trump wants another $4.5 billion from Congress in new emergency border security funding,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-wants-billions-more-in-emergency-border-funding,"President Donald Trump has asked Congress for $4.5 billion in emergency funding for border security. This is in addition to the money he previously reallocated using an emergency declaration.
What's the context? In February , Trump announced that he was declaring a national emergency in order to get border security funding that Congress had denied him. Congress had agreed to $1.375 billion, but Trump had wanted $5.7 billion. This impasse led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.
The shutdown ended only when Trump agreed to sign a spending bill with some border security funding into law, and then circumvent Congress and use a national emergency declaration to move about $6 billion to securing the border.
Even members of Trump's own party, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), tried to discourage him from using this drastic measure, arguing that a future president could use a similar emergency declaration to force through policies of their own.
In March, Trump indicated that he would ask Congress for $8.6 billion in additional funding to be used for the construction of a border wall.
Now he's requesting $4.5 in additional emergency funds for securing the border.
What happened now? In his request for emergency funding, the Washington Post reported , White House acting budget director Russ Vought wrote, ""the situation becomes more dire each day. The migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis is rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond.""
This new funding would include $1.1 billion for border security, $3.3 billion for humanitarian assistance, and $377 million for Department of Defense and National Guard work at the border.
Vought argued that without a cash infusion, the Department of Health and Human Services would soon be unable to maintain all of its current programs and also provide child welfare services for illegal immigrant children. He painted a picture of ""thousands of children"" stuck ""for lengthy periods of time in facilities that were never intended to be long-term shelters"" if this funding wasn't approved.
With the Democrats in charge of the House of Representatives, it is not clear if Trump can get that $4.5 billion without triggering another budget crisis."
"Ilhan Omar angrily blames Trump and GOP for anti-Semitism, Islamophobia: ‘This is not going to be the country of white people.’",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ilhan-omar-angrily-blames-trump-and-gop-for-anti-semitism-islamophobia-this-is-not-going-to-be-the-country-of-white-people,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) lashed out at President Donald Trump and the Republican Party during a Tuesday event organized by Black Lives Matter.
What did she say? The freshman congresswoman said that Trump and his political allies are to blame for a surge in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the U.S.
Fellow freshman lawmaker Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was also in attendance at the event, which was held at the Capitol and called ""Black Women in Defense of Ilhan Omar.""
""The occupant of the White House ... and his allies are doing everything that they can to distance themselves and misinform the public from the monsters that they created that is terrorizing the Jewish community and the Muslim community,"" Omar said, according to NBC News .
She added that talking about anti-Semitism is the same as discussing Islamophobia.
""[W]hen we talk about anti-Semitism, we must also talk about Islamophobia,"" Omar insisted. ""It is two sides of the same coin of bigotry.""
The congresswoman went on to point out that she will not stand for the U.S. being ""the country of white people.""
""This is not going to be the country of the xenophobics. This is not going to be the country of white people. This is not going to be the country of the few. This is going to be the country of the many,"" she demanded.
What else? Omar also said that she is a living example of what happens when you are targeted for your religion.
""The thing that upsets the occupant in the White House, his goons in the Republican Party, many of our colleagues in the Democratic Party is that they can't stand ... that a refugee, a black woman, an immigrant, a Muslim shows up in Congress thinking she's equal to them,"" Omar added.
Omar herself stands accused of using anti-Semitic language.

Barr confirms ‘multiple criminal investigations’ to find Russia probe leakers are under way,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/barr-confirms-multiple-criminal-investigations-to-find-russia-probe-leakers,"In his first congressional appearance since the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on his investigation into Russian election interference, Attorney General William Barr told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that his department is actively looking for officials who made unauthorized leaks to the media.
""We have multiple criminal leak investigations under way,"" Barr said when asked by former committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) what his team is doing to address leaks to the media from sources within the FBI and Department of Justice throughout the course of the Russia investigation.
Barr, however, did not explain which leaks from the 22-month investigation are currently being investigated.
Grassley's question followed up on a letter he sent to Barr last week asking whether or not the attorney general was looking into ""whether DOJ or FBI officials had unauthorized contacts with the media"" during the course of the Russia investigation.
""Much of DOJ's work involves non-public, sensitive matters,"" a Department of Justice outline of the agency's confidentiality and media contacts policy states. ""Disseminating non-public, sensitive information about DOJ matters could violate federal laws, employee non-disclosure agreements, and individual privacy rights; put a witness or law enforcement officer in danger; jeopardize an investigation or case; prejudice the rights of a defendant; or unfairly damage the reputation of a person.""
""DOJ personnel should presume that non-public, sensitive information obtained in connection with work is protected from disclosure, except as needed to fulfill official duties of DOJ personnel, and as allowed by court order, statutory or regulatory prescription, or case law and rules governing criminal and civil discovery,"" the DOJ document continues.
In April, House Intelligence ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) sent a letter to Barr outlining eight criminal referrals in relation to the Russian interference investigation, which included ""global leaks"" among several other allegations."
"'Avengers: Endgame' wraps up more than 10 years of Marvel promoting duty, honor, courage, and truth. But beware the 'woke' crowd's plans for the future.",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/avengers-endgame-wraps-up-more-than-10-years-of-marvel-promoting-duty-honor-courage-and-truth-but-beware-the-woke-crowds-plans-for-the-future,"It was the most brilliant of sunsets, the cinematic likes of which we may never see again.
I'm, of course, talking about ""Avengers: Endgame."" Gratitude was the overwhelming feeling I had upon viewing the final chapter of a decade-long journey. And that feeling ironically was strengthened all the more by the virtue signaling from those involved in the production of the film, that likely signals the future of the Marvel Universe will include its own perilous, entertainment-killing version of Thanos' snap. More on that later.
For now, though, I truly can't believe we made it this far in the MCU with traditional themes like duty, honor, courage, and truth winning the day, considering how so much of the present age is tyrannically begging for those themes to be woke-afied. Our real-time pursuit of such dangerous nonsense is the non-fiction snap that our country and Western civilization in general endures day after day after day.
So very much that is good is simply being willed out of existence.
Yet truth still found a way on the big screen and, thus, in many of our hearts as well. And because it did, whatever happens after this in the MCU will be judged against it. And the glory of what we just witnessed will stand out all the more because of it.
Thanos was Malthusian ethics and Margaret Sanger's ramblings incarnate. In other words, the big bad of the greatest cinematic achievement ever was the very spirit of the age progressivism much of those in the leftist film industry seek to promote. Humanity didn't flourish after we cut down the surplus population like the firm of Malthus/Sanger/Thanos promised, but never recovered from the loss.
Even more ironic, the only way to stop Thanos was for Tony Stark to demonstrate no greater love by laying down his life for his friends. And Stark only came to a place where he could show that much courage after, in his words, ""he got a life."" How did he finally grow up? He set aside the hedonism, acclaim, and materialism that once ruled over for him for a wife and family. In other words, Tony Stark became the hero by embracing the very values spirit of the age progressivism believes to be on the wrong side of history.
I couldn't be more satisfied with the conclusion to this epic saga, which is why I'm also prepared for how some of those who made it happen will likely go about rebuking their own work with what's to come. Whether it's MCU godfather Kevin Feige more than dropping hints that sanctimonious SJW-ing is on the horizon. Or Captain Marvel actress Brie Larson, who makes Alyssa Milano look like Socrates when it comes to white progressive self-parody, poised to become the face of the MCU's future. It sadly appears they could be set to ruin a good thing with the comic book movies like they already did the comic books themselves.
While I hope I'm wrong about that, and will be saddened if I'm not, we'll still have these 22 films to fall back on. Those belong to us, and they can't snap their fingers and take them away."

Eric asked about current front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden's chances of unseating the president in the 2020 election.
""We're not scared of 'Job-killing Joe',"" Kayleigh answered. ""You look back on his job-killing record ... he likes to act like he's for blue-collar workers but he supported NAFTA, and that killed a million jobs. He supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That would've killed another half a million. So, for someone who's so middle class, so blue-collar, you've killed an awful lot of jobs there, Joe.""
Kayleigh also dismissed Democratic candidate Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' chances.
""When you look at Bernie Sanders, he's a supporter of socialism, a vowed, declared supporter of socialism, which has a 25 percent approval rating in the country,"" she said. ""He wants to allow terrorists to vote from their prison cells, including rapists, including murderers can vote from their prison cells. [He's for] infanticide, abortion until birth.
""The Democrats are quickly becoming the party of the 15 percent. So best of luck winning a national election,"" Kayleigh added. ""We're often asked, 'Who do we fear the most?' None of them.""

220 Houston firefighters hit with layoff notices after voters approve pay raises,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/220-houston-firefighters-laid-off-after-voters-pass-pay-raises,"The Houston City Council gave the all clear for issuing layoff notices to 220 firefighters last week, as leaders struggle with how to fund sweeping pay raises approved by voters in November.
 Last fall, Houstonians passed Proposition B , a measure that requires the city's firefighters to be compensated on the same level as police officers of corresponding rank and experience.
Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association President Mary Lancton argued ahead of the vote that ""as city politicians found ways to increase pay for police officers by 37 percent since 2011, our pay has risen by only 3 percent in that time.""
The problem is ""the cost of Proposition B is $80 to 100 million with no new funding source,"" Mayor Sylvester Turner argued last week, after the City Council voted 10 to 6 in favor of handing out pink slips and demotions to cover the costs of granting the required pay hikes to the remaining 3,700 firefighters, KHOU-TV reported.
The mayor added, ""We don't want to lay off anyone.""
The firefighters' union called the vote ""one of the most reckless political stunts in Houston history.""
Turner previously warned that ""Implementing Prop B for the next fiscal year starting July 1 will add another $80 million to the expected budget gap now projected to be $197 million,"" KPRC-TV reported. In order to balance the budget, he says, it's not just firefighters who have to be let go.
""Based on initial projections,"" he wrote in a mid-March statement, ""the city anticipates having to lay off 400 to 500 firefighters and [other] municipal employees.""
According to KTRK-TV , Fire Chief Sam Pena began delivering notices to those on the chopping block via email on Tuesday, in a letter which read, in part, ""I am sorry to have to notify you that your position is being eliminated.""
But city leaders say some or all of the terminations could be rescinded if the union would allow the new pay requirements to be introduced over a period of five years, rather than over three years.
Chief Pena issued a statement after sending the layoff emails, saying, ""This is the most difficult thing I have had to do in my career. ... I hope we can reach an agreement with the Fire Union to phase-in the full implementation of Proposition B and avoid the layoffs.""
Anything else? A fact-check conducted by the Houston Chronicle in 2018 showed that the city's first-year firefighters receive ""29 percent less than the Texas big-city average"" in salary. The union has argued such disparity means the department is losing good, seasoned firefighters to other municipalities, which offer better compensation and benefits.
The Chronicle also noted, ""Regardless of whether the parity measure passes, Houston's expenses have outpaced its revenues for years.""
The city's annual budget is $5.4 billion, $500 million of which is dedicated to the fire department."
