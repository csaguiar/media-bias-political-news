"Adele husband, Simon Konecki, have separated: report",www.foxnews.com,Julius Young,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/adele-and-husband-simon-konecki-have-separated-report,"The pop singer’s representatives Benny Tarantini and Carl Fysh confirmed the news Friday in a statement to The Associated Press. “Adele and her partner have separated,” the emailed statement said. “They are committed to raising their son together lovingly.
""As always they ask for privacy. There will be no further comment.”
The British songstress announced her marriage to her longtime partner, Konecki, during a concert in Brisbane, Australia, in 2017 and thanked Konecki during the 2017 Grammys, calling him her “husband” at the awards ceremony.
""I was trying to remember how it was I felt at the beginning of the relationship that inspired that record,” Adele said at the time. ""Because as bad as a break-up can be and as bitter and horrible and messy as it can be, that feeling when you first fall for someone is the best feeling on earth, and I am addicted to that feeling. Obviously, I can&apos;t go through with those feelings because I&apos;m married now.""
Adele and Konecki had been together since 2011 and welcomed a son, Angelo, in 2012.

More ripples in state attorney's office follow Jussie Smollett case,www.foxnews.com,Matt Finn,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/more-ripples-in-state-attorneys-office-after-smollett-case,"Cook County Inspector General, Patrick Blanchard, is reviewing Kim Foxx’s office’s decisions during the Smollett case. Two separate petitions have been filed in Cook County for a special prosecutor to investigate the case, and President Trump says he’s asked for a federal review. And now, another criminal case that Foxx’s office is prosecuting raises new questions about Foxx’s personal and professional relationship with another alleged Chicago victim that her office might not be prosecuting to the fullest extent. At an April 6 rally for Foxx lead by The Rev. Jesse Jackson at his Rainbow Push headquarters on the south side of Chicago, Foxx posed for at least one picture and stood alongside known Chicago activist Jedidiah Brown.
Foxx’s office is currently prosecuting 32-year-old Brown for allegedly assaulting Chicago police officers David Alvarez and Jeffrey Shafer while Brown resisted arrest in July 2018.
Following the April event at Rainbow Push, Brown posted this picture with Foxx to Facebook with the caption ""Let the record reflect, I stand with Kim Foxx. Blue Klux Klan we aren&apos;t going without a fight you&apos;ll never forget!""
Attorney James McKay, who represents the two police officers who Brown allegedly assaulted, tells Fox News the picture of Brown and Foxx just looks bad.
“This is not right. The guy’s got a criminal case pending. A prosecutor has the duty to avoid the slightest appearance of impropriety. Not be with him. Period. It’s just improper,” McKay told Fox News.
McKay filed a petition in Cook County criminal court this week requesting that Foxx’s office be removed from the Brown case and a special prosecutor assigned. The president judge could rule on the petition as early as Tuesday.
McKay’s petition indicates that on July 19, 2018, Brown and a “band of protesters” did not comply with Chicago police officers’ requests to limit a demonstration they organized in the city to areas that would not impede with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Police say they warned Brown and his group multiple times not to interfere with traffic. The warnings were audio recorded and videotaped, according to McKay’s petition.
Police allege Brown was aggressive, defiant and resistant to police commands to march peacefully, resulting in his arrest in which Brown kicked and punched the police officers. McKay tells Fox News he has obtained an online video that shows Brown preparing to potentially physically engage with police by removing his jewelry on his way to the protest.
McKay says after Brown’s arrest, as detectives investigated, Chicago police held Brown on felony charges of aggravated battery against two on-duty police officers but high ranking members of Foxx’s staff showed up and rejected the felony charges police recommended — despite what McKay says is abundant amount supporting video evidence for felony charges. Brown’s attorney, Michael Oppenheimer, acknowledges to Fox News there is some type of videos that exist. Their exact content is not clear.
Brown was charged with two counts of lesser misdemeanor battery, one count resisting arrest and one count of obstruction of traffic, McKay tells Fox News. Brown’s assault charges are pending in Cook County criminal court.
Oppenheimer tells Fox News his client is innocent of the charges. “All the allegations in the criminal complaint, they are unfounded,” Oppenheimer said.
Oppenheimer says he can’t comment on direct details of the case but he is taking it to trial and says taking a picture with Foxx is not a conflict of interest. “I think having a photograph together with the State’s Attorney, lots of people do, it’s really not a conflict of interest. Kim Foxx takes photos with lots of people. That’s up for the judge to decide.”
It appears Brown and Foxx’s relationship might go beyond taking a picture and appearing together at Foxx’s April rally. McKay writes in his complaint that Brown and Foxx had a working relationship during Foxx’s campaign for state’s attorney in 2015. Fox News cannot confirm the exact relationship between the Brown and Foxx, however Brown is quoted in this Al Jazeera article saying “we worked hard to get Kim Foxx elected,” and Brown is seen in this photograph just days before the Kim Foxx event facing off with police at a police protest against Kim Foxx outside of her downtown office.
Fox News made multiple requests to Kim Foxx’s office for comment or guidance but emails and phone calls were not returned.

Trump to nominate Shanahan as permanent defense secretary: sources,www.foxnews.com,Lucas Tomlinson,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-to-nominate-shanahan-as-permanent-defense-secretary-sources,"Shanahan worked at Boeing for over 30 years before coming to the Pentagon as then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s deputy at the start of the Trump administration. Shanahan’s nomination had been held up by the White House since the Pentagon inspector general opened an investigation into Shanahan’s conduct following a report in Politico days after taking over for Mattis alleging Shanahan called Boeing-rival Lockheed Martin’s advanced F-35 program “f—ed up” and said the company didn’t know how to run a defense program following years of cost overruns and delays to the fifth-generation fighter jet.
Shanahan has been serving as acting defense chief since the president forced Jim Mattis to leave the job early following his resignation in December.
Shanahan faces a potentially contentious confirmation hearing in the Republican-controlled Senate in order to assume the role as defense secretary.
President Trump found an early supporter and point man in Shanahan for the creation of a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force.
In an exclusive interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier, Shanahan spoke about his urgency in developing the new branch.
“We have a $19 trillion economy that runs on space. Our military runs on space. It is vitally important,” said Shanahan. “[The] Chinese and Russians are deploying capability to put our economy and our military at risk in the time of crisis.”
Asked for comment a spokesman for the acting defense secretary would not answer the question directly if Shanahan was expecting to be nominated next week.
""Acting Secretary Shanahan remains focused SOLELY on the Department, on our global military options, on our servicemembers, civilians, and their families,"" said Army Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino.
A defense official added Shanahan will be “ready for a confirmation hearing, should he be nominated.”

Body of missing Ohio teen found in shallow grave near farm,www.foxnews.com,Paulina Dedaj,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/body-of-missing-ohio-teen-found-buried-in-a-shallow-grave-near-farm,"The body of 14-year-old Jonathan Minard was discovered around 10:15 a.m. near a farm in Washington Township, the Carroll County Sheriff&apos;s Office confirmed in a news release. Police gave few details surrounding the discovery but said the remains were transferred to the Cuyahoga County medical examiner for an autopsy. It could take several weeks before the results are released.
Jonathan Minard was last seen April 13 helping a 29-year-old friend on the dairy farm of the friend's dad, authorities say. (Carroll County Sheriff's Office)
“At this time, no further questions will be answered as the investigation remains pending. The Carroll County Sheriff’s Office will continue to gather evidence until the investigation is complete,” the release read.
“Jonathan’s discovery is just the first step in gathering evidence to answer to many unanswered questions that have led us to this moment,"" Carroll County Prosecuting Attorney Steve Barnett said at a news conference.
Jonathan was last seen April 13 helping a 29-year-old friend on the dairy farm of the friend&apos;s dad, authorities said. The teen complained of a toothache and said he&apos;d call his mother at the friend&apos;s house to pick him up.
But Carroll County Sheriff Dale Williams said Jonathan’s mother didn’t receive that call.
On Wednesday investigators identified a person of interest. He is described as a 29-year-old man with a criminal record, consisting of mainly drug offenses, Cleveland&apos;s Fox 8 reported.
It was not immediately clear if the person of interest was the same man whose father owned the farm.
According to Cleveland&apos;s WEWS-TV , the person of interest was questioned twice and agreed to take a polygraph test before later backing out.
Washington Township is about 28 miles southeast of Canton.
