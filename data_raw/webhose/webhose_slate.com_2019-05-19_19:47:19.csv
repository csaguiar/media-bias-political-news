Justice Department indicts judge who helped immigrant evade ICE in her courthouse.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/ice-courthouse-judge-shelley-joseph-indicted.html,"A New Obstruction Case Against a Judge Proves William Barr’s DOJ Is Now Just an Arm of President Donald Trump A Massachusetts judge has been indicted for helping an unauthorized immigrant avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in her own courthouse. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston released the indictment on Thursday, charging Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph with obstruction of justice. Federal prosecutors also secured the indictment of Wesley MacGregor, a court officer, for obstruction and perjury. The charges constitute a remarkable intrusion into the internal affairs of a state judiciary and possible retaliation against Massachusetts’ “sanctuary” policies. Rarely in modern history has the federal government sought to punish a state judge acting in exercise of judicial functions. This prosecution sends a clear threat to state courts around the country that do not want to be commandeered by ICE. Thursday’s charges stem from an incident on April 2, 2018, when Joseph held an arraignment hearing for Jose Medina-Perez, who has resided in the United States unlawfully. Medina-Perez had been arrested on drug charges by police in Newton, Massachusetts, where Joseph presides. Prosecutors initially believed he also had an outstanding warrant for drunk driving. But on April 2, Assistant District Attorney Shannon Jurgens concluded that Medina-Perez was not the individual named in the warrant. She also declined to request that the state hold him the drug charges. So Joseph ordered him released. That’s when the trouble began. Joseph and the attorneys were aware that a plainclothes ICE officer was present to arrest Medina-Perez once the hearing concluded; the judge had asked him to wait outside the courtroom. Before releasing him, Joseph held a sidebar with Medina-Perez’s attorney, David Jellinek. She asked Jellinek, “ICE is gonna get him?” She then asked him “What if we detain him?” Then she had the court recorder turned off for an “off the record” conversation, in apparent violation of the Massachusetts Rules of Court. After the recording resumed, Joseph ordered Medina-Perez released. MacGregor escorted him to a backdoor exit, avoiding the ICE officer just outside the courtroom. Medina-Perez left, successfully evading arrest. Prosecutors allege that Joseph and MacGregor conspired to help the immigrant elude ICE, thereby obstructing justice. (They also claim that MacGregor lied to a grand jury during the ensuing federal investigation.) The indictment alleges that, when the recorder shut off, Joseph and Jellinek (who has not been charged) “discussed devising a way” to help Medina-Perez escape ICE, which had a detainer for his arrest. Joseph’s case is certain to prompt an outcry from civil liberties advocates who oppose ICE’s aggressive invasion of state courthouses to seize immigrants suspected of lacking proper documentation. Newton is a “sanctuary city”—municipal law bars local officials from helping federal agents detain unauthorized immigrants. Moreover, Massachusetts is a partial “sanctuary state,” as the Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that state court officers cannot legally comply with ICE detainers. (These detainers, or “immigration holds,” direct officers to hold immigrants in custody until ICE can retrieve them.) There is, however, a line between refusing to cooperatewith ICE and actively obstructing ICE’s operations. Joseph and MacGregor are alleged to have crossed that line. It is gratifying to see that the Justice Department still believes that obstruction of justice can occur , but this case is a curious one to pursue. Joseph will surely raise the defense of judicial immunity , since judges generally have absolute immunity for actions they take in their official capacity. For that reason, prosecutors are famously hesitant to charge judges for any exercise of their judicial function. To win this case, prosecutors may have to prove that Joseph did not engage in a judicial act when she allowed Medina-Perez to leave out the back door. But judges typically have the power to determine how an individual in custody is released, so the prosecution may prove to be an uphill climb. (Prosecutors will surely cite the fact that Joseph turned the court recorder off, in apparent violation of the court’s rules, as evidence that the judge knew she wasn’t acting in a lawful, official capacity.) This case, then, appears deeply political—a warning to judges who, like Joseph, will not collude with ICE under any circumstances, and may even work to thwart ICE’s goals. Few, if any, contemporary legal disputes involve such a direct clash between federal and state authority; one might need to revisit the Fugitive Slave Act cases to locate a roughly analogous conflict between federal authorities and state courts. While the legal issues here are murky and complex, the message from the Justice Department is clear: State judges who help immigrants evade arrest in jurisdictions with sanctuary policies may themselves wind up behind bars.

Olivia Munn’s attacks on fashion site Go Fug Yourself are bizarre and misplaced.,slate.com,Heather Schwedel,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/olivia-munn-go-fug-yourself-attacks-fashion-criticism-explained.html,"We’re not allowed to say anything about this outfit, just that this is Olivia Munn on April 4 in Los Angeles. Vivien Killilea/Getty Images With an essay she posted to Twitter on Thursday, actress Olivia Munn has sounded a declaration of war. Her target? An independent fashion blog with one-eighth of her following. A short essay on the ugly behaviors of the @fuggirls pic.twitter.com/KfZ5ambMQM — Olivia Munn (@oliviamunn) April 25, 2019 Munn wrote that the blog Go Fug Yourself is “at the forefront” of “the perpetual minimization of women” and that it “shouldn’t get away with spewing vitriol” anymore. “Blogs like theirs have been around for awhile, with their snarkiness and hypocrisy on full display,” Munn wrote. “And we’ve accepted it because as women we’ve been conditioned to believe that being publicly chastised for our weight, our looks, or our choice in clothing is an acceptable part of our existence.” Munn goes on to draw a comparison between the blog and the boys at a Maryland high school who circulated a list that ranked their female classmates by their looks. For anyone who’s ever read Go Fug Yourself, Munn’s choice to focus on the fun, light-hearted, good-spirited blog is a bit of a head-scratcher. The site, despite its somewhat off-color title ( fug is short for “fugly,” or “fucking ugly”), is actually one of the nicest blogs in the fashion and celebrity online ecosystem, and one that has for years made a point of keeping its critiques to the clothes famous people are wearing rather than their looks or their size. For a site that came up in an earlier and meaner internet era when Perez Hilton reigned over the blogosphere, this is an admirable, and rare, stance. Munn accuses the blog of body-shaming, but its writers take pains not to do so in their posts and to root out such behavior in their community. Munn also calls out the Fug girls for perpetuating the idea that women are only as good as their looks, but the site covers—and critiques—both genders. What’s more, Go Fug Yourself is hardly a powerful corporate behemoth that profits hand over fist for taking down everything Olivia Munn wears—it’s essentially a small business, run by its two founders, Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan. It’s influential and well-known on its corner of the internet, but with about 100,000 followers on Twitter, its reach pales in comparison to the 800,000 followers Munn commands. Munn is a movie star, and Cocks and Morgan are a couple of freelance writers trying to make a living. Munn wrote in the essay she posted that “it feels like a losing game to go up against anyone who will inevitably spend a large portion of their time retaliating & further smearing your name across social media,” but it is Cocks and Morgan, not Munn, who stand to face social media harassment or worse after Munn directed her much larger fan base toward them. Munn may get aggressive comments too—that’s social media for you—but she has resources to protect herself that Cocks and Morgan lack. This appears to be the week celebrities with enormous social media followings punch down and single out their critics for harassment. Let's not be coy. Olivia Munn knows exactly what kind of week the @FugGirls are going to have thanks to this. This is irresponsible. ❤️ you, J+H https://t.co/44szBT1PFP — Tom & Lorenzo (@tomandlorenzo) April 25, 2019 On top of all this, I really must emphasize that the site is not attacking celebrities personally .At all. Let’s take a look at some of what Cocks and Morgan have written about Munn in recent months:
Olivia’s hotpants suit looks absurd . For a minute I honestly thought it was a romper; the purse-size pockets don’t look any better now that I know it’s a coat. Notice that this does not say Olivia looks ugly or fat in this outfit, just that it’s “absurd.”
[This outfit] makes [Olivia] look like like [she’s] peeing a wedding veil . Nothing about her looks or body, just an objective description. Seriously, how else is one supposed to describe the random piece of tulle hanging down from between her legs? The bathroom language may fool readers into thinking this is rude, and it certainly is cheeky, but it’s fundamentally a comment about what Munn is wearing, not her.
[A]s a Dowager Countess, I ASSURE YOU that I just looked at this outfit through a lorgnette , made an incredibly disapproving H PH sound, and then tutted off into the garden to do something more useful. “An incredibly disapproving H PH” is an exceedingly polite way of saying that an outfit doesn’t work.
I wish this road up a little higher on her body , and her hair looks like she realized she put in too much product and she just gave up – I’ve been there! – but overall, this is pretty fun. Brutal, right?
Wow, I’d love to see the rest of Olivia Munn’s bathing suit ! (I will note that I love that bomber jacket, although Bra Top and Jacket is a perplexing style choice from a body temperature perspective.)
Olivia Munn showed up at the event fully dressed for A Moment . She’s clad in fresh Prabal Gurung, a fall-color neon version of this springy green frock from the 2019 runway, styled from top to toe. I quite like the sweater, but the skirt isn’t coming together for me — nor, it seems, for her right leg. This all might be in danger of overshadowing her, but I appreciate that she did it up to the nines. She came for the trend pieces.
Well, the best thing I can say about this is that Olivia’s hair is very shiny . Whatever her deep conditioner is, it’s worth every dollar. The dress, though, is just another one of those stretchy skintight Show Us Your Slip contraptions that cease to have any personality after, oh, the first ten of them. And the longer I look at it, the more I see two little paws shooting up from her waistband to fondle her boobs. This is fashion criticism, not body-shaming. It’s not “bad for women” to treat actresses’ clothes and self-presentation as worthy of notice and criticism. Munn herself, for all her protests that she doesn’t want anyone to talk about her clothes, has posted those clothes and their credits on her Instagram account, which shows that she too finds fashion fun and interesting and worth paying attention to—but only if you praise her, apparently. (Unfortunately, Munn joins a wave of celebrities who have confused criticism with harassment in recent weeks. As Alan Zilberman quipped on Twitter , “Between Ariana Grande, Michael Che, Colin Jost, Lizzo, and now Olivia Munn, I’m glad these pampered rich people are displaying genuine courage by punching down at the smallest slight.”) Celebrities’ public and red-carpet appearances are just as much a part of their jobs as their acting roles. When celebrities pose at premieres, promote their movies, and appear on late-night shows, they’re creating personas and brands, and it’s worth noting that some of them are better at that than others, that some stylists are more skilled than others, that some publicists excel at crafting stars’ media personalities. This also, frankly, helps puncture the belief that what stars do is effortless—behind each one stands a team of people propping them up. A good publicist, for example, might have advised Munn that writing a two-page essay about a breezy, not-very-powerful blog was a bad idea. "

The Roberts court is considering the legal reasoning of Jim Crow in the census case.,slate.com,Eric L. Muller,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/john-roberts-supreme-court-census-jim-crow-muslim-ban.html,"Joe Biden Wants to Make America … Great Again? There’s an odious Supreme Court case from 1971, Palmer v. Thompson , that most people don’t remember and that most who do remember wish they could forget. It’s a relic of a bygone era—one of the last pieces of the Jim Crow system that the Supreme Court ever sustained. On our current Supreme Court, Palmer v. Thompson looks to be having a moment. Its reasoning stealthily drove last year’s decision in Trump v. Hawaii , in which the court’s five-justice conservative majority upheld the travel restrictions that the president had planned during the campaign to be a “Muslim ban.” And this week’s oral arguments in the census case suggest that four of the conservative justices who upheld that pretextual ban—and the fifth conservative who replaced Anthony Kennedy—are poised to use the reasoning of both Palmer and that travel ban decision to endorse the administration’s tactic of forcing people to reveal their citizenship status if they simply want to be counted as present in the country. How could a late-stage Jim Crow decision be wreaking such havoc in the 21 st century? Palmer v. Thompson was about a particular racist notion that surfaced in white people in the American South at the idea of being in the water with black people. As late as 1963, the city of Jackson, Mississippi, ran five public pools, all of them for whites only. A lawsuit led a federal judge to declare that black people had the constitutional right to unsegregated use of the city’s pools. Jackson’s political leaders responded not by integrating the pools but by closing them. It was a devilish move that packaged Jackson’s racism in neutral wrapping paper. Closing the pools wasn’t racist, the city argued; it applied equally to everyone. Nobody—black or white—would any longer be able to beat the heat of a Mississippi summer in a Jackson municipal swimming pool. How could a late-stage Jim Crow decision be wreaking such havoc in the 21 st century? Justice William O. Douglas saw the devil in the move: A city can close its pools, he reasoned, but not “for the purpose of perpetuating or installing apartheid .” Justice Byron White agreed. “Shutting down the pools,” he argued, “was nothing more or less than a most effective expression of official policy that Negroes and whites must not be permitted to mingle together.” But their views did not prevail. Justice Hugo Black, writing for a bare majority of five, upheld the city’s decision to shut the pools rather than integrate them. Jackson’s lawyers had come into court arguing that the city closed the pools for administrative, not racial, reasons: It would be too costly to run integrated pools, the city argued, and too unsafe. Justice Black credited those rationalizations. Where a law treats both races equally, as the closure of the pools purportedly did, “the motivations of the men who voted for it” cannot undermine the law’s neutrality. Black also wrote that “it is extremely difficult for a court to ascertain the motivation, or collection of different motivations, that lie behind a legislative enactment.” It is hard not to burst out laughing at this assertion in the context of 1960s Mississippi. Now, improbably, Palmer v. Thompson is back. Consider this week’s oral argument in the census case, Department of Commerce v. New York. The census has many uses, but the most important—the one listed in the Constitution—is the “actual enumeration” of all the people in the country. The census tally drives legislative apportionment, and legislative apportionment drives our democracy. Getting the numbers right is crucial because the tally is enduring. The count won’t happen again for a decade. A Commerce Department intent on getting the numbers right would work to remove barriers to participation in the census rather than build them. But this administration’s Commerce Department intends to ask all respondents whether they are U.S. citizens, something it hasn’t done since 1950. It intends to do this in a climate of concern, even turmoil, over the presence and status of immigrants, especially Hispanic immigrants, in the United States. The president wants to wall off the southern border. Deportation numbers are soaring, and families are being broken apart. The government’s own evidence estimates that the citizenship question will deter between 6 million and 7 million people from responding to the census. And that undercount won’t be politically neutral: Far more of the millions deterred will live in Democratic than Republican areas. That’s the reality. Enter the reasoning of Palmer v. Thompson . The citizenship question, the claim goes, has a purpose other than deterring immigrants from responding. That’s what the government’s lawyer told the Supreme Court this week. The reason for asking about citizenship, said Solicitor General Noel Francisco, was that the data would help the Justice Department enforce a voting rights law, by supplying a number needed for the calculation of something called “citizen voting age population,” or CVAP, that experts are often called on to testify about. There are other sources for the “citizen” piece of the CVAP than the census, but the Commerce Department thinks it would be convenient to use the census to gather the data. This explanation received a warm embrace from justices in the Supreme Court’s conservative majority. “The CVAP … is the critical element in voting rights enforcement,” said Chief Justice John Roberts in pressing a lawyer challenging the citizenship question, as if the existence of some legitimate factor could paper over the reality of the question’s response-suppressing tendencies. Questions with similarly credulous premises came from Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. Observers came away from the argument predicting that the court will allow the citizenship question —in the face of the obvious undercounting of millions (in Democratic-leaning districts). If there’s a facially legitimate reason for an action that will disadvantage those without power—even if it’s not a genuine reason and even if it’s concocted after the fact—that is enough. Actual motivations be damned. This was precisely the reasoning of the conservative five-justice majority in last year’s Trump v. Hawaii decision. The issue there was the legality of the order halting immigration by travelers from a list of Muslim-majority countries. The president had called for a “complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” on the campaign trail. He repeated this sort of rhetoric across the whole campaign and after taking office. His focus on and animus toward Muslims were unmistakable, and the five-justice majority that upheld his actions did not even try to deny them. But again, enter Palmer v. Thompson . The president’s subjective motivations did not undermine the legality of his order because his lawyers managed to cast its provisions in neutral terms that did not single out Muslims as such. The administration added a couple of non–Muslim-majority countries, like North Korea and Venezuela, to the list of affected nations, and said that what got a country on or off the list was not the religion of its population but the quality of certain security-vetting procedures on the ground. It was this veneer of neutrality, rather than the litany of anti-Muslim statements coming from the president’s mouth and Twitter account, that commanded the majority’s attention. “The issue before us,” said the chief justice, was “not whether to denounce the statements.” Rather, the justices in the majority chose to decide whether to credit the surface neutrality of the president’s order. Credit it they did. Just as they appear poised to credit a pretextual defense of the census question. And just as a bare majority, in an earlier day, accepted the ludicrous notion that the city of Jackson, Mississippi, closed its pools to save money rather than to keep black people from swimming with white people. If Palmer v. Thompson stands for anything in our world today, it should stand as a reminder of the evil that can thrive when credulous courts look the other way. Its revival should worry us all.

Report: North Korea demanded $2 million for Otto Warmbier's care.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/north-korea-medical-bill-otto-warmbier.html,"One Reason So Many Democrats Are Running for President: They Don’t Think Joe Biden Can Win As American officials negotiated the release of American college student Otto Warmbier, the North Koreans demanded $2 million for his medical care, the Washington Post reported Thursday. It’s not clear if the U.S. ever paid that bill—a North Korean condition for turning over the comatose University of Virginia student—but the Post did report that President Trump instructed the U.S. envoy sent to collect Warmbier to sign a pledge to do so. Warmbier died six days after his release. The bill was sent to the Treasury Department, where it sat through 2017. It’s possible the Trump administration later made the payment, but other news outlets have reported that the invoice has not been paid. Trump himself has repeatedly bragged that the U.S. paid no money to North Korea when arranging the return of Warmbier and other American citizens held by the state. According to reporting about the negotiations and rescue, it was clear when a U.S. doctor examined Warmbier in North Korea in June 2017 that he would never return to a healthy state. He apparently went into a coma the night he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for pulling down a propaganda poster in a hotel in Pyongyang in 2016. His parents have insisted the coma was a result of torture. An American doctor who examined Warmbier 15 months after the event that caused the coma said Warmbier appeared to be well cared for in the hospital. Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center who examined Warmbier after he returned home found no physical evidence of torture. The exact cause of his brain damage remains a mystery. Fred Warmbier told the Post that the $2 million bill sounded to him like a “ransom” for his son. Trump himself has said he does not believe that the North Koreans tortured Warmbier, as Kim Jong-un apparently told him that he did not know about Warmbier’s treatment. “I don’t believe he would have allowed that to happen,” Trump said in February, after his second summit with Kim. “He tells me he didn’t know about it, and I take him at his word .” Support our journalism

The problem with Joe Biden’s approach to Trump.,slate.com,Dara Kass,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/joe-biden-2020-announcement-problem-treats-trump.html,"The Toughest Dilemma for the 2020 Democrats Isn’t Impeachment. It’s Immigration. I woke up Thursday morning eagerly anticipating Joe Biden’s campaign announcement . Given that he has been leading in a crowded field of 19 candidates despite not being declared, I wanted to hear from him. As I watched his video, my face fell. Biden largely spends the video making the point that Donald Trump’s presidency is a stain on our country. “I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time,” Biden says. He focuses specifically on the awful white supremacy rally that happened in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 , framing Trump’s “very fine people on both sides” response as a shocking turning point in Biden’s perception of America. As a physician, I wasn’t surprised that a medical analogy jumped into my head immediately as I watched.* In 2015, the Department of Homeland Security launched a campaign called Stop the Bleed . It was a call-to-action intended to encourage bystanders to intervene before professional help arrives. Put simply, if you are there when someone is shot or stabbed, especially in a mass casualty, you can deploy simple techniques to stop the bleeding for long enough for the person to make it to the hospital. Watching Biden’s video , I heard him offer to stop the bleed. He framed what happened in Charlottesville, and Trump’s response to it, as a traumatic event that requires someone to step in to stop the bleed to save our country. But in medicine, we know that stopping the bleed is never enough to heal the patient. It’s not supposed to be—it’s just the first response in a moment of trauma until medics, doctors, or nurses are available. It doesn’t fix the patient (surgery or closing the wounds does that). It just stops the death spiral. Is it enough to stop the bleeding? Or do we also have to consider the broader picture of what is causing such wounds to rupture in the first place? Even as closing the wound matters more than stanching the bleeding, it’s how we think about why the bleeding started that matters most of all. Dr. Rob Gore, an emergency medicine doctor in Brooklyn, New York, started the Kings Against Violence Initiative after he saw the same young men presenting to his ER as both victims and perpetrators of gun violence. As the KAVI website summarizes, “resorting to violence is often both the symptom and cause of longstanding and systemic inequities, poverty, and marginalization. Hurt people hurt people.” So at KAVI, they are looking to understand what starts the bleeding, and take steps to undo the cycle of violence before we’re in triage. Which brings me back to Biden. “In that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime,” Biden says of Trump’s Charlottesville comments. It’s certainly true that Trump’s presidency is unusual. But to me, one of the most fundamental questions we’re going to have to address as we consider how to move forward from our current political moment is the same question we have faced in medicine around gun violence: Is it enough to stop the bleeding? Or do we also have to consider the broader picture of what is causing such wounds to rupture in the first place? What strikes me as off about Biden’s announcement is the way he conceives of our current political moment as a peculiarity that can be smoothed over rather than as an obvious, hemorrhaging symptom that makes plain that we have a deeper societal ill. There’s plenty of reasonable debate over whether Democratic candidates should focus on Trump in mounting their arguments, or if they should focus on what they want to do for voters—ensure access to health care, propel economic reform, take action on climate change. I suspect this is a bit of a false choice, as what we need is a little bit of both. But if we’re going to talk about Donald Trump, I think we need to acknowledge that he wasn’t created in a vacuum . Our systemic racism and sexism, coupled with our economic insecurities, built a world in which Trump could come to power. Biden’s announcement seems premised on the idea that we need to revert to the world we had before Trump, rather than dramatically rethink the world that produced him. Our experience in medicine shows that if all you do is stop the bleed, people continue to die because the same system keeps opening new wounds. Trump is a bleed. We can stitch over the wound. But if we want to rebuild America, we need to consider what brought us here, not just how to survive the moment.

"The Press Didn’t Just Report Accurately on Trump-Russia Corruption, It Prevented the Corruption From Being Worse",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-russia-media-mueller-corruption.html,"The View ’s Gushing Hosts Saved Biden From Embarrassing Himself in His First Campaign Interview Russia conspiracy skeptics like the Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald and President Donald Trump are not done gloating/ranting about how “the media” allegedly embarrassed itself by reporting on seemingly improper relationships between Trump advisers and the Russian government in 2016 and 2017. Which is interesting, because I keep reading parts of the Mueller report and finding examples of potential Trump-Russia deals that were very likely called off because of accurate media reports . Here are three of them! • Trump Tower Moscow. Trump attorney Michael Cohen was involved in an effort to secure Russian approval for the development of a Trump Tower project in Moscow in late 2015 and 2016. Cohen and the Trump Organization were still pursuing the project on June 9, 2016, when senior Trump campaign figures attended a meeting at which they discussed foreign policy with several individuals representing the interests of the Russian government. It wasn’t until June 14 that Cohen told Felix Sater, the Trump Organization’s liaison to Russian partners, that the organization was putting pursuit of the deal on hold. That’s also the day that the Washington Post first reported that Russian hackers were targeting the Democratic Party. According to the special counsel’s report, “After the media began questioning Trump’s connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a ‘party line’ that publicly distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there.” • Sanctions. What the Russians at the June 9 meeting specifically wanted to discuss with Trump’s advisers was their government’s interest in getting the U.S. to lift sanctions that prevent Russian officials, oligarchs, and/or organized crime figures from using the American financial system. And June 9 wasn’t the only attempt to broach this issue: Campaign chairman Paul Manafort discussed a sanctions-related Ukraine “peace plan” in August 2016 with one of his former business partners, Konstantin Kilimnik, who had connections to Russian military intelligence. Additionally, eventual Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn served as an “adviser” until June 2016 to a company that was developing a plan to build nuclear reactors in the Middle East in collaboration with Russian partners, a plan that would have required the U.S. to lift certain sanctions. As is documented at length in Mueller’s report, during the presidential transition period Flynn told Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that the Trump administration did not want to escalate sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed against Russia over its election interference. A former State Department official who dealt with sanctions has also said publicly that Trump officials began initiating plans to rescind other sanctions against Russia immediately after Trump’s inauguration. Those efforts subsequently died under heavy political pressure, however. After the Washington Post broke the news of Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak, he was eventually forced out of office—and more broadly, as the New Yorker has reported , the administration’s efforts to strike a sanctions-easing agreement with Russia died because of “the looming Mueller investigation” and because “members of Congress were pushing at the time to expand sanctions against Russia, not reduce them.” Says the New Yorker: “Trump told aides that he was frustrated that he could not make progress because of political opposition in Washington.” That political opposition, of course, existed because even Republican senators were responding to what John McCain described as “Russia’s attack on American democracy”—a subject that had been covered since June 2016 in press accounts of Russian propaganda and hacking operations whose details would go on to be confirmed by multiple Mueller indictments and documented in his report. • Michael Flynn’s nuclear deal. As mentioned above, Flynn served well into 2016 as an adviser to a group called ACU Strategic Partners, which was developing a plan to build nuclear reactors in the Middle East in collaboration with Russian companies and, in Reuters’ description, “required lifting sanctions on Russia” to go forward. But when Flynn became Trump’s national security adviser and began promoting a Middle East nuclear plan inside the administration, it was one developed by a different company he’d advised, IP3, whose key figures split from ACU in 2016—and say they specifically did so because they didn’t want Russia involved in the deal . (The post-inauguration nuclear plan push alarmed many career national security staffers who felt it was being pursued for potentially corrupt reasons, and it has since been documented in reports by the House Oversight Committee.) According to Newsweek’s coverage , ACU’s breakup took place in the context of “reports … that the FBI was investigating possible collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.” One of IP3’s partners told Politico that he and the others had told Flynn that “we’re not up for working with Russia.” Flynn’s disclosure forms say his work with ACU ended in June 2016, the month that Trump-Russia reporting first surfaced, and that he started advising IP3 in August of that year. The picture the Mueller report creates of Trump World in 2016 and early 2017 is one in which Russia-connected figures were swarming around trying to squeeze concessions out of the campaign and administration. And, repeatedly, Trump’s advisers were receptive to hearing about and pursuing these plans until being caught in the spotlight of press scrutiny and related political pressure. No wonder he hates the media!"
Do all men lie about their penis size?,slate.com,Stoya,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/penis-size-men-lie-averages-female-preference.html,"Every Thursday night, the crew will answer one bonus question in chat form. This week, life size. Dear How to Do It, Recently I had sex with a man who said he had a 10-inch penis. It was, indeed, huge. But when I told my (gay) friend about this guy’s endowment, he told me that specific measurement was statistically very, very unlikely, and that the guy was probably just getting away with it because people have a skewed perspective (mostly because guys lie constantly, making people think smaller sizes are bigger). He said my guy was probably more like 8 or 9 inches, and that is already “huge” by most people’s standards. He said anything over 7 inches is “big,” given that the average penis is more like 5 inches or a little more. Is this … right? How rare is a 10-inch penis? Do all guys lie? Is everyone terrible at spotting actual size when they see it? —Lengthy Stoya : Just yesterday I was repeating that joke about how women have been being told that 4 inches is 6 inches our whole adult lives. It’s a tired joke. But it almost always gets a laugh. Rich : It’s so true. Low-key gaslighting by way of genitalia. Stoya : A bit, yes. Why do men lie about penis length? And why are they so focused on length over girth? Rich : I think the answer to your first question is: Because they can. Enough people will believe them or not call them on their shit when it’s clear that they’re lying. I mean, you can imagine how often this happens via hookup apps. So few say their real size, and then they show up and what are you going to do? Look their penis in the eye and yell, “LIAR!”? You’d be the asshole then. Stoya : Eugh. Just eugh. Rich : It ends up putting the burden on you because then you have to ask yourself, “Am I really that superficial that dick size would make or break the hookup?” Stoya : If the guy can’t make up for it with oral and digital sex? For me, total deal-breaker. Sexual relationships should be sexually satisfying. Rich : And also, when someone lies to you that early on in your association with them, it doesn’t bode well for the future—even if it’s a petty lie. Stoya : Exactly. Very red-flag move. Rich : I guess the problem is that so many people lie that others feel the need to do so to correct for that, essentially revising the truth. If enough people say they have 8 inches on Grindr but are in truth 6 or so, 6 inches eventually becomes 8 in terms of how your brain processes those numbers. These fraudulent boners are tearing at the very fabric of the numeral system. Stoya : What happens if you show up, and someone is actually too big to handle? Rich : As if there’s such a thing! Stoya : Because if someone told me they were 10 inches I’d be like “haha sure,” and then if they actually were I’d have to use my vagina and at least one hand. Rich : Something might be prohibitively big for my butt, but I always manage to find a way to play. On apps guys will note that they a “true 9 inches,” which is like, “Hm, well now that’s convincing.” But again, it’s just more words that could obscure more lies. Stoya : Kind of makes you want to bring a ruler. Rich : It’s just so funny how easy it is to just say something in those forums and have people accept it as truth because they want to . The one thing I find wild about this is that the writer actually saw it, and yet their friend is convinced that he’s more of an authority on dick that is a total stranger to him. Gay men are not immune to mansplaining. Stoya : Just because you have one doesn’t mean you know everything about all of them. And wow is it nice to hear that acknowledged. Statistic outliers happen. I do agree with the friend that anything over 7 inches is big, and that 9 is huge. I wish there was more discussion of girth. Always. Rich : Yeah, to circle back around to a question to asked earlier, men probably pay less attention to girth because men in general pay less attention to matters of women’s pleasure. So they think “big is long” because length is more obvious display of size. And yes, I think that the dick of dubious length at hand in this question very well could have been 10 inches. It’s possible .It happens. But isn’t it funny to think of what we’re examining here? Inches? The difference between something that is one half-thumb longer than something else? I believe in my heart that a 7-inch dick and a 9-inch dick are two very different things, but the actual unit of measurement is so infinitesimal that it kind of exposes the absurdity of the debate. Kind of makes you want to bring a ruler. Stoya : And really, I’m going to kick the width horse until it dies. Thin is easier for anal. Thick is nicer for vaginal penetration. Medium (or multipurpose) is preferable for variation in penetrative hetero-monogamy. Rich : Would you say that consensus among women is width > length? Stoya : I have no idea. I’m curious. I know length can be a thing for women who like having their cervixes stimulated. Or who just generally prefer super deep penetration. Rich : I think I prefer thinner in general because of what you said about anal and also they’re easier to suck. Stoya : Agreed. Thick dicks and molars … Rich : Yeah, and I have a big mouth, so if I’m having trouble you gotta wonder if this guy ever gets good head. The poor, wretched donkey-dicked man … Stoya : I actually do feel bad for really big guys out there getting fetishized and having their cocks grated. Rich : There’s a parallel phenomenon that is actually the inverse of what we’re talking about that I’d like to discuss, though it involves some TMI on my part. So please forgive me. I have noticed that people often really want to believe that my dick is bigger than it is. I mean, when it’s in front of them. Stoya : Oooh. Strange. I think I might understand? There’s something erotic about taking a giant dick. Even for me—and it isn’t really my thing—there’s something satisfying about handling it. Rich : I have a gay friend and a straight friend who have experienced this as well. People will tell us, “Your dick is so big.” And it’s like, you know, I’m not complaining. I’m happy with my dick. But let’s be real: It’s not so big. I know big dicks, and I know them well. It’s good, I’m happy, but neither of us are blind here. Stoya : But they are! By their rose-colored glasses! Rich : I guess so. I guess it’s also sex brain, which just skews everything. Stoya : Yeah. Everything is so hot, so hard, so tight. Rich : So maybe those inflated numbers guys give are ultimately just correcting for that? Stoya : Like, “This is how big you’ll think I was”? Rich : Haha, yes—“I’m gonna get you so hot that you’ll BELIEVE it’s 8 inches.” And not for nothing, I think 7.5 is the ideal size. But in light of all that we’ve discussed, I guess that’s more theoretical or at least fuzzy given that this scale is built on lies. Do I even really know what 7.5 is? Stoya : You should be able to compare with your own, no? Rich : Kind of? Actually, that’s another thing! Sometimes a guy with a legitimately massive dick will be like, “Oh, we’re the same size.” Stoya : ? Rich : Do I have dick dysmorphia? Stoya : It sounds like you might? Rich : I don’t know. I just feel like everyone’s lying all the time, even to me, about my own dick. Stoya : I feel like you ought to get a measuring tape and get to the bottom of this. I’ve got the national averages one web search away ."
Joe Biden called Anita Hill before launching 2020 campaign. She's not ready to forgive him.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/joe-biden-anita-hill-2020-presidential-campaign.html,"Joe Biden Has Successfully Goaded Donald Trump, Which Is Exactly What He Needs to Do Joe Biden, who has weathered renewed criticism over his role overseeing Anita Hill’s 1991 testimony against Clarence Thomas, reached out to Hill earlier this month in an attempt to make amends as he geared up to launch his presidential campaign, according to the New York Times. But Hill, in an interview with the Times on Wednesday, said she did not believe Biden’s efforts reflected sincere regret and called for the former vice president to publicly apologize. “I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I’m sorry for what happened to you. I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose,” she said in the interview. Biden called Hill earlier this month to express “his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country,” a Biden spokeswoman told the Times. Biden has long been criticized for his handling of the hearings and for allowing Republicans to smear her character on national television. Hill told the Times that she had come away from the conversation unsatisfied, and she “declined to characterize his words to her as an apology,” according to the Times. She said she could not as a result support Biden until he claimed responsibility for the 1991 hearings and accepted the harm that came from it. She said she was also upset by the recent accusations of inappropriately familiar physical contact. “The focus on apology to me is one thing,” she said. “But he needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw. And not just women. There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.” During the 1991 confirmation hearings, Biden, then the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, allowed Hill to be interrogated and berated with irrelevant testimony from Thomas supporters but failed to call witnesses who could have supported Hill’s account of sexual harassment by the then-judge. Biden also has been criticized for ceding too much control to Senate Republicans, who were allowed to dictate certain elements of the hearing process, including by allowing Thomas to testify both before and after Hill. While the hearings are now acknowledged to have played an important role in moving the country forward in its understanding of sexual harassment, Hill herself was subjected to what is now recognized (though not by everyone) to have been a deeply unfair beating in the process. In the national press, Thomas supporters, apart from attempting to deny that sexual harassment was a real problem, attacked Hill’s character. The American Spectator famously called her “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.” Biden has regularly been criticized for his role in Thomas’ confirmation hearings. On Thursday morning, just as Biden formally announced his presidential candidacy, Anita Hill was trending as a topic on Twitter. The resentment held by many women over that hearing remains one of Biden’s largest potential campaign vulnerabilities. Biden has expressed regret for Hill’s suffering during that hearing, but until recently he avoided acknowledging his own responsibility. At an event last month, Biden stopped just short of an apology. “To this day, I regret I couldn’t give her the kind of hearing she deserved,” he said. “I wish I could have done something.” Support our journalism

Elizabeth Warren’s student loan forgiveness plan mostly helps the middle class.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-student-debt-forgiveness-middle-class.html,"A New Obstruction Case Against a Judge Proves William Barr’s DOJ Is Now Just an Arm of President Donald Trump Earlier this week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren became the first major Democratic presidential candidate to support mass student loan forgiveness, rolling out a plan that would cancel at least some debt for an estimated 42 million Americans. According to a new analysis published by the Brookings Institution, most of the benefits from her proposal would flow to middle-class households. You would not necessarily guess that, however, based on some of the headlines the report has generated. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, ran a piece titled , “Warren’s Student-Debt Deal Would Most Benefit Stronger Earners, Study Finds.” The Brookings brief somewhat pushes that interpretation of its findings, calling Warren’s idea “regressive, expensive, and full of uncertainties.” I’d argue that it’s actual numbers, however, tell a more flattering story. For years now, left-wing activists have dreamed of wiping out every last dollar of student loan debt on America’s books in one enormous jubilee. As many writers, myself included , have pointed out, such a move would be pretty regressive, since a disproportionate share of outstanding eduction debt belongs upper middle class and high-income households. Warren’s plan, however, is designed to take this into account. It caps forgiveness at $50,000 for individual in households making up to $100,000, and gradually phases down the amount of loan relief a borrower can receive as their income rises. Those earning $250,000 or more would not be eligible for any debt cancellation at all. The idea is to cancel debt for more borrowers, without giving a windfall to corporate lawyers and high-earning doctors who borrowed six-figures for their lucrative professional degrees. Measured by the total amount of debt written off, Brookings finds that 73 percent of the benefit goes to Americans in the middle 60 percent of the country’s income distribution (the analysis only includes households headed by adults age 25 or older, and excludes people who are still in school). Almost a third of the benefits are especially concentrated in the 60th to 80th percentile, where households earn between $68,000 and $111,000 per year. Jordan Weissmann/Slate To be clear, this does not make the plan progressive . Low income households get the smallest share of the benefits. Some upper-middle class —those in the 80th to 90th income percentiles—get a slightly oversized oversized share of the haul. But Warren’s plan does a decent job of limiting the benefits of the very highest earners, while helping out middle-income families. Looked at another way, Warren’s plan is a bit more favorable to six-figure earners. The Brookings report also measures the distribution of debt relief by measuring the actual reduction in annual payments households would see.* It’s a wonkier, less intuitive approach, but it makes some sense because there are many low-income households that will likely never pay off their full loan balance before they qualify for one of the federal forgiveness programs that already exist. If you look at the data from this angle, 23 percent of the benefit goes to households in 80th to 90th percentile. Jordan Weissmann/Slate Personally, I think you have to look at both of these graphs to get a sense of who benefits under Warren’s plan. So, what are the take-aways? • Warren’s plan is not strictly progressive .•But it does successfully limit the amount of debt relief going to high-earning MD’s, JD’s, and MBAs, while keeping it concentrated in the broadly defined middle class. There are definitely ways Warren could make her plan more progressive. She could drop the maximum forgiveness amount to $20,000— roughly the median that borrowers have graduated school with in recent years—and wipe out the loan balances of a lot of lower income students while limiting the rewards to six-figure earners. She could exclusively forgive undergraduate loans. You can tweak it in all sorts of ways. On the other hand, Warren is planning to pay for her $650 billion proposal with proceeds from a wealth tax on people with assets above $50 million, and a partial reversal of the corporate tax cut Republicans passed. I don’t know if I’d personally place a debt-forgiveness plan like she has proposed at the very center of a left-wing agenda (the very poor could use some help first). But there are certainly much more appalling things than a transfer from the ultra-wealthy to the middle class.
Correction, April 25, 2019: This post originally misstated that the Brookings analysis also looked at monthly loans payments, rather than annual ones."
Trump doesn’t want a “better” deal with Iran.,slate.com,Fred Kaplan,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-iran-deal-oil-sanctions-chaos.html,"Texas Retracts Claim of Mass Voter Fraud Touted by Trump, Agrees to Halt Planned Purge President Donald Trump is about to squeeze Iran like never before. It’s hard to see where this can lead except to chaos or war. And it’s fairly clear that Trump wants it this way. When Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed economic sanctions that had been lifted as part of that accord, he issued six-month waivers to eight countries—China, India, Iraq, Turkey, South Korea, Italy, Greece, and Taiwan—allowing them to keep buying Iranian oil. On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the waivers would end May 2 . After then, any country doing business with the Islamic Republic would be barred from the U.S. banking system, which dominates financial transactions worldwide. In recent months, some countries, notably China and members of the European Union, have discussed setting up some mechanism to trade with Iran without going through U.S. banks, but this has proved easier said than done. The European countries that were granted waivers have already stopped importing Iranian oil; the others have cut back, albeit reluctantly. After May 2, if Washington really enforces a no-tolerance ban, Iran—which is already hurting economically—will be boxed in. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, have said that, in response to this hostile act, they might block the Strait of Hormuz , a body of water with a two-mile-wide shipping lane that transits 20 percent of the world’s oil supply. The idea is that if Iran can’t send its oil through the strait, which borders its territory, nobody else can either. Zarif also has said that Iran might resume enriching uranium—and thus reviving its nuclear program—in response. Either of these moves would likely spark a U.S. military reaction, which may be what Trump wants to happen. One clear sign that Trump wants Iran boxed in is that he hasn’t offered another choice—he hasn’t said what he wants the Iranian government to do in exchange for dropping his campaign of “maximum pressure.” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif likened the Trump administration’s behavior to that of a “gangster.” Pompeo has said he wants a “better” nuclear accord, but his definition of the word is so over the top that he’s clearly signaling that he doesn’t mean it. In a speech at the Heritage Foundation in May, he laid out 12 conditions that Iran must fulfill for a new deal. They include ending its enrichment of uranium—a ban imposed on no other country in the world. (Article IV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty gives signatories the “inalienable right” to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, which includes enriching uranium at low levels. The Iran deal allows enrichment up to 3 percent—way below what’s needed to make a weapon.) Pompeo also demanded that Iran give international inspectors “unqualified access” to “all sites throughout” Iran—a formula for espionage that no country would accept. He said Iran must halt tests and development of ballistic and cruise missiles (a ban on development is impossible to verify); end support for Syria, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen; disarm its militias in Iraq; drop all threats against Israel; and release all foreign prisoners. All these steps would be welcome, but no nation would surrender so much of its sovereignty to a foreign power, except, possibly, after a total defeat in a war. More drastic still, Pompeo listed these conditions not as the terms of a new deal but merely as the steps that Iran must take before the United States sits down at the bargaining table. What further concessions, they might ask, would Trump and Pompeo demand after that? In any case, the Iranians have no cause to trust them, given that Trump withdrew from the existing deal, which was negotiated with six other countries, even though the International Atomic Energy Agency has attested many times that Iran is in full compliance. There are ways to get a better deal with Iran, if that’s what Trump really wanted. He could do what Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, the two Bushes, Clinton, and Obama did to get better nuclear arms deals with the Kremlin. They negotiated a series of treaties, each one reducing nuclear weapons to lower levels without tearing up some previous accord just because it didn’t go as far as one side or the other might have preferred. At a Q&A with journalists at Iran’s U.N. mission in New York on Thursday, Javad Zarif likened the Trump administration’s behavior to that of a “gangster.” The Iran nuclear deal, which is enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution, bars impediments to trade with Iran. Trump’s officials aren’t acting like “the world’s policeman,” he said. Rather, they’re demanding that other nations “break the law.” Sad to say, he’s right, and this is one reason so many countries—especially those that signed the nuclear accord—are bitter about the way Trump is flexing American power. Yet Javad Zarif took care to draw a distinction between Trump and his administration, noting national security adviser John Bolton is a longtime advocate of regime change in Iran, while Trump has pledged to avoid another stupid, costly war in the Middle East. He also noted that Iran “never left the negotiating table”; only the United States did that, and Tehran stands ready to continue talks. But this stab at an appeal to Trump’s more restrained impulses is probably based on a false hope. Clearly, Trump has no interest in talking with the Iranians about a new accord. And Pompeo, who sees a big part of his job as saying what Trump wants him to say, reflects that disdain. In his Heritage speech and in others, especially one delivered in July before an audience of Iranian Americans at the Reagan Presidential Library , Pompeo emphasized U.S. solidarity with “the Iranian people” against their oppressive government. He went about as far as a senior U.S. diplomat could go toward advancing a policy of “regime change” without uttering those words. Trump may well think that this “maximum pressure” will simply bring the Iranian regime to its knees. This is doubtful. But if it does, it is even more unlikely that Western-leaning freedom fighters will replace the toppled mullahs. Tehran is the most literate, pro-Western city in the entire Middle East, outside of Israel, but even its denizens know the history of foreign coups in Iran, and despite their hatred for the medievalists occupying supreme power in their country, they would resist another episode of American meddling. If the mullahs were somehow to be ousted, they would more likely be succeeded by a more anti-Western faction, probably consisting of the most intolerant elements of the military. Trump’s stepped-up pressure campaign might be justified if Iran posed an urgent, existential threat to the United States, its allies, or its interests—or if Iran’s leaders were poised to break out of the nuclear deal’s restrictions. But it doesn’t, and they aren’t. The other parties to the nuclear deal—Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China—are sticking to it, seeing no reason to pull out and many reasons to stay in. It prevents Iran from building a nuclear bomb, has already led to the dismantlement of materials with which they might have built a bomb, and contains the tightest verification regimen in the history of arms control accords. Even most Israeli military and intelligence officers favor sticking with the deal. Trump is serving the interests only of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners, who want to keep Iran holed up, and of the region’s Sunni Arab powers, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which want to wage war on Iran. In effect, Trump’s new policy—which forces the world to reimpose the sanctions that he wants— is a declaration of economic war. Even if Iran doesn’t shut down the Hormuz Strait or resume enriching uranium, the move is likely to contract the global economy, at least somewhat. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have said they will redirect some of their oil exports to Iraq and Turkey in order to make up for the cutoff of Iranian supplies. But it’s unclear where this extra oil will come from—they’ve recently cut their output and have not said they’ll pump more—or who will compensate the countries that once got lots of oil from the Arabs but are now getting shortchanged. Oil analysts say that Trump’s policy will squeeze global supplies in a market already facing disruptions and will almost certainly raise gasoline prices, just in time to make summer vacations more costly. Trump is taking a huge risk, alienating allies, aggravating American consumers, upsetting global markets, and possibly triggering war—all because he doesn’t like Iran and doesn’t like the Iran nuclear deal (or any other deal) that was struck by President Barack Obama. He’s governing by pique, and we may all pay the price in one way or another. Support our journalism

Joe Biden’s 2020 launch both attacks and echoes Donald Trump.,slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/joe-biden-2020-launch-maga-trump-us-history.html,"The Toughest Dilemma for the 2020 Democrats Isn’t Impeachment. It’s Immigration. Biden’s pitch is many things—emotionally compelling, politically shrewd, and a little presumptuous, among them. But it is one thing above all else: convenient. Biden is telling many Americans who oppose Trump, particularly white ones, what they want to hear: that Trump’s election—like what happened in Virginia the following summer—was an aberration, a tumor that can be surgically excised from the body politic, and not a symptom of an underlying disease that’s been present since the nation’s birth. The desire to reduce American history to a series of individual moments is natural, particularly for a politician, but in this case the oversimplification gives Biden the chance to choose which moments “made America, America,” and which can be brushed aside as isolated incidents uncharacteristic of that same “America.” And so when images of the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements flash on screen, Biden is asking his audience to see that progress as what defines America, rather than the centuries of disenfranchisement based on gender and race that preceded it and the racism and sexism that remain. Consider how Biden chose to begin the video (emphasis mine):
Charlottesville, Virginia, is home to the author of one of the great documents in human history. We know it by heart: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.” … We haven’t always lived up to these ideals; Jefferson himself didn’t . But we have never before walked away from them. In the span of three words, Biden shrugs off Thomas Jefferson’s ownership of slaves—and the nation’s long embrace of slavery along with it—as a failure to live up to a professed set of ideals, as opposed to the conscious decision to compromise those ideals. Biden’s hardly the first politician to don rose-colored glasses when looking upon American history, but few Democrats wear them so regularly as he does today. As I’ve noted before , Biden loves to wax nostalgic about the bipartisan days of yore, seemingly unable to grasp that the friends he made back during his early days in the U.S. Capitol were segregationists like Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms , or that Congress was so male-dominated when he first arrived that it would take another two decades before women got their own restroom off the Senate floor. It’s why Biden praises the late John McCain, defends Vice President Mike Pence, and vouches for Republican congressmen who’ve spent their careers working to thwart progress. To Biden, public service is a noble act, regardless of what one does with one’s power. Trump makes plain the flaw in that logic, and so Biden must write him out of history as somehow un-American. Biden is asking us to believe that Trump emerged from thin air—to ignore the reality that the Republican Party nominated him, after long exploiting a strategy of racial resentment —and to forget that 63 million Americans ultimately cast their ballots for him. It would be a stretch to say Biden wants to Make America Great Again in the nationalist sense Trump means it. But Biden, like Trump, is holding up the past as an example of where the nation needs to go. He is saying that America has always been great—still will be as long as Trump is denied another four years.
Folks, America’s an idea, an idea that’s stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most desperate people on earth. It guarantees that everyone is treated with dignity and gives hate no safe harbor. It instills in every person in this country the belief that no matter where you start in life, there’s nothing you can’t achieve if you work at it. That’s what we believe. And above all else, that’s what’s at stake in this election. Such a Pollyannaish view of America is hardly unique to Biden, but it is uniquely helpful to his case when running in a crowded Democratic field. Biden’s biggest liability in the primary is his long record on the national stage, much of which looks downright conservative by today’s standards. And so Biden needs voters to believe that America before Trump is an America worth returning to—because the America before Trump is also the America that Joe Biden helped build. He spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate, including stints as the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees, and then another eight years by President Barack Obama’s side. Biden, then, has been a key contributor to roughly one-fifth of the nation’s 243-year political history, a slice of time that has seen remarkable progress but also plenty of setbacks. In the 1970s, Biden was a vocal opponent of school integration. In the 1980s, he was a law-and-order drug warrior. In the 1990s, he held the judiciary gavel during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and helped pass the draconian Clinton crime bill. In the 2000s, he voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq and to pass bank-friendly bankruptcy reform. Most Americans look back fondly, for good reason, at the Obama administration in which Biden served faithfully, but it wasn’t without its flaws: Obama exponentially expanded the use of drones, failed to close Guantánamo Bay, and opted not to prosecute big banks and other bad actors in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, among other shortcomings. All of that makes the story of Joe Biden—and the pre-Trump history of modern America—far more complicated than Biden is ready to admit. Biden closed his launch video by urging Americans to “remember who we are,” but in reality he’s asking us to forget much more. He’s offering voters a deal in 2020: Forgive his political sins, and they can ignore the nation’s as well. Support our journalism

Doggy day care too expensive: pet advice from Beast Mode.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/doggy-day-care-too-expensive-alternatives-advice.html,"Beast Mode is Slate’s pet advice column. Have a question? Send it to . Dear Beast Mode, I have a very sweet 9-month-old dog who has been going to day care five days a week while I’m at work. He loves day care, but I need to tighten my budget a bit. I have some major unplanned expenses coming up, and the $600-a-month fee is steep. My ideal situation would be to have him do two to three days a week of day care and then stay home alone for the other days. I’m not sure how to transition him from the bathroom-break-every-two-hours routine he gets at day care to having a walker once a day. Additionally, I am worried that reducing his contact with other dogs when he’s still young will inhibit his social development. Am I wrong to wean him off day care like this? —Barking on a Budget Dear Barking on a Budget, Like moving apartments or renting a jet ski, dogs come with some hidden costs. Whether it’s treats, vet bills, or day care, a furry best friend can set you back a bit. I’ve long tried to find a way to monetize my own dog to offset this, but among her few marketable skills, so far we’ve only been able to capitalize on her ability to provide fodder for this pet advice column. I don’t hold it against her, though, especially considering that writing said column is one of the few marketable skills I can offer myself. There are plenty of other ways to get your pooch to burn off some energy with his peers. The good news is that dogs are flexible. They may not understand the concept of bills or budgeting, but if they did, they would be happy to make the occasional sacrifice for their humans. (If dogs understood the concept of budgeting, we could also give them little plastic visors and have them crunch numbers for us come tax time. It’d be adorable.) You shouldn’t feel guilty if you have to cut back on doggy day care. Your pup will be just fine. It’s great that you’ve given your dog plenty of socialization during his most formative years. You’ll still want him to play with other pups, but at 9 months, his behavior and personality are going to stay pretty solid in this regard. A trip to the park before or after work (or both!) should be enough to fill his social schedule, especially when you add in daily group treks with a dog walker. As long as he’s getting that walk in the middle of the day, you shouldn’t fret about your dog’s bathroom breaks either. Every two hours is amazing (and generous) for young pups, but a 9-month-old will be able to hold it for longer without issue. It’s admirable that you want to provide him with as much day care as possible, but don’t put yourself in dire financial straits over it. Besides the park and daily walks, there are plenty of other ways to get your pooch to burn off some energy with his peers. Dog training classes aren’t free, but they’re cheaper than day care and will get you involved too. Many training companies also offer group play date sessions (often for a fraction of what a class costs), and these will offer him a day care–like environment at a different time of day. You’re doing great, and your pup is lucky to have such a considerate human. He will be thrilled to see you after work, wherever he may be. That’s his full-time job. "
Anthem: Homunculus review: John Cameron Mitchell’s podcast musical is a game-changing spiritual sequel to Hedwig and the Angry Inch.,slate.com,Alan Scherstuhl,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/anthem-podcast-review-john-cameron-mitchell-hedwig-sequel-musical.html,"A Casual Moviegoer’s Guide to Avengers: Endgame John Cameron Mitchell’s new podcast has been positioned by its producers and publicists as a game changer, the leveling up of an entire medium. Michael Bloom, the CEO of First Look Media, told the New York Times that his company signed on to finance the new star-studded rock musical Anthem: Homunculus because “the concept would be a magnet for the kind of talent that transcends what’s been done in podcasts to date.” The funny thing about it? Anthem lives up even to that grandiose bit of hype, offering listeners something wildly different from what they’ve been cued to expect from podcasts or rock musicals. Though the series is a spiritual sequel to Mitchell’s trans glam masterwork Hedwig and the Angry Inch— Patti LuPone herself sings a jazz ballad early in the run, and Glenn Close later wilds out with a scuzz rock lulu —Homunculus , the 10-episode first season of a planned anthology series,is a pained and muted affair, an audio survey of the American hellscape that’s more Notes From Underground than Hedwig Rocks Your Earholes. Co-written by Mitchell with Bryan Weller, it’s deal-breaker art, prickly and rambling, urgently personal, and making no accommodations for audience expectations. Unlike earlier podcast musicals like Songonauts or 36 Questions, Homunculus is something very much like what its trailer-park protagonist, Ceann (Mitchell) is creating himself: a splenetic work of outsider art. Don’t expect the star turns or featured showstoppers of musicals, or the twists or cliffhangers that predominate on most narrative podcasts. Homunculus , like Hedwig, takes its form from a performance suited to its medium. Where the stage show and film of Hedwig capture the blazing final concert delivered by an East German “girlyboy” singer, Homunculus instead documents Ceann’s livestreamed crowdfunding attempt to pay for treatment for a tumor. Rather than rock ’n’ roll’s thrills and catharsis, we have a telethon—one broadcast, we learn in the first episode, from the same trailer near Junction City, Kansas, that Hedwig once rented. It’s a laid-back telethon at that, despite its scabrous monologues and Ceann’s insistence that listeners “help my fucking tumor go viral.” Neighbors and family members pop in to visit the same way the postman used to visit Mr. Rogers’ house, and if you didn’t know they were played by the likes of Bridget Everett or Cynthia Erivo, you might not guess. Don’t expect the star turns or featured showstoppers of musicals, or the twists or cliffhangers that predominate on most narrative podcasts. This is a mood piece, concerned first with its protagonist’s state of mind, and then with the state of the world. In early episodes, between bursts of audio-collage tape-recorder art, Ceann dishes bons mots about the terrors of American health care or the alone-in-public oddness of our online lives: “Grindrs can’t be choosers out here on the lonely prairie,” and “In the future, we’ll pray we will be anonymous for 15 minutes.” Sometimes he’ll pass out and be visited by a ghost from his past, like the Catholic priest Ceann tells us raped his younger self, or his own tall tales, like a hilarious one about sex with William S. Burroughs, longtime resident of nearby Lawrence, Kansas. That story leads to a wrenching reminiscence of losing a loved one to AIDS, which is Homunculus in a nutshell. It’s powered by its own free-associative emotional logic, not by plot. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

The LuPone number is marked with despair, its mix intentionally muffled in Ceann’s memory as it’s sung by the protagonist’s heroin-addicted aunt, at a Kansas City club, when he’s a pre-pubescent runaway and she’s already washed up. Other numbers include a cosmic country ballad about the world burning up; the mounting, mutating epic “Homunculus”; and the easy-listening ballad “The End of Love,” which might take a hearing or two to click. As in Hedwig, their mode is rock rather than musical theater, and the singers never sound as though they’re being accompanied by a pit band with sheet music. Mitchell and his collaborators are pushing the dude-talking mode of so many podcasts and AM radio toward something more delicate and perhaps even mesmerizing, if you can get on its wavelength. But like a high-plains AM radio signal, that wavelength takes some effort to catch. With Anthem ,Mitchell shakes off the crowd-pleasing prerogatives of both its genre and its medium. Musical theater often offers a dazzling communal uplift, a sense that our individual weirdness is honored and even made triumphant via the heroics of the extraordinary singers onstage. Podcasts, meanwhile, tend to be intimate and inviting, the hosts not just hosts but our most intimate of buddies, whispering right into our ears. Not long ago, Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards carped that most podcasts are “ tedious and samey and sedative .” But Anthem: Homunculus is none of that, nor is it some glorified cast recording of a rock musical that never hit the stage. Instead, it’s a challenging work of hybrid art that demands much more from a listener than the rest of its cohort in the iTunes store. If you stream it on the treadmill assuming (quite reasonably) that a star-studded rock musical podcast would strive to be invigorating and likable, prepare to be disappointed. It is, after all, titled Anthem: Homunculus . It’s not your buddy. In it, the human spirit perseveres rather than triumphs."
"Facebook faces yet another privacy investigation, this time for harvesting 1.5 million users’ contacts without consent:",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/facebook-privacy-investigation-new-york-attorney-general-1-5-million-user-contacts.html,"The Supreme Court’s Anti-Worker Rulings Are So Routine Now That We Hardly Notice Them. Big Mistake. Facebook learned it will face yet another probe into its data practices on Thursday when the New York state attorney general’s office announced it will investigate the social media company’s unauthorized harvesting of more than 1.5 million users’ email address books. Facebook, it was discovered in April, had been slurping up contact lists of new users without their knowledge or consent. The practice reportedly began in May 2016 and appears to have continued up until it was reported on in the media earlier this month. Facebook was able to access the contact lists by prompting certain new users to enter the password to their personal emails accounts, as a means of identification verification the company said, but would then simply import all of the users’ contacts. The company then used the data to target ads and other services to the users. When Business Insider broke the story last week about the surreptitious data collection, Facebook said the contact data was “unintentionally uploaded to Facebook” and that it would delete it. The company has said it didn’t access any of the content in the users’ emails, but Facebook has a pretty serious credibility problem at this point. “While 1.5 million people’s contact books were directly harvested by Facebook, the total number of people whose contact information was improperly obtained by Facebook may well be in the dozens or even hundreds of millions, as people sometimes have hundreds of contacts stored on their email accounts,” Business Insider reported last week. “The spokesperson could not provide a figure for the total number of contacts obtained this way.” The New York attorney general’s investigation is the latest in a string of inquiries into the company’s data and privacy practices. Facebook told investors yesterday it expects a $3 billion–$5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations revealed during the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Also, the Financial Times reports , “earlier on Thursday, Irish regulators announced a new privacy probe into the company, while Canadian regulators published a report saying it had breached local privacy laws.”"

"Watch Fox News’ Legal Analyst Call Trump’s Obstruction “Immoral, Criminal, Defenseless, and Condemnable”",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/watch-fox-news-legal-analyst-napolitano-trump-obstruction-of-justice.html,"Joe Biden Has Successfully Goaded Donald Trump, Which Is Exactly What He Needs to Do Amidst the barrage of support for President Donald Trump on Fox News’ airwaves comes an extraordinary takedown of the president from the small, still functioning truth-telling cortex of the Fox News brain. This bit by senior legal analyst Andrew Napolitano is stashed away online, in a digital video segment called “Judge Napolitano’s Chambers,” but in it the Fox News regular lays out a pretty compelling and straightforward case for why Trump not only acted criminally but immorally in obstructing justice on multiple occasions revealed in the Mueller report. A written piece accompanies the video, and it’s fine, but we’ve all read a lot recently about everything that’s wrong with Trump and the obviousness of why. When said out loud though, given the platform and the intended audience, Napolitano’s quickie sermon is somehow more powerful and even more welcome as a reminder that certain principles and laws and facts remain true even if Fox News’ primetime lineup refuses to acknowledge them. “[W]hen the president asked his former [deputy national security] Adviser K.T. McFarland to write an untruthful letter to the file knowing the government would subpoena it—that’s obstruction of justice,” Napolitano says. “When the president asked Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, to get Mueller fired—that’s obstruction of justice. When the president asked his then White House counsel to get Mueller fired and then lie about—that’s obstruction of justice. When he asked Don McGahn to go back to the special counsel and change his testimony—that’s obstruction of justice. When he dangled a pardon in front of Michael Cohen in order to keep Cohen from testifying against him—that’s obstruction of justice.” “So why not charge him?” he asks. “Because the attorney general of the United States would have blocked such a charge. Because the attorney general of the United States is of the view that obstruction of justice can only occur if you’re interfering with a criminal investigation of yourself . But that’s not what the obstruction statute says. And that’s not what law enforcement believes and that’s not what prosecutors do. Prosecutors prosecute people who interfere with government functions. And that’s what the president did by obstruction.” “If [Trump] had ordered his aides to violate federal law to save a human life or to preserve human freedom, he would at least have a moral defense to his behavior,” Napolitano concludes. “But ordering them to break federal law to save him from the consequences of his own behavior that is immoral, that is criminal, that is defenseless, and that is condemnable.” That’s really quite something."

WannaCry hero Marcus Hutchins pleads guilty to cybercrimes from years past.,slate.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/marcus-hutchins-guilty-plea-wannacry-ransomware-kronos.html,"Future Tense What Should We Do About the Past Crimes of Reformed Hackers? The guilty plea of Marcus Hutchins, who slowed the spread of the WannaCry ransomware, shows the challenge facing the legal system. April 26, 2019 7:30 AM Photo illustration by Slate. Illustration by MatiasEnElMundo/iStock/Getty Images Plus. Last week, 24-year-old British hacker Marcus Hutchins took a plea deal in which he admitted to helping develop and sell malware designed to steal people’s banking credentials. Despite his admission of guilt and the clearly malicious program he wrote, the resolution of his case feels, in many ways, more like a loss than a victory for cybercrime policing. Hutchins writes the MalwareTech blog and gained considerable attention in May 2017 when he was able to slow the spread of the massively destructive WannaCry ransomware by reverse-engineering it and then purchasing a domain that he found hard-coded into the malware. The then–22-year-old Hutchins told the Guardian , “I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after I registered it, so initially it was accidental. So I can only add ‘accidentally stopped an international cyber-attack’ to my resume.” Advertisement Months later, in August 2017, Hutchins came to Las Vegas for the annual Def Con security conference and was arrested by the FBI on charges of helping develop and sell the Kronos banking Trojan in 2014 and 2015. Of course, one good deed—even one as far-reaching as stemming the spread of WannaCry—does not automatically undo the damage of providing people with tools to conduct financial fraud and theft. But it’s hard not to feel some regret here. Hutchins didn’t just do one good thing amid an ongoing series of bad ones. So far as anyone can tell, by the time WannaCry happened, he had already put his malware-selling days behind him and turned his attention to reverse-engineering and documenting examples of malware on his blog. Soon after Hutchins’ arrest, security journalist Brian Krebs did a thorough investigation of Hutchins’ ties to illegal online activity and concluded that “Hutchins began developing and selling malware in his mid-teens—only to later develop a change of heart and earnestly endeavor to leave that part of his life squarely in the rearview mirror.” Hutchins himself, in a post on his blog about the plea deal , wrote, “As you may be aware, I’ve pleaded guilty to two charges related to writing malware in the years prior to my career in security. I regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes. Having grown up, I’ve since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes. I will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks.” Advertisement Of course, any arrested hacker could claim to have put their black-hat days behind them and turned over a new leaf. But in Hutchins’ case there’s actually evidence to back that up. Not just his remarkable contribution to fighting WannaCry but also his years of blog posts detailing his analysis of how different types of malware work. That work provides a genuine public service, helping people recognize and understand vulnerabilities that are exploited by malware and how to protect against them. His skills at reverse-engineering malware are rare, and valuable. And while youth is not an excuse for criminal activity, it seems significant that Hutchins’ most malicious activity seems to have occurred in his late teens, with a clear change of course as he entered his 20s. Hutchins has not yet been sentenced, but the two charges he pleaded guilty to each come with a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and one year of supervised release. With luck, the sentencing will be lenient, in recognition of both the service Hutchins has provided to the security community since his days of selling malware and the potential for him—and other people like him—to provide similar contributions to cybersecurity in the future. We need to create a path for people like Hutchins to use their talents for good. Not everyone will want or be able to do that, and not every hacker who is offered a second chance manages to stick to the right side of the law. (Albert Gonzalez, for instance, famously pulled off the huge 2005 TJX data breach while working as a paid informant for the Secret Service .) Not every cybercriminal necessarily deserves a second chance, either—if Hutchins had been running a large-scale financial cybercrime ring for years à la Evgeniy Bogachev , then it would be absurd to even imagine he would try to reform himself, or be worth letting him off the hook for his crimes. But what Hutchins did was relatively small-scale and seems to be squarely in his past at this point. Undoubtedly, it was also dumb and wrong and quite possibly illegal. (Orin Kerr has written a good analysis in the Washington Post of the legal issues surrounding the case.) And Hutchins’ malware may well have cost innocent people money, though security reporter Thomas Brewster wrote in Forbes in 2017 that Kronos “was largely a failure amongst serious cybercriminals” and that “while [it] may have claimed some victims, it never became anything close to a serious criminal operation.” The fact that Hutchins wrote relatively unsuccessful malware does not excuse what he did, but there are too few people with Hutchins’ talents—and those talents are too often forged in shady or outright illegal dealings—to refuse to offer him and others like him a chance at redemption and an opportunity to make amends by keeping us all a little bit safer.

Endgame hair: Ranking the Avengers’ new hairstyles.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/avengers-endgame-hair-ranking-new-hairstyles.html,"A Casual Moviegoer’s Guide to Avengers: Endgame This post contains hair spoilers—and some regular spoilers—for Avengers: Endgame . Avengers: Endgame offers many surprises, but foremost among them is the haircuts. While a couple of these new hairstyles have been spotted in the movie’s trailers by eagle-eyed viewers, Marvel kept most of them under lock and key, rightfully regarding them as one of the film’s biggest twists. What do our heroes’ updated manes reveal—and more importantly, how do they look? Below, we count down the Avengers’ new 2024 ’dos, from worst to best. 9. Hawkeye’s Skater Mohawk Walt Disney Studios This is how you know Hawkeye didn’t reach out to any of his friends after the Great Dust Off: No one sat him down to tell him how stupid he looked. People give you a lot of slack when you’re mourning, as well they should, but sometimes you have to draw a line. Does this pitch-black, dyed-in-a-gas-station-bathroom-sink head pelt, especially when paired with his cry-for-help sleeve tattoo, speak to Hawkeye’s nihilistic death wish? Sure. Is it so dumb it gave me a nihilistic death wish? Definitely. 8. Black Widow’s Avril Lavigne Ombré Walt Disney Studios Again, I get it. When you’re in the midst of grief, you do some dumb shit to your hair. It’s part of the process. Some of us drain every bit of life out of our tresses in order to feel something , and Black Widow was undeniably hurting. But the auburn-to-blond ombré looks cheap now and will no doubt look even more passé by 2024, by which time I assume we’ll all be nostalgic for the iconic looks of the 2000s. Never thought I’d say this, but bring back Natasha’s stiff bob. 7. The Hulk’s Manageable Tousle It’s there. Like the new Hulk, it’s flatter and easier to deal with. And like Bruce Banner, you’re not really supposed to notice it in Endgame . 6. Captain America’s Slightly Older–Man Hair Walt Disney Studios Chris Evans’ blond hair is the one special effect the Marvel movies never managed to get right. His hay hues have tended to at once look unnatural and wash the actor out. This is most obvious in the scene where Captain America fights his earlier self, and the even blonder Steve Rogers of 2014 instantly becomes the one you want to see prone on the ground. Evans’ darker, honeyed Endgame look is an improvement but still wince-inducing. The two Caps may have America’s Asses, but they’ll never have America’s Tresses. 5. Captain America’s Much-Older-Man Hair One of the ingredients in the super-soldier potion they gave Captain America must be Rogaine, since centenarian Steve still has a brick-thick head of hair. It’s nothing worth writing home about, but it’s the least Peggy Carter (Peggy Rogers?) deserves. 4. Nebula’s Gilded Veneer Who needs self-care more than a woman who’s the Frankensteined product of her father’s various science projects? When Korean sheet masks won’t cut it, there’s always the option of getting an upgrade on one’s … skull plate. I honestly expected something a bit more imaginative from a space creature whose dad singlehandedly initiated a sequel to The Leftovers . Yet another blond highlight? But judging from her penchant for monochromatism, the gold accessorizing is probably the boldest look Nebula’s ever tried. And given her history with wild experiments, I don’t begrudge her hesitance. 3. Iron Man’s O-So-Slightly Grayer Mane Maturity’s always been a good look for Tony Stark, so I’m not sure why he’s resisted it for so long. Whatever it is that gajillionaires use to make their silver streaks look distinguished, rather than rundown, it’s definitely working. 2. Captain Marvel’s Soft Butch Quasi-Pompadour Marvel has thus far kept Larson’s SBQP carefully under wraps, but here it is in our own universe. Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Grey Goose Vodka Can we finally admit that Carol Danvers’ loose, TV-friendly curls in Captain Marvel were distracting as hell? Maybe her vaguely defined superpowers include full control over her shoulder-length bob amid life-and-death battles, but it makes sense that by 2024 the world-saving veteran would have finally figured out that the end of the world isn’t the most convenient time to let one’s hair fly in one’s face. Carol’s Tilda Swinton–esque swoop is serious, stylish, and—combined with the straighter lines of her uniform—finally indicative that female superheroes don’t need to pander to the straight male gaze anymore. 1. Thor’s Lebowski Locks Stay with me. Sure, you could practically smell those oily, heavy, borderline white-guy dreads all the way here in 2019. But like his patterned cardigan and faded sweatpants, Thor’s hair told a story: of his emotional spinout, his desire to conceal himself from the world, and his gods-given gift of perfectly sun-kissed highlights even when the only styling product he’s used in the past half-decade is pizza grease. It’s the yummiest of yucks."
Taylor Swift “ME!” review: New single and video says even less than she wants you to think.,slate.com,Carl Wilson,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/taylor-swift-me-review-new-single-and-video-says-even-less-than-she-wants-you-to-think.html,"A Casual Moviegoer’s Guide to Avengers: Endgame “We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic,” Taylor Swift declared in a fine little essay she contributed to Elle’s Music Issue in February . “I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive.” Now, that’s way too skinny a definition of all that this ill-defined we might want from pop. We could also want surreal through-the-looking-glass escapism, or incoherent outbursts of alienation, or something about being too sexy for your shirt . But it certainly evokes the brew of intimacy and over-the-topness that Swift herself (whose royal we prerogative I’ll happily concede) can concoct at her best. As she also wrote in Elle, “I want to remember the colour of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever. The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of.” If only somebody had read that paragraph back to Swift when she and producer Joel Little (best known for his work with Lorde) were crafting her new single, “ME!”, a duet with Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco—a song that dallies with evocative details (which could have been outtakes from “Blank Space”) for about a verse, then quotes Sesame Street (“one of these things is not like the others”) and confines itself to that reading level till the bitter end. In the bridge, she calls out, “Hey kids! Spelling is fun!” before she and Urie go on to inform us repeatedly that the letters M and E can be found in such words as team and awesome . It’s not that it’s a bad song, quite. Rather, it is a song so fluffy and immaterial that such a heavy label would just fall straight through it and clatter to the ground. Which is, I suspect, its point. This song represents Swift jumping off the roundabout of self-declarations and outside judgments and defensive reactions that for years made her and everybody else so dizzy—saying “whatever” to all that, at last without making the mistake of putting the “whatever” literally in the song. Instead, she and Urie just traipse through a kiss-and-make-up number out of a teen musical. It’s not that it’s a bad song, quite. Rather, it is a song so fluffy and immaterial that such a heavy label would just fall straight through it and clatter to the ground. If anybody feels let down, try first to forget that this caramel-coated serving was preceded by a two-week social media countdown, a frenzy of fan detective work (much of it on the theory that Swift was about to come out as gay or bi for today’s Lesbian Visibility Day, a little-known occasion even to lesbians ), a sky-high mural painted on a wall in Nashville, Tennessee, and a teaser interview in the middle of the NFL draft picks, leading to a video that drew a half-million views within a couple of hours of its midnight debut. Then remember that ever since “ We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together ” announced Red in 2012, the mission of the first single released ahead of any Taylor Swift album has been to disrupt and mislead: to disrupt whatever Swift doesn’t like about what’s been said about her since the previous album and to mislead the press and public that the album to come is a more radical departure than it will turn out to be. Of course Swift’s albums do differ from each other, as she develops as a writer and performer and adapts to changing styles. But ultimately they turn out to be collections of Taylor Swift songs, aka evocative details squeezed into catchy melodic cadences. The job of the lead single is to thrill or scare or outrage us by hinting that this time it’ll be something else. Last time, with “Look What You Made Me Do,” she effectively spooked me that Reputation would be an album fixated on the social media celebrity battles she’d been through (mostly with the Kardashian-Wests). That turned out to be a lesser subtopic on an album mostly about the complexities of love , especially for a staggeringly famous teen star who’d become an adult. The disruption now, in advance of the as-yet-unannounced album fans call TS7 , is to shake off Reputation ’s negative overtones—and with them, that album’s mediocre-for–Taylor Swift sales and conspicuous dearth of Grammys . The “old Taylor” whom she pronounced dead on “LWYMMD” is at least partway back, the romantic and girly Tay Tay, first of her name, mother of kittens and rainbows. The “ME!” video begins with the snake that symbolized Swift’s Reputation “era” exploding into hundreds of pastel butterflies. It then transitions to Swift and Urie having a hysterical lovers’ quarrel out of a French New Wave film— en français, no less—and then into a sequence of cotton-candy kaleidoscopic scenarios out of Les Parapluies de Cherbourg or Amélie : people falling through the air on umbrellas, rooftop proposals, drum majorettes (there’s a marching-band underlay to the music in general that suggests a light borrowing from Beyoncé via “ Formation ” and Beychella ), and 1960s teen-dance-party TV shows. You should bask in it a handful of times and then challenge yourself to remember much about it 24 hours later (except probably the French shouting part). The mission of the first single released ahead of any Taylor Swift album has been to disrupt and mislead. As for the mislead, I assume it’s that the balance of the album will not be nearly so much of a regression from the great, grown-up songs of eros, loss, and recovery on Reputation, such as “Delicate,” “Getaway Car,” “Dress,” and “New Year’s Day.” It won’t actually be a never-ending fountain of creamy affirmations—and if there is more of that, perhaps it will incline more toward her country-pop successor Kacey Musgraves’ Golden Hour (which features a song titled “Butterflies” and another called “Rainbow”) than, as here, to Glee, or to Swift’s upcoming way-too-on-brand role in Cats . Though if the style of “ME!” does tell us anything, it’s that her perpetually predicted pivot back to country is likely still far away. Meanwhile, though, there is a country crossover song that was released simultaneously with “ME!” last night. Bruce Springsteen’s new “ Hello Sunshine ,” the first single from his upcoming Western Stars album, sounds like a gently rolling tribute to the ‘60s and ‘70s country sound of Glen Campbell on Jimmy Webb numbers like “ By the Time I Get to Phoenix ” or “ Wichita Lineman .” It’s pretty much nothing but the creaking of floorboards, the temperature of air, and hours on the clock. I bet Swift’s already given it an admiring hearing."
Kentucky Governor Blames Shooting of 7-Year-Old on Teacher Protests,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/kentucky-governor-matt-bevin-teachers-girl-shooting.html,"Ocasio-Cortez Accuses Kellyanne Conway of Trying to “Stoke Suspicion Around My Christianity” Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who once before sparked outrage over wild and speculative claims about striking teachers, is facing condemnation by state Democrats after saying on Thursday that he blamed the accidental shooting of a 7-year-old girl on teachers striking for better classroom funding, according to the Louisville Courier Journal . “[W]e had people pretending to be sick when they weren’t sick and leaving kids unattended to or in situations that they should not have been in,” he told the crowd at the Louisville Rotary Club. “A little girl was shot, 7 years old, by another kid because they were somewhere that they weren’t intended to be and because the parent didn’t have any option, and put them into a situation so they could go to work.” Bevin’s apparent reference to a March 12 shooting in Shively, Kentucky—in which the girl survived—doesn’t get the details quite right. The girl’s guardian, her uncle, was outside when she was shot in the head by her 11-year-old brother inside their home. And while Jefferson County Public Schools had been closed at the time because of the teacher protests, it’s not known whether the two children, who have not been identified, attended public schools in the county. In responding to a question about stemming gun violence, Bevin, who opposes any additional firearm regulations, brought up the teachers’ protests unprompted. The public school teachers had staged a “sick-out” during six days in February and March, calling in sick en masse. (It is illegal for teachers to actually strike in Kentucky.) The teachers had for weeks been demanding better funding for their classrooms and for their pension systems, following another national wave of protests by public school teachers. The teachers conducted their first mass sick-out in 2018 after lawmakers surprised them with a pension-reform measure tacked onto another bill originally meant to deal with “wastewater services.” (The resulting law was ultimately struck down by the state Supreme Court because of the way in which it was passed.) They followed up with more protests over school funding, and Bevin, frustrated by a teacher rally in April 2018 that shut down schools statewide, told reporters that children were being abused as a result of the protests. “I guarantee you somewhere in Kentucky today, a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them,” Bevin said. “I guarantee you somewhere today, a child was physically harmed or ingested poison because they were left alone because a single parent didn’t have any money to take care of them.” He also guessed that some children were “introduced to drugs for the first time.” Bevin—who in January said that school cancellations during the deadly polar vortex proved that America was “ getting soft ”—faced a backlash for those comments. According to the Courier Journal, Bevin’s popularity plummeted soon after he made the remarks, and a new poll showed him to be the least popular governor in the country. Support our journalism

"Trevor Noah assesses Joe Biden, Trump's least favorite candidate (VIDEO).",slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/trevor-noah-joe-biden-trump-daily-show.html,"Watch Conan O’Brien Get Effortlessly Upstaged by a Dog Who Refuses to Wear a Fake Beard After months of dilly-dallying, Joe Biden launched his official campaign for the presidency on Thursday, entering what he calls a “battle for the soul of this nation.” The “adorable goofball,” as Daily Show host Trevor Noah dubbed him, has had a long tenure in office, and with that comes his fair share of baggage. In addition to a handful of dubious political moments—like his mishandling of Anita Hill’s 1991 testimony —the former vice president is known for his verbal gaffes, such as the time he publicly asked a politician in a wheelchair to stand up, or when he aligned 7-Elevens and Dunkin’ Donuts with having a “slight Indian accent.” Even so, Biden remains a favorite in the 2020 race, having won approval in recent years due to his progressive policies and lovable rapport with Barack Obama. But Biden’s biggest asset, Noah insists, is his unique ability to rile up President Donald Trump. On numerous occasions, both Trump and Biden have promised that, were they younger, they’d “beat the hell” out of each other—an entertaining idea, Noah admitted, as long as they can keep their dentures in their mouths.

Kansas Supreme Court issues sweeping decision protecting abortion rights.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/kansas-supreme-court-abortion-rights-case-roe-wade.html,"Rod Rosenstein Has Adopted Trumpian Talking Points In a sweeping decision on Friday, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that its state constitution protects bodily autonomy—including a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy. The court interpreted the Kansas Constitution to provide stronger protections for abortion rights than the federal Constitution, and its decision cannot be reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Friday’s ruling illustrates how state Supreme Courts can safeguard women even as the federal judiciary chips away at Roe v. Wade . It is a signal triumph for both federalism and individual liberty. The court’s decision in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt revolves around a 2015 state law known as S.B. 95 that banned the most common procedure for second-trimester abortions. Reproductive rights advocates challenged the measure under Section 1 of the Kansas Bill of Rights , which declares: “All men [and women] are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” A district court blocked S.B. 95, ruling that the Kansas Constitution provides the same protections for abortion as the U.S. Constitution. The state court of appeals affirmed that decision , and the state appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court, which voted to affirm, and bolster, the lower court ruling. In its majority opinion, the high court agreed that the Kansas Constitution protects abortion rights—but held that it goes further than the federal Constitution in its guarantee of bodily autonomy. Unlike the federal Constitution, the majority explained, the Kansas Constitution expressly shields “inalienable rights” from government intrusion. And an exhaustive review of the historical record demonstrates that the framers of the Kansas Constitution intended “its unenumerated natural rights guarantee” to extend beyond the Due Process Clause of the federal Constitution, in which Roe is rooted . Among other things, “inalienable rights” encompass the right to “to control one’s own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self-determination.” The court explained:
At the heart of [Section 1 of the Kansas Bill of Rights] is the principle that individuals should be free to make choices about how to conduct their own lives, or, in other words, to exercise personal autonomy. Few decisions impact our lives more than those about issues that affect one’s physical health, family formation, and family life. Applying this principle to S.B. 95, the majority easily concluded that the law ran afoul of this principle. “Denying a pregnant woman the ability to determine whether to continue a pregnancy,” the court wrote, “would severely limit her right of personal autonomy. And abortion laws do not merely restrict a particular action; they can impose an obligation on an unwilling woman to carry out a long-term course of conduct that will impact her health and alter her life.” As a result, any Kansas law that limits abortion access must meet “strict scrutiny.” That requires the state to prove that an abortion restriction is “narrowly tailored to promote” a “compelling interest.” Here, Kansas has not yet met this “searching” standard, as it failed to identify any compelling interest in outlawing a common, safe abortion procedure—and, in the process, “severely” curtailing women’s natural rights. The district court did not apply strict scrutiny to S.B. 95, so the state has not yet had an opportunity to try to prove that the law meets this standard. So the majority sent the case back down for further hearings, with a strong suggestion that Kansas will not be able to “establish a compelling state interest.” Friday’s ruling cannot be overturned by SCOTUS . By applying strict scrutiny, the Kansas Supreme Court expressly rejected the current U.S. Supreme Court test for abortion limitations, which simply asks if they impose an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to choose. The majority refused to adopt this loose and notoriously malleable test, holding that it is insufficiently stringent to safeguard inalienable rights under the Kansas Constitution. This “ad hoc balancing test” allows a “weak” state interest to “justify an infringement” on abortion, the Kansas Supreme Court wrote of the current federal standard. It “emphasizes the governmental interest” instead of “the individual’s rights,” and thus “lacks the rigor demanded by the Kansas Constitution for protecting the right of personal autonomy.” The ruling was 6–1, with three of the court’s liberals joined by two more conservative judges in the majority opinion. Another liberal justice, Daniel Biles, concurred in the judgment but rebuffed the new standard; he would’ve blocked the law under the undue burden test that the majority spurned. A single justice, Caleb Stegall, dissented, insisting that the Kansas Constitution does not protect the right to terminate a pregnancy. He did not attempt to conceal his disdain for abortion, railing against the procedure as “human dismemberment.” And he condemned the majority’s ruling as “the most significant and far-reaching decision this court has ever made.” Stegall is not wrong that Friday’s decision is monumental. But for those who support the right to bodily integrity, its scope is cause for celebration not denunciation. Like a number of other state Supreme Courts— including, most recently, Iowa’s —the Kansas Supreme Court has ensured that abortion rights will survive in the state if the U.S. Supreme Court overrules Roe. Indeed, it has granted robust protections for abortion access that go far beyond the federal standard. Even if Roe falls, Kansas women will have a constitutional buffer against draconian constraints on their reproductive rights. Because it is rooted exclusively in the state constitution, Friday’s ruling cannot be overturned by SCOTUS. But it can be reversed by constitutional amendment. That would require both houses of the Legislature to approve an amendment by a two-thirds vote, at which point it would be placed on the ballot and added to the constitution if supported by a majority of voters. Republicans hold a supermajority in both houses of the Kansas Legislature, though the GOP faction is sharply divided between archconservatives and moderates. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly endorsed Friday’s ruling but has no authority over the amendment process. To forestall an amendment, Kelly will have to persuade Democratic legislators, as well as a handful of moderate Republicans, to stand behind the court. The fight over abortion rights in Kansas, in other words, is not over. And the future of Friday’s landmark decision is uncertain. But a majority of the court has ensured that, at least for now, the state may not exercise control over women’s bodies. Other state Supreme Courts should take note : This is what judicial courage looks like. Support our journalism

Trump defends “very fine people” Charlottesville comments.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-very-fine-people-charlottesville-defense.html,"Ocasio-Cortez Accuses Kellyanne Conway of Trying to “Stoke Suspicion Around My Christianity” In his campaign announcement video Thursday, Joe Biden reminded the viewers of a particularly shocking moment from the Trump presidency. In August 2017, after violence during a rally of white supremacists and neo-Nazis left one counterprotester dead and dozens injured, President Trump defended the marchers during a press conference and argued that there were “some very fine people on both sides .” Biden’s reference put Trump on the defensive, and in a new statement on Friday, the president indicated he doesn’t regret his remarks about the Unite the Right rally, a white supremacist gathering organized to bring together a large number of far-right groups that had risen in prominence after Trump’s election and pegged to the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. “If you look at what I said, you will see that that question was answered perfectly,” Trump said. “I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee—a great general, whether you like it or not.” Technically, Trump had mentioned Lee—later on, after he had already weathered a backlash for his initial comments. The press conference in which he first drew moral equivalence between anti-racist protesters and avowed white supremacists came on Aug. 12. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,” he said, placing an emphasis on the last three words. He repeated: “ On many sides .” He gave another more diplomatic response the next day, but the president doubled down on the “both-sides” position three days later, tossing aside his more carefully scripted remarks about condemning hatred to blast his critics in a combative exchange with reporters . “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent,” he said. “And nobody wants to say that. I’ll say it right now. You had a group—you had a group on the other side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violent.” It was at that point that he wove in his material about Lee:
But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee. If you look at some of the groups and you see—and you’d know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you’re not—but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week it’s Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? This argument did not reflect the reality of the situation—there were white supremacists shouting “white lives matter” and “Jews will not replace us.” Instead, he attempted to reduce this violent hatred to an issue of statue preservation. The president then uttered a phrase that would become a rallying cry for his critics. “Yes, I think there’s blame on both sides,” he said. “And you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.” He suggested that some of the white supremacists were there simply to harmlessly protest the removal of “to them, a very, very important statue.” Trump furiously criticized the “alt-left” as being “very, very violent” and “swinging clubs” and demanded to know if the “alt-left” had “any semblance of guilt.” Trump was grasping for a defense, furious about the bipartisan and nearly universal criticism of his earlier statements. As the New York Times put it: “Venting, his face red as he personally executed the defense of his own actions that no one else would, Mr. Trump all but erased any good will he had earned Monday when he named racist groups and called them ‘repugnant to everything we hold dear.’ ” Biden, in his video, held up Charlottesville and Trump’s poor response to the violence that broke out there as representative of why he is seeking the presidency. Some have accused Biden of using the city and the traumatic event as a prop, but others believe that evoking one of the president’s worst moment of the past two and a half years will speak to a certain segment of the electorate. If nothing else, Biden’s video did get Trump talking—and digging that hole ever deeper. Support our journalism

Avengers: Endgame’s female superheroes are mistreated and then united to take a bow.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/avengers-endgame-female-representation-black-widow.html,"Endgame Is a Love Letter to Robert Downey Jr. From the Marvel Cinematic Universe This post contains spoilers for Avengers: Endgame . Avengers: Endgame takes its fan-service duties seriously. As the culmination of an 11-year, 22-film cycle, this season finale of a film has to resolve countless storylines and character arcs, but it also takes frequent breathers to feature, say, Captain America fighting an earlier version of himself, the Hulk taking selfies with fans, and a wastrel Thor issuing threats through a headset while playing Fortnite with his fellow Ragnarok survivors. And yet there’s one bit of fan service that couldn’t land more gracelessly if it were tossed off the cliff on Vormir. During the final showdown with Thanos for the fate of the universe, Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Okoye, the Wasp, and several other female characters get in formation, presumably for audiences to rally around Marvel’s commitment to gender equality and women’s representation. Instead, the scene immediately revealed itself as the apotheosis of the studio’s expectation that fans of female superheroes be satisfied with scraps, while courting woke points for its supposed forward thinking. Endgame treats most of its female characters as walking applause lines first and people (or space aliens) second. Let the record speak for itself: Marvel put out 20 movies with male protagonists, many of them brain-meltingly similar to one another, before releasing its first built around a female superbeing. That 2019 movie, Captain Marvel ,was also the first Marvel movie with a female director in co-helmer Anna Boden and only the second with female screenwriters in Boden and Geneva Robertson-Dworet. Maleness isn’t a disqualifier for writing women well, of course, but even the most dynamic female supporting characters in the Marvel canon—such as Thor: Ragnarok ’s Valkyrie and Black Panther ’s Okoye and Shuri—are relegated to secondary arcs and largely pop off the screens because of the charisma of the actresses embodying them. Many of the other Marvel superheroines have been mired in controversies: Black Widow calling herself a “monster” for her inability to conceive children (after a forced sterilization) in Age of Ultron , Mantis being called ugly in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , the Wasp having to wait the duration of an entire movie before getting to suit up and size down (at which point she was immediately Snaptured). Then there’s the depressing fact that so many female characters primarily exist to scold or discourage , their most notable superpower consisting of constantly looking like they’re wagging their fingers while not physically performing that action. Humor and valor are the currencies of the Marvel movies. Too often, the women are left in arrears. Endgame is no exception. Tony Stark quips, Captain America checks out his own ass, Thor channels the Big Lebowski, and even the Hulk finds the Buddhist bro within. Hawkeye broods, but he’s ultimately rewarded for his quest with the movie’s yawn-inspiring vision of bliss: heterosexual domesticity. Black Widow, in contrast, seems to hit all the female obligations of superhero tales: to be no fun, yearn romantically, then die, arguably so a man can find happiness. In the rare moments when the female heroes who have been afforded a non-sourpuss personality in other movies show up—Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Okoye, Shuri—they don’t get to show it. Gamora, Scarlet Witch, and the Wasp may not have a sense of humor—a lack that is frankly the most dehumanizing trait a writer can give a character—but at least they’ve got backstories as superpowered beings. The presupposition that we’re supposed to salute fifth-billed characters like Mantis and Pepper Potts just for showing up demonstrates how deep Marvel had to dig to come up with these ostensible triumphs of feminism. Then there’s the ways Endgame fails its two biggest female characters, Black Widow and Nebula, by not bothering to fully develop their emotional journeys. Black Widow’s readiness to give up on life is hardly established, and on Planet Vormir, she’s on the verge of getting back what she’s desired all along—a family—before killing herself. Even more insultingly, the only continuous Avenger who still hasn’t gotten her own movie—though one’s been promised for years and may yet happen —gets a fraction of the mourning that Tony Stark enjoys. Iron Man gets a funeral, with slow pans across the gathered grievers. Black Widow gets a single mention. Her disappearance from the movie couldn’t have been more abrupt if Scarlett Johansson had magically vanished from the set midway through shooting.

But the greater affront might be the Marvel movies’ ongoing treatment of Nebula, whose tale of grisly, lifelong abuse by her father is seldom given the gravity it deserves. We feel Nebula’s physical pain in Endgame , as she’s pried apart once again by Thanos to serve his own agenda. But the Guardians of the Galaxy movies have tended to villainize her for not getting over her brainwashing fast enough, and now Endgame , which finds her rehabilitated, dares not acknowledge the full horror of a woman forced to kill a stunted, not-yet-ready-to-heal version of herself to save her sibling. In fact, Endgame ’s pat appeal to sisterhood, which unites Nebula and Gamora, is symptomatic of its overall treatment of female characters as walking applause lines first and people (or space aliens) second. The fans are ready to clap for their female favorites, but Marvel should try giving them something to cheer for first."
Ukraine Elected a Sitcom Star President. His Show Tells Us What to Expect.,slate.com,Jennifer Wilson,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky-sitcom-servant-of-the-people.html,"Watch Conan O’Brien Get Effortlessly Upstaged by a Dog Who Refuses to Wear a Fake Beard Last year, the production company behind Servant of the People , Kvartal 95, registered a political party by the same name and nominated the show’s lead actor, comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, for the presidency. Political observers largely regarded his candidacy as a publicity stunt, and in truth, Zelensky did much to encourage that point of view. In lieu of participating in debates, he held large rallies that reportedly felt more like comedy shows than campaign events (he also charged an entrance fee). But on April 21, life imitated primetime, and Zelensky walked away with 73 percent of the vote (an even higher margin than his TV character’s win), beating out the incumbent Petro Poroshenko. As Zelensky has no prior political experience and largely avoided discussing policy during his campaign, it’s difficult to predict what his presidency might look like. All we really have to speculate from is his television show. So what can Servant of the People tell us about how Zelensky might govern Ukraine? Perhaps quite a lot, given how eerily Zelensky’s candidacy mirrors Vasyl Holoborodko’s rise to power: Both were heavily reliant on harnessing a potent mix of anti-establishment sentiment, social media prowess, and countrywide desire to play a joke on the powers that be. Much like the viral video that garnered nationwide support for Vasyl’s presidential run, Servant of the People quickly shifted from mere entertainment to a real political sensation. In 2017, Zelensky told the website Cinema Escapist, “I have started receiving more messages from ordinary people that confirm there’s a desire for [someone like Holoborodko] to lead Ukraine through its current realities.” Those current realities are frightening. An ailing economy, widespread government corruption, and continued fighting with pro-Russian separatists have left Ukrainian citizens feeling beleaguered, frustrated, and maybe, it turns out, even a little desperate. Outside observers, particularly in Russia, have tended to paint Ukraine’s political difficulties as insurmountable and the country as endemically dysfunctional, teetering on the verge of becoming a failed state. The appeal of a show like Servant of the People is that it pushes against the idea that there’s anything structurally wrong with Ukraine; the country just needs good, honest people in office, and then everything will be OK. As one of Vasyl’s friends and appointees puts it: “The country is fine. We just have a lot of jackasses.” Servant of the People pushes the idea that “the country is fine. We just have a lot of jackasses.” In the pilot episode, we find Vasyl living with his parents, sister, and niece in a cramped apartment with outdated furnishings and broken appliances. His father drives an unregistered taxi to supplement the paltry government subsidy he receives as a pensioner. Vasyl works as a public school teacher where he collects a salary that—as his father likes to remind him—is less than he’d receive collecting unemployment wages. Vasyl even has to take out a loan to buy a microwave oven. But one day the family gets a knock on the door: The prime minister is there and congratulates Vasyl, now President Holoborodko. The show flashes back to Vasyl’s history classroom. After learning that his students have been pulled out of class to build voting booths for the upcoming election, he rants to a colleague in a profanity-laden tirade about the uselessness of voting: “It’s always the lesser of two assholes, and it’s been this way for 25 years.” It turns out a student is secretly recording Vasyl, who adds, “If I could have one week in office, if such a thing were possible, I would show them! Fuck the motorcades, fuck the perks, fuck the weekend chalets.” The video quickly garners 8 million YouTube views, and a political star is born. Social media was also a major component of Zelensky’s candidacy. Instead of participating in debates or giving interviews, Zelensky communicated almost exclusively with voters via Instagram (he has 4.7 million followers to Poroshenko’s 286,000).

We see him become turned off by the opulence of the presidential estate. During a tour of the property, he’s shown an antique chandelier that was recently replated with gold. “Remember the 2008 crisis?” his aide asks him. “This was that.” In just a couple of episodes, a disgusted Vasyl moves back in with his family and calls for sweeping anti-corruption reforms including one requiring government employees to declare their assets. That mirrored a real initiative implemented in 2016 that showed just how much wealth Ukraine’s political elite was amassing (the mayor of Dnipro had a ticket to space on a Virgin Galactic flight) while the country’s average monthly income teetered around $200. On Servant of the People , Vasyl’s reforms predictably attract pushback from political elites who do their best to collect kompromat (Russian for “compromising material”)—a word that has become increasingly well-known in the U.S. thanks to the alleged pee tape. But their operatives come up empty. Vasyl, in the tradition of inspiring TV presidents, is the real deal, an honest, hardworking teacher who can’t be blackmailed or bought. This is the fantasy of Servant of the People —and it’s a popular one, not just in Ukraine. The ratings success of the show attracted attention from studios worldwide. In 2016, Fox bought option rights to make an American version of the show. Production companies in France and Greece swiftly followed suit. The original series was translated and aired in South Korea in 2017, and Netflix purchased streaming rights the same year. The show’s popularity and global appeal should come as no surprise; the idea that real political change can be ushered in by electing the right people without any radical altering of the political structure is a comforting, if silly, thought. And perhaps nowhere is that thought more attractive than in a country like Ukraine, which has seen revolutions and popular uprisings (most recently the 2014 Maidan movement) yield little in the way of actual change. In the pilot episode, Vasyl, shortly after finding out he’s won, turns to his prime minister and says: “It feels like this is a practical joke.” It is uncanny to watch this scene, indeed this entire show, knowing what we know now. Whether or not Zelensky’s candidacy was indeed a practical joke or publicity stunt gone wrong, his election means that, for better or worse, anyone can become president. Either way, it makes for good TV, and it’s a reminder that democracy can be—and maybe is even supposed to be—scary."
The Supreme Court’s Anti-Worker Rulings Are So Routine Now That We Hardly Notice Them. Big Mistake.,slate.com,Sheldon Whitehouse,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/sheldon-whitehouse-roberts-supreme-court-lamps-plus.html,"Trump: Fox’s Napolitano Asked for Supreme Court Seat, Pardon for His Friend The Supreme Court’s conservative bloc delivered yet another 5–4 decision helping corporate interests this week. You may not have heard about it, as these 5–4 pro-corporate rulings are now issued like clockwork. A distinct pattern has emerged among the court’s “partisan” rulings, where the Roberts Five render a 5–4 decision attracting no support from the more liberal justices. This one comes at the expense of American workers. This latest partisan 5–4 decision—which came in the case of Lamps Plus Inc. v. Varela —used the Federal Arbitration Act, a law governing how parties can resolve disputes through private arbitration proceedings, to deny a defrauded worker a chance at a class action. Again, if you missed it, you’re not alone. Partisan decisions from the Roberts Five choking off the rights of workers and consumers and protecting corporations from accountability have become so boringly predictable that they’re hardly news anymore. The Federal Arbitration Act is a favored weapon of the corporate-friendly Roberts Five. In a series of these partisan 5–4 decisions, the Republicans on the Roberts court have morphed that statute into a get-out-of-accountability-free card for corporations: Rent-a-Center v. Jackson (2010), AT&T v. Concepcion (2011), American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant (2013), and Epic Systems v. Lewis (2018), to name a few. All made it harder for workers to get their day in court. All went well beyond the original meaning of the act when passed in 1925, which was to “enable merchants of roughly equal bargaining power to enter into binding agreements to arbitrate commercial disputes,” as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained in a 2018 dissent in Epic Systems . These same arbitration cases often also display the Roberts Five’s fierce hostility—in both judicial and arbitration settings—to plaintiffs who seek to join their claims in collective or class-action cases. This hostility lets corporate malfeasance resulting in high-volume, low-dollar injuries go unremedied. The court’s hostility lets corporate malfeasance resulting in high-volume, low-dollar injuries go unremedied. Lamps Plus is a textbook example. The plaintiff, Frank Varela, sued his employer, Lamps Plus, after a company data breach led to a fraudulent tax return being filed in his name. Relying on the Roberts Five’s arbitration precedent, Lamps Plus lawyers drove Varela’s claims out of court and into corporate-friendly arbitration. In arbitration, Varela sought to arbitrate his claims for a class of similarly situated workers. The 9 th Circuit agreed, applying the legal doctrine of contra proferentem —a long-settled principle of state contract law that ambiguities in contracts be construed against the party that drafted the contract, particularly where that party has greater bargaining power. “A reasonable—and perhaps the most reasonable—interpretation of [the agreement’s] expansive language is that it authorizes class arbitration,” the 9 th Circuit majority said. Then the Roberts Five went to work. Notwithstanding these state contract law principles (remember federalism?) or the absence of any textual support in the arbitration statute (remember textualism?), the 5–4 Roberts majority held that to construe ambiguities against the drafter of an arbitration agreement (almost always a corporate drafter) would contravene what it called the Arbitration Act’s “first principle”—that “arbitration is strictly a matter of consent, not coercion.” As a matter of fact, this employer had drafted the arbitration agreement (ambiguities and all) and had forced Varela to sign it as a condition of his employment. Some consent. (The Roberts Five have a tendency to invent facts in cases to suit their desired outcome— Citizens United and Shelby County being notable examples.) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in dissent pointed out how “treacherously” the court has strayed from the principle that arbitration is a matter of consent: “Shut from the Court’s sight is the ‘Hobson’s choice’ employees face: ‘accept arbitration on their employer’s terms or give up their jobs.’ ” Once again, the corporate interest won, 5–4. There is an established pattern of bias toward the corporate elite, inconsistent with Roberts’ famous assertion from his confirmation hearing that the justices are just “calling balls and strikes.” In partnership with the American Constitution Society, I just published a review of Chief Justice John Roberts’ tenure through 2018 describing this pattern. Republican appointees have delivered for corporate or conservative interests in 73 partisan, 5–4 decisions during the Roberts era, with big Republican donor interests winning 73 out of 73 decisions. More tellingly, the Roberts Five often trample purportedly conservative judicial principles—respect for states’ rights, textualism, judicial restraint, stare decisis , even originalism—when those principles stand in the way of an outcome they want. In nearly 55 percent of those 73 decisions, one or more of those traditionally conservative judicial principles was ignored. Driving consumers and employees into forced arbitration takes away their constitutional right to a jury trial and spares mighty corporate defendants the embarrassment of testifying under oath, divulging corporate documents through discovery, or being treated equally with an injured person. Closing off class actions—the only economically feasible path to litigate high-volume, low-dollar fraud—creates a safe harbor for this form of corporate misbehavior. Many of the 73 Roberts Five decisions serve to protect corporations from these consequences. Equality before the law is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. Courts and juries have a constitutional role in checking the power of wealthy elites who can push ordinary people around, and who are often not checked by legislatures and executive officials. While the chief justice has recently been inclined toward grand public gestures defending his court’s impartiality , the unmistakable pattern of partisan 5–4 decision leads to an inescapable conclusion: that the Roberts Five are pursuing political outcomes, and are willing to violate basic principles of American governance to execute the right-wing, corporate Republican game plan. Lamps Plus is another case in point. Support our journalism

"Texas retracts claim of mass voter fraud touted by Trump, halts planned purge.",slate.com,admin,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/texas-retracts-voter-fraud-claim-stops-purge.html/,"The Press Didn’t Just Report Accurately on Trump-Russia Corruption. It Prevented the Corruption From Being Worse. On Jan. 25, Texas Secretary of State David Whitley issued a shocking advisory alleging that 95,000 noncitizens were on the state’s voter rolls, 58,000 of whom had cast at least one ballot. Whitley, a Republican, directed county registrars to commence an immediate purge of these noncitizens using lists he would provide. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Republican, promptly tweeted a “VOTER FRAUD ALERT” summarizing Whitley’s findings, and President Donald Trump repeated Whitley’s claims two days later. By that point, counties had already begun notifying targeted voters that they would be purged from the rolls. On Friday, Whitley quietly promised to rescind his January advisory and halt Texas’ voter purge as part of a settlement with multiple voting rights groups. The factual basis of Paxton and Trump’s tweets has been not just undermined, but fully revoked. Friday’s settlement is a good reminder to be incredibly skeptical of government officials who make eye-popping claims of voter fraud and whose partisan interests are at stake. Over and over and over again, these claims are later proved to be extremely dubious—if not outright false. Whitley compiled his purge list by using Department of Public Safety records to identify individuals who presented documents indicating that they were noncitizens when they obtained or renewed a driver’s license. It cross-referenced that list with the voter rolls, and voilà , found 95,000 names that appeared on both. What Whitley did not consider is the fact that more than 50,000 Texans are naturalized each year—and when they gain citizenship, they do not have to inform the Department of Public Safety. Thus, it’s overwhelmingly likely that a huge number of people Whitley flagged have become U.S. citizens and are lawful voters. As I explained in February: “Driver’s licenses issued to non-citizens are valid for six years, and over the last six years, nearly 350,000 Texas adults have been naturalized. If even one-third of those adults registered to vote, they could easily account for the total number of ‘non-citizen’ voter registrants on Whitley’s list.” So Whitley’s list didn’t really target noncitizens; it targeted naturalized citizens, which happens to be unconstitutional. In response, a coalition of voting rights groups—including Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the American Civil Liberties Union, Dēmos, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the Texas Civil Rights Project—filed lawsuits. A federal judge blocked the purge in late February, describing it as “ham-handed,” “a solution looking for a problem,” and an effort “to intimidate the least powerful among us.” Seeing the writing on the wall, Whitley chose to settle the cases rather than suffer a protracted court battle over his indefensible purge. Under the terms of Friday’s settlement, Whitley must retract his January advisory and ask counties to stop purging voters on the basis of the lists he sent. Instead, Texas will undertake a narrow and restrained approach, using much more detailed, precise criteria and up-to-date information to maintain its voter rolls. Naturalized citizens will not be targeted, and voters suspected of lacking citizenship will have a real opportunity to prove they’ve been misidentified. The state will train county registrars to ensure that they do not purge voters on the basis of incomplete or suspect data. After the Texas purge began, I noted that Whitley had taken a page from the Kris Kobach playbook, tossing out a wildly inflated claim of noncitizen voting, then used the ensuing panic to justify mass disenfranchisement. But that tactic does not necessarily work when voting rights advocates are prepared to pummel the state with lawsuits that uncover the lies and duplicity used to concoct the state’s initial claim (or when the initial claim is so easily proven to be bogus). The Friday settlement ending Texas’ planned purge is an object lesson in the vital role that swift, smart lawyering can play in safeguarding the franchise. If the state hadn’t faced an immediate hail of lawsuits, it may well have gotten away with its lawless assault on suffrage.

The best gift you can give a teacher is a thank-you letter.,slate.com,Matthew Dicks,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/best-teacher-gift-costs-nothing-thank-you-cards.html,"Teacher Appreciation Week snuck up on you? Slate’s Ask a Teacher columnists dish on gifts teachers actually want . Carrie Bauer explains why you should never look to Pinterest for teacher gift inspiration . It’s the last day of fourth grade. Kids are so loud and excited that it feels like summer vacation has started one day early. Except the classroom also looks like Christmas, at least to me. My classmates are filing into the room carrying boxes of every size and shape, wrapped in colorful paper and ribbons—gifts for our teacher, Mrs. Lavern. I don’t have a wrapped gift for Mrs. Lavern. I like her as much as everyone else, but my parents have never had the money to purchase gifts for my teachers. I wear my cousin Russell’s hand-me-down clothing—every item too long and too wide—and I raise my hand every morning when Mrs. Lavern asks who is getting a free hot lunch. Giving Mrs. Lavern a box of chocolates is simply not my parents’ priority. And I get it. Still, I feel small and stupid every time my classmates bring in gifts and all I have to offer is a homemade card. I can barely muster the courage to hand it to her when the time comes. Thirty years later, standing before my own class of two dozen fifth graders, I cherish these personal cards from students and parents more than anything purchased from a store, and I’m sure Mrs. Lavern felt similarly. This is why when I’m asked, as I often am, what parents should give their children’s teachers, I always say the same thing: a heartfelt letter. This isn’t just because my family couldn’t afford presents, though that certainly shaped my point of view. It’s also because, as a teacher, I’ve seen how valuable a truly thoughtful note can be. I know that many parents are looking for a quick token to express their appreciation , and as a busy parent myself, I understand that perspective. And those gifts are certainly appreciated. But a sincere thank-you note can have a deeper impact than you might think. Teachers whom administrators trust are able to deviate from the curriculum and work more creatively. They are able to take more risks and teach outside the box. Teachers exist in an odd bubble. A student might say “thank you” at the end of the day or offer us a hug after we help them tie their shoes. They may even leave a note on our desk, like the one I recently received from one of my fifth graders that said, “You make me mad in a good way.” But for the most part, we work hard every day for students who don’t always have the words, inclination, or awareness to express their appreciation. We spend thousands of hours with these little people, struggling to teach them to read and calculate and write. We relentlessly encourage them to make good decisions and treat others with kindness. We fall in love with our students, but in June they exit our classrooms. They may cherish the memories of our time together, but we often never hear about the difference we’ve made in their lives. As you’ve no doubt heard, teaching is often described as “thankless work.” In fact, most of what we hear are questions, concerns, and complaints from parents. Parents wonder if their child has friends, is reading at grade level, or is behaving in the cafeteria. Does Charlie need math support? Shouldn’t Elizabeth be in the gifted program? These are perfectly legitimate questions, and I love discussing my students with their parents, who are, and should be, their children’s fiercest advocates. But many of those same parents are also watching their children grow over the course of the year. They know if their child’s teacher has celebrated their child’s successes or focused only on her struggles. They can tell you with perfect accuracy if a teacher has taken a special interest in their child or if their child has seemingly fallen between the cracks. If your child’s teacher has made a real impact on your child, take a moment during Teacher Appreciation Week to let that teacher know how much her dedication and effort has meant to you. In fact, take it one step further. Rather than simply sending a thank-you letter to your child’s teacher, forward it to that teacher’s superintendent and principal too, or even better, write directly to the superintendent and principal and forward a copy to the teacher as well. I know how helpful these letters can be because I once received such a letter. In June of 2001, I had just completed my second year of teaching, and I was hoping to get tenure soon. On the last day of the school year, I found a note in my teacher mailbox, written by the mother of one of my students. It was addressed to the superintendent of schools, and I could see from the envelope that a copy had also been sent to my principal. I expected the worst—a note addressed to the superintendent is never good—but in fact, the mother had written to express her appreciation for me: “I am pleased to write to you to sing the praises of one of your elementary school teachers, Matthew Dicks,” it began. She told the superintendent that I am tough and that I “challenged the students effectively.” She said that her daughter had developed a deep love for reading, writing poetry, solving math problems, and “even Shakespeare!” After that note, I had no trouble getting rehired for the next year. While a principal conducts formal observations of a teacher and spends time in the classroom throughout the year, a teacher teaches for more than 1,000 hours per year. An administrator might be lucky to see three or four of those hours. Superintendents almost never enter a teacher’s classroom, and even if they stop by for a visit, they don’t get a measure of a teacher’s skill and dedication. That parent’s insight into my teaching meant everything. Teachers held in high esteem can become team leaders, which is often the first step toward an administrative position, and these positions are often accompanied by a bump in pay. A solid reputation makes it easier to facilitate or avoid a grade-level change or transfer to another school. It may also help a teacher to counteract the words of a parent who has lodged a complaint. If parents are clearly happy with a teacher’s performance, the lone complaint can appear as more of an outlier than the beginning of a pattern to an administrator. Teachers whom administrators trust are able to deviate from the curriculum and work more creatively. They are able to take more risks and teach outside the box, like teaching Shakespeare to third graders. And for a teacher hoping to earn tenure, a letter like the one I received can serve as ammunition when a principal argues in favor of that teacher’s tenure to the powers that be. Save yourself some money on Starbucks gift cards this year. Instead, sit down and spend an hour writing something meaningful and impactful about your child’s teacher. Then send it to the principal and even the superintendent. It’s the least-expensive and most-appreciated gift you may ever give. "

Trump again re-enacts Paris terror attacks using finger guns: “Get over here!

After angering many in France (and around the world) last year when he used finger guns and sound effects to act out the 2015 terrorist attacks on Paris that killed 130 people, he was at it again this week. Speaking to the National Rifle Association convention, Trump once again used the attack as an example of why the United States needs lax gun laws. Last year, that little skit by the president led to complaints both from the French Foreign Ministry and François Hollande, who was French president at the time of the attacks. But that didn’t stop Trump from repeating the same talking point. “Paris, France, they say has the strongest gun laws in the world,” Trump told the crowd in Indianapolis Friday . “If there was one gun being carried by one person on the other side, it very well could have been a whole different result.” Trump then went on to act out the massacre: “Get over here! Boom! Get over here! Boom! And then they left. They were captured later.” The president went on to say that even if a there were a couple of guns in the crowd, the attacks “probably wouldn’t have happened because the cowards would have known there are people in there having guns.” Last year, the spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the president’s remarks: “France expresses its firm disapproval of the comments by President Trump about the attacks of 13 November 2015 in Paris and asks for the memory of the victims to be respected.” Support our journalism

Kennedy’s administration and, except for Ron Ziegler who lied for Richard Nixon, I’ve never seen anything like this with Sarah Sanders,” Donaldson said. And even when it came to Ziegler “there’s a difference” because “Ziegler lied about one thing” and that’s whether Nixon was engaged in a cover-up of Watergate but he was still truthful on other matters.

Donaldson did go on to say though that the real problem was Trump, not his press secretary. “And let’s face it, I don’t know her. I feel a little sorry for her because it’s the boss who does it,” Donaldson said. “She takes the cue from him. Leadership begins at the top. And so it is all the bad things that happen in the administration.” It isn’t just the frequency of the lies, Donaldson went on to say, but also that her lies are far from inconsequential. Other press secretaries may have made up quotes in support of their boss.

"President praises Nick Bosa, second pick in NFL draft, a Trump supporter who called Kaepernick a “clown.”",slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/president-praises-nick-bosa-second-pick-nfl-kaepernick-clown.html,"A New Obstruction Case Against a Judge Proves William Barr’s DOJ Is Now Just an Arm of President Donald Trump President Donald Trump sent a tweet of support to Nick Bosa Saturday morning , shortly after he became the second player to be selected in the NFL draft. Trump didn’t say a word about the top draft pick, Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray, who is black and was selected by the Arizona Cardinals. Instead, he was full of praise for Bosa, who is white and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers. “Congratulations to Nick Bosa on being picked number two in the NFL Draft. You will be a great player for years to come, maybe one of the best,” Trump wrote . “Big Talent! San Francisco will embrace you but most importantly, always stay true to yourself.” Congratulations to Nick Bosa on being picked number two in the NFL Draft.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 27, 2019 While some were quick to highlight the fact that Trump chose to praise the white player while ignoring the black player , the tweet also came shortly after Bosa expressed contrition for some politically controversial tweets. Specifically, Bosa addressed a since-deleted tweet in which he called Colin Kapernick a “clown.” “I definitely made some insensitive decisions throughout my life,” Bosa said at a news conference Friday .. “I’m just excited to be here with a clean slate. I’m sorry if I hurt anybody. I definitely didn’t intend for that to be the case.” He also denied that the “clown” tweet referred to Kaepernick´s efforts to raise awareness. “It’s not like I’m saying his stance and what he was doing, that’s not what I was calling or talking about at all. It was just a specific thing that happened and me as a young kid a thought popping in my head and boom, decided to tweet it out,” he said . “Bad decision. I respect what he’s done. If it empowers anybody then he’s doing a good thing. So, I apologize for that.” The tweet, which was sent in August 2016 at the height of the controversy of Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem, was deleted as part of a broad scrubbing of controversial social media posts. He also deleted other tweets, including some that were supportive of Trump. He also allegedly deleted a tweet that called Beyoncé’s music “complete trash” and another one that allegedly characterized Black Panther as the “worst Marvel movie.” In an interview with ESPN, Bosa said he “had to” delete the tweets because “there is a chance I might end up in San Francisco.” Support our journalism

Chabad of Poway shooting: several injured in synagogue shooting outside San Diego.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/chabad-poway-synagogue-shooting-san-diego.html,"A New Obstruction Case Against a Judge Proves William Barr’s DOJ Is Now Just an Arm of President Donald Trump A woman was killed and three were injured in a shooting at a synagogue outside San Diego Saturday. A law enforcement source tells ABC News the suspect appeared to fire “more than 10 rounds” before leaving, noting it all happened very quickly. “[We were] outside in front of our house and heard about six gunshots, a pause, some yelling and then another six or seven gunshots,” neighbor Chris Folts said. The San Diego County sheriff’s office said on Twitter that a man has been detained in connection with “a shooting incident” that took place at the Chabad of Poway synagogue. Poway is located around 20 miles north of San Diego .

Golden State Warriors vs. Houston Rockets: Is Kevin Durant the best player in the world?,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/golden-state-warriors-vs-houston-rockets-is-kevin-durant-the-best-player-in-the-world.html,"The Spurs Forgot How Fouling, Time, and Points Work The only knock you can make on Kevin Durant’s 50-point performance against the Los Angeles Clippers is that Golden State needed to play a Game 6 in order for it to happen. The Warriors lost as many home games in this first-round series (two) as they did during their previous two postseason runs combined, and the extra work of Friday’s 129-110 victory took its toll. While Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson both suffered—and played through—ankle injuries, Durant took control of the offense and tested the endurance of the Staples Center’s scorekeeper. Durant scored 38 before halftime, which tied an NBA playoff record for most points in a single half. He was as efficient as he was prolific, and it only took him 26 shots to reach his final tally of 50 points. It was the kind of performance where the numbers themselves make for jaw-dropping highlights, but the actual highlights are worth watching, too. 50 pts | 15-26 FG — ESPN (@espn) April 27, 2019 Seven-footers aren’t supposed to be that nimble, and Durant scored with the ease of a retirement home orderly retrieving a blanket from a moderately high shelf. It looked so effortless that I was relieved to see him out of breath during the halftime interview, if only for the sake of his opponents’ pride. “We tried everything,” Clippers guard Lou Williams said after the game. “Sometimes, you come across special people and it doesn’t matter what you send to them.” Can’t hate on this answer. Good series 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/shHHDKzy1Q — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) April 27, 2019 “That was one of the great performances I’ve ever seen in my life, and I’ve seen some good ones,” Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said after the game. Kerr called Durant “ the best player in the world ,” and the forward won’t have to wait long to justify that praise. Golden State’s next series, against the Houston Rockets, starts on Sunday. No team has come closer than the Rockets to toppling the Warriors during the Durant era. They pushed Golden State to a Game 7 in last year’s Western Conference Finals before succumbing to one of the coldest (and oddest) shooting performances in postseason history ( 7-for-44 from beyond the arc ). If you believe luck manifests itself in broad, pendular swings, then Curry and Thompson’s ankle injuries probably look pretty significant. Both players are expected to play in Game 1, but they were clearly hobbled against the Clippers on Friday so expect Durant to be tasked with much of the heavy lifting. For at least the immediate future, Golden State will be his team. Despite winning two consecutive Finals MVP trophies, Durant has been something of an adjunct superstar during his tenure with the Warriors. He’s been the plus-one to their party, and this has helped fuel rumors of his imminent departure during free agency this summer. Some league insiders are treating this as a foregone conclusion , meaning all that’s left to determine is whether or not Durant leaves as a champion. That, like everything else related to the Warriors at the moment, is completely up to him."
Oliver North is out as president of NRA amid bitter leadership battle.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/oliver-north-ousted-president-nra-wayne-lapierre.html,"William Barr Is Cowering at the Prospect of a Proper Cross-Examination The bitter leadership battle that has engulfed the National Rifle Association and recently burst into public view has come out with a clear winner. Oliver North surprised attendees at the group’s annual convention by announcing that he would not serve a second term as president of the organization, as is tradition. Although he doesn’t outright say it, the letter North had someone read on his behalf at the convention makes clear that he was forced out following his efforts to get longtime CEO Wayne LaPierre out of the organization.In the statement, North says he was “informed” that he would no be nominated for reelection after his term ends Monday. “I’ve been on the NRA board for more than two decades,” North said. “It was a great privilege to serve as your president this past year, an honor second to only serving our country as a U.S.Marine in combat.” North went on to say that shortly after he took office in September he was faced with a spate of complaints about how much money the NRA was paying a contractor. North also called for a committee to be set up to review the NRA’s finances. The shocking turn of events at the organization that is embroiled in an intense leadership battle comes a day after it was revealed that LaPierre wrote a letter to the board accusing North of extortion. In the letter, LaPierre said North, the former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who is best known for the role he played in the Iran-contra affair, had threatened to release “damaging” information about him to the board. “Delivered by a member of our Board on behalf of his employer, the exhortation was simple: resign or there will be destructive allegations made against me and the NRA,” LaPierre wrote in the letter that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The leadership dispute also comes at a time when the New York attorney general, Letitia James, has opened an investigation into the group’s tax-exempt status, reports the New York Times . That looming investigation is in part what sparked the confrontation. “The current situation,” North wrote in his statement, means that the organization’s “non-profit status is threatened.” James’ actions were hardly a surprise. Before he relection last year, she had vowed to investigate the NRA’s tax-exempt status, saying in an interview that while the group claimed to be “a charitable organization” it was actually “a terrorist organization.” Support our journalism

Conan O’Brien hired a dog to wear a beard. Big mistake.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/conan-obrien-dog-wearing-fake-beard-off-script.html,"“We discussed this, and I said no.” TBS Silent film comedian Monty Banks once claimed that his career took off because he didn’t understand English. Hired to play minor roles and do odd jobs at Keystone, the Italian immigrant came to Mack Sennett’s attention when filmmakers started complaining that he wouldn’t take direction; upon looking into the matter, Sennett discovered that Banks was failing to do what he was told, but not out of arrogance. Since he had very little idea what his directors were saying, he took his best guess and improvised, with results that Sennett reportedly found funnier than following instructions would have been. A long career in comedy—cut short when sound film made Banks’ accent an insurmountable obstacle—was born. All of which is to say that the heroic dog in this Conan sketch needs a Mack Sennett to champion his bold and daring comedic vision, because this is a star turn: As originally written, this would have been a mildly amusing sketch about the all-too-often overlooked issue of beard sanitation, with some sort of meta-twist once the dog with a beard arrived. As performed, however, it is a brilliant and hilarious sketch about a dog who refuses to wear a fake beard, then yells at Conan O’Brien for trying to make a dog wear a fake beard in the first place. It’s rare to see a true breakout performance in a late-night sketch, and rarer still to see that performance come from a performer refusing to follow the script—there’s Andy Kaufman on Fridays and not much else—but this is the genuine article. But even when a good boy goes rogue, television is a collaborative medium, and everyone else on Conan deserves credit for immediately switching gears and helping to execute the dog’s vision. Andy Richter and Conan O’Brien both take their cues from the dog’s energy, swallowing their pride and correctly recognizing that they were now in a new, funnier sketch than the one they’d originally planned. And the off-the-cuff decision— probably made by Conan director Billie Bollotino —to shoot a slow push in on the bearded dog’s disapproving stare is the stuff television legends are made of. But it’s the basset hound who deserves the most credit for picking up the bearded dog’s vibe and running with it, and not just because basset hounds are not very good at running with anything . In his initial appearance, before the sketch goes off-leash, the basset hound does more or less what he’s supposed to, looking confused but not unhappy about replacing a bearded man in Conan’s studio audience. After the beard incident, however, he gives Conan an even more withering stare than the bearded dog, complete with an intimidating streamer of drool. This final twist turns what could have been a botched sketch into an unsparing critique of the uneasy bond between man and dog, particularly with regards to men who make dogs wear fake beards on late night television. It’s the greatest achievement in beard-related sketch comedy since “ The Bearded Men of Space Station 11 ,” and we owe it all to the unerring comedic instincts of one very good dog.

Marvel A lot of people all over the world decided to watch Avengers: Endgame on Friday, and they paid a lot of money for the privilege, Variety reports . In fact, in many countries, they paid more money than any person or group of people has ever paid to watch a single movie in a single day. Tony Stark and company earned $156.7 million dollars domestically on Friday, which shatters the previous record for a Friday opening of $119 million, held by Star Wars: The Force Awakens . Avengers: Endgame also broke the record for Thursday previews, taking in $60 million to The Force Awakens ’ $57 million. Internationally, the movie was also no slouch: In China, it earned $107.2 million on its Wednesday debut, the country’s largest single-day box office haul. It also broke the single-day box office records in Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Egypt, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad, the U.K., and Uruguay. What’s more, it set top opening day records in Indonesia, Malaysia, Netherlands, Greece, Portugal, Slovakia, Turkey, and the Ukraine. That’s 28 of the 193 member states in the United Nations, or just under 15%, the greatest international consensus anyone has achieved since we agreed we weren’t going to do anything about climate change . Domestic weekend estimates for the film range from $310 million to $345 million, which will easily break Avengers: Infinity War ’s current record of $257.7 million. It had already broken the international record by Friday, pulling in about $487 million so far. The Fate of the Furious only managed a paltry $443 million. Finally, Avengers: Endgame is playing on more North American theater screens than any film in history, with 4,662 separate screens showing Avengers: Endgame . Those are impressive numbers, but consider this: The maximum potential domestic box office—all 327.2 million people in the United States and another 37.06 million Canadians paying an average price of $9.11 to see the same movie on the same weekend—is just over $3 billion, even if no superfans see the movie twice. That means that for all the shattered records, the latest chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will only make it 11.5 percent of the way to complete cultural hegemony.

White House Correspondents' Dinner: Watch Ron Chernow pine for a more civilized age.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/white-house-correspondents-dinner-ron-chernow-whcd.html,"Ron Chernow speaking at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. CSPAN After last year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner, in which Michelle Wolf drew fire for correctly noting that press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied to the press , the White House Correspondents’ Association decided to hire a historian instead of a comedian. Ron Chernow, author of Alexander Hamilton , got tapped primarily to provide less controversy, as he acknowledged:
I confess that I was surprised when I got the invitation to speak here tonight. I mean, I knew they weren’t approaching me as an international sex symbol, right? Then Olivier told me that they wanted to try “boring” at this year’s dinner, and I said, “Oh, I can deliver on that big time . Now you’re talking my language.” For the most part, Chernow succeeded. Here’s his full speech: Since Stephen Colbert’s legendary 2006 WHCD appearance in 2006, the WHCD has occasionally been a venue where people spoke frankly about the government—and world—we’ve built. Chernow’s speech, although it included a few quips about Donald Trump’s intelligence, seemed like it was written on another planet, someplace where authoritarianism could be effectively fought with civility:
Even though it may seem wistful and naïve and a touch quixotic, I would like to keep alive tonight the fading memory of more civilized dealings between chief executives and the news media. Call it a museum of presidential decorum. At this confrontational moment in American politics, we must recall that civility has been an essential lubricant in our democratic culture and that our best presidents have handled the press with wit, grace, charm, candor, and even humor. Chernow is exactly right: That does seem wistful and naïve and a touch quixotic. It doesn’t matter how plush the velvet glove on the iron fist is, and there is no amount of wit, grace, charm, or humor that would make the resurgence of authoritarianism and white supremacy in the United States any better for anyone. Still, candor does matter, and it is true that Donald Trump is a different sort of president. Chernow made this point by tracing the history of presidential relationships with the press, sharing stories about both Roosevelts, Kennedy, and, of all people, Ronald Reagan:
Now, Ronald Reagan was a no less sunny personality and a past master, of course, of media relations. When he became president, he said, “I think that most of the time, the overwhelming majority of reporters do a fine job, and as a former reporter, I know just how tough their job can be.” Nevertheless, Reagan had a sometimes bumpy relationship with the press. Then on March 30, 1981, he was shot and nearly killed outside this very hotel, the Washington Hilton, as he was about to duck into his limousine. A bullet lodged within an inch of his heart. Reagan was scheduled to speak at, yes, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. And so he telephoned in this line instead. “If I could give you just one little bit of advice: When somebody tells you to get into a car quick, do it.” That was a touch of class that has been sorely missing in our political culture in recent years. It was a subtle reminder that whether Republicans or Democrats, we are all bona fide members of Team U.S.A., and not members of enemy camps. With all due respect to Chernow, what the government of the United States is missing today is not “a touch of class,” or a phone call from the president to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, and Ronald Reagan’s lawless , inhuman presidency should be a model to no one. It’s pointless to decide who is a bona fide member of “Team U.S.A.” when the planet is boiling and white supremacists are shooting up synagogues , but pretending that the politicians responsible are not “members of enemy camps” to all humanity is voting for table manners over the survival of the species. But Chernow did point to journalists who spoke frankly about how power and money work, including Ida B. Wells , Jacob Riis , Lincoln Steffens , Ida Tarbell , and Upton Sinclair , all of whom are well worth reading and contrasting with Chernow’s palpable wish for a more civilized era. There’s nothing civil about any of this. There never has been. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

After Denver took a 90-86 lead on a Jamal Murray teardrop, the Nuggets’ Torrey Craig blocked the Spurs’ DeMar DeRozan at the rim at the other end. Denver center Nikola Jokic grabbed the rebound with a little more than 27 seconds remaining and Denver … just dribbled out most of the shot clock? THE NUGGETS GET THE BUCKET AND BLOCK TO SECURE THE SERIES! 😱 #MileHighBasketball pic.twitter.com/7PK3QC20vU — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) April 28, 2019 San Antonio is always one of the best-coached teams in the NBA with Gregg Popovich at the helm, yet the Spurs failed to foul and extend the game—something any grade-school squad ( and most college teams ) would know to do. Popovich was on the floor yelling at his players , but his instructions were lost in the din of the Pepsi Center. When asked about it after the game, Popovich said, “ Obviously he didn’t hear it cause he didn’t foul .” The “he” Popovich is referring to here is Spurs veteran LaMarcus Aldridge, who was the on-ball defender during that last possession. Though, after 13 years in the league, Aldridge should probably know what to do when his team is down 4 with the clock running down, even without someone yelling “foul!” in his ear. Aldridge was not alone in his aloofness. San Antonio’s failure to foul during the last sequence didn’t get a single mention from the TNT commentating crew. Denver got one last shot up at the buzzer but, with only a few seconds left, San Antonio couldn’t do anything with the rebound. It was a fitting end for a sloppy game, one in which the Spurs shot 22 percent in the first quarter and the Nuggets nearly threw away a 17-point third-quarter lead. If both teams are doing their best to lose, then it’s only fair to sound the buzzer and let everybody go home."

The president criticized the media, praised the economy, and mocked Democrats. At one point, he turned to what has emerged as a favorite talking point for the president as he gears up for the 2020 presidential campaign: “extreme late-term abortion.” Trump claimed Saturday that Democrats are in favor of “allowing children to be ripped from their mother’s womb right up until the moment of birth.” Trump went on to falsely characterize what he said an “extreme late abortion” would entail in horrifically graphic—and not to mention misleading—language. “Your Democrat governor here in Wisconsin, shockingly, stated that he will veto legislation that protects Wisconsin babies born alive. Born alive,” Trump said in a disapproving tone. “The baby is born, the mother meets with the doctor, they take care of the baby, they wrap the baby beautifully, and then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.” Trump then put on an incredulous tone. “You hear late term, but this is where the baby is born, it’s there, it’s wrapped, that’s it,” Trump said as he made a guillotine motion with his hand, as if he were implying that the baby’s head would be sliced off. Trump falsely claims Democrats support murdering babies.""The baby is born, the mother meets w/the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. Then the doctor and mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.""The crowd respond w/angry boos pic.twitter.com/DgVgw5IZ0f — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 28, 2019 Trump has previously accused Democrats of supporting the killing of babies, often falsely twisting comments by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to make it seem like Northam supports infanticide. “The governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world,” Trump said at a rally in El Paso, Texas, in February , “and wrap the baby, and make the baby comfortable, and then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby. Execute the baby!” He even made a similarly misleading—yet much less graphic—claim during his State of the Union address. “Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world,” he said. The claims, of course, are false . Holy shit -- Trump falsely accuses Ralph Northam of saying he supports ""a newborn baby [coming] out into the world, and wrap the baby, make the baby comfortable, & then talk to the mother & talk to the father and then execute the baby.

Trump also claimed that he rejected a request to pardon one of Napolitano’s friends. In a pair of tweets after his campaign rally in Wisconsin, Trump said that Napoitano had become “very hostile” toward his administration after he rejected his requests. “Ever since Andrew came to my office to ask that I appoint him to the U.S. Supreme Court, and I said NO, he has been very hostile!

But Napolitano has recently spoken up quite a bit against Trump, particularly after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s redacted report. “I am disappointed in the behavior of the president,” Napolitano said earlier this week . “If he had ordered his aides to violate federal law to save a human life or to preserve human freedom, he would at least have a moral defense to his behavior,” he added. “But ordering them to break federal law to save him from the consequences of his own behavior, that is immoral, that is criminal, that is defenseless, that is condemnable.” He also published a scathing op-ed earlier this week that said Mueller “laid out at least a half-dozen crimes of obstruction committed by Trump.” Before this recent turn, Trump and Napolitano seemed quite fond of each other. Trump even quoted Napolitano in his tweets several times during his presidency and referred to him as a “ very talented legal mind ” during a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

"After birth, baby is “wrapped in a blanket” and mother, doctor “decide whether to execute the baby.”",slate.com,admin,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-abortion-baby-wrapped-blanket-execute-baby.html/,"Texas Retracts Claim of Mass Voter Fraud Touted by Trump, Agrees to Halt Planned Purge President Donald Trump skipped the White House Correspondents’ dinner Saturday night and instead held a raucous rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he hit several familiar themes. The president criticized the media, praised the economy, and mocked Democrats. At one point, he turned to what has emerged as a favorite talking point for the president as he gears up for the 2020 presidential campaign: “Extreme late abortion.” Trump claimed Saturday that Democrats are in favor of “allowing children to be ripped from their mother’s womb right up until the moment of birth.” Trump went on to falsely characterize what he said an “extreme late abortion” would entail in horrifically graphic—and not to mention misleading—language. “Your Democrat governor here in Wisconsin, shockingly, stated that he will veto legislation that protects Wisconsin babies born alive. Born alive,” Trump said in a disapproving tone. “The baby is born, the mother meets with the doctor, they take care of the baby, they wrap the baby beautifully, and then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.” Trump then put on an incredulous tone. “You hear late term, but this is where the baby is born, it’s there, it’s wrapped, that’s it,” Trump said as he made a guillotine motion with his hand, as if he were implying that the baby’s head would be sliced off. Trump falsely claims Democrats support murdering babies.
“The baby is born, the mother meets w/the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. Then the doctor and mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”

— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 28, 2019 Trump has previously accused Democrats of supporting the killing of babies, often falsely twisting comments that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam made to make it seem like he supports infanticide. “The governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world,” Trump said at a rally in El Paso, Texas in February , “and wrap the baby, and make the baby comfortable, and then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby. Execute the baby!” He even made a similarly misleading—yet much less graphic—claim during his State of the Union address. “Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful, babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world,” he said. The claims, of course, are false. Holy shit — Trump falsely accuses Ralph Northam of saying he supports “a newborn baby [coming] out into the world, and wrap the baby, make the baby comfortable, & then talk to the mother & talk to the father and then execute the baby. Execute the baby!”

"Judge Damon Keith, civil rights icon, dies at 96.",slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/judge-damon-keith-civil-rights-icon-dies.html,"A Police Shooting at Yale Shows How Campus Police Have Fostered a Climate of Fear The United States lost a civil rights icon on Sunday when Judge Damon Keith died at the age of 96. A judicial giant who served on the bench for more than 50 years, Keith adamantly refused to tolerate injustice in any form. His landmark opinions defending the constitutional liberties of unpopular groups provoked ire and, at times, death threats against the judge. But Keith never yielded, facing down opponents as powerful as the president of the United States and as violent as the Ku Klux Klan. He maintained his resolute belief in equality to the very end of his extraordinary career. Keith was born in Detroit on July 4, 1922, a patriotic coincidence he always relished. He served in a segregated Army unit during World War II, an experience that drove home the evils of American racism. “I served my country,” Keith later said , “but when I returned, I still had to ride on the back of the bus, drink from separate water fountains and use separate bathrooms. I thought, is this what I’ve been fighting for? Have I been laying down my life to come back to this world of Jim Crows and racists?” After attending Howard University School of Law, Keith worked closely with the NAACP and eventually served on the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson appointed him to federal district court in Detroit; 10 years later, President Jimmy Carter elevated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6 th Circuit. As soon as Keith joined the bench, he faced a series of hugely controversial disputes over civil rights. In 1970, he ordered the desegregation of public schools in Pontiac, Michigan, prompting serious threats against his life. A year later, the KKK firebombed 10 Pontiac school buses. (Keith never considered backing down, explaining : “I don’t scare easily.”) In 1971, he ruled that the city of Hamtramck’s “urban renewal program”—which mostly entailed demolishing black people’s homes—constituted unlawful housing discrimination and ordered the homes rebuilt. That same year, Keith halted the Nixon administration’s warrantless wiretapping program. President Richard Nixon sued Keith in an effort to maintain the practice, but the Supreme Court unanimously sided with Keith, holding that Nixon had violated the Fourth Amendment. These decisions alone would’ve been enough to cement the judge’s legacy . But on the 6 th Circuit, he continued to field contentious disputes over civil rights. In 2002, he wrote the decision for the court in Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft , a challenge to the Bush administration’s efforts to close off post-9/11 deportation hearings to the public and press. Keith ruled that the First Amendment barred the government from holding secret deportation hearings. It was in this opinion that Keith coined his famous phrase “democracies die behind closed doors.” The passage in which that aphorism appears is worth quoting in full. Explaining that a free press is a vital safeguard of immigrants’ rights, Keith wrote:
Today, the Executive Branch seeks to take this safeguard away from the public by placing its actions beyond public scrutiny. Against non-citizens, it seeks the power to secretly deport [immigrants] … The Executive Branch seeks to uproot people’s lives, outside the public eye, and behind a closed door. Democracies die behind closed doors. The First Amendment, through a free press, protects the people’s right to know that their government acts fairly, lawfully, and accurately in deportation proceedings. When government begins closing doors, it selectively controls information rightfully belonging to the people. Selective information is misinformation. The Framers of the First Amendment … protected the people against secret government. The Bush administration declined to appeal Keith’s decision to the Supreme Court. Even in his mid-90s, Keith never wavered from his staunch defense of the Constitution. In October 2016, at age 94, he wrote an impassioned and historic dissent from a 6 th Circuit decision allowing Ohio to curtail black voters’ access to the ballot. Keith, in protest, included a gallery of “martyr of the struggle for equality” in his opinion. He explained:
The utter brutality of white supremacy in its efforts to disenfranchise persons of color is the foundation for the tragedy that is the majority’s effort to roll back the progress of history. I will not forget. I cannot forget—indeed America cannot forget—the pain, suffering, and sorrow of those who died for equal protection and for this precious right to vote. I add the following publicly available historical statements to humanize the struggle for the right to be equal participants in the democratic process. Later, Keith told me he “wanted to dramatize the racist attitude of the majority.” He made no effort to conceal his disdain for the conservative judges who turned a blind eye to Ohio’s racist assault on the franchise. Today, judges like Keith are in short supply. In just two years, President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have stacked the judiciary with judges who are overwhelmingly straight, white, and male . These individuals were chosen because of their past work defending the powerful and harming the powerless. Many spent their careers helping to abridge minority voting rights and now refuse to say if Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided. Some promoted racist conspiracy theories and defended states’ rights to disenfranchise black voters. These judges are anathema to Keith’s enduring vision of constitutional equality. His death is a great loss for the country—and a reminder of what judicial courage looks like at a time when it is in increasingly short supply. Support our journalism

Al Horford ruined Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Sunday.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/al-horford-giannis-antetokounmpo-boston-celtics-milwaukee-bucks.html,"Clippers’ Advice on Guarding Kevin Durant: Uh … Hmm … Well How does one stop Giannis Antetokounmpo? The Milwaukee Bucks’ superstar has the wingspan of a California condor and can get from half court to the hoop with a single dribble . Defending him must be like putting a lightning bolt in a headlock, which why I’m happy I will never have to try. The Boston Celtics don’t have that luxury, but if Game 1 of their second-round playoff series against the Bucks is any indication, they have a pretty sound plan for how to approach him. Boston won 112-90 on Sunday, and they limited Antetokounmpo to just to 22 points on 33 percent shooting. It was a great all-around performance from the Celtics, and their defense on Milwaukee’s MVP candidate is what stood out the most. Boston sent waves of players at Antetokounmpo, but center Al Horford was tasked with the brunt of this work. Horford is an experienced defender, and he stayed between Antetokounmpo and the rim all game. In one second-quarter sequence, Hoford stuffed Antetokounmpo twice, and he spiked the second attempt like he was playing tetherball against a summer camp nemesis. Al Horford met Giannis at the rim TWICE 😤 pic.twitter.com/uuR8X9BvTI — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) April 28, 2019 Blocking Giannis is like high-fiving Godzilla. Even if you time it right, you still need to be big and strong enough to withstand the impact. Horford clearly is, and he managed to do what few players have done all season. Giannis was blocked in the restricted area only 71 times all season. Already three times today—once by Tatum, twice by Horford. — Kevin O'Connor (@KevinOConnorNBA) April 28, 2019 It’s easy to overreact to one game, especially when a team plays as well as Boston did on Sunday. But if Horford and the Celtics can keep the Bucks’ lightning bolt in a full nelson, then Milwaukee’s once-promising season will be in significant peril."
Attorney General Barr threatens to cancel House testimony on Mueller report amid format dispute.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/attorney-general-william-barr-threatens-cancel-house-testimony-muelle.html,"Trump: Fox’s Napolitano Asked for Supreme Court Seat, Pardon for His Friend Attorney General William Barr has threatened he may not show up to his scheduled testimony before the House Judiciary Committee about special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Thursday as his office has made it clear to Democrats that he is none too happy with the format of the hearing. CNN was first to report the story, which was later confirmed by several others, citing an unnamed committee source that said Barr wouldn’t go to the hearing unless there was a change in the proposed format. Failing to attend the hearing would mark a huge escalation in tensions between the Trump administration and Democrats , who have requested to see the full, unredacted Mueller report. There are two basic sticking points. First, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler has proposed that after lawmakers complete their allotted time for questioning there would be an additional 30-minute round for each side of the aisle in which Democratic and Republican counsels could question Barr . “The attorney general agreed to appear before Congress. Therefore, members of Congress should be the ones doing the questioning,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “He remains happy to engage with members on their questions regarding the Mueller report.” Barr is also reportedly opposed to the idea of moving to a closed session if lawmakers want to discuss parts of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that were redacted. Nadler was defiant Sunday morning, telling CNN that Barr would not “dictate the format of the Judiciary Committee.” Nadler added that “the witness is not going to tell the committee how to conduct its hearing, period.” Asked what could be the next step if Barr doesn’t agree to testify, Nadler didn’t mince words. “Then we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena,” he said. Barr is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and the House committee on Thursday. Seeing as though the hearing is still a few days away, the two sides could still come up with some sort of compromise that would allow it to move forward as scheduled. Support our journalism

It all began when Conway appeared on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday morning , and in the midst of a bit of sparring with host Jake Tapper over white supremacy, the White House counselor brought up the freshman lawmaker. In the middle of their discussion, Conway threw a seemingly offhand comment about how Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted “many times” about the shootings at two mosques in New Zealand that killed 50 people last month but “never once” about the church bombings in Sri Lanka that killed more than 250 people.

This alone would not have been too controversial, but a Warriors player sliding under a Rockets jump-shooter had been a theme for much of the first half. The officials didn’t call fouls then, either. The NBA rulebook states that “ [d]efenders may not move into the landing area of an airborne shooter. ” Golden State guard Klay Thompson did this with enough frequency during the first half that ABC play-by-play announcer Mike Breen said that he was fortunate to not have four fouls called against him (Thompson had one foul at the time).

In the 2017 postseason, Pachulia injured then–Spurs star Kawhi Leonard when he slid his feet under Leonard during a 3-point attempt . The ensuing ankle sprain knocked Leonard out of the playoffs, and the league updated the rulebook in the offseason to address the issue. Dubbed “the Zaza rule,” it lets officials call a flagrant or technical foul if they deem a player’s close-out to be intentional or unnaturally reckless. “ It’s 100 percent for the safety of the players ,” Joe Borgia, NBA senior vice president of replay and referee operations, said at the time. No one was injured during any close-outs on Sunday, but Houston’s hopes of winning the series were certainly dinged.

HBO There are two versions of Last Week Tonight . First, there’s the Last Week Tonight that exists online, where the conversation is driven by the segments released on YouTube. These are almost always the show’s trademark longform muckraking pieces on a single issue of public concern, from corporate tax rates to the NRA’s television network . Then there’s the much stranger version of Last Week Tonight that airs on HBO, where the longform segments are preceded by shorter, weirder bits, like the legendary montages of C-SPAN anchor Steve Scully being patient with people who call into his show. Last week, Oliver’s main story was about the Mueller Report, an informative and funny 15-minute rundown of the latest developments in what Oliver calls “Stupid Watergate.” But there’s no Last Week Tonight this week, presumably because HBO needs the time to kill off as many Game of Thrones characters as possible, so the network posted a segment from last week’s episode on YouTube instead.

All types of face coverings that could hide someone’s identity are now banned in the country under an emergency law. The measure was imposed a week after more than 250 people were killed in a series of bombings that targeted churches and hotels. “President Maithripala Sirisena took this decision to further support the ongoing security and help the armed forces to easily identify the identity of any wanted perpetrators,” read a news release from the president’s office. Catholics in Sri Lanka, meanwhile, were not able to attend Sunday Mass as churches remained shut amid fears of further attacks. Many Catholics stayed home and watched a televised service given by the Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Ranjith from his home. In a sign of unity, President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and former president and opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa attended the service in person. “This is a time our hearts are tested by the great destruction that took place last Sunday,” Ranjith said during his televised Mass. “This is a time questions such as, does God truly love us, does he have compassion toward us, can arise in human hearts.” The concern of further attacks comes amid warnings from both local officials and the U.S. Embassy that more attacks could be imminent. In an illustration of how serious the threat could be, authorities say they found a sophisticated bomb-making operation at a site where three militants blew themselves up after law enforcement officials found them. Police also raided the headquarters of the hardline Islamist group National Thawheed Jammath (NTJ) that was founded by the man suspected of being the mastermind behind the Easter bombings. Authorities believe the founder of NTJ, Zahran Hashim, was one of the nine suicide bombers. Support our journalism

Game of Thrones: The cinematography in the Battle of Winterfell was too dark for many viewers to see.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-long-night-dark-cinematography-twitter-complaints.html,"SPOILERS FOLLOW! BEWARE! TAKE CARE! This week’s Game of Thrones was ostensibly about the Battle of Winterfell, the final confrontation between the armies of the evil Night King and the forces of humanity. But for many viewers, the episode was much more than an epic battle: It was also a whirlwind tour of the limits of video compression algorithms and home video display technology. Which is to say that a lot of people couldn’t see anything . On Sunday night, Twitter was full of viewers complaining about the show’s cinematography, which has often been dark, but never quite so consistently stygian. Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times summed up the general impression the episode made on many: just an incredible episode so far pic.twitter.com/43JpqyvWbj — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) April 29, 2019 In reality, Fabian Wagner’s cinematography on the episode, aptly named “The Long Night,” wasn’t quite as dark as Itzkoff’s screenshot, but it wasn’t exactly bright either. Here’s a random still captured from the HBO Now version on a laptop, then cropped to Slate’s preferred aspect ratio and slightly enlarged. It is murky : HBO I specified where and how I got that image and what I did to it afterward because what’s going on here isn’t just the artistic decision to shoot Game of Thrones in very low light, or to stage the Battle of Winterfell as a horror movie in which the living dead abruptly loom out of the snowy darkness. Those were both good decisions, and it’s hard to think of a better recent use of darkness than the defeat of the Dothraki in this week’s episode. The problem is that the entire television infrastructure that distributes Game of Thrones , from the cameras in Ireland to the eyeball in your own personal head, does a uniquely bad job with dimly lit scenes. And “The Long Night” was practically nothing else. The trend toward darker television has been going on for a while, and not just on HBO. As several prestige-TV cinematographers explained to Slate back in 2016 , the switch to digital filming and post-production made it easier and faster to work in low light than it had been on film. Simultaneously, the switch from cathode-ray tubes to high definition televisions made that same low-light cinematography look worse than it ever had before, especially on lower-end models. Meanwhile, cable companies switched to digital distribution , applying their own video compression to the already-compressed signals they got from networks. Streaming services like HBO Now do the same thing in order to fit HDTV signals into as little internet bandwidth as possible. Every time lossy video compression is applied to the video, the image quality drops. And guess what kind of scenes current video compression techniques do the worst job with? It’s a perfect storm: Every recent advance in television technology seems to have been designed specifically to make “The Long Night” difficult to make out.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. There are ways for a home viewer to mitigate the damage, first and foremost by darkening the room. Watching over internet streaming is better in many cases too, because it means cutting your cable company out of the loop, and the compressed versions of HBO Now episodes, which can be encoded in advance, might undergo a little more quality control than the versions cable companies create on the fly from HBO’s live feed. And calibrating your television, even if that just means using the signal patterns on a THX DVD or Blu-Ray to set the brightness and contrast, will do a lot to help. (As a bonus, paying attention to any or all of those things will make everything you watch look better, not just Game of Thrones .) But there’s just no way to feed images like the ones in “The Long Night” into the current television distribution system and have them look good in everyone’s living room. So can anything be done? Well, there’s a tradition in the music industry of taking the final mix of a recording and testing it out on a car stereo, to see what the beautiful music playing out of the expensive monitor speakers in the studio sounds like when it’s filtered through crappy car speakers, competing with engine noise. The reason audio engineers do this is not because they love the way music sounds in a 1989 Honda Civic. It’s because they have no control over the listening environment where their work will eventually be heard, and they want to make sure it’s tolerable even under the worst of circumstances. There’s a trade-off, of course: a car radio–friendly mix might sound a little worse than the original version when it’s played on a high-end stereo in a soundproof room. It’s lowering the ceiling to raise the floor, and normally I’m not very sympathetic to that kind of approach. But we’re on Game of Thrones ’ eighth season: If the general public were going to calibrate their televisions or darken their rooms in order to appreciate thecinematography, they would have done it by now. So if TV directors aren’t already making a point of running their work through the worst compression algorithm any cable company uses, then watching it on a cheap LED screen in a room with plenty of natural light, it’s probably time to start. If they need an unsuitable-for- Game-of-Thrones living room to use as a model for their test environment, Game of Thrones Twitter is full of potential volunteers."

Ian McEwan’s Machines Like Me and science fiction.,slate.com,Laura Miller,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/ian-mcewan-science-fiction-machines-like-me.html,"A Military Strategist Defends the Living Army’s Tactics in the Battle of Winterfell Every so often, a literary novelist offends the community of science fiction writers and fans. They can be touchy, given that their genre is often misrepresented by outsiders. For example, despite having, by her own account, written, read, and enjoyed many science fiction novels, Margaret Atwood once described the genre as “ talking squids in outer space ,” a statement that has reliably fueled outrage for a decade and counting. (Although, with admirable humor, the science fiction novelist Vonda McIntyre created a web site, Talking Squids in Outer Space , dedicated to enshrining examples of the genre using just that motif.) The latest and most egregious example is Ian McEwan. In an interview with the Guardian , the author of Atonement asserted that his new novel, Machines Like Me , takes the motif of artificial intelligence into new territory by addressing it “not in terms of travelling at 10 times the speed of light in anti-gravity boots, but in actually looking at the human dilemmas of being close up to something that you know to be artificial but which thinks like you.” As many commentators have pointed out , this absurd statement exhibits ignorance of a huge swath of well-known science fiction, from the writings of Philip K. Dick to films and TV series like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Westworld , all of which do precisely what McEwan claims is groundbreaking about his own novel. If McEwan had read some of the genre’s best treatments of this theme, Machines Like Me might have been a better book. The novel is set in an alternate version of the 1980s, one far more advanced technologically than the one we’re familiar with. The narrator, Charlie Friend, is a day trader with a shabby London flat and a rattletrap car, but when he gets a small inheritance from his late mother, he blows 84,000 pounds on a robot, a newly released model nearly indistinguishable in appearance from a young man. At the same time, he falls in love with his upstairs neighbor, Miranda. Over time, a romantic triangle between man, woman, and android develops. McEwan has often been celebrated for his interest in science, but the alternate history he has created for this fiction is even more rickety than Charlie’s car. Charlie’s world surpasses our own, posits McEwan, with such impressive advances as “brain-machine interfacing” and organic-seeming androids, because Alan Turing, instead of committing suicide at 41, has survived into old age. Brilliant as Turing was, this vein of Great Man sentimentalism is silly. For example, if McEwan thought about it a bit, he’d have realized that creating a product like Adam, Charlie’s robot, would require advances in many more fields than artificial intelligence. It would take chemical, engineering, and industrial genius to create a material that looked, felt, and functioned like living human skin.

Any writer asking his readers to enter into an imaginary world different from the one around us faces a challenge: how to ease the reader into this altered reality without resorting to long passages of exposition. Over the decades, science fiction writers have developed a sophisticated range of narrative tools to help them do this. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle —set in a counterfactual history in which the Axis powers won World War II and are occupying the former United States—opens his novel with a scene in which a shopkeeper selling Americana caters fawningly to a stylish Japanese couple. Everything about the interaction, including how the shopkeeper tries to suss out the rank and influence of his new customers, conveys what the reader needs to know about the world Dick’s characters inhabit. Part of the pleasure of reading novels like this comes from surmising the rest. Real people don’t spend a lot of time musing on the broader historical context of their everyday lives. But in Machines Like Me , they do, and the novel is larded with long, tedious passages of potted history:
Nothing proved more vividly the maxim that technology renders civilisation fragile than the great traffic paralyses of the late seventies. By then, autonomous vehicles comprised seventeen per cent of the total. Who can forget that roasting rush-hour evening of the Manhattan Logjam? Due to an exceptional solar pulse, many on-board radars failed at once. McEwan might have decided that he didn’t want to bother with concocting a rationalized, convincing world in which to set Machines Like Me. Science fiction writers do that, too! For example, time travel is the only unrealistic touch in Octavia Butler’s Kindred , and in his first novel, Gun, With Occasional Music , Jonathan Lethem makes no effort to explain the technology behind procedures that allow animals to become as intelligent as people or couples to trade erogenous zones. The “science” in this type of science fiction either serves as a handy device (transporting a girl from the 1970s to an antebellum slave plantation) or as a metaphor for the disjunctions and perplexities of contemporary life. McEwan seems to be after the latter effect—he’s not really interested in how a machine like Adam could be engineered—but he also seems to have fallen in love with the half-baked historical scenario he’s come up with as a backdrop for his robot love story. (In addition to Turing’s survival, this alternate 1980s has got a Beatles reunion and Britain losing the Falkland Islands War.) The result works neither as a parable of free will and selfhood nor as an experiment in imagining the quandaries waiting in our future. If only McEwan could strap on those antigravity boots and travel at 10 times the speed light back into the past. Then he could start this lazy, flimsy novel over, only this time with the humility to learn from those who have boldly gone before. "

Spanish elections: Far-right Vox party does worse than expected but still crosses historic threshold.,slate.com,Brietta Hague,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/spanish-election-vox-party-far-right-congress.html,"Bibi Wins Reelection—and With Trump in the White House, There’s Nothing Stopping Israel’s Drift to the Right BARCELONA, Spain —Chants of “viva España” echoed through the drab hotel conference room on Sunday night as Vox party supporters waited to see if they would be a new force in Spanish politics. A white-haired woman waving a Spanish flag danced awkwardly in front of a large television screen in a bid to brighten the mood. But early news from the TV pundits was making the crowd nervous. A record 75.8 percent of Spaniards had turned out to vote. And Vox officials knew it was probably because so many people were afraid of their party. “Vox is a party that generates a lot of sympathy and a lot of antipathy,” Juan Carlos Segura, a Vox candidate for regional office in Catalonia, told me. “A lot of people are scared because they think we’re an extreme-right party. But in reality, we are not.” The world first noticed Vox in December when it unexpectedly won 12 seats in regional elections in Andalusia. Before then it had been a little-known fringe party promoting a hard-line nationalist, anti-immigration, and anti-feminist agenda. But growing public concern over Muslim migration and disquiet over Catalonia’s independence push bolstered its support. While the party rejects the far-right label, its campaign has run on the promise of repealing domestic violence legislation, restricting abortion, and embarking on a new reconquista , or reconquest. Spain had not had a far-right party in its national parliament since democracy was restored in 1981. Many had long believed that the long period of right-wing dictatorship under Gen. Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, had made Spain immune to the nativist, nationalistic movements now on the rise across the rest of Europe. Suddenly, it seemed to critics, the barbarians were at the gate. “I’m terrified,” one Catalan acquaintance told me before the election, saying his parents planned to send his gay brother abroad if Vox came to power. “These fascists, who are anti-women, anti–gay rights, and anti-immigration, come from the days of Franco. They descend from prominent business and families of that era. They’ve been lying dormant.” While the party rejects the far-right label, its campaign has run on the promise of repealing domestic violence legislation, restricting abortion, and embarking on a new reconquista , or reconquest, a reference to the Christian knights who drove the Muslim Moors from Spain. The party has been taking advice from former Trump Svengali Steve Bannon on how to sell its agenda. Slick social media postings projected a populist message of making Spain great again. Even in the left-wing stronghold of Catalonia and its regional capital Barcelona, Vox was campaigning hard to win over Catalans concerned about the dangers of separatism and to energize Spaniards who had been moving for generations to the relatively affluent northeast in search of jobs. Catalans were exhausted by the independence movement, according to Segura. “The [Catalan] nationalists have access to public money, which they use for independence propaganda. A party like Vox, with great aspirations not only to end separatism but to eliminate Catalan autonomy and restore the autonomy of Spain, has had the confidence and support of many people during the campaign,” he said. In cosmopolitan Barcelona, the party was putting forward its most presentable face, choosing Ignacio Garriga, black dentist and NYU graduate, as its highest-profile candidate. The son of African migrants, Garriga spent the campaign arguing for expelling tens of thousands of undocumented migrants. “Vox is not racist. Just look at me,” he told the El Mundo newspaper . “Look into my eyes and tell me if I can despise my mother or my grandmother who are black.” But the presence of two police vans and heavily armed officers outside Vox’s election night venue was a testament to the fact that Catalonia has at times felt like enemy territory for the Vox campaign. Every rally has been shadowed and harassed by hostile crowds of anarchists and independence activists. “We like dialogue, democracy, and we are tolerant,” Segura said. “But parties of the extreme left don’t accept this. When we rally, they throw rocks at us, they physically attack many of our people, including children, with iron bars. No one from Vox is aggressive to anyone.” At a rally in the neighbouring Catalan town of Terrassa on Thursday, mainly elderly Vox supporters had to run the gantlet of antifa demonstrators shouting, “Fascists!” “They are like Franco,” said Alba, a member of the local antifa collective. “They’re primarily running against independence and that’s their principal slogan, but behind that is a fascist agenda. We’ve been in a financial crisis for years and years, and people blame foreigners and immigration, and Vox is popular for this reason. They also blame social problems on feminist movements.” Vox had gone into election night hoping to win up to 37 of the 350 total seats in the Congress of Deputies and potentially enter a new right-wing coalition government. But as the night wore on, the mood in the gathering in Barcelona shifted from nervous to somber, even with a stirring ’80s rock version of the national anthem blaring over the speakers. It became clear that the ultranationalist wave was not going to be quite the tsunami they had hoped for. Ignacio Garriga won a seat, but all the party’s other Catalonia candidates fell short. Across Spain, the party won just 24 seats with 10 percent of the vote. Just as people were starting to leave, Garriga and his entourage entered the venue for the first time to announce he was happy with the result. “Today is a day to celebrate, friends. Spain has stood up today. Today is the starting point of the reconquest throughout the length and breadth of the nation,” he told the crowd. It’s not the triumph Vox had hoped for, but it’s still a momentous development for Spain. With seats inside Parliament, Vox will now be able to challenge conservative parties to embrace its ultranationalist agenda. The party’s success has come at the expense of Spain’s traditional right. Partido Popular, once the conservative party of power, suffered its worst-ever defeat, losing 71 seats. Like Vox, it won just a single seat in Catalonia. The biggest winner of the night was the center-left Partido Socialista Obrero Español, which had run a minority government before calling snap elections after Catalan independence parties withdrew support. The left-wing Unidas Podemos party, once a bitter rival to the Socialists, also did well, winning 42 seats. With no party winning a majority, the coming days will be dominated by horse-trading to form a coalition or workable minority government. All signs are that the left will dominate. The Socialists may even be able to take power without needing the support of Catalonia’s independence party. The right, for now, is in a smaller minority. But Ignacio Garriga promises it is just the beginning: “Spain has stood up and said that it wants 24 brave people to enter the Congress to say—until now—what no party has said.”"

Attorney General Barr Threatens to Cancel House Testimony on Mueller Report Amid Format Dispute,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/attorney-general-william-barr-threatens-cancel-house-testimony-mueller.html,"Ocasio-Cortez Accuses Kellyanne Conway of Trying to “Stoke Suspicion Around My Christianity” Attorney General William Barr has threatened he may not show up to his scheduled testimony before the House Judiciary Committee about special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Thursday as his office has made it clear to Democrats that he is none too happy with the format of the hearing. CNN was first to report the story, which was later confirmed by several others, citing an unnamed committee source that said Barr wouldn’t go to the hearing unless there was a change in the proposed format. Failing to attend the hearing would mark a huge escalation in tensions between the Trump administration and Democrats , who have requested to see the full, unredacted Mueller report. There are two basic sticking points. First, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler has proposed that after lawmakers complete their allotted time for questioning there would be an additional 30-minute round for each side of the aisle in which Democratic and Republican counsels could question Barr . “The attorney general agreed to appear before Congress. Therefore, members of Congress should be the ones doing the questioning,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “He remains happy to engage with members on their questions regarding the Mueller report.” Barr is also reportedly opposed to the idea of moving to a closed session if lawmakers want to discuss parts of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that were redacted. Nadler was defiant Sunday morning, telling CNN that Barr would not “dictate the format of the Judiciary Committee.” Nadler added that “the witness is not going to tell the committee how to conduct its hearing, period.” Asked what could be the next step if Barr doesn’t agree to testify, Nadler didn’t mince words. “Then we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena,” he said. Barr is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and the House committee on Thursday. Seeing as though the hearing is still a few days away, the two sides could still come up with some sort of compromise that would allow it to move forward as scheduled."
"Democratic 2020 primary unity pledges urged by activist group, George Takei.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/democratic-2020-primary-unity-pledges-indivisible-george-takei.html,"Rod Rosenstein, the Man Responsible for the Mueller Investigation, Resigns The latest hot trend in Democrat World is to ask primary candidates and their supporters to take a “unity pledge.” The grassroots activist group Indivisible launched its version last Thursday, which calls in general terms for a “constructive” primary in which “shared values” are highlighted and everyone immediately gets behind the eventual nominee rather than continuing to hold grudges for the next 1,000 years . On Friday and Saturday, #resistance celebs George Takei and Alyssa Milano, whose combined Twitter/Instagram followers total 9.94 million, took things a step further and asked their social-media hordes to agree not to speak “negatively” about anyone in the race at all: Will you join me in pledging not to speak negatively about any of our candidates? We don’t know who the nominee will be, but they need to be as strong as they can be going into the election against Trump. — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) April 26, 2019 #IPledge to not speak negatively about anyone running for President. Do you? https://t.co/d5VKX30Dyy — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 27, 2019 The motivation here is the idea that nasty primary campaigns can depress the enthusiasm of the losers’ supporters; Indivisible has addressed that problem directly by scheduling a “Weekend of Action” after the Democratic National Convention during which supporters of both winning and losing primary candidates will be able to join hands to knock on doors and make phone calls for the nominee. Another motivation is the idea that negative primary campaigning can pre-emptively destroy the winning candidate’s reputation among general-election swing voters, hence the Takei/Milano/My Mom model, in which if you can’t say something nice you shouldn’t say anything at all. The problem with unity enforcement, though, is that it tends to protect the status quo, because it means never criticizing the frontrunner, which gives party insiders and major donors—who are free to line up behind particular candidates before they even launch their “exploratory committees”—even more influence than they already have. Joe Biden, for example, has already gotten more endorsements from top party figures than any other candidate despite having only been in the race for only a week, and he leads in most polls in part by virtue of name recognition. But is the average Democratic voter really well served by a regime in which it’s considered improper to criticize Biden? Or, to be more specific, is the country better off if Democrats aren’t complaining that Biden held his first official campaign fundraiser at the home of the man who supervises lobbying operations for Comcast , a monopolistic mega-corporation that is reviled by its customers ? If it’s not cool to complain about that kind of thing, why even have a Democratic Party at all? It seems like Indivisible’s version of the pledge would allow me to make this point, for what it’s worth, so long as I did so while emphasizing shared values (let’s say by pointing out that 77 percent of Democrats favor the enactment of laws restricting the amount of influence that big donors have on the political process) and presenting constructive context (let’s say by pointing out that candidates like Elizabeth Warren and John Hickenlooper have already outlined proposals to prevent further monopolization of the American economy). Alyssa Milano’s unity pledge, however, would forbid me from speaking my truth. But as I have always said, I will not be silenced by Alyssa Milano. Joe Biden, do better! Support our journalism

A Police Shooting at Yale Shows How Campus Police Have Fostered a Climate of Fear,slate.com,TJ Grayson,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/stephanie-washington-yale-shooting-campus-police.html,"William Barr Is Cowering at the Prospect of a Proper Cross-Examination Sitting in the front seats of their car earlier this month, Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon could be seen in a cellphone video singing love songs to one another, laughing, smiling, and apparently savoring each other’s presence. Soon after, both of these young, black New Haven, Connecticut, residents would be under gunfire, and Washington would be shot in the face, sustaining injuries. Neither posed a threat, but that didn’t matter to the Yale and Hamden police who shot at them. On April 16, Yale police officer Terrance Pollock and Hamden police officer Devin Eaton opened fire on Washington and Witherspoon. While the bullets missed Witherspoon, some of the more than 15 shots hit Washington, who now appears to be in stable condition. The involvement of university police in this tragic event implicates the entire Yale community. As a Yale Law School student, I, along with the thousands of students who walk the streets of New Haven and enjoy the privileges that come with our institutional affiliation, am culpable for this act of police violence. As a Yale Law School student, my tuition helped fund this life-threatening incident. And as a black Yale Law School student, I know how easily that same violence could have been directed toward me . Yale’s current approach to policing has created a confusing and complicated accountability structure. Since the shooting shined a light on New Haven’s convoluted system of policing, students and activists have taken their demands for justice to the streets , following the lead of local organizers like Kerry Ellington from New Haven for Black Lives. The presence of multiple police forces—Yale Police (YPD), Hamden Police, and New Haven Police—has resulted in a complex and fear-inducing degree of surveillance. This concern is not unfounded. In recent years, there have been other prominent incidents of overpolicing in New Haven. Last year, a black student was accosted by several police officers after falling asleep in a common room of a dorm; four years ago, a Yale police officer pulled a gun on the son of New York Times columnist Charles Blow. Other black Yale students have expressed concern over what has been described as a climate of racial profiling. The anxiety and concern this atmosphere creates warrants interrogation, particularly as a rapidly increasing number of universities follow in Yale’s footsteps and begin the controversial process of expanding the authority of campus police. Ultimately, Yale’s resources must be better spent. Rather than financing a subsidiary community police force, Yale should limit the authority of YPD and invest directly in New Haven by paying the taxes the city’s residents have been demanding for years. University police forces like Yale’s maintain contracts with host cities whereby the scope of their authority is defined. Often, as in Yale’s case, these university-funded officers function as a sworn police force, with many of the same responsibilities as the city’s. These agreements are frequently framed as a necessary form of institutional support from the university to the city: Campus police forces like YPD are known for being better trained, paid, and resourced than police departments in the surrounding area. The true benefits, however, are being called into question. Yale and similar universities undoubtedly have an obligation to invest in the surrounding area. Yet tragedies like Washington and Witherspoon’s near-death experience demonstrate that this is not the way to do it. Yale’s current approach to policing has created a confusing and complicated accountability structure. This policing regime has been described by activists as a triple occupation, a perception rooted in fears of overpolicing. The significance of this perception alone cannot be overstated. In fact, professors here at Yale have shown that the distrust this creates between community members and the police weakens police legitimacy in a way that hinders the efficacy of policing itself. Yale is not alone, of course. Throughout the country, universities are bolstering the authority of campus police, ultimately complicating accountability mechanisms. As recent examples like Johns Hopkins’ restructuring of its campus police show , these expansions of power are often initiated in the face of intense opposition from community members. What’s a more effective way for universities like Yale to contribute to their surrounding areas? Paying their fair share in taxes. Cities like New Haven and Baltimore are resource-deprived. With a poverty rate of more than 25 percent, New Haven lacks the funds to effectively invest in a strong police force and violence-prevention programs that tackle crime. The implications of this lack of resources are severe. As sociologists like Robert Vargas have shown, this broad underfunding of government services has been known to intensify the very crime rates campus police are asked to address. This does not have to be the case. Despite their wealth, universities like Yale use almost every loophole possible to avoid taxes. Although Yale owns more than $100 million in real estate assets—making it the city’s fourth-largest property owner—it is a tax-exempt entity. From 2010 through 2015 , Yale avoided paying corporate income taxes on earnings from its $25 billion endowment, resulting in savings of $2.1 billion. During this same period, Yale saved $708 million in municipal property taxes, something many corporate entities would have paid. And again, Yale is not alone. Far too many universities, including Johns Hopkins , have leaped at opportunities to limit their contributions to the surrounding community by failing to pay a fair share in taxes. If universities truly care about the safety of their communities, they will invest directly in a way that would make institutions like YPD obsolete. Only then can universities like Yale begin to improve, rather than make worse, the lives of those in their city’s communities. Only then will these universities give their cities the autonomy they deserve when it comes to policing and begin to address the all-too-common violence inflicted on people like Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon.

Game of Thrones tried to make Arya’s big moment both surprising and inevitable.,slate.com,Sam Adams,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-arya-night-king-battle-of-winterfell-long-night.html,"Game of Thrones Taught Us to Want Death. Then It Changed the Rules. She was meant for this. The Battle of Winterfell may have been the most complicated undertaking in Game of Thrones ’ history, but in retrospect, the episode had one simple purpose: convincing the audience that, after 70 hours and nearly eight years, the fitting ending for the show’s apparently immortal, nigh-all-powerful Night King was a knife in the gut from a teenage girl. The ground troops who were slaughtered by the thousands—and, in some cases, reanimated and killed again—didn’t matter in the end. It was Arya, with the Valyrian steel dagger, in the godswood. “The Long Night,” as the episode is formally called, splits roughly into two parts, the first concerned with what happens outside Winterfell’s walls, the second, after the dead breach the castle gates, set within them. During the first part, which she spends standing atop the battlements with her sister, Arya is mostly a bit player: She lets loose a few well-timed arrows (the Hound says thanks), exchanges some significant glances, and hands a dragonglass dagger to Sansa before sending her down to the crypt. When Sansa balks, insisting she doesn’t know how to use a weapon, Arya advises her to “stick ’em with the pointy end”—a reference that goes all the way back to the second episode of the series, when Jon Snow gave Arya her sword, Needle, with identical words of wisdom . The reversal is a reminder of how far Arya has come, but it also foreshadows the end of the episode, when she and Jon will switch their expected roles: He’ll be the one helplessly pinned down by a larger enemy, and she’ll be the one to slay the (figurative) dragon. The episode featured several nods to Arya’s past, including her sword-fighting tutelage in King’s Landing under Syrio Forel , whose refrain was picked up by the mystical Red Woman: “What do we say to the God of Death? Not today.” Fulfilling her prediction that they would meet again, Melisandre recalled her prophecy of the eyes Arya would one day shut forever : brown, green, and [pause for emphasis] blue. That took us back to Season 3 , two years before Arya began her assassin training in earnest, and two more before Bran passed on to her the dagger she would use to save his life and kill the Night King. (That dagger itself had been wending its way toward the climactic moment for years; it’s the one an assassin used to try to kill Bran in Season 1.) The episode also pointed ahead to its surprise ending by frequently cutting between Arya and Lyanna Mormont, also a pint-size female badass, who, while being crushed to death in an undead giant’s hand, still mustered the strength to draw her sword and stick him in the eye. (Underlining the idea that there’s no correlation between size and bravery, Lady Lyanna’s last stand and Arya’s battle with a horde of zombie wights were intercut with shots of the towering Sandor Clegane cowering against a wall.) “The Last Night” worked to conceal its Arya ex machina twist from first-time viewers, dropping Arya from most of its final act in hopes that we’d forget her purposefully striding away from the Red Woman and the Hound, a killing look set on her face. But watch it again and the episode is making a sustained argument—a plea, really—for us to see Arya’s killing of the Night King as a satisfying, even inevitable, culmination. This isn’t just chance—which is good, because no one is that lucky—it’s fate, the fruit of a design so grand that even the Three-Eyed Raven and the Red Woman can only glimpse its outlines. Beric Dondarrion, who’d come back from the dead a half-dozen times, lived so that he might sacrifice himself for Arya. Theon Greyjoy’s death might seem a pointless one—why charge at an enemy you know you can’t wound?—but you can theorize that he gained Arya the few precious seconds necessary to ensure she could launch herself at the Night King before he drew his sword and killed Bran. When Theon apologizes for betraying the Starks, Bran monotonously reassures him, “Everything you did brought you here,” a tautology tinged with mystical purpose. Seeing her father beheaded set Arya on a course to becoming a killer rather than watching others be killed, but here she’s face to face with the fear that her own death might be as pointless as Ned Stark’s. As the Hound says, they’re not just fighting the dead: They’re fighting Death, and death always wins in the end. The sequence’s mechanics are pure video game, but there’s real terror in Arya’s eyes, a vulnerability we haven’t seen since the days when Arya didn’t know which end of a sword to use. But when the Red Woman reminds her that she’s been training very nearly her whole life for this, she surmounts her fear. She’s been waiting for her moment, and so have we.

Richard Lugar: The late Republican senator helped protect the world from nuclear chaos and mentored Barack Obama.,slate.com,Fred Kaplan,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/richard-lugar-obituary-nuclear-policy-barack-obama.html,"Why Are Companies Buying Cyberinsurance That Doesn’t Cover Cyberattacks? Former Sen. Richard Lugar, who died on Sunday at the age of 87, was the most mild-mannered historic figure of our time, a moderate Republican whose signal achievement helped save the world from calamitous chaos. His passing is worth noting because nothing like his achievement could occur, nor could anyone like him rise to power, in today’s political climate. His great deed was the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1991 , co-sponsored with Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn (bipartisan bills were routine in Congress back then), which, in the wake of the Soviet Union’s implosion, authorized $400 million a year to deactivate—over the years—7,500 nuclear warheads, shut down 47 biological weapons centers, retrain 58,000 weapons scientists, and lock up enough fissile material to build thousands of nuclear bombs, throughout the former Soviet republics. At the time of the act’s passage, Nunn was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Lugar was ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Some Soviet Consulate officials—whom they’d met while monitoring U.S.-Soviet arms control talks in Geneva—approached them with warnings that the world was in trouble. Officers guarding the Soviet nuclear stockpile were deserting in droves, leaving fissile materials and the weapons themselves open to rogue elements and terrorists. The Kremlin needed Western money to pay the guards and Western technicians to build new locks. There was initial reluctance, especially in some Republican circles, to spend American taxpayers’ dollars to beef up Russian security, but most lawmakers grasped the urgency. The bill easily passed the House and the Senate on voice votes. Over the next several years, “Nunn-Lugar” came to refer to a range of efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the post–Cold War era. Its two sponsors traveled frequently to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan—the former Soviet republics where nuclear weapons had been based—to witness the dangers, and observe the dismantlement, of missiles, warheads, and bombs. When I interviewed Lugar a year ago, for a forthcoming book on the history of American nuclear-war policy, he told me about one of his first inspection trips, to the Pervomaisk missile base in Ukraine, where he watched an enormous intercontinental ballistic missile, tipped with several nuclear warheads, being pulled out of its underground silo. He and his hosts took the long elevator ride down the tube to see the launch facility. The first thing he saw, when they reached the bottom, was a guard’s desk and, on the wall behind it, photographs of large American cities. It occurred to him: Those cities had been the targets of that missile. Like most politicians, like most Americans, Lugar—who had been mayor of Indianapolis before winning his first election to the Senate in 1976—hadn’t closely followed the arcana of the nuclear debate before this immersion. The thought made him shiver more than a little—and deepened his commitment to his new mission. His enthusiasm for foreign policy, once a plus for Republican candidates, was turned into a mark against him. Another historic consequence of all this was the role Lugar played in the education of Barack Obama. As a freshman senator in 2005, Obama nabbed a slot on the foreign relations committee and threw himself into the work. Often, as a hearing rambled on beyond its first hour, Obama and the committee chairman were the only senators in the room. Since the Republicans had taken control of the Senate two years earlier, the chairman was Lugar. Almost 30 years Obama’s senior, he was impressed and took to mentoring the up-and-comer. After a few of these hearings, Obama asked if he could tag along on one of Lugar’s visits to the former Soviet republics. They went together that August, on a weeklong tour of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons sites. It was an eventful trip: Russian border guards detained the senators for three hours at the airport in the Siberian city of Perm, demanding to search their aircraft, which they suspected was a spy plane. Top Kremlin officials, alerted by the U.S. Embassy, eventually ordered the guards to let the plane leave for its next stop, in Ukraine, and apologized to the senators. During their holdup, Obama and Lugar discussed the issues, and the politics of the issues, more deeply than they had before. When Obama became president three years later, his signal achievements on nuclear security all stemmed from his tutorship with Lugar. These included the U.S.-Russian New START, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty; the Iran nuclear deal; and the Nuclear Security Summits , which extended the aims of Nunn-Lugar and resulted in the removal or downgrading of enough highly enriched uranium to build nearly 7,000 nuclear bombs at more than 50 facilities in 30 countries, as well as the installation of radiation detectors at 329 international border crossings. After six terms in the Senate, Lugar was defeated in the 2012 primary by Indiana’s treasury secretary, a Tea Party candidate named Richard Mourdock, who was subsequently trounced in the general election by Democrat Joe Donnelly. Lugar lost because he was, by then, too moderate for the Republican Party. His enthusiasm for foreign policy, once a plus for Republican candidates, was turned into a mark against him. Lugar’s complacency, a trait of many multiterm incumbents, compounded the trend. One of Mourdock’s catchy lines was that Lugar had spent more time in Moscow, Russia, than in Russiaville, Indiana—and the jab hit a sore spot: Lugar hadn’t lived in his “home state” since 1977, when his Senate career began. After his defeat, Lugar established the Lugar Center, a Washington-based think tank affiliated with Indiana University and the University of Indianapolis.* Nunn left the Senate voluntarily, 16 years before Lugar, in 1996 after serving four terms, tired of holding a minority seat in a chamber that Republicans had recently taken over.* In 2001, he created, and still co-chairs, the Nuclear Threat Initiative , which has carried on the Nunn-Lugar Act’s work with private funding. There is no one like either of them in the Senate today—lawmakers who also see themselves as diplomats, more devoted to national policy than to party politics—and the country is poorer because of it.
Correction, April 29, 2019: This piece originally misstated that Nunn left the Senate six years before Lugar. It was 16 years before.
Correction, April 30, 2019: This piece originally misstated that the Lugar Center is sponsored by the University of Indiana. It is affiliated with Indiana University and the University of Indianapolis. Support our journalism

"Game of Thrones taught us to want death, then denied it.",slate.com,Willa Paskin,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-battle-of-winterfell-deaths.html,"Game of Thrones Tried to Make Arya’s Big Moment Both Surprising and Inevitable This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones . At 8:04 EDT last night, 56 minutes before the third episode of the eighth season of Game of Thrones began, I got a text: “Hi would anyone like to speculate who is gonna die tonight on GOT. I have a list.” So did I. So did everyone else. The Battle of Winterfell was the long-awaited fight with the vast armies of the frozen undead, this was Game of Thrones , and obviously some people were going to die. Not just ancillary people, but substantial characters. Definitely Grey Worm. Probably Brienne. Perhaps Sam. Maybe even a Lannister. And then, instead, they didn’t. All respect to the Mormont line and Dolorous Edd (aka the guy whose name I had to look up four times, no dis!), these were not the people you’d expect to die in an epic battle, one HBO has promoted like it was a luxury handbag, its value unrelated to anything like utility or aesthetics but rendered only in terms of effort and cash. We had steeled ourselves for worse, for the death of someone who would really make us cry—and it didn’t come. I have seen this outcome described as fan service, but it is more singular than that. This was not what the audience wanted, exactly. We were busy cosplaying as Arya, running the death list over and over in our heads after all! (Grey Worm. Brienne. Jorah. Tyrion ? Could it be Tyrion?) Fans have been running down clues about who would die like a maniac CSI squad hellbent on determining a particular form of zombie death. And then, instead, barely anything. It’s like craving spaghetti for dinner, and then your parents feed you an ice cream sundae instead. Thank you. I will eat that. It tastes … good? But why are you serving this to me? In the beginning, Game of Thrones , following the lead of George R.R. Martin’s books, distinguished itself from other magical fantasy sagas with its attention to realistic detail, both tactile and tactical. Like HBO’s The Wire , Game of Thrones took a genre we were familiar with and refreshed it by wonking out. Armies of men with swords and spears would not just meet on battlefields. We would be let into the backroom dealings, the fumbling strategy sessions, the rancid, watery alleyways. Issues of winning and losing would jostle for space with questions like: How do you fund an army, how do you execute a war, how do you move a battalion across a sea, how do you rule, and above all how do you contend with the brutal accidents of brutal life? But for all of its attention to the strategic details usually glossed over in legends about future kings, nothing indicated Game of Thrones ’ differencefrom the fantasies that came before it like its willingness to do death—because there it broke not with just fantasy but nearly all fiction. From the moment that the heroic Ned Stark, decent yet unstrategic, found his head on a stake at the end of Season 1, Game of Thrones flouted a rule: Main characters don’t die. (A corollary: Main characters are on contract.) But on Game of Thrones , they did . On TV, death (like, literal darkness and nipples) can be a cheap shorthand for depth, proof not of seriousness but of seriosity. Sometimes shows kill people not to demonstrate the awful, wasteful carnality of life, but to prove they are a show about this very thing, now voyeuristically rendered for your viewing enjoyment. Game of Thrones has done much of this—hundreds of extras who have died bloody, crunchy, grimy deaths over its many seasons—but it has also given us deaths that were more than just some sick thrill. In killing Ned, and Robb, and Joffrey, in constantly violating basic structural storytelling conventions—don’t kill your heroes or your villains (till the end)—it brought us closer to the thudding, juddering unfairness, the finality and randomness, the awful abruptness, even when expected, of real death. And with these relatively early major character deaths, the audience became conditioned to expect more, and I don’t just mean in some Pavlovian way. ( Game of Thrones on. Time to slobber for dead meat.) We became, like many of the surviving characters, cynical. We learned to check our hope. Life on Game of Thrones is nasty, brutal, and short. Good people die and being too good might actually kill you. Strategy plays its part but so do chance and cruelty. There goes the Red Viper and Margaery (who I still like so much I checked how to properly spell her ridiculously spelled name), and there goes Stannis, and there goes a little girl burned to death on a stake by an evil witch, who, actually, it turns out could kind of see the future a quarter of the time. Life is horrible. But then, around when Jon Snow was stabbed to death and resurrected as a man with an important mission (but still no ability to make varied facial expressions), something new began to settle on Game of Thrones , a new feeling, a new flavor: untouchability . Jon Snow was inviolable. Was Dany? What about the Starks and Lannisters? This new vibe hung over the show, but it was hard to tell if it was really here to stay. It was late enough in the show’s run, these characters were beloved enough, that they needed a proper sendoff before death, right? OK, well, here was the Battle of Winterfell. A proper sendoff! We weren’t spoiled, but we all knew what was coming. And then it didn’t. We in the audience, panting for death, may be creepy, we may be callous and bloodthirsty, but we seem to have learned the lesson of the show—that happy endings are for stories—better than the show has learned it itself. With each episode of the final season, Game of Thrones has painted itself further into a corner where the end will decide how good or bad the whole thing really was. Is this a show about a morally complicated, morally impossible world? Or is this just a fantasy wrapped in complicated, fetid clothing that it is now throwing off piece by piece, revealing it was basic all along: a quest for the good leader who will restore order to the land, a legend about how systemic evil can be defeated by one (really) badass girl. There are, of course, three episodes left, and surely, deaths will come. (Definitely, still, a Lannister.) But whatever happens, we are squarely back inside a story where death is deployed not with the horrible casualness of life but with the care—and the restraints—of fiction. In acquiescing to this convention, the show has cast off what was most original and truthful about it: the way it illustrated death’s complete lack of cooperation with the wants of men. You do not really get to tell death “not today.” But on Game of Thrones , now you do. The Game of Thrones TV Club Recaps Season 8

"John Singleton, dead at 51, and Spike Lee: The story of how the two directors met.",slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/john-singleton-dead-how-he-met-spike-lee-as-a-teenage-fan.html,"Game of Thrones Tried to Make Arya’s Big Moment Both Surprising and Inevitable John Singleton, the writer-director who was a guiding light for many black filmmakers, died on Monday after suffering a debilitating stroke earlier this month . He is known as the first black American to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for his 1991 film Boyz n the Hood , an achievement that paved the way for black filmmakers like Steve McQueen, Barry Jenkins, and Spike Lee, who have each received directing nominations in the years since. Lee and Singleton became longtime friends, and while discussing Lee’s BlacKkKlansman on the Directors Guild of America’s The Director’s Cut podcast in August , the pair reminisced about the time when they first met. It was the summer of 1986, when Lee was promoting his debut feature, She’s Gotta Have It , in Los Angeles. Singleton, who was 18 at the time, says that he was visiting a Santa Monica theater to see Akira Kurosawa’s Ran when he first caught a glimpse of Lee’s film. “I saw the trailer to She’s Gotta Have It , with my man taking out tube socks on the street,” Singleton remembers, referring to the film’s high-concept movie preview , in which Lee peddles socks and begs moviegoers to buy enough tickets so that he can give up the side hustle. Singleton remembered thinking, while watching the trailer, “I gotta come, I gotta come be here.” When Singleton returned to the cinema the following week, Lee was greeting viewers out front. “I was outside the theater passing out buttons,” Lee says. “He came up to me—what did you say?” “I said, ‘I’m going to film school at USC in two weeks,’ ” Singleton recalls. ” ‘Watch out for me.’ ” Upon hearing news of Singleton’s passing, Lee wrote a remembrance of the initial encounter on Instagram: “Over many years people have told me ‘I’m going to be a filmmaker’, when John said that to me the 1st time we met, I believed him right away. It was no surprise.”"
Michael Avenatti pleads not guilty to dozens of charges that he was better at stealing than lawyering.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/michael-avenatti-pleads-not-guilty-stormy-daniels-lawyer-fraud-hassan-whiteside.html,"Swarthmore Students Occupy Frat House After Documents Leak With Reference to “Rape Attic” Attorney Michael Avenatti was in federal court Monday, this time as a defendant pleading not guilty to 36 counts , which include wire and bank fraud relating to a series of alleged embezzlement schemes that saw him swipe money from a paraplegic man and the ex-girlfriend of an NBA player. It’s quite an astonishing fall for the man who made his name as former porn star Stormy Daniels’ attorney as she battled with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and then, somehow, grew in stature to a national anti-Trump spokesman camped out on CNN and MSNBC taking shots at the president in the name of decency and justice. For a moment, Avenatti’s ascent had reached so high that he even toyed with running for president himself before things started to unravel for the 48-year-old. “With a public defender at his side, the 48-year-old Avenatti pleaded not guilty to all charges in the 36-count indictment which alleges that he stole more than $12 million in settlement money from five of his clients, failed to file income tax returns, failed to pay millions in taxes, submitted fraudulent loan applications and concealing assets from bankruptcy court,” CBS L.A. reports . Even in the age of Trump that, um, isn’t exactly presidential material. The allegations made against Avenatti aren’t pretty. Here’s what prosecutors are accusing Avenatti of in the case that is expected to go to trial on June 25: • Stealing $4 million from a paraplegic man to finance a coffee business. • Embezzling $2.5 million from the ex-girlfriend of Miami Heat player Hassan Whiteside to purchase a portion of a private jet. • Failing to file personal income tax returns from 2010 onward. • Using fake financial data and forged personal income tax returns in order to secure $4.1 million in loans from a bank in Mississippi. In an unrelated, but equally not great development, Avenatti was also charged last month with trying to extort more than $20 million from Nike. Avenatti 2020!"
William Barr is cowering at the prospect of a proper cross-examination. - Slate Magazine,slate.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-jerry-nadler-testimony-judiciary-committee.html,"This piece first appeared on the blog Impeachable Offenses . This weekend brought a subtle, but important, bit of good news for those interested in effective congressional investigations of the Trump administration. Attorney General William Barr is threatening to refuse the request of the House Judiciary Committee that he testify later this week. Reportedly, Barr is balking because the committee will deviate from the pattern of recent congressional hearings in which members do all the questioning and every member gets a paltry three to five minutes to ask questions of the witness, with no opportunity for follow-up. Instead, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler is delegating some of the questioning to committee lawyers who will have 30 minutes to pursue lines of questioning to their logical conclusions. There may also be a private session about any classified materials in the Mueller report. The “get every Member on camera for five minutes” mode of proceeding has long had those of us who are trial lawyers tearing our hair and screaming at our TV sets (or computer screens). It is guaranteed to be ineffectual for three reasons: First, cross-examination, particularly of reluctant or hostile witnesses, is the single most difficult trial skill. To do it well takes training and years of practice. Perishingly few members of either the House or Senate have the professional background to have mastered it. For most of those few, the experience was years in the past, and they’ve lost their edge. Second, the best cross-examiner in the world can do little if confined to an arbitrary five-minute limit. Thus, even the rare talented congressional interrogator can be filibustered for five minutes by any reasonably self-possessed witness. It is extraordinarily heartening to see that Nadler seems to have learned a lesson from history. Third, sequential questioning by members could be made fractionally more effective if all the members (or at least all the members of one party) carefully coordinated the topics and lines of questioning to be pursued. But there is little indication that this is ever done, and it would require a degree of diligence, focus, and cooperative spirit improbable in a group composed of office-seekers eager to get individual, and distinctive, face time. If you want an eye-opening contrast to the aimlessness and patent grandstanding of most modern congressional hearings, go watch the proceedings of the Senate and House committees investigating Nixon and Watergate. Three key differences jump out: First, the committee’s professional counsel did much of the questioning; second, they were unconstrained by artificial time limits; and third, the senators and congressmen of both parties were prepared for their turns at questioning and were obviously interested in learning the truth. Moreover, in order to promote candor and avoid concerns about unfairly besmirching reputations, a number of the key hearings were held in private . The result was that, in Watergate, both the Senate and House hearings were genuine factual inquiries in which witnesses were compelled to answer questions comprehensively and explain inconsistencies in their stories. Both sets of hearings maintained coherent narratives and exposed important facts that would not otherwise have come to light. It is extraordinarily heartening to see that Nadler seems to have learned a lesson from history. Barr’s anguished cries at the prospect of a modest move back toward earlier and more productive modes of procedure should be seen as what they are—the vain protestations of a lawyer who knows the power of competent cross-examination and desperately wants to avoid having it directed at him. That said, Nadler’s proposal is only a modest step in the right direction. The staff questioning will still be broken up into five-minute alternating chunks between majority and minority counsel, which is sadly reminiscent of the clumsy experiment by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republican majority in the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Nadler should do two things. He should stick to his guns in this confrontation with Barr. And in the future, he should move even more firmly in the direction of procedural rules that, in living memory, facilitated the discovery of truth. Committees of both the House and Senate who want facts should follow and build on his example. Support our journalism

Bernie Sanders 2020: Trying to restore the vote to prisoners hurts more than it helps.,slate.com,Jon Sherman,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/bernie-sanders-felon-voting-enfranchisement-democrats-2020.html,"Swarthmore Students Occupy Frat House After Documents Leak With Reference to “Rape Attic” With every passing week, there seems to be a new litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates. Last week’s was whether a felon should be permitted to vote while serving time in prison. At CNN town halls on April 22, Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed the idea of enfranchising those currently serving prison sentences, Mayor Pete Buttigieg did not, and former prosecutor Sen. Kamala Harris hedged, calling for “a conversation.” But no one’s commitment to voting rights should be judged based on a policy that has been adopted by only two states —Maine and Sanders’ Vermont. This is not a pragmatic or strategic approach to changing these laws in the near future. Reasonable people—including those who care deeply about civil rights and democracy—can and do differ on whether felons should be allowed to vote during incarceration, even as more and more citizens and their representatives favor earlier and easier restoration of this right. There are millions of disenfranchised people nationwide who have completed their prison sentences , and restoring their right to vote would constitute a tectonic shift in civil rights. Focusing on this widely popular policy goal before trying something that is far less agreed upon is not just practical politics but also smart policy. Most states restore voting rights at some point after incarceration, usually following parole or probation, while an ever-shrinking minority of states require a felon to petition the state government for restoration. But only 15 states —plus the District of Columbia—restore voting rights immediately upon release from incarceration. Bringing 33 additional states into that column would constitute an enormous change—a “revolution” by any definition. It would immediately restore the voting rights of millions who are still completing a period of supervised release but who have successfully finished their prison terms. Permitting parolees and probationers to vote helps reintegrate them into society, and there is some evidence that it can diminish the chances that a person will break the law again . There is also already momentum for change on this issue, as evidenced by the passage of a constitutional amendment in Florida restoring voting rights to most felons who have completed their sentences, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision to reenfranchise parolees in New York, and Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ support for amending the Iowa Constitution to restore voting rights to returning citizens who have completed their sentences. There is already momentum for change on this issue. But as any observer of the state legislative debates on this issue knows, there is no nationwide consensus or trend in favor of Maine and Vermont’s policy to let all felons vote, including those still in prison for the most serious and violent crimes. This year in New Mexico, where Democrats control both houses of the legislature and the governor is a Democrat, a bill to end all felon disenfranchisement , including during incarceration, stalled in committee. By the time legislators decided to amend it to restoration following release from prison—which would have restored an estimated 16,000 people—they ran out of time and the bill failed . Now, nothing will pass until 2021. By contrast, last week in Nevada, a bill to adopt voting rights restoration following the end of incarceration passed the assembly with bipartisan support and is on to the state Senate. If enacted, this legislation will restore approximately 77,000 people in one fell swoop. The assembly speaker, who sponsored AB 431 , should be commended for not holding up the voting rights of approximately 77,000 American citizens who have completed the hardest part of their criminal sentences for the much more controversial voting eligibility of about 14,800 people in prison . Colorado is currently considering similar legislation . Drawing the line at restoration following release from prison is a pro-voter and completely defensible position. It is also the line drawn in the Democracy Restoration Act , a bill that has been introduced in Congress for many sessions and has now been incorporated in H.R. 1 , which the House of Representatives recently passed. Adopting restoration upon release from prison would vastly improve the laws in no fewer than 33 states, if adopted, restoring voting rights to an estimated 2 million to 3 million people. That could hardly be dismissed as minor, craven, or incremental reform. Seeking change in the near term requires advocacy based on the evidence of where popular will is currently and where it could be led. Taking stock of where 50 state legislatures and the D.C. Council are on this issue is a good gauge of popular opinion and the scope of likely reform on felon voting rights restoration.

Rod Rosenstein resigns after shepherding the Mueller investigation to its completion.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/rod-rosenstein-resigns-after-shepherding-the-mueller-investigation-to-its-completion.html,"Swarthmore Students Occupy Frat House After Documents Leak With Reference to “Rape Attic” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his resignation to Monday, bringing to a close a tumultuous two years at the helm of the Mueller investigation that saw him alternatively enrage President Donald Trump and anti-Trumpers on the left. Rosenstein had been rumored to be on his way out of the Justice Department for months—and throughout the ups and downs of the special counsel investigation always seemed precarious in the job—but will officially leave his post, on his own terms, on May 11. The resignation letter reads as an affirmation of some of the achievements that Rosenstein believes have been accomplished during his tenure at the DOJ. The note also has a number of more cryptic passages that are either aimed at Trump himself or as a reminder of the principles that the Justice Department aims to embody. “I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens,’ ” Rosenstein wrote in his resignation letter . “We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls. We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle. We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first.” Rosenstein’s legacy remains unclear, but the second in command at the DOJ was in the thick of this tumultuous presidency from the outset and made what was the most consequential move of Trump’s presidency so far—the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel in May 2017. Rosenstein had been handed decision-making authority over the Russian investigation after then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself. While the appointment of Mueller to investigate Trump’s Russia ties and possible obstruction of justice angered the Trump administration, Rosenstein also tweaked the left by writing a letter critical of James Comey that was used by Trump to fire the then–FBI Ddirector in the early days of his presidency. More recently, despite managing to stay in his job long enough to see the Mueller investigation to its completion, Rosenstein sided with Attorney General Bill Barr on his handling of the release of Mueller’s findings. The roll-out has been criticized as a cover up operation for the president. Rosenstein’s successor, Jeffrey Rosen, is awaiting confirmation from the Senate."

Right Wing Smear Campaigners Try to Cook Up Fake Sexual Assault Accusations Against Pete Buttigieg,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/right-wing-smear-wohl-burkman-fake-sexual-assault-accusations-pete-buttigieg.html,"Trump: After Birth, Baby Is “Wrapped” in a Blanket and Mother, Doctor Decide Whether to “Execute the Baby” The Daily Beast reported Monday that noted right-wing smear campaigners Jacob Wohl and lobbyist Jack Burkman have been busy trying to cook up a controversy about Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. The pair have reportedly been trying to recruit Republican men to make sexual assault accusations against Buttigieg, the openly gay Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind. As with most things Wohl and Burkman touch , the scheme appears to be comically simplistic, deeply cynical, and possibly illegal. One example of the smear campaign being pushed by the two are the made up accusations posted by Michigan college student Hunter Kelly. In a Medium post Monday, a user with a Hunter Kelly profile made a vague accusation that he was “sexually assaulted by Mayor Pete Buttigieg” in February and promised “[i]n the days and weeks ahead, I will share my full story with the nation.” “That post was tweeted out by David Wohl, Jacob’s father, and quickly re-written by the site Big League Politics, which is known as a landing ground for right wing conspiracy theories,” the Daily Beast notes. Subtle. The Beast got in touch with the real Hunter Kelly who said the Medium account and the Twitter account associated with it were not his. It appears that Wohl and Burkman simply impersonated Kelly to smear the presidential candidate online. Kelly wrote a Facebook post later Monday titled: “I WAS NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.” In another instance, a Republican source told the Daily Beast that Wohl and Burkman had approached him trying to get him to come forward with false allegations that Buttigieghad sexually assaulted him when he was too drunk to consent.
The pitch by Wohl and Burkman wasn’t detailed, the source said, but it resembled past attempts by the duo to peddle dubious sexual assault allegations against perceived political foes. It would involve the accuser giving a press conference where he would publicly make his accusations about Buttigieg. The source said Wohl and Burkman seemed to want him to figure out many of the details, including a window of time during which he and Buttigieg were both in Washington, when the fabricated offense may have occurred. “When the source expressed reluctance, they assured him the scheme would make him wealthy, famous, and a star in Republican politics,” the Beast reports. “Wohl cited the national recognition given to Christine Blasey Ford after she accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault during his confirmation hearings last year.”"

"Ali Smith, author of the new book Spring, on her post-Brexit novel Autumn.",slate.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/ali-smith-author-of-spring-post-brexit-novel-autumn.html,"Copy this link and add it in your podcast app. copy link For detailed instructions, see our Slate Plus podcasts page . Scottish writer Ali Smith just released Spring , the third in a planned quartet of novels named for each of the seasons. The first in the series, Autumn , was released just months after Britain voted to leave the EU and was heralded as the first great post-Brexit novel. Kurt Andersen spoke with Smith in 2017 when Autumn had just been published in America . While the book feels allegorical, it’s also firmly grounded in current events. “I kind of felt I would be cheating the novel if it didn’t face the contemporary or the contemporary didn’t face it,” Smith says. The novel centers around the tender and playful cross-generational friendship between the novel’s main characters, Elizabeth and Daniel. They meet when Elizabeth is just 8 years old and intrigued by her whimsical, elderly neighbor, and the two grow close over the years through their pun-filled chats and shared love for art. There is also this remarkable third character in the book who looms over Elizabeth and Daniel’s lives: the artist Pauline Boty , who died young and until recently was forgotten to art history, but in the 1960s was a central figure in the burgeoning British pop art movement. “If there’s a spirit behind this book, it’s a spirit of Pauline Boty, who was the one and only female U.K. pop artist,” Smith explains. “She was a glorious, inventive, and experimental figure, in her art and also in the world.” 💃 See Pauline Boty's 'The Only Blonde in the World' on display at @Tate_StIves https://t.co/zf6qfnnqDl pic.twitter.com/tqWclX6rPc This podcast was produced by Studio 360’s Zoë Saunders.

FBI says it foiled army veteran's plan to bomb Nazi rally in Los Angeles.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/fbi-los-angeles-nazi-rally-bomb-plot.html,"Trump: After Birth, Baby Is “Wrapped” in a Blanket and Mother, Doctor Decide Whether to “Execute the Baby” A California man has been arrested over an alleged plot to bomb a white supremacist rally in Los Angeles, law enforcement said in court documents published by the Los Angeles Times . The man was allegedly motivated by a desire to seek revenge for the mass shootings last month in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Mark Steven Domingo, a 26-year-old Army veteran who recently converted to Islam, was arrested Friday night after allegedly accepting what he believed to be an improvised explosive device from a bomb maker. An undercover FBI agent posing as the bomb maker had worked with a confidential FBI source as part of a weekslong effort to uncover Domingo’s plans. The suspect had allegedly weighed several forms of retaliation for the New Zealand shootings, which left 50 people dead. He told FBI informants he wanted to cause “mass casualties” and considered attacks against Jews, police, churches, and tourists at the Santa Monica Pier, according to court documents. But he ultimately came to focus on a planned white supremacist rally in Long Beach. According to the Associated Press , no actual white supremacists showed up at the rally, which was planned for Sunday. Instead, a large group of counterprotesters rallied to demonstrate against hate. The FBI was first alerted to Domingo’s alleged plans after he posted to an unnamed platform his desire for revenge after the New Zealand attack. He told an informant who had been working with the FBI for the past six years that he considered, among other forms of terror, shooting Jews as they walked to synagogue. He also said he thought the U.S. should experience another event similar to the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. “Its not about winning the civil war its about weakening America and giving them a taste of the terror they gladly spread all over the world,” he allegedly wrote . He reportedly boasted about his firearms, including two semi-automatic rifles. Domingo allegedly went as far as to purchase several hundred nails to be used as shrapnel in a pressure cooker bomb and to visit the park where the rally was to occur. But according to the court documents, he expressed some hesitation about following through with his plot. He allegedly told the confidential source he wanted to “sleep on it” but then said the next day that he wanted to go forward with the plan. Authorities have said Domingo worked alone. He has been charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted."
"Sanders, Buttigieg, Booker, Castro 2020: Why a mayor hasn’t become president in almost 100 years.",slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/mayor-president-2020-sanders-buttigieg-booker-castro.html,"Dear Care and Feeding: Can We Have Daytime Sex When Our Son’s in the House? A few weeks ago, I watched Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti give what sounded awfully close to a stump speech at a luncheon in New York. He started with the usual spiel about mayoral aptitude—bipartisanship, innovation, infrastructure, getting things done—and went on to discuss his own heritage, green jobs, climate change, immigration, the Hyperloop, pesticides, inequality, and Americans “feeling left behind.” He capped it all with a gender-neutral patriotic paraphrase of the poet Robert Browning: “A person’s reach should always exceed their grasp—or what is America for?” To which, once the rapturous applause had died down, his interlocutor responded, “You just articulated why you should be running for president.” No one is asking for another Democratic candidate for president. Still, Garcetti has long been considered the man who might finally reconcile the gap between American mayors’ high sense of self-worth and their dismal record seeking higher office. It is one of the most beguiling statistics in U.S. politics: No one with mayoral experience has become president since Calvin Coolidge, who was briefly mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts, and only two others preceded him: Grover Cleveland, who was mayor of Buffalo, New York, and Andrew Johnson, who was mayor of Greeneville, Tennessee, for two years in the 1830s. Garcetti says he’s not jumping into the 2020 primary, but his peers are: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is currently sitting at third in the polls. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former mayor of Newark, is running. So is Julián Castro, who was mayor of San Antonio before he became President Barack Obama’s secretary of housing and urban development. And former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who was mayor of Denver. And Sen. Bernie Sanders, who got his start in politics as mayor of Burlington, Vermont. And then there is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who may not be officially running yet but whose dogged, fruitless pursuit of national popularity is proof, in its own way, of mayoral tenaciousness, bravery, and idealism. At first glance, being the executive of an American city seems like a fine job from which to launch a greater political career. In reality, very few representatives, senators, or Cabinet officials have come through local politics. Why haven’t mayors broken through? Does the fact that so many are running this time around mean something’s changed? Does the fact that so many mayors are running this time around mean something’s changed? One obvious answer to the first question is that the sphere mayors operate in is largely subservient to state and federal government. Power resides with state and federal officials, who tend to take credit and deflect responsibility when it comes to urban affairs. A governor might score points for a tax cut, for example, but leave it to a mayor to figure out how to maintain after-school programs with less revenue. De Blasio, in particular, has been a victim of this dynamic, big-footed and blamed by New York’s powerful governor , Andrew Cuomo, on matters as small as animal rescue and as big as education. “Things could be worse,” President Lyndon Johnson quipped during a difficult moment in the Oval Office, “I could be a mayor.” That structure puts mayors on the outside track for higher office but, more importantly, reinforces the fact that they have little say on big issues. “Mayors have way less power than you think,” says Richard Schragger, the author of City Power . “In Charlottesville, the mayor couldn’t control guns, couldn’t take down Confederate monuments, couldn’t control the minimum wage, couldn’t adopt inclusionary housing ordinances.” In many cases, even basic local policymaking has been co-opted by statehouses dominated by conservative, anti-urban interests. Which, of course, is as much a problem for us as for mayors: America’s rural-dominated government—which gives eight senators to Wyoming, Vermont, and the Dakotas (total population 2.8 million) and two to California (population 39.6 million)—gives little thought to metropolitan issues like homelessness or public transportation. After two terms in South Bend, Buttigieg could be an example of the shortfalls of running for higher office on a mayoral record. For one thing, voters probably won’t care how a mayor picked up snow or rebuilt the waste-to-energy plant, even as reporters home in on the more controversial aspects of a tenure, like Buttigieg’s dismissal of a black police chief and his efforts to enforce building code violations in communities of color. For another, the kind of coalition building and compromise that’s required to run a city may look unattractive, particularly in the base-driven primaries, compared with candidates who have hewed to neat ideological lines in the legislature. Michael Bloomberg finally seems to have realized his moderate vibe makes him a bad fit for the Democratic electorate. And as Rudy Giuliani worked his way into the GOP mainstream, particularly during a primary run for president in 2012, he strayed so far from his centrist reputation that in 2018 he was booed at a Yankees game —a rebuke that would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. (This challenge of getting through primaries on pragmatism has also applied to governors, though their issues are more relevant during a presidential campaign.) A record of getting things done just might not be that appealing . For a third, most Americans have long associated city politics with corruption or graft, first that of the white urban machines—think the Daleys—and later that of black leaders like Detroit’s Coleman Young and Washington, D.C.’s Marion Barry. Add to that the greater crisis of disinvestment, crime, and poverty that afflicted so many U.S. cities in the second half of the 20 th century. Add to that, perhaps most importantly, the indelible association in the white mind of the American city with black power and racial conflict. Perhaps it is no surprise that for so long no one thought of city hall as a building block in a national platform. But maybe that’s changing. Mayoring is not just about picking up garbage and clearing snow anymore: Some mayors have advanced complex, progressive social agendas, like de Blasio’s success in providing prekindergarten to 70,000 kids. Others, like Garcetti, can lay claim to ambitious infrastructure initiatives—Los Angeles County is setting aside $120 billion to fund regional transportation, including highways and rail projects. Still others have led the way on issues that have newfound national resonance, like climate change, housing, and racial justice. And virtually every big-city mayor has been loud and clear about his support for immigrants and opposition to federal immigration policy, with many maintaining so-called sanctuary cities in open defiance of federal law enforcement . The reputation of the American city isn’t what it used to be. The country’s drug problem, once a symbol of urban dysfunction, is mostly white and rural now. Despite President Donald Trump’s repeated invocation of Chicago’s gun violence, urban politics is just as likely to signify class, power, and money. That’s certainly true of cities where gentrification and displacement have upended black and Latino neighborhoods and created new emblems of urbanity for public consumption. But it’s also true of places like Milwaukee, as the political scientist Katherine Cramer has shown, despite the fact that urban poverty remains endemic. Even a mayor of a depressed, post-industrial city is just as likely to be associated with condos and bike lanes as with unemployment or racial strife—or sometimes, as in Buttigieg’s case, with both. The truth is, many mayors are presiding over downtown revitalization and neighborhood poverty at the same time. But to a visitor, things look good: Auto theft is down, condos are up. Most importantly, the Democratic Party is not what it used to be: The urban-rural divide is real, and more than ever, Democratic votes are to be found in the country’s cities and suburbs. There are fewer rural Democrats than at any time in history. The party is less white than ever before. The consequences of those shifts are emerging in policy discussions—for example, in Sens. Booker, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren emphasizing housing policy, or in the expectation that all Democratic candidates will answer questions about policing. We may not get a president who ran one of the country’s cities, but at least, for a change, we’ll get to talk about them. "
Stephen Moore—Whose Fed Bid Is Crashing and Burning—Wanted to Get Rid of Child Labor Laws,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/stephen-moores-fed-bid-crashing-burning-joni-ernst-richard-shelby.html,"Trump Just Gave Democrats Another Reason to Launch an Impeachment Inquiry I don’t want to jinx anything, but Stephen Moore’s chances of actually making it to the Federal Reserve are starting to look a bit dicey. As journalists have continued to comb through his back catalog of magazine columns and public appearances, they’ve churned up more and more outrageous and offensive tidbits, and collectively, they seem to be eating away at his support in Congress. Just this week, the New York Times reported that at a 2016 debate about the minimum wage, he said that the U.S. should nix many of its child labor laws. (He feels it’s important that young people should get work experience early.) “I’m a radical on this,” he said, in total sincerity. “I’d get rid of a lot of these child labor laws. I want people starting to work at 11, 12.” This sentiment pops up from time to time among especially batty conservatives. Readers who are especially fond of political trivia might remember Newt Gingrich once made a similar argument during the 2012 Republican primary. (He thought kids should have the opportunity to work as janitorial assistants in public schools.) But it was not a great look then. It is still not a great look now, coming from a potential Fed nominee. (Trump previously said he intended to tap Moore for the central bank’s Board of Governors, but hasn’t officially done it yet.) Moore’s image has already taken a beating thanks to revelations that he owes the government $75,000 in back taxes and penalties, was held in contempt of court for failing to pay alimony, and spent years as a pundit writing sexist dribble that he has since tried to defend as comedy. (He mocked women’s sports, criticized the idea of women serving in the military, downplayed the seriousness of women being sexually harassed by drunk frat guys on college campuses, and—while married—joked about his kid foiling efforts to pick up younger women, among other bits.) And many Republicans on the Hill seem to be getting tired of it. “His past writings are ridiculous,” Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst told reporters on Monday. “I’m not enthused about supporting him, let’s put it that way.” Richard Shelby, the powerful GOP senator from Alabama, is also making skeptical noises. Via Politico :
Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said he thought Moore would be an interesting pick for the Fed but added that he too has qualms about what he has said about women.
“I think everybody does,” he told reporters. “My wife is a professor, you know? She broke through a lot of ceilings and everything,” adding that he has a granddaughter who “thinks she can do anything.”
“I know him, but a lot of these things have come up about his taxes, about his child support and alimony, about things he’s written about women,” he said. He said those things would all be considered if he’s nominated. Shelby is a senior member of the Banking Committee, which would have jurisdiction over Moore’s nomination. And remember, Mitt Romney has already hinted that he has qualms with Moore’s qualifications. (The man spent much of his life as conservative political advocate and pundit, co-founding the Club for Growth and writing editorials for the Wall Street Journal; he also lacks an actual economics Ph.D.) Point being, things aren’t looking great for ol’ Steve. In related news, the White House has finally started going through Moore’s past writing, looking for any other bombs. Better late than never? Update, April 30, 2019, 2:12 PM: Moore may be in even deeper trouble than I thought. About 10 minutes after I published this post, Politico posted an article with more cautious and critical comments from Republicans. “These stories that have come out recently will be a good test about what the support level is up here,” said Senate Majority Whip John Thune, which sounds like a hint that Moore’s chances may be on the verge of an imminent collapse. “If you have Joni [Ernst] and other members of our conference … as affected by some of these stories as she was, we’ll get a sense of that pretty quickly.” An anonymous Republican senator was more blunt: “I don’t imagine he can get the votes.” Update, April 30, 2019, 2:50 PM: Yeah, it looks like this ship has hit an iceberg. BREAKING: GOP Sen. Joni Ernst is the first to go on record against Steve Moore.She says it is “very unlikely” she would support Moore and that she has told the White House that. #Fed"
