"Donald and Abe's friendship day: golf, sumo and barbecue - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Kevin Liptak,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/25/politics/donald-trump-japan-sumo-abe/index.html,"Tokyo (CNN) A sunny round of golf, double hamburgers for lunch, ringside seats at a sumo wrestling ""basho"" and a barbeque dinner. Those were the components Sunday of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's latest bid to become President Donald Trump's best global friend.
Whether the hours of male bonding result in wins on trade and security remains to be seen. Before the day even began, there were signs the ardent effort at cultivating the US leader -- started even before he assumed office -- had not paid off in new agreement on North Korea. Still, the lavish displays of camaraderie clearly suited Trump, who was pictured at the Mobara Country Club south of Tokyo smiling broadly in a selfie taken by Abe as they played 16 holes and sat together for both breakfast and lunch (double cheeseburgers made from American beef, according to Japan's foreign ministry). And he relished presenting the gleaming, oversized President's Cup trophy topped with a spread-winged eagle -- which he said he purchased himself -- at a sumo wresting tournament, or basho, in Tokyo. He was seated on a small chair during several bouts, watching with interest as the loin-clothed wrestlers brawled. Donald Trump presents the President's Cup to the Tokyo Grand Sumo Tournament winner Asanoyama, at Ryogoku Kokugikan Stadium. Later, Trump and first lady Melania Trump joined Abe and his wife at a barbeque restaurant for grilled chicken, Wagyu beef and vanilla ice cream -- the venue selected with Trump's penchant for red meat in mind. Read More ""The prime minister and I talked lot today about trade and military and various other things. I think we had a very productive day,"" Trump said at the start of the dinner after being handed his first course on a long wooden paddle. It was all meant to maintain the close personal ties Abe has developed with Trump in pursuit of a smooth and beneficial relationship between Washington and Tokyo. But an episode earlier in the day highlighted the challenges that Abe faces in cultivating an ally in Trump, whose deeply personal view of diplomacy has led to ample displays of friendship that sometimes fail to yield results. Trump tweeted -- as he prepared for his round of golf with Abe -- that he doesn't view North Korea's recent short range missile tests as disturbing , a view deeply at odds with his Japanese hosts and in conflict with statements made a day earlier by his national security adviser. Trump plays down North Korea's missile test, putting him at odds with Abe ""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. The Japanese government has said North Korea's recent test of short range missiles violated UN resolutions -- a determination that national security adviser, John Bolton, agreed with in Tokyo on Saturday during a briefing with reporters. Trump, who has chafed in recent weeks at what he views as an overly hawkish approach from Bolton, signaled he was more intent on preserving his relationship with Kim Jong Un. ""I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,"" Trump said in his tweet before taking a swipe at former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. It was a startling start to what was meant to be an ostentatious display of US-Japan unity, orchestrated by a prime minister whose stabs at becoming Trump's closest global ally are bound by few limits of enthusiasm or taste. There were the gold-plated golf clubs he presented the newly-elected Trump during a visit to his Manhattan tower in November 2016. There were the white baseball caps he embroidered with gold -- ""Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Great Again"" -- to wear over a lunch of hamburgers a year later. There was the rumored nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize, an episode still vague in detail but not denied by the Japanese government. And this week, there is the royal pageantry of a state visit , the first for Japan's newly enthroned emperor .

Whether any of that has helped Abe cultivate Trump into anything more than a friend is unclear. What is certain, however, is the example he set early on for his fellow world leaders hoping to make inroads with an untested and unpredictable president. His model of conspicuous flattery has been mimicked by leaders across the globe, though few have carried out the task with as much gusto as the Japanese leader. Their round of golf Sunday was the latest of several outings on the links the men have enjoyed both in Japan and Florida over the past two years. And the invitation to the finals of the spring sumo wrestling tournament were a hotly anticipated event that had left Japanese fans wondering how the brash and unpredictable US leader would fit in the tradition-bound stadium. He presented a four-and-a-half foot tall trophy, weighing between 60 and 70 pounds, to the victor, grimacing happily as he hoisted the cup with the help of two other men. Trump later told reporters he'd paid for the cup himself to avoid questions. ""We bought that beautiful trophy which they'll have hopefully for many hundreds of years,"" he said. The trophy presented, Trump and Abe joined their wives for dinner at a traditional charcoal grill restaurant in Tokyo -- an accommodation for a President not always eager to experience his host country's more exotic offerings (Abe took Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, to what is regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world, Sukiyabashi Jiro). It was an entire day of face time with Trump for Abe, who is eager to diffuse trade tensions while also ensuring the US remains committed to pressuring North Korea on its nuclear weapons and missile programs. The two men will meet more formally on Monday after participating in royal events with the new emperor -- bringing the times they have spoken by phone or met in person north of 40. For Abe, a strategy of cultivating Trump has drawn some criticism and even light mockery. And though Trump himself is not popular in Japan, surveys show most Japanese believe maintaining strong ties to the US is essential, no matter who its president is. Inside Trump's Air Force One: 'It's like being held captive' Whether Abe will succeed in converting his warm friendship into trade and security wins remains unknown. Trump, whose view of Japan as an economic rival dates from its boom period in the 1980s, continues to harp on the $68 billion trade deficit with the United States. He's refused Abe's pleas to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on the country. And he's threatening new auto tariffs if a new bilateral trade agreement can't be struck within six months. Trump tweeted on Sunday that real work on a new trade agreement would have to wait until after parliamentary elections in Japan, due to be held in July. On security matters, too, Japanese officials have felt rattled by Trump. His diplomatic opening with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un caused concern in neighboring Japan, where the threat of missiles is far more potent than on the US mainland. Japan has pressed Trump to maintain pressure on Pyongyang, and has eyed the budding friendship between Trump and Kim warily -- particularly because a number of Japanese citizens were abducted by the North Korean regime decades ago, an issue Abe has pressed Trump to raise with Kim during their summits. According to White House officials, those issues would be under discussion during this week's visit to Japan. But they were expected to play only a supporting role to the main ceremonial events of the week. Trump arrives in Japan eager for flattery and pomp Trump, who was briefed by Abe on some of the visit's details during a visit to Washington last month, has been hotly anticipating the pageantry , according to officials. He told reporters as he was preparing to leave he would be witnessing ""something that hasn't happened in over 200 years,"" though didn't specify what he meant. When Abe told him the sumo wrestling tournament would be bigger than the Super Bowl, Trump couldn't refuse. ""I said, 'I'll be there. If that's the case, I'll be there,'"" Trump said in the Oval Office during Abe's visit. It's a model that other world leaders have utilized to varying levels of success on a President highly susceptible to extravagant displays of flattery. During a first stop abroad in Saudi Arabia two years ago, Trump was treated to a royal sword dancing display and a now-mocked ceremony involving a glowing orb. His relationship with Riyadh appears stronger than ever, despite its concerning human rights record and involvement in the murder of an American journalist . The US' strongest ally has found the flattery route somewhat harder to execute. A state visit to the United Kingdom had been an on-and-off affair for nearly two years after Prime Minister Theresa May came to the White House to extend the invitation. It will finally come to fruition next week -- and the royal welcome from Queen Elizabeth will be met with expected protests. May, meanwhile, has announced she'll resign from office days later."

Why China is building hundreds of new airports,www.cnn.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-new-airports/index.html,"Beijing is building hundreds of airports as millions of Chinese take to the skies Matt Falcus and Maggie Hiufu Wong, CNN • Published 25th May 2019 Facebook Twitter Email (CNN) — When China's air industry hits the news, stories are typically centered on passengers going rogue , punching each other, trying to wrestle open emergency doors mid-takeoff or dangerously tossing coins into airplane engines for luck. While alarming and fascinating in equal measure, these headlines conceal another tale -- one of a country undergoing a breakneck expansion into the world of flying as its people take to the sky in rapidly increasing numbers. In the space of barely more than a decade, China has transformed from a nation where few had ever experienced air travel to one where millions of its citizens are flying not only across their own vast territory, but to destinations around the world. Such is the pace of China's ascension to the jet age that stories of wayward passengers are perhaps inevitable -- even if they obscure the fact that many air journeys in China are incident free. But there's more to come. Much, much more. Beijing's new Daxing International Airport conducted its first flight tests with passenger aircraft on May 13. STR/AFP/AFP/Getty Images World's largest aviation market Even as China is on course to overtake the United States as the world's biggest air travel market within the next three years, the country's hunger for aviation seems set to continue growing exponentially. To sate that hunger, the government has embarked on an airport building program on a scale rarely witnessed before anywhere. Billions upon billions of dollars are being poured into runways and terminals that will plug the entire country directly into the global transport network. China currently has around 235 airports, but with many lacking the capacity to sustain the coming increase in passenger numbers and flights, government officials estimate around 450 airports will be needed across the country by 2035. That's the same year aviation analysts predict China will be handling a quarter of all the world's air passengers. Related content Inside India's aviation revolution and what it means for travelers Cheung Kwok Law, director of policy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Aviation Policy and Research Centre, tells CNN Travel Beijing's super-heated expansion into aviation is aimed at future-proofing against demand but also to generate economic growth. ""The government is really looking ahead,"" he says, ""not only to meet the current demand but to stimulate future demand for air transportation."" While much of this expansion is taking place in cities and districts that many people outside of China or Asia may never have heard of, it's also highly visible in Beijing, where construction on the multibillion-dollar Daxing International Airport has just entered its final phase, with the first round of flight tests taking place on May 14. The new Beijing Daxing International Airport is said to have the world's largest single terminal and is designed to handle more than 100 million passengers annually. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images As we move towards the third decade of the 21st century, airport superhubs are nothing new. But Beijing's sprawling creation -- designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid and her Chinese partners -- is almost breathtaking in its ambition. Due to open in September of 2019, it will feature four runways and a terminal the size of 97 soccer pitches. Related content The most exciting new airports opening in 2019 China's capital has long been in need of a second global gateway. Handling more than 100 million passengers in 2018, Beijing's existing Capital International Airport is now the second busiest airport in the world after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and is hitting full capacity. When the new Daxing Airport opens, Beijing Capital will not close. Instead it will continue to handle airlines like Air China and Hainan Airlines, giving the city an extra boost of capacity as the number of air travelers shows no sign of abating. Where are the airports needed most? While China's plan to build more than 200 airport facilities may seem extraordinary, it is the speed rather than the scale of this ambition that is remarkable. It still pales beside the 5,000 public airports serving US towns, cities and communities. ""I don't think the expansion of airports is excessive at all,"" says Law. ""There are three international airports in New York and five in London; Beijing will open its second airport this year. Shanghai, with over 20 million people, will construct its third airport and Guangzhou, with 17 million people, will construct its second airport."" According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), in 2018, Chinese airports handled 1.264 billion passengers, up 10.2% over 2017, with 37 of the country's airports handling over 10 million passengers in a year. Beijing Daxing International Airport, seen here in a rendering, will open in September, 2019. Courtesy Zaha Hadid Architects At present an average of eight new airports are opening in the country every year, while some facilities are being expanded and upgraded -- but there are concerns within China that those already open are failing to meet modern expectations. Related content These are the world's best airports for 2019 ""Service has improved substantially, but existing airports are far from adequate and are unevenly distributed throughout the country,"" Dong Faxin, director of CAAC's development and planning department, said in a report issued late last year outlining China's airport construction ambitions. A large chunk of the upcoming facilities will be located in the Yangtze River Delta region, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, as well as the Chongqing and Chengdu city clusters. These are the areas with the highest populations but rely on a few hub airports to handle all passenger traffic. In the coming years, they will each have new world-class airports for their individual centers of population. Shanghai Pudong International Airport is China's second busiest airport after Beijing Capitol. JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Chengdu Tianfu International Airport, for example, will open in 2020. It'll be Chengdu's second aviation hub, easing the pressure on busy Shuangliu International Airport. New airports will also be built in China's west, where there are currently fewer facilities. This will aid the development of this region both for business and tourism but also further Beijing's push to exert its influence over far-flung regions. ""The mainland government has a very clear development strategy to promote the economic development in the less developed areas and locations like the western and northeastern parts of China,"" says Law. ""Providing air traffic support will be vital to the development of these areas and to achieve a more balanced economic development between the coastal region and more remote areas."" Chengdu's new Tianfu International Airport, due to open in 2020, was designed by a consortium made up of the China Southwest Architectural Design and Research Institute, China Airport Construction Group Corporation and French architectural firm ADP Ingenierie. ADP Ingénierie Airports for the future The upside to building new airports from scratch is that each facility can be developed to meet today's high-tech demands while also keeping growth and wider transport infrastructure in mind. Airports today are not standalone facilities and the most efficient seamlessly link with other modes of transport such as major road arteries and the country's high-speed rail network, which the Chinese government has been promoting heavily. The flagship new Daxing airport is seen as a blueprint, albeit on a much bigger scale, for others, incorporating a 350-kilometer per hour rail link to the city. It will initially accommodate 72 million passengers and two million tons of cargo annually, rising to at least 100 million passengers and four million tons of cargo a year when fully opened. Daxing's creators are also redesigning the way passengers use airports by combining one of the world's largest terminal buildings with short walking distances, allowing travelers to easily reach their gates through a unique layout and design. Economic setbacks loom In many respects it seems China is unstoppable in its growth. Building hundreds of new airports is merely one step for a country reinventing itself on the way to becoming the next major superpower. However, there are doubts the country's economy will hold up long enough, or attain the expected levels of growth, to see all these planned airports become a reality. The recent economic slowdown is the worst some analysts have seen, exacerbated by a trade war with the United States and slumping sales in some key areas. Related content The most exciting new airports opening in 2019 If a slump in tourism coincides with this dip, it could leave many of the planned airports on the drawing board -- especially those built as a response to growing inbound tourism. Any hit to the economy would also reduce the amount of outbound travel undertaken by Chinese citizens. But Law is optimistic about the situation. ""By 2035, it's expected global passenger travel will increase by 3.5% annually,"" he says. ""If you look at China, growth could be between 5-6% on average, much higher than the global average. In one estimation, China is expected to have a middle class population of more than 500 million in the next 10 years. ""So the economy may be slowing down moderately but the rising of the middle class will provide support to the aviation development in China -- both in terms of passenger demand as well as the demand for cargo transportation."" Experts worry that if the economy slows down, many of these future airports will barely have any flights. Matt Falcus Possible road blocks: Staff shortages, airspace imbalances However, Law does acknowledge there will be challenges -- including a potential staff shortage. ""Globally, the current generation of aviation professionals will be retiring at a faster pace in the next five to 10 years,"" he says. ""While China plans to expand rapidly in the next decades, they will be facing an acute shortage in manpower and so far, I do not see the government paying sufficient attention on this subject."" The environmental impact of air traffic increases is also a concern. Earlier this year, the UN launched its Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), aimed at addressing increases in total CO2 emissions from international civil aviation. Under the scheme, airlines in countries that have voluntarily opted to participate will be required to buy carbon offsets to compensate for their growth in CO2 emissions, and would begin tracking these emissions from January 1, 2019. Related content Inside Changi Airport Singapore's new 'Jewel,' home to world's tallest indoor waterfall As of May​ 6, 80 states, representing 76.63​% of international aviation activity , stated their intention to voluntarily participate in CORSIA. Unlike the US, China is not among them, though participation is mandatory as of 2027. According to data compiled by Australia's Griffith University's Institute for Tourism , in 2018 the US emitted 22.7% of all passenger Co2 emissions, followed by China at 10.4%. Another problem is China's notorious airspace management, which is largely to blame for consistent flight delays. Civil aviation only accounts for 20% of all traffic while the military controls 80%. In the US, the situation is reversed. ""In this respect, the rapid expansion of the civil aviation activities and the congestion of the airspace management will become more serious,"" says Law. ""In the country's 13th five-year plan, there are a couple of statements indicating the government will work on the liberalization and the restructuring of its airspace management -- but without further information [on how or when it will do this]."" For passengers, the improvements can't come soon enough. Any increase in efficiency and choice combined with delay reductions can only be of benefit in a country with a seemingly insatiable demand for air travel -- and should result in fewer rogue passengers hitting the headlines. Matt Falcus is a British aviation writer and editor of the popular Airport Spotting Blog , which delivers daily news on airline and airport operations around the world. He is also the author of numerous books on airports and aviation history. "
47 states urge Betsy DeVos to forgive disabled veterans' student loan debt - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,"Paul LeBlanc, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/25/politics/student-loans-disabled-veterans-attorney-generals-betsy-devos/index.html,"(CNN) A group of bipartisan attorneys general from 51 states and territories on Friday wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urging the Department of Education automatically forgive the student loan debt of eligible veterans who became disabled through their military service.
""We write, as the Attorneys General of our jurisdictions, to urge the Department of Education to take prompt action to satisfy its statutory mandate to discharge the student loans of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled or otherwise unemployable,"" the letter says. ""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us."" While the student loans of disabled veterans are required to be discharged by law when they make the request, the letter asks DeVos to make the loan discharges automatic, stating the current requirements to secure loan forgiveness ""may prove insurmountable obstacles to relief for many eligible veterans due to the severe nature of their disabilities."" The letter, which was also signed by attorneys general from three US territories and the District of Columbia, says just 9,000 of 42,000 eligible veterans applied for student loan forgiveness as of April 2018. These dogs cleared explosives in Syria. Now they're adjusting to civilian life ""Forgiving their school loans is the least we can do to recognize their service and sacrifice,"" Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said in a statement about the letter. ""These veterans have suffered permanent and total disability as a direct result of their service to our country. They and their families have sacrificed health, quality of life, and often their dreams for the future. Many have lost their ability to work and pay off any school debt."" Read More In a statement to Reuters Friday, the Department of Education pushed back on the letter, saying, ""While 'automatic discharge' may seem like a simple solution, there are long-term impacts we want all veterans to have the chance to consider before their loans are discharged."" The department told Reuters they wanted veterans to be aware that loan ""discharges might boost their tax bills or make it harder to borrow for education later."" Despite this, the attorneys general touted bipartisan congressional support for the measure as well as backing from multiple veteran advocacy groups. ""We now urge the department to take action to better protect those who once protected the nation,"" they wrote in the letter. ""Our veterans deserve nothing less."""

It looks like any other graduation -- except these graduates earned their degrees in prison,edition.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/25/us/prison-education-programs-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) There was pomp and circumstance. There were caps and gowns. Proud family members sat in the audience.
It looked like just another graduation ceremony -- except it took place at the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center in the town of Pacific, where all 10 of the graduates are incarcerated. The graduates received Associate of Arts degrees earlier this week from Washington University in St. Louis, becoming the university's first class of incarcerated graduates. To earn the degree, the men completed 20 courses across disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and mathematics -- all while serving time in prison. Washington University's Prison Education Project is just one of scores of programs across the country that grant liberal arts degrees to incarcerated or formerly incarcerated people. It's a departure from the vocational training typically offered in prisons, which seeks to find employment for inmates in industries such as welding, plumbing and auto repair after they are released. Prison education improves critical thinking Read More Carl Brock (left), Mark Boyd and Torey Adams congratulate a fellow student. For anyone wondering what benefits learning to solve calculus problems or reading Homer's ""The Odyssey"" provide to people in prison, Washington University's graduates will tell them: It's the critical thinking skills. ""Most people end up in prison because of bad decision-making skills,"" Torey Adams, who has been in prison for nearly 13 years for robbery and armed criminal action, said. Over time, Adams said, taking courses such as sociology and archaeology have helped him approach problems differently and have taught him to think things through before making a decision. ""You can't quite see it when it's happening but some way, somehow, it's teaching you to think critically,"" he said. ""I see how being a Wash U student affects me in other areas of my life."" Harvey Galler has been in and out of prison five times -- currently, he's serving a five-year sentence for statutory rape. He's set to be released in about seven months, and he said he sees an education as the only real opportunity for him once he's out of prison. The market for trade jobs is saturated and having a criminal record makes getting a job even harder. ""We've got this mark on us that other people don't have that we've got to compete with, so it's easier for them to get jobs,"" he said. ""If we're able to get this leap ahead with this education, I think that carries a lot more value."" Robert Henke, director of the school's Prison Education Project and a professor of drama and comparative literature, said he sees a strong determination to learn in his incarcerated students. Many have ambitions of eventually earning a Bachelor of Arts degree, or continuing on to even higher education. ""There's this kind of intensity, this sense for them that something's really at stake,"" Henke said. It also reduces the risk of returning to prison Harvey Galler (right) takes in the moment. Research shows that degree-granting prison education programs have a significant effect on reducing recidivism rates, meaning that programs like this make it less likely that former inmates will end up back in prison. And the idea has bipartisan support. ""Ensuring that people are able to participate in liberal arts programs that might empower them to be entrepreneurs or something like that as opposed to a tradesman is actually beneficial to the people themselves and society as a whole, as it helps them better find a job after prison,"" Ames Grawert, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said. Offering people in prison an opportunity to get a liberal arts education is also humanizing, Grawert said, because it recognizes that education isn't a ""one-size-fits-all solution."" Nikhil Pal Singh, the faculty director of a similar program at New York University, echoed that sentiment, saying that a liberal arts education provides people in prison access to more career opportunities. ""It's mistaken to think that basic liberal arts isn't what's needed for the professional world these days,"" Singh said. ""People need to be able to think, they need to be able to write, they need to be able to communicate. These are the kinds of skills you learn in a basic liberal arts college program."" In addition to courses in writing, math and social sciences, NYU's program also offers electives designed to introduce inmates to certain career paths, such as social work or business. NYU's prison education program also offers other opportunities generally available to college students, such as counseling and workshops on financial literacy and leadership development. The liberal arts empower graduates Torey Adams gets a hug at the ceremony. Back at Washington University, the program seems to have ignited a spark in some of its graduates. Adams said he intends to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and eventually start his own business focusing on entertainment hospitality. Galler said that after earning a bachelor's, he hopes to pursue a master's in social work to be a voice that represents people who have been incarcerated. Henke said he doesn't see Washington University's prison education program as a community service project. Instead, it's ""a chance to get out of the ivory tower"" and find talented students in places might otherwise be neglected. ""It's a matter of, 'Let's find really excellent students. Let's go beyond the normal confines. Let's look for excellence in different places, in some surprising places,'"" Henke said. ""It's not social work. It's not pity work."" That attitude showed at the graduation ceremony, where nothing in the program indicated that the graduates were in prison. From the catered food to the leather-bound diplomas, Adams said it made the experience that much more powerful. ""They really did everything they could to make us feel like we graduated in freedom as opposed to graduating in prison,"" he said."
San Francisco police chief says raid on journalist's home may have violated California shield law,edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/25/us/san-francisco-police-chief-journalist-raid/index.html,"(CNN) San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott called for an independent investigation Friday into the department's handling of leaked documents and the subsequent raid of a journalist's home.
Freelance journalist Bryan Carmody obtained a confidential police report that included information about the February death of prominent San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi. Carmody, 59, refused to tell authorities how he obtained the documents in April. During a raid of Carmody's home weeks later , officers seized his computers, cameras, phones and notebooks. Jeff Adachi Days after the May 10 raid, Scott said at a news conference there is a criminal investigation into whether Carmody was an ""active participant in the commission of the criminal acts beyond his role with the news media."" Despite those comments, Scott released a statement Friday saying the department is seeking an ""independent, impartial investigation by a separate investigatory body."" Scott said he was concerned ""by a lack of due diligence by department investigators in seeking search warrants and appropriately addressing Mr. Carmody's status as a member of the news media."" ""This has raised important questions about our handling of this case and whether the California shield law was violated,"" Scott's statement read.

"Russia must release detained Ukrainian sailors, UN tribunal rules - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/25/europe/ukraine-sailors-russia-kerch-strait/index.html,"(CNN) Russian authorities must release the 24 Ukrainian sailors who were captured last year after entering the Kerch Strait, a United Nations maritime tribunal has ruled.
The sailors and their three vessels were taken by the Russian navy last November. The incident marked a major escalation in tensions between the two former Soviet Republics . Ukraine said two of its small gunboats and one tugboat were attacked after entering the Kerch Strait en route to the city of Mariupol. Russia said the Ukrainian ships illegally entered Russia's territorial waters, carrying out dangerous maneuvers. The UN International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea said Russia must release the sailors immediately and urged both nations to not escalate the conflict. ""The actions taken by the Russian Federation could irreparably prejudice the rights claimed by Ukraine to the immunity of its naval vessels and their servicemen,"" said Jin-Hyun Paik, the tribunal's president. Read More Ukraine says Russia opened fire on its naval vessels, seized them Ukraine has asked for the sailors' release, but Russia has not yet taken notice of the country's requests or attended public hearings on the case, the tribunal said. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Olena Zerkal said she expects Russian authorities to comply with the tribunal's order. ""The order of the Tribunal is a clear signal for Russia that it cannot violate international law with impunity,"" she said, according to Ukrainian state-run news agency Ukrinform. Russian officials did not attend the tribunal's hearing and only sent a note through the Russian Embassy in Germany saying the country does not believe the tribunal has jurisdiction to review the incident, Russian state-run news agency TASS reported. The Kerch Strait -- a shallow, narrow stretch of water just 2 to 3 miles wide at one point -- connects the Azov Sea with the Black Sea and runs between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia. It is an important economic lifeline for Ukraine, as it allows its ships to access the Black Sea. It's also the closest point of access for Russia to Crimea, a peninsula Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A Russian-built bridge over the Kerch Strait opened last year. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in long-simmering conflict since the annexation of Crimea, and a war with Russian-backed separatists in the country's east has claimed more than 10,000 lives. Russia has also backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.​"

(CNN) Gregory Beck was on his way to his St. Louis home in his wheelchair when tornado sirens sounded.
Beck lost both of his legs last year and is legally blind, according to CNN affiliate KMOV4 . It would normally take him 25 minutes to get back home from the supermarket, and he would need to stop as many as 10 times to rest. Gregory Beck
""Everyone kept telling me the storm is coming and you need to hurry up and get home,"" Beck told the station.
While other drivers honked and yelled at Beck as he tried to cross the street Tuesday and make it up the hill, 16-year-old Seth Phillips and his mother, Amber Gilleylen, stopped their car so Seth could push him the rest of the way home.
""Just the greatest people and very concerned about other people, which America needs to start doing more of,"" Beck said.
Gilleylen said she recorded the act of kindness to share with her mother and posted it on Facebook. She said she hopes other teens will see that it is cool to stop and help others.
And though she is proud, Gilleylen said this kind of behavior is nothing new for her son.
""His only complaint was 'it makes me sad that people would rather fly by and honk at a disabled person rather than to lend a hand,"" Gilleylen told the station.
""We need to be caring for each other and helping each other out,"" Seth said. "
Moby apologizes to Natalie Portman after claiming in his new book that they dated,edition.cnn.com,Kendall Trammell,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/25/entertainment/moby-natalie-portman-memoir-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Moby is apologizing for what he wrote about Natalie Portman in his new memoir, ""Then It Fell Apart.""
The 53-year-old musician described an alleged relationship with the Oscar-winning actress , saying he met Portman at one of his concerts when he was 33 and she was 20. He detailed in his memoir that Portman flirted with him in his dressing room. Later, he tried to date her in the early 2000s. ""For a few weeks I had tried to be Natalie's boyfriend, but it hadn't worked out,"" Moby wrote in his book, released this month. ""I thought that I was going to have to tell her that my panic was too egregious for me to be in a real relationship, but one night on the phone she informed me that she'd met somebody else. I was relieved that I'd never have to tell her how damaged I was."" Portman, now 37, denied his claim in an interview with Harper's Bazaar , published Thursday, and said she had actually just turned 18 when the two met. ""I was surprised to hear that he characterized the very short time that I knew him as dating because my recollection is a much older man being creepy with me when I just had graduated high school,"" she said. Read More Earlier this week, Moby reasserted his account and said he had photographic evidence. ""It hurts to be lied about, especially as I've always respected her, and I thought we were friends,"" he wrote on Instagram after hearing Portman's denials . Now, after much outrage online, Moby has made a public apology to Portman .
View this post on Instagram As some time has passed I've realized that many of the criticisms leveled at me regarding my inclusion of Natalie in Then It Fell Apart are very valid. I also fully recognize that it was truly inconsiderate of me to not let her know about her inclusion in the book beforehand, and equally inconsiderate for me to not fully respect her reaction. I have a lot of admiration for Natalie, for her intelligence, creativity, and animal rights activism, and I hate that I might have caused her and her family distress. I tried to treat everyone I included in Then It Fell Apart with dignity and respect, but nonetheless it was truly inconsiderate for me to not let them know before the book was released. So for that I apologize, to Natalie, as well as the other people I wrote about in Then It Fell Apart without telling them beforehand. Also I accept that given the dynamic of our almost 14 year age difference I absolutely should've acted more responsibly and respectfully when Natalie and I first met almost 20 years ago. Moby

San Francisco police chief says raid on journalist's home may have violated California shield law - CNN,us.cnn.com,Amir Vera,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/25/us/san-francisco-police-chief-journalist-raid/index.html,"(CNN) San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott called for an independent investigation Friday into the department's handling of leaked documents and the subsequent raid of a journalist's home.
Freelance journalist Bryan Carmody obtained a confidential police report that included information about the February death of prominent San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi. Carmody, 59, refused to tell authorities how he obtained the documents in April. During a raid of Carmody's home weeks later , officers seized his computers, cameras, phones and notebooks. Jeff Adachi Days after the May 10 raid, Scott said at a news conference there is a criminal investigation into whether Carmody was an ""active participant in the commission of the criminal acts beyond his role with the news media."" Despite those comments, Scott released a statement Friday saying the department is seeking an ""independent, impartial investigation by a separate investigatory body."" Scott said he was concerned ""by a lack of due diligence by department investigators in seeking search warrants and appropriately addressing Mr. Carmody's status as a member of the news media.""

It looks like any other graduation -- except these graduates earned their degrees in prison - CNN,us.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/25/us/prison-education-programs-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) There was pomp and circumstance. There were caps and gowns. Proud family members sat in the audience.
It looked like just another graduation ceremony -- except it took place at the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center in the town of Pacific, where all 10 of the graduates are incarcerated. The graduates received Associate of Arts degrees earlier this week from Washington University in St. Louis, becoming the university's first class of incarcerated graduates. To earn the degree, the men completed 20 courses across disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and mathematics -- all while serving time in prison. Washington University's Prison Education Project is just one of scores of programs across the country that grant liberal arts degrees to incarcerated or formerly incarcerated people. It's a departure from the vocational training typically offered in prisons, which seeks to find employment for inmates in industries such as welding, plumbing and auto repair after they are released. Prison education improves critical thinking Read More Carl Brock (left), Mark Boyd and Torey Adams congratulate a fellow student. For anyone wondering what benefits learning to solve calculus problems or reading Homer's ""The Odyssey"" provide to people in prison, Washington University's graduates will tell them: It's the critical thinking skills. ""Most people end up in prison because of bad decision-making skills,"" Torey Adams, who has been in prison for nearly 13 years for robbery and armed criminal action, said. Over time, Adams said, taking courses such as sociology and archaeology have helped him approach problems differently and have taught him to think things through before making a decision. ""You can't quite see it when it's happening but some way, somehow, it's teaching you to think critically,"" he said. ""I see how being a Wash U student affects me in other areas of my life."" Harvey Galler has been in and out of prison five times -- currently, he's serving a five-year sentence for statutory rape. He's set to be released in about seven months, and he said he sees an education as the only real opportunity for him once he's out of prison. The market for trade jobs is saturated and having a criminal record makes getting a job even harder. ""We've got this mark on us that other people don't have that we've got to compete with, so it's easier for them to get jobs,"" he said. ""If we're able to get this leap ahead with this education, I think that carries a lot more value."" Robert Henke, director of the school's Prison Education Project and a professor of drama and comparative literature, said he sees a strong determination to learn in his incarcerated students. Many have ambitions of eventually earning a Bachelor of Arts degree, or continuing on to even higher education. ""There's this kind of intensity, this sense for them that something's really at stake,"" Henke said. It also reduces the risk of returning to prison Harvey Galler (right) takes in the moment. Research shows that degree-granting prison education programs have a significant effect on reducing recidivism rates, meaning that programs like this make it less likely that former inmates will end up back in prison. And the idea has bipartisan support. ""Ensuring that people are able to participate in liberal arts programs that might empower them to be entrepreneurs or something like that as opposed to a tradesman is actually beneficial to the people themselves and society as a whole, as it helps them better find a job after prison,"" Ames Grawert, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said. Offering people in prison an opportunity to get a liberal arts education is also humanizing, Grawert said, because it recognizes that education isn't a ""one-size-fits-all solution."" Nikhil Pal Singh, the faculty director of a similar program at New York University, echoed that sentiment, saying that a liberal arts education provides people in prison access to more career opportunities. ""It's mistaken to think that basic liberal arts isn't what's needed for the professional world these days,"" Singh said. ""People need to be able to think, they need to be able to write, they need to be able to communicate. These are the kinds of skills you learn in a basic liberal arts college program."" In addition to courses in writing, math and social sciences, NYU's program also offers electives designed to introduce inmates to certain career paths, such as social work or business. NYU's prison education program also offers other opportunities generally available to college students, such as counseling and workshops on financial literacy and leadership development. The liberal arts empower graduates Torey Adams gets a hug at the ceremony. Back at Washington University, the program seems to have ignited a spark in some of its graduates. Adams said he intends to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and eventually start his own business focusing on entertainment hospitality. Galler said that after earning a bachelor's, he hopes to pursue a master's in social work to be a voice that represents people who have been incarcerated. Henke said he doesn't see Washington University's prison education program as a community service project. Instead, it's ""a chance to get out of the ivory tower"" and find talented students in places might otherwise be neglected. ""It's a matter of, 'Let's find really excellent students. Let's go beyond the normal confines. Let's look for excellence in different places, in some surprising places,'"" Henke said. ""It's not social work. It's not pity work."" That attitude showed at the graduation ceremony, where nothing in the program indicated that the graduates were in prison. From the catered food to the leather-bound diplomas, Adams said it made the experience that much more powerful. ""They really did everything they could to make us feel like we graduated in freedom as opposed to graduating in prison,"" he said."

""We write, as the Attorneys General of our jurisdictions, to urge the Department of Education to take prompt action to satisfy its statutory mandate to discharge the student loans of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled or otherwise unemployable,"" the letter says. ""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us."" While the student loans of disabled veterans are required to be discharged by law when they make the request, the letter asks DeVos to make the loan discharges automatic, stating the current requirements to secure loan forgiveness ""may prove insurmountable obstacles to relief for many eligible veterans due to the severe nature of their disabilities."" The letter, which was also signed by attorneys general from three US territories and the District of Columbia, says just 9,000 of 42,000 eligible veterans applied for student loan forgiveness as of April 2018. These dogs cleared explosives in Syria. Now they're adjusting to civilian life ""Forgiving their school loans is the least we can do to recognize their service and sacrifice,"" Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said in a statement about the letter. ""These veterans have suffered permanent and total disability as a direct result of their service to our country. They and their families have sacrificed health, quality of life, and often their dreams for the future. Many have lost their ability to work and pay off any school debt."" Read More In a statement to Reuters Friday, the Department of Education pushed back on the letter, saying, ""While 'automatic discharge' may seem like a simple solution, there are long-term impacts we want all veterans to have the chance to consider before their loans are discharged."" The department told Reuters they wanted veterans to be aware that loan ""discharges might boost their tax bills or make it harder to borrow for education later."" Despite this, the attorneys general touted bipartisan congressional support for the measure as well as backing from multiple veteran advocacy groups. ""We now urge the department to take action to better protect those who once protected the nation,"" they wrote in the letter. ""Our veterans deserve nothing less."""
"Donald Trump and Abe's friendship day: golf, sumo and barbecue - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Kevin Liptak,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/25/politics/donald-trump-japan-sumo-abe/index.html,"Tokyo (CNN) A sunny round of golf, double hamburgers for lunch, ringside seats at a sumo wrestling ""basho"" and a barbeque dinner. Those were the components Sunday of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's latest bid to become President Donald Trump's best global friend.
Whether the hours of male bonding result in wins on trade and security remains to be seen. Before the day even began, there were signs the ardent effort at cultivating the US leader -- started even before he assumed office -- had not paid off in new agreement on North Korea. Still, the lavish displays of camaraderie clearly suited Trump, who was pictured at the Mobara Country Club south of Tokyo smiling broadly in a selfie taken by Abe as they played 16 holes and sat together for both breakfast and lunch (double cheeseburgers made from American beef, according to Japan's foreign ministry). And he relished presenting the gleaming, oversized President's Cup trophy topped with a spread-winged eagle -- which he said he purchased himself -- at a sumo wresting tournament, or basho, in Tokyo. He was seated on a small chair during several bouts, watching with interest as the loin-clothed wrestlers brawled.

Later, Trump and first lady Melania Trump joined Abe and his wife at a barbeque restaurant for grilled chicken, Wagyu beef and vanilla ice cream -- the venue selected with Trump's penchant for red meat in mind. Read More ""The prime minister and I talked lot today about trade and military and various other things. I think we had a very productive day,"" Trump said at the start of the dinner after being handed his first course on a long wooden paddle. It was all meant to maintain the close personal ties Abe has developed with Trump in pursuit of a smooth and beneficial relationship between Washington and Tokyo. But an episode earlier in the day highlighted the challenges that Abe faces in cultivating an ally in Trump, whose deeply personal view of diplomacy has led to ample displays of friendship that sometimes fail to yield results. Trump tweeted -- as he prepared for his round of golf with Abe -- that he doesn't view North Korea's recent short range missile tests as disturbing , a view deeply at odds with his Japanese hosts and in conflict with statements made a day earlier by his national security adviser. Trump plays down North Korea's missile test, putting him at odds with Abe ""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. The Japanese government has said North Korea's recent test of short range missiles violated UN resolutions -- a determination that national security adviser, John Bolton, agreed with in Tokyo on Saturday during a briefing with reporters. Trump, who has chafed in recent weeks at what he views as an overly hawkish approach from Bolton, signaled he was more intent on preserving his relationship with Kim Jong Un. ""I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,"" Trump said in his tweet before taking a swipe at former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. It was a startling start to what was meant to be an ostentatious display of US-Japan unity, orchestrated by a prime minister whose stabs at becoming Trump's closest global ally are bound by few limits of enthusiasm or taste. There were the gold-plated golf clubs he presented the newly-elected Trump during a visit to his Manhattan tower in November 2016. There were the white baseball caps he embroidered with gold -- ""Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Great Again"" -- to wear over a lunch of hamburgers a year later. There was the rumored nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize, an episode still vague in detail but not denied by the Japanese government. And this week, there is the royal pageantry of a state visit , the first for Japan's newly enthroned emperor .

Whether any of that has helped Abe cultivate Trump into anything more than a friend is unclear. What is certain, however, is the example he set early on for his fellow world leaders hoping to make inroads with an untested and unpredictable president. His model of conspicuous flattery has been mimicked by leaders across the globe, though few have carried out the task with as much gusto as the Japanese leader. Their round of golf Sunday was the latest of several outings on the links the men have enjoyed both in Japan and Florida over the past two years. And the invitation to the finals of the spring sumo wrestling tournament were a hotly anticipated event that had left Japanese fans wondering how the brash and unpredictable US leader would fit in the tradition-bound stadium. He presented a four-and-a-half foot tall trophy, weighing between 60 and 70 pounds, to the victor, grimacing happily as he hoisted the cup with the help of two other men. Trump later told reporters he'd paid for the cup himself to avoid questions. ""We bought that beautiful trophy which they'll have hopefully for many hundreds of years,"" he said. The trophy presented, Trump and Abe joined their wives for dinner at a traditional charcoal grill restaurant in Tokyo -- an accommodation for a President not always eager to experience his host country's more exotic offerings (Abe took Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, to what is regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world, Sukiyabashi Jiro). It was an entire day of face time with Trump for Abe, who is eager to diffuse trade tensions while also ensuring the US remains committed to pressuring North Korea on its nuclear weapons and missile programs. The two men will meet more formally on Monday after participating in royal events with the new emperor -- bringing the times they have spoken by phone or met in person north of 40. For Abe, a strategy of cultivating Trump has drawn some criticism and even light mockery. And though Trump himself is not popular in Japan, surveys show most Japanese believe maintaining strong ties to the US is essential, no matter who its president is. Inside Trump's Air Force One: 'It's like being held captive' Whether Abe will succeed in converting his warm friendship into trade and security wins remains unknown. Trump, whose view of Japan as an economic rival dates from its boom period in the 1980s, continues to harp on the $68 billion trade deficit with the United States. He's refused Abe's pleas to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on the country. And he's threatening new auto tariffs if a new bilateral trade agreement can't be struck within six months. Trump tweeted on Sunday that real work on a new trade agreement would have to wait until after parliamentary elections in Japan, due to be held in July. On security matters, too, Japanese officials have felt rattled by Trump. His diplomatic opening with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un caused concern in neighboring Japan, where the threat of missiles is far more potent than on the US mainland. Japan has pressed Trump to maintain pressure on Pyongyang, and has eyed the budding friendship between Trump and Kim warily -- particularly because a number of Japanese citizens were abducted by the North Korean regime decades ago, an issue Abe has pressed Trump to raise with Kim during their summits. According to White House officials, those issues would be under discussion during this week's visit to Japan. But they were expected to play only a supporting role to the main ceremonial events of the week. Trump arrives in Japan eager for flattery and pomp Trump, who was briefed by Abe on some of the visit's details during a visit to Washington last month, has been hotly anticipating the pageantry , according to officials. He told reporters as he was preparing to leave he would be witnessing ""something that hasn't happened in over 200 years,"" though didn't specify what he meant. When Abe told him the sumo wrestling tournament would be bigger than the Super Bowl, Trump couldn't refuse. ""I said, 'I'll be there. If that's the case, I'll be there,'"" Trump said in the Oval Office during Abe's visit. It's a model that other world leaders have utilized to varying levels of success on a President highly susceptible to extravagant displays of flattery. During a first stop abroad in Saudi Arabia two years ago, Trump was treated to a royal sword dancing display and a now-mocked ceremony involving a glowing orb. His relationship with Riyadh appears stronger than ever, despite its concerning human rights record and involvement in the murder of an American journalist . The US' strongest ally has found the flattery route somewhat harder to execute. A state visit to the United Kingdom had been an on-and-off affair for nearly two years after Prime Minister Theresa May came to the White House to extend the invitation. It will finally come to fruition next week -- and the royal welcome from Queen Elizabeth will be met with expected protests. May, meanwhile, has announced she'll resign from office days later."
"Russia must release detained Ukrainian sailors, UN tribunal rules",us.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/25/europe/ukraine-sailors-russia-kerch-strait/index.html,"(CNN) Russian authorities must release the 24 Ukrainian sailors who were captured last year after entering the Kerch Strait, a United Nations maritime tribunal has ruled.
The sailors and their three vessels were taken by the Russian navy last November. The incident marked a major escalation in tensions between the two former Soviet Republics . Ukraine said two of its small gunboats and one tugboat were attacked after entering the Kerch Strait en route to the city of Mariupol. Russia said the Ukrainian ships illegally entered Russia's territorial waters, carrying out dangerous maneuvers. The UN International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea said Russia must release the sailors immediately and urged both nations to not escalate the conflict. ""The actions taken by the Russian Federation could irreparably prejudice the rights claimed by Ukraine to the immunity of its naval vessels and their servicemen,"" said Jin-Hyun Paik, the tribunal's president. Read More Ukraine says Russia opened fire on its naval vessels, seized them Ukraine has asked for the sailors' release, but Russia has not yet taken notice of the country's requests or attended public hearings on the case, the tribunal said. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Olena Zerkal said she expects Russian authorities to comply with the tribunal's order. ""The order of the Tribunal is a clear signal for Russia that it cannot violate international law with impunity,"" she said, according to Ukrainian state-run news agency Ukrinform. Russian officials did not attend the tribunal's hearing and only sent a note through the Russian Embassy in Germany saying the country does not believe the tribunal has jurisdiction to review the incident, Russian state-run news agency TASS reported. The Kerch Strait -- a shallow, narrow stretch of water just 2 to 3 miles wide at one point -- connects the Azov Sea with the Black Sea and runs between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia. It is an important economic lifeline for Ukraine, as it allows its ships to access the Black Sea. It's also the closest point of access for Russia to Crimea, a peninsula Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A Russian-built bridge over the Kerch Strait opened last year. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in long-simmering conflict since the annexation of Crimea, and a war with Russian-backed separatists in the country's east has claimed more than 10,000 lives. Russia has also backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.​"

A close-knit partnership with FCA could give a massive boost to Renault's business in North America, where FCA already has a large manufacturing and customer base selling car brands like Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler. Reports cautioned that a deal is not yet final and talks could still fall apart. FCA and Renault declined comment to CNN Business.

Nissan posted a big drop in profits earlier this month, underlining the bumpy road ahead as it tries to move on after Ghosn's arrest and fend off a merger proposal from Renault. The talks between Renault and FCA, however, are focused on the potential for extensive cooperation that goes beyond the companies' existing manufacturing partnership, and could ""include joining large portions of their businesses,"" the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. Adding FCA to the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance could shake up the balance of power within the group in a way that would weaken Japan's Nissan, according to the Financial Times . It's not clear if Nissan, which also builds and sells cars in the United States, was involved in the discussions with FCA, the sources said."

(CNN) If there is one thing that regularly brings our country together, it's our hatred of Washington. Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat or a fake Republican pretending to be one for your job security, odds are you have at times harbored some level of dislike for the nation's capital. But the truth is, if you hate Washington, DC, the thing you actually hate is Washington -- and, most likely, you don't know much about DC.
W. Kamau Bell When I was in town, folks who actually live there -- as in, not the politicians who just work there -- told me they refer to Capitol Hill as Washington and everything else as DC. Hating Washington has been a thing since we decided to put the capital there in 1790: It was too far south for the North and too far north for the South. And because our Founding Fathers didn't want the nation's capital to be under the sway of the state it was located in, they decided it would remain under the rule of the federal government -- which sounds fine, unless you live there. Since Washington isn't in a state, it can't really govern itself. The city does have a delegate in Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, but although she can serve on committees, she cannot vote on final passage of any legislation. This is weird, especially when you consider that DC is the capital of a country whose whole existence is based on self-governance. But as quiet as it's kept, Washington is not just the capital of the United States. It's more like a tale of two cities -- and this Sunday on ""United Shades of America,"" I learn what that's like for the people who just happen to live in the District.

This kid says he felt safer when Barack Obama was President 01:32 Where Washington is a scene that has long been and is still mostly dominated by white men, DC is one of America's great black cities -- so black it's called Chocolate City. (Or at least they used to call it that. Gentrification has some of the people I talked to people calling it ""Milk Chocolate City"" or ""Reese's Pieces City."") DC has had decades of black leadership. And no matter who is in charge over on the Hill, DC is a reliable bright blue dot on the electoral map. It is a city that regularly leads the rest of the country on lefty issues like gun control , marriage equality , and l egalization of marijuana . Or at least it tries to lead the nation. Since DC isn't a part of a state or its own state, when the District decides to vote for something like legalized marijuana or banning handguns, the federal government often steps in and says not so fast. As one of the guests on the show, Howard University professor Dr. Greg Carr tells me on Sunday's episode, ""DC has more in common with Guam and Puerto Rico . It's an occupied territory."" W. Kamau Bell: Hmong-Americans redefined patriotism before my eyes Sit with that for a little bit in the so-called land of the free. Many of the DC residents I talked to discussed how their sense of occupation is connected to race. During the Civil War and Reconstruction, more than 25,000 formerly enslaved Africans moved to town. Back then, DC was mostly pro-Union, and it had a burgeoning infrastructure of black education, small businesses and churches that were centers for social justice. But while DC residents empowered themselves locally, it's always been an uphill battle with the federal government. They weren't even allowed to vote in the presidential election until 1961, the same year we first put a man in space. My goal this episode was to talk to as many people off the Hill as I could to get a feel for the real DC. I started at one of my favorite spots in the city, Calabash Tea & Cafe, which is owned by my friend Sunyatta Amen. It's right around the corner from Howard University, so it's a regular hangout for students and professors. That's where I met Professor Carr, and it was the first of many times that week that I heard about the man DC calls ""The Mayor For Life,"" Marion Barry .

April Ryan describes the day she asked President Trump if he is racist 00:52 He wasn't actually the mayor for life, but he was DC's mayor multiple times across many years with a break in the middle. That break is why I'm guessing that, for many people who may only have heard the story of him getting caught smoking crack, he's just the punchline to a joke. But what's less known is that he's also a hero to the city. In the 1960s he was a civil rights leader who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. In the 1970s he an architect of the Home Rule Act, which meant there could actually be a mayor in DC. As mayor, he got more black police officers on the force and launched the Summer Youth Program, which gave many DC residents their very first jobs. After tea, I went to Lee's Flower and Card Shop, a community hub that has the laughter and conversation of a barber shop. It's one of DC's oldest black-owned businesses and employs many local residents. When I was there I quipped that there were more black women working there than in the Trump administration. They laughed. I wasn't really kidding. I also talked to people in DC who have seen what is going on over on Capitol Hill and have felt inspired to go to do something about it. That included Naomi Wadler, an 11-year-old girl who spoke at The March For Life rally held after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and activist and mom Kristin Mink, who went viral for confronting the embattled then-head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who seemed to specialize in doing everything in his tenure except protecting the environment.

I was also honored to meet with longtime White House correspondent and Black Twitter doyenne April Ryan. Ryan was born and raised in Baltimore, not that far from DC, and she talked about how she never could have imagined her life as a White House reporter. I even embedded my audition to be the new host of ""Kids Say The Darnedest Things About Our Crumbling Democracy"" in this episode by talking to a bunch of fifth graders at Oyster-Adams Bilingual School. Oyster-Adams is a public school that in addition to the regular stuff teaches English, Spanish and eventually Mandarin to its students. It's a diverse school, and serves a portion of DC's large Salvadoran community. The kids I met with all expressed their love of DC and their fear of what is going on in Washington. Each of them spoke more eloquently and intelligently than anything we have had coming out of the Oval Office since January 17, 2017. But before you think my visit was too one-sided, I also met with Prentice Wolf, a black woman who, as you can tell from her red MAGA hat, ain't with her . She talked of her discomfort with letting people know she's a Trump supporter in such a bright blue city. DC is a beautiful place, a city with a proud black history when it wasn't easy to be black and proud, and a city that has consistently turned out some of the nation's best artists and thought leaders. And many of those people also have a real problem with Washington, because Washington won't let DC be DC: a diverse place with progressive politics and a history of fighting for the voices of the unheard. Many feel like they are being ruled instead of governed, and that is especially clear during the Trump era. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

(CNN) Humanity is facing a global surgery crisis. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery reported in 2015 that there were 5 billion people in the world lacking access to safe and affordable surgical and anesthesia care. Approximately one third of all diseases globally were due to conditions that were treatable through surgical care, based on 2010 disease statistics, and this burden is greater than that of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.
Jacquelyn Corley Eliana E. Kim Intuitively, the prevalence of disease resulting from surgically-treatable conditions makes sense, given that surgical health care is integral to a wide breadth of treatment strategies, including cesarean sections for childbirth, tumor removal in cancer care and operations after injuries. An additional 143 million surgical procedures are needed each year to meet the needs of the world's growing population, according to the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery. How can we possibly tackle these towering challenges? Research published in The World Journal of Surgery suggests that the surgical capabilities of developing nations can be improved through investments in medical equipment and surgical training programs. However, even with this proposed solution, there is a critical component that remains unaddressed. We have a large and robust untapped source of the potential surgical workforce: women. Although women have made great strides in gender parity in medicine in the United States and now make up more than half of all medical school matriculants, much work remains to be done in the field of surgery. As of 2015, only 19.2% of American surgeons were women, and research shows that these female surgeons are less likely to receive career promotions and can expect to earn $1 million less in their careers than their male counterparts. Globally, the picture is even bleaker. According to data from the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, as of 2015 there are only three female surgeons for every 1 million people in low-income countries. Read More More than 20 million children worldwide miss out on the measles vaccine each year Unfortunately, the solution is not as simple as creating more residency training positions. In many countries, unequal childhoods between boys and girls have transformed into inferior educational opportunities for girls. The United Nations estimates 130 million girls ages 6 to 17 are no longer enrolled in school, and 15 million girls of primary school age will never set foot in a classroom. Women in developing countries are a vast untapped resource. US policymakers should use America's significant economic leverage to encourage and support improving educational opportunities for girls, and US private industry should be encouraged to invest in programs in developing nations that empower women. But global efforts to provide funding for education are just a start. We must also build far-reaching awareness campaigns that aim to reverse decades of institutional biases against women, and it starts with powerful women in countries throughout the world, including here in the United States, who can serve as role models to the tens of millions of girls who are told every day that their voices don't matter. Expanding the role of women in developing nations would increase the number of physicians working to improve individual and public health and help those countries more quickly enhance their health systems, especially surgical systems. And in doing so, it would expedite the time needed for developing countries to be capable of independently serving their own populations. Further, adding more women will benefit all patient care in those countries, as many studies demonstrate there are improved health outcomes when female physicians, including surgeons, are involved in treatment. But still more must be done. Those women who are fortunate enough to obtain a quality education and enter medical school and surgical training are often met with many institutional and cultural biases that make it difficult to graduate. For example, even in the wealthiest nations, the attrition rate for female surgeons far outweighs the attrition rate for male surgeons. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

A study published in February in The Lancet identified six leading reasons why women prematurely end their surgical training: ""unavailability of leave,"" ""distinction between valid and invalid reasons for leaving,"" ""poor mental health,"" ""absence of interactions with women in surgical section and other support,"" ""fear of repercussion"" and ""lack of pathways for independent and specific support."" These problems are exacerbated in many developing countries, where women continue to face harsh stigmas about their ""proper"" role in society as caregivers and homemakers. The hurdles identified in the Lancet study should be used to guide institutional policies to create welcoming and supportive programs within medical schools and training departments, both in the United States and around the world. Such policies should encourage female participation and foster accessible avenues for family planning and child rearing. The global surgical burden of disease is immense and cannot be addressed with vaccine campaigns or mission trips. We must build and strengthen health systems, especially surgical systems, which will require a greater emphasis on increasing the number of women in developing nations' workforces, as well as significant institutional changes that allow women to work on equal footing with men."

(CNN) The hardest decision I ever made as a father was leaving the city where my then-5-year-old son lived with his mother (my ex-wife) so I could take a better-paying job. I did so with one singular goal in mind: to be in a better position to pay for his college tuition.
LZ Granderson For five years, we lived apart as my career took me from Atlanta to New York. We talked on the phone, I visited him as often as I could, and he spent parts of his summer vacations with me. Eventually I got to the point professionally where I could live anywhere in the country, so I moved back, bought a house around the corner from my son, and tried to make up for lost time. This week, my son graduated from New York University. As I sat in Yankee Stadium next to my ex-wife during commencement, I thought about what I missed in those five years: the birthdays, those first days of school, and the games I couldn't attend. Of course I showered him with gifts every chance I could, and certainly graduating from college debt-free is a gift not only for him but for generations to come. My great-grandmother was a sharecropper. My grandmother also worked the fields. My mother did not graduate from high school. I became a college graduate with significant student loan debt. And now, through generations of hard work, sacrifice and above all, God's grace, my son has graduated college debt-free. While I am so thankful, I would be lying if I said I didn't question whether it was worth it. Not the money spent for his education, but rather what I gave up to earn it. The speech I couldn't give due to my dad's death ""Presence over presents"" is what my favorite cousin Ingrid used to say during family get-togethers. Her wise words began as a whisper in my head the morning of my son's graduation, and grew progressively louder over the course of the ceremony. By the time we were celebrating at Sylvia's, the historic soul food restaurant nestled in the belly of Harlem, Ingrid's words reverberated in my spirit. Read More In American culture, when we speak of wanting our children to have a better life than we had, it is usually understood through a lens of materialism. Rarely does our notion of a better life translate into ""smaller house, more family time."" And as I watched my son laughing with his siblings, smiling at his grandparents and aunt who made the journey from California, Oklahoma and Michigan to celebrate his achievement, tears escaped my eyes as I fixated on him. Was I afraid of the inevitable changes in both our lives because I had built my world around him? Or was I second-guessing the strategy with which I accomplished my mission? I am not so arrogant as to think I am in a position to tell new parents what to do simply because my son is now a college graduate. But I've spent a significant portion of my career sharing my truth, and I believe this particular lesson may be beneficial for those who find themselves at a similar crossroads. While I do not regret my decision to forgo time with my son in order to pay for his education, I didn't understand the weight of that decision until this week. It was only when I watched my son start a new chapter in his life that I was reminded of the chapters I missed, and the chapters I will never get to read. Stay up to date...

As parents we want to do everything we can to help our children. My greatest struggle as a father has been trying to decipher the perfect ratio between presence and presents.

(CNN) Amid heightened tensions at home, President Donald Trump arrived Saturday in Japan seemingly in need of a vacation from the battles he has chosen to fight with Democrats, the intelligence community and just about everyone else who hasn't agreed to do his bidding.
Samantha Vinograd While his time in Japan promises to be filled with fun and games, it's also an opportunity to make real progress on some key national security issues. Bromancing a US ally such as Japan is important, but the President's perceived dislike for any preparatory work -- and his desire to focus more on feting himself than on difficult policy discussions -- means that his four days in Japan may largely be a waste of Air Force One jet fuel. Instead of berating domestic enemies from abroad, or simply enjoying the pageantry in store, Trump should make the most of his time with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and focus on trade, North Korea and other security issues. Soft spots aside While Abe understands that Trump's got a soft spot for being treated like a king, there are complex issues for the two leaders to work through. As national security adviser John Bolton stated publicly from Japan, North Korea's short-range missile tests earlier this month violate UN Security Council resolutions -- and threaten the region. Kim Jong Un is likely to respond to these latest statements -- and continued US sanctions -- by ratcheting up tensions. Trump should prioritize a coordinated response with Abe if there's time this weekend to squeeze a policy talk in between golf and a sumo wrestling tournament. Read More South Korea -- another US ally -- has been drinking some of the ""Kim Kool-Aid"" and trying to convince Trump to stay engaged in diplomacy with North Korea's leader despite a lack of progress on denuclearization and Kim's increasingly menacing behavior since the Hanoi summit collapsed. Abe, on the other hand, has been consistently focused on ensuring that Trump doesn't go soft on North Korea. Japan is in striking range of Kim's rockets (as are the tens of thousands of American service members and their families stationed in Japan), some of which have flown over Japan before and landed in Japanese territorial waters. Donald Trump shows why he's a stunningly bad deal maker While the Trump administration was reluctant to punish Kim for his recent missile launches, Abe took a hard line and said the tests violated UN resolutions long before Bolton publicly agreed. Abe likely believes that Trump is willing to go easy on Kim to leave the possibility of future diplomatic talks on the table. It's also become clear that Trump is willing to deploy US troops in the Middle East to counter Iran, but he's suspended joint military exercises in the Asia-Pacific region to placate Kim. Kim is a menace in Abe's neighborhood, and the Japanese Prime Minister will be looking for reassurance from Trump that the United States won't sacrifice its alliance with Japan to maintain ties to North Korea. After all, Trump's relationship with Kim has been a short-lived affair, while our close ties to Japan have stretched back 70 years. Enemies' list Friends can have disagreements, and Japan and the United States do disagree on Iran. Japan was against the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and Japan and Iran have maintained good relations . Abe recently welcomed Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and may visit Iran this summer. Trump approves additional deployment to Mideast to counter Iran Japan has halted imports of Iranian oil due to US sanctions, but because of its historically close ties to both Iran and the United States, Abe could try to mediate tensions between the two. Four days is ample time for the President to share sensitive intelligence with Abe regarding the reasoning behind his decisions to deploy more US military assets to the Middle East and the State Department's decision to withdraw personnel from Iraq. If the President decides to consider actual diplomacy with Iran -- which doesn't happen by tweet -- Abe could share some key messages with the Iranians. But that would require Trump briefing him, in full, on his intentions, including whether he's actually willing to talk. Show of force Abe's also probably wary of Trump asking him to foot more of the bill for US forces stationed in Japan. Trump has bullied South Korea regarding its financial contribution to US forces stationed there (and we all know how Trump has criticized our NATO allies for their contributions to that alliance). Abe is likely worried that Trump will publicly call for more of a financial commitmen t from Japan as well despite the fact it is in the US interest for American forces to be stationed there. As evidenced by the recent military drill we did with Australia, South Korea and Japan, threats in Asia-Pacific are rising -- especially from China and North Korea. Now is not the time to issue any threats about diminishing our military alliance with Japan if it doesn't put up more cash. If anything, this visit is a prime opportunity to make a show of force when it comes to our security alliance with Japan. Trading floor During Abe's visit last month to the United States, the White House said that both sides remain committed to working on a bilateral trade agreement. On Saturday, Trump said that he's optimistic about a trade deal. Trump has been on a trade tear since taking office -- including when he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes Japan -- and this time around, he needs a win more than ever. With the US-China trade war hanging over his head and bad economic news associated with the tariffs he has imposed, Trump is likely more open to doing what it takes to clinching a deal with Japan because he's come up empty on all other fronts. But Abe knows he isn't out of the woods when it comes to US tariffs. Trump has put tariffs on Japanese products in the past and has postponed (but not canceled) plans to slap tariffs on Japanese automobiles . Trump fights China on trade, surrenders on human rights If Abe is going to go out on a limb and sign a bilateral pact with Trump, he's probably expecting a tariff truce for the foreseeable future. Abe has his own politics to worry about -- the Japanese auto lobby , among other constituencies, is dismayed by Trump's tariffs. The Prime Minister is focused on winning Trump's approval, probably because he thinks it could mean better security for Japan and some kind of immunity from Trump's tariffs. Doing so will require consistent obsequiousness -- which Abe seems willing to adopt as long as the rewards outweigh the political risks of being Trump's No. 1 fan. Return on investment Abe has already invested a lot of time and effort in his relationship with the US President. In total, Abe has visited and spoken with Trump more than 40 times . It's clear that Abe understands that keeping Trump happy means a lot of face time, flattery (Trump claims Abe nominated him for a Nobel Prize ) and gold-plated gifts. While Abe is pulling out all the stops for Trump, he is also aware that the President faces several domestic battles. With Trump holding progress on key issues such as infrastructure hostage in a long-standing showdown with Democrats over oversight investigations, Abe knows that Trump will be distracted by issues at home. Abe is likely nervous that the focus of this visit will be overshadowed by Trump's domestic fights rather than the mutual challenges that the United States and Japan are supposed to confront together. Abe is on comfortable footing at home for now, but he's probably looking for a return on his investment in Trump when it comes to a stronger security alliance and some guarantees on tariffs. Only 30% of Japanese express faith in Trump -- the third-lowest confidence in an American leader in 13 years. With snap elections potentially on Abe's agenda, a Trump tirade in Japan could hurt the Prime Minister domestically. Abe has likely set a low bar for Trump's visit -- his ultimate aim is to keep him happy so that Trump doesn't sell him out in favor of Kim or hit him with politically motivated tariffs.

Trump's visit to Japan couldn't come at a more crucial time. The stakes are high. His talks with North Korea have stalled, and trade negotiations with China collapsed. This is a prime opportunity for the President to advance a proactive policy agenda with Japan. But without extensive preparation, Trump is more likely to use his time on the trip lapping up the hospitality and celebrating himself."
The two viral outbreaks plaguing our country (opinion),us.cnn.com,Brett Guthrie,05-25-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/25/opinions/measles-vaccine-spread-of-misinformation-guthrie/index.html,"Congressman Brett Guthrie (KY-02) is the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and also serves on the committee's Health Subcommittee. He has represented Kentucky's Second District in Congress since 2008. The views expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) Right now, our country is facing two viral outbreaks. Both are incredibly dangerous and one fuels the spread of the other. The first: More than 800 cases of measles have been confirmed in the United States this year. The second? A plague of misinformation.
While measles was once common, the disease was declared eliminated in the US in 2000 thanks to the widespread use of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Today, our country is seeing a resurgence more than 55 years after the measles vaccine was first developed in 1963 . Most people no longer remember the dangers of this infectious disease, which can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, and death. Sadly, we're now being reminded of the true toll that measles can take. And while it can affect people of all ages, it's particularly dangerous for babies and young children. One or two in 1,000 children who contract measles will die. Contagious diseases spread quickly -- and so does misinformation. There is plenty of ""fake news"" circulating about measles and the MMR vaccine. Some erroneously believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism, even though vaccine safety experts say there is no link between the two . Others have been led to believe the vaccine contains ingredients that violate their religious beliefs, although religious authorities have ruled they do not violate Jewish, Islamic or Catholic law. That's why, as the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I helped lead an oversight hearing earlier this year on the current measles outbreak, which has affected my home state of Kentucky, and the safety of vaccines. Experts from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) answered our questions on the contagious nature of measles, the safety of the MMR vaccine, strategies to prevent the further spread of the disease, and the role of misinformation in the latest outbreak. Measles cases are up nearly 300% from last year. This is a global crisis At our hearing, I made it a point to specifically ask about the safety of the MMR vaccine, as many parents have expressed their concerns to me. The answer was, unequivocally, that the MMR vaccine is safe for healthy children. Just a few weeks ago, yet another study -- one that looked at data from more than 650,000 children -- found the MMR vaccine creates no increased risk of autism . Parents who are worried about the safety of the vaccine should consult their pediatricians to alleviate any concerns. The CDC and state health departments also offer resources for parents looking to find information about the safety of vaccines. Read More During the hearing, we also learned from experts about the importance of ""herd immunity,"" which is achieved when 93-95% of a community are vaccinated, thereby protecting the remaining few like newborns or people with weakened immune systems who can't get the shot. Vaccination rates across the United States can vary greatly, and many communities in the US have lost that precious herd immunity status. As a parent, I certainly understand the fear that many parents have regarding the safety of their children. I can appreciate why parents might be wary of the government requiring vaccinations. But the facts are clear: the MMR vaccine is effective, and it eradicated measles in 2000. Just last month, Trump weighed in on the measles outbreak and said , ""They have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important. This is really going around now. They have to get their shots."" Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .
Let's remember that before the measles vaccination, an estimated 3 to 4 million people were infected each year in the US, and when the vaccine was developed, parents were thrilled to be able to protect their kids from this disease. While many of us have forgotten the toll that measles can take, the dangers of this disease are very real. I urge parents to get the right information and vaccinate their children."
Poland rocked by documentary exposing church abuse - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Antonia Mortensen,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/poland-catholic-church-abuse-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""Father, I wanted to look you in the eye ... I wanted to ask you why?"" demands Anna Misiewicz as she confronts the parish priest she says abused her when she was just 7 and 8 years old.
""You touched me where you were not supposed to, my private parts,"" Misiewicz says, matter-of-factly, telling him that his actions ""really scarred my adult life deeply."" ""I still have nightmares ... I am unable to sleep at night,"" she tells her alleged abuser. ""I still carry it inside me."" The elderly man she is addressing exhales and shifts in his orange-and-brown-striped chair, as a religious service plays out on a TV nearby, in a home for retired priests in Kielce, central Poland. The priest, identified only as Father Jan A., has never been charged with abuse. He pauses briefly, before saying: ""I should never have done it, I should not have touched or kissed you ... I know I shouldn't have."" Read More ""I regret it profoundly,"" he says, insisting that he has reformed in the three decades since the alleged episode detailed by Misiewicz. ""It was the devil who took his toll."" The pair's troubling meeting was captured on secretly filmed footage that is at the heart of ""Tell No One,"" a new documentary that has sent shockwaves through the Polish Catholic Church and wider society in the deeply religious nation. Since its release on YouTube on May 11 the film, which details decades of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in Poland and shows victims confronting their alleged abusers, has been viewed more than 20 million times. 'Erosion' of Catholic Church The Catholic Church -- and its priests -- enjoys a revered status and wields serious influence in Poland, where more than 90% of the country's population is registered as Catholic. The Church has long held powerful ties to politics; together with the late Polish Pope John Paul II, it is widely hailed for its opposition to the Communist regime that collapsed in 1989. Marcin Zaborowski, political analyst at Visegrad Insight, told CNN the Catholic Church has been ""fundamental"" to Polish society. ""The Church is part and parcel of Polish politics,"" he said. ""The current government will find it difficult to distance itself from the Catholic Church,"" Zaborowski added. Only a week before the film was released, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the conservative ruling Law and Justice Party, said: ""Anyone who raises his hand against the church, wants to destroy it, raises his hand against Poland."" After seeing the documentary, he clarified his remarks at a rally, saying: ""That does not mean that we support or tolerate pathology in the Church."" But Zaborowski said the film ""could be a game changer,"" adding that it had ""started the erosion of the position of the Catholic Church in Poland."" The case that's created the biggest outcry since the film's publication is that of Father Franciszek Cybula, the priest of Lech Walesa, leader of anti-Communist movement Solidarity in the 1980s. Confronted on the doorstep of a small, white house in Gowidlino, a village in northern Poland, Cybula is accused of abusing a 12-year-old boy, decades earlier. Cybula, who is unaware he is being filmed, admits he touched the boy in a sexual manner but tries to downplay his actions. ""There was a moment of caressing and then we went back to our daily business,"" he says, arguing that ""it never exceeded any inappropriateness,"" and suggesting that the pair had ""fondled"" each other mutually. Cybula died before the documentary finished production. Poland's prosecutor general has issued an investigation into the alleged crimes detailed in the film. ""Tell No One"" director Tomasz Sekielski told CNN he felt compelled to bring the sexual abuse to public attention after meeting several victims during his career as a journalist. ""The horror of their stories stayed with me, and I knew that I wanted to do something more on the subject; that's why my brother and I decided to make the film."" Alleged abuse carried out by the priest of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, pictured, has caused an outcry in Poland. Taboo subject in Poland It was difficult to find traditional investors willing to back the film because of its polarizing subject, Sekielski said. Ultimately, he and his brother raised more than $100,000 to shoot the documentary via crowdfunding websites. Sekielski says the response to it has far exceeded their expectations: ""This film has been like a shock to Polish society and has managed to create real social awareness of a subject that has been very taboo in Poland."" Sekielski says he does not know if Pope Francis has seen the film, which is available online with Spanish and English subtitles. When CNN asked the Vatican if they had a comment on the film, they said they ""would look into it."" In response to the film, the Vatican's ambassador to Poland, Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio, told CNN: ""The Pope is very concerned, and we express sympathy and solidarity."" The Vatican has announced plans to send Malta's Archbishop Charles Scicluna, the Vatican's top sex crimes investigator, to Poland on June 13 to host a ""study day"" on abuse for Polish bishops on how to protect minors from abuse within the Church. Archbishop Stanisław Gądecki, president of the Polish Bishops' Conference, said he had been ""deeply moved and saddened"" by the film. ""On behalf of the entire Bishops' Conference, I would like all the victims to accept my sincere apologies; I realize that nothing can compensate them for the harm they have suffered,"" he said in a statement, adding that the film would ""definitely contribute to an even more severe condemnation of pedophilia, for which there can be no place in the Church."" Following the film's release, the Polish government proposed raising the maximum prison sentence for convicted pedophiles to 30 years. But that's insufficient, says Polish foundation Have No Fear, which helps victims of child abuse committed by the Catholic Church. The organization worked with the Sekielski brothers, helping to find victims who were willing to participate in the film. Anna Frankowska, a board member of the organization, told CNN it had been ""completely overwhelmed"" by the reaction to the film: ""It has generated a tsunami of calls from new victims to our charity."" Since the film's release more than 100 new cases have come to light, according to the charity. ""On one hand it is wonderful, but on the other it is overwhelming as we do not have the resources to process all the cases,"" said Frankowska. ""The government increase in jail time is not an effective tool,"" she said, arguing that ""it is more symbolic than anything, the courts need to actually start implementing these harsh sentences."" Marek Lisinski as a teenager around the time he was allegedly abused by his local parish priest. 'Gesture gave me huge hope' In February, representatives from Have No Fear delivered a report to Pope Francis in Rome, accusing 26 bishops in the Polish Catholic Church of concealing the perpetrators of sexual abuse of minors. Marek Lisinski, a co-founder of Have No Fear, was one of those who met the Pontiff. ""The Pope took my hand in his hands and looked at me and ... grew sad. It had a huge impact on me. Then ... he kissed my hand. That gesture gave me huge hope,"" Lisinski said. An abuse survivor himself, Lisinski told CNN how he had been groomed by a young vicar when he was a 13-year-old altar boy living in Poniatowo, in central Poland. ""It was in 1981 ... You must remember these were totally different times in Poland, there was a shortage of almost everything. But he had everything, sweets, food. It's important to understand what it meant in those days to get a sweet from someone,"" he said, explaining that ""times were tough."" ""He followed me into the toilet one day and started doing bad things to me,"" Lisinski said. When he tried to tell his mother about the abuse -- on the same day that martial law was declared, in December 1981 -- he said she was ""more worried about the political situation in Poland rather than me."" Lisinski said the sexual abuse ""really hurt my life"" and led him to become an alcoholic. Now sober, he now dedicates his time to helping other victims of abuse. Have No Fear says it has yet to hear back from the Vatican about the report; its members are extremely frustrated at the way the Polish Catholic Church is dealing with what they see as a huge crisis in the country. In March, Poland's Catholic Church released a long-awaited report on the numbers of sexual abuse cases there in the past 28 years -- the first time it has presented data on the scale of the problem. According to data compiled by the church's statistics institute and child protection center, 382 clergymen were reported for sexual abuse involving 625 minors between January 1990 and June 2018. Of these 58.4% were male, while 41.6% were female; more than half of the victims were under the age of 15, the report said. Have No Fear says the numbers do not tell the whole story; they want access to church documents detailing the nature of the abuse, and to find out what -- if any -- punishments the alleged abusers faced. In the absence of those records, the accounts of victims like Anna Misiewicz, who are willing to speak up about the abuse they say they faced as children, are all-important in helping to raise awareness of the issue. Standing outside the pretty wooden church she attended as a child, Misiewicz tells the filmmakers about the day of her first communion, pointing out where she stood alongside her alleged abuser for a photograph to mark the occasion. Dressed all in white, with a lace headdress in her hair and a half-smile on her face, there is little trace of the turmoil she was going through but, she says, ""I was under great stress because ... as a little girl I feared the photo would show that there was 'something between us,' as teenagers say now."" ""He destroyed my life,"" Misiewicz says of her alleged abuser. ""For me he does not even deserve to be called a priest."""
Trump dances with danger in Middle East by deploying aircraft carrier and a 'peace plan',edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Tamara Qiblawi,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/middleeast/trump-middle-east-iran-analysis-trump-intl/index.html,"(CNN) In the Persian Gulf, a US aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln , lurks off the Iranian coast, sending out a message of aggression. Meanwhile, in the Levant, the administration of US President Donald Trump starts to roll out his version of a widely anticipated peace plan for the Israelis and the Palestinians.
The US appears to be banging war drums at the same time it's, conversely and perhaps superficially, extending an olive branch just a few hundred miles away. But the events in the Levant and the Persian Gulf could be two sides of the same coin. Both are aimed at strong-arming parties into accepting the tough demands of America and its allies, and both could propel decades-long tensions toward a new, and possibly more violent, chapter in the region's history. The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge, right, the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, and the Spanish navy Alvaro de Bazan-class frigate ESPS Méndez Núñez transit the Strait of Gibraltar, entering the Mediterranean Sea. Charting dangerous waters in the Persian Gulf For long-time experts in the region, recent events in the Persian Gulf tread into dangerous territory. The escalation of tensions between Iran and the US, as well as its allies, could easily spiral out of control. All the while, Trump has intensified his bid to get Iran to negotiate. Read More When Trump first pulled out of the landmark nuclear accords in 2018, he slammed it as a ""bad deal"" and tightened the noose on Iran's economy with several rounds of sanctions. Iran's government responded with what experts dub ""strategic patience."" The Islamic Republic's diplomats appealed to Europe for support in keeping the nuclear deal afloat, as the country, by all accounts, continued to abide by its end of the bargain. But on May 8, exactly a year after Trump's pull-out from the deal, the tide changed. In Tehran, specter of war met with more defiance than fear In April, Trump ratcheted up pressure on Iran, removing oil export exemptions that acted as a lifeline for sanctions-ridden Tehran, and announcing that he intended to deploy the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region. The aircraft carrier began to make its way to the Persian Gulf on May 5. Rather than absorb the shocks, Iran retaliated. It announced a part-suspension of its commitment to the nuclear accord, and said it would increase uranium enrichment, a potential step to creating a nuclear weapon. And a series of flashpoints in the region began to flare up. An Iranian woman walks past a currency exchange shop in the capital Tehran, Iranians, where locals are hard hit by punishing US economic sanctions ""The main premise of the maximum pressure campaign has been economic coercion,"" said Crisis Group's Iran analyst, Naysan Rafati. ""By issuing close to 1,000 sanctions designations, by putting a 'foreign terror organization' tag on the [elite wing of Iran's military] Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, by cutting Iran's oil's exports ... (the US hoped) that Iran would come back to the table. ""But what we've definitely seen is a response from Iran on the nuclear front ... and the risk has always been that there would be a response on the regional front,"" said Rafati. ""It's as if (the Iranians) suggest that 'you can put us under significant economic duress, but we also have cards to play.'"" Iran tensions spotlight Trump's questionable credibility It is unclear if Iran has activated its regional network of sympathetic armed groups to act on its behalf. But in the days that followed the May 8th announcement, the UAE reported a sabotage attack on four oil tankers off the coast of the strategic port city of Fujairah -- Iran has denied any involvement. Iran-backed Yemen rebels mounted a first-ever attack on a Saudi oil pipeline , and a Katyusha rocket was launched into Baghdad's Green Zone, where the US embassy is. ""We've certainly had a series of escalations,"" said Rafati. ""Clearly, Iran's 'strategic patience' is giving way to some degree of strategic impatience."" Iran refuses Trump's offer of talks unless US shows 'respect' And there's no end in sight. Tehran has rebuffed Trump's overtures to talk. The economy has buckled under incessant sanctions and political discontent is rising, putting pressure on Tehran to act. The Iranian government has warned that it should not be tested, while assuring the public that it does not expect war. In countering Tehran's rhetoric, the US largely mirrored it. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that the US does not want war, while Trump threatened to bring the ""official end to Iran"" in case of conflict. US narrative on Iran questioned as allies call for 'restraint' ""Even if the (the US) aim is not to initiate some sort of armed conflict, the higher you raise tensions the more chance for a mistake, for something to happen that will spiral out of control really fast,"" said former US Secretary of the Navy and former ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ray Mabus. ""I think we're significantly closer (to war), certainly than we were when we negotiated the (nuclear) treaty which from all appearances was working,"" said Mabus. ""Now we have a president that pulled us out of it and said 'I can make a better deal.' Well, he hasn't. In fact, he's made things much worse."" 'The deal of the century' Many in the region believed the days and weeks that followed the May 8 announcement to be critical. The UAE sabotage attacks sounded alarm bells in a country that consistently champions its political stability and safety. The Saudi pipeline attacks sent oil prices upward. But amid the erratic developments in the Persian Gulf, Trump's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner unfurled the first part of his long-awaited peace plan for the Israelis and the Palestinians. The events appeared out of sync, but the underlying messages were similar. Though only the economic dimension of the so-called peace plan has been unveiled, Kushner has signaled that the Palestinians should make political concessions. ""People are letting their grandfather's conflict destroy their children's futures. This will present an exciting, realistic and viable pathway forward that does not currently exist,"" Kushner told CNN in a statement. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner, US President's daughter Ivanka Trump, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Israel's President Reuven Rivlin attend the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018. The senior administration official said the plan would discuss four major components: infrastructure, industry, empowering and investing in people and governance reforms. The initiative comes after Trump strengthened Israel's hand on some final-status issues such as the status of Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. He has recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and withdrawn vital funds for Palestinian refugees. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also vowed to annex West Bank settlements, illegal according to international law. The promise, made in the closing days of an election campaign, received no objection from the US. The Palestinians have already spurned the Kushner proposal, which centers on an economic ""workshop"" in the Bahraini capital to encourage investment in the West Bank, Gaza, and the region. Iran stance is straight from Trump's North Korea playbook ""The Trump administration's vision is being implemented on the ground with their decisions and positions on Jerusalem, settlements and refugees, among others,"" Palestine Liberation Organization Secretary General Saeb Erekat said in a statement. Erekat said the solution to conflict ""is not about improving living conditions under occupation but about reaching Palestine's full potential by ending the Israeli occupation."" To some, the Trump administration's sidelining of the Palestinian leadership spells the end of the two-state solution, long favored by the international community, where an independent Palestinian state would be established alongside Israel. ""My hope is that (Kushner's proposal) leads to a situation where the political deal is not released, thereby not leading to this vicious cycle where we end up with further Israeli annexations of the West Bank, the further destabilization of the Palestinian Authority, and an end to the possibility of the two-state solution,"" said Hady Amr, a former deputy special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under former President Barack Obama's administration. ""As unlikely as the two-state solution is, I still think it's a more likely outcome than any other in the coming decade."" With both the Iranians and the Palestinians, Trump appears to try to extract major political concessions with promises of vast economic riches. ""(Trump) is using a very big stick with a very small carrot,"" said Iran expert Rafati. In both these cases, the moves are seen as a bid to chip away at sovereignty, and it is being met with considerable resistance. But while the counter-forces have so far rendered the political situation inert, it could soon take on new dimensions that policy-makers may be ill-equipped to tackle."
"Amanda Eller, missing Maui hiker, survived on berries, river water and smarts for 17 days in Hawaii forest",edition.cnn.com,"Steve Almasy, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/hawaii-hiker-survived-17-days-in-forest/index.html,"(CNN) It had been more than two weeks that she had been lost in a thick Hawaiian forest, and Amanda Eller was at an end.
The 35-year-old doctor of physical therapy was at a place where she could no longer go forward because of the terrain. With a fractured leg and no shoes, she sure wasn't going to go back. The area she found herself in had little to no food. She stayed there for a day and a half and, as Eller's mother and a friend told reporters Saturday as they detailed the rescued woman's ordeal, she began to resign herself to the dire possibility that she might die there. ""It came down to life and death -- and I had to choose. I chose life. I wasn't going to take the easy way out. Even though that meant more suffering in me for myself,"" Eller told CNN affiliate KHON . A Maui yoga instructor who vanished weeks ago after a hike has been found She tried to keep her spirits up. She had conquered so much to get to this point. Read More She picked berries and guava to eat when she could find them. She drank water only when it was clear enough and looked like it wouldn't make her sicker. She took care of a bum knee and nursed sunburn so bad it got infected. She walked without her shoes, which had been swept away in a flash flood when she was trying to dry them out. She listened for the helicopters. They had come before, several times and she had waved as best she could, but they flew away. On Friday, Javier Cantellops, a friend of Eller's, went up with other searchers in a rented helicopter to look for a place where they could access the woods where Cantellops thought Eller might be headed. They weren't even really looking for her per se, but ways to get dropped off near points of where they might pick up her trail. Still Cantellops and the others kept scanning the woods below, looking for movement, for a sign of life. And suddenly, there she was. She popped out into a ravine and they landed nearby. She had to wait for them as they cut a path to her, but after 17 days a few more minutes were worth it. Eller was in a Maui hospital Saturday, surprising her doctor. Yes, she's lost 15 pounds, has a broken left tibia and they are treating her infections, but Eller looks ""amazing."" ""What she's been through, you'd never be able to tell,"" Dr. Zora Bulatovic said. Eller had been released from the hospital by Saturday evening, according to a news release from the hospital. Julia Eller speaks about her daughter's rescue during a news conference in Maui on Saturday. Eller's mom, Julia, beamed during an earlier hospital news conference, telling reporters her daughter -- the sweetest and most caring person, her mother said -- had gone for a 3-mile walk May 8 on a different path than usual when she stopped to meditate then nap and then when she woke up couldn't figure out how to get back to her car. She hadn't brought her phone, Julia Eller said as she recounted what her daughter has told her about the ordeal, and she was lost in the woods where, as mom said, ""Everything looks the same. It would be very easy to get misguided."" Julia Eller said she had her moments of despair as to whether her daughter would be found but she felt in her heart that Amanda was alive. ""She's a trouper, man; she's a real warrior,"" her mom said. ""And I had no doubt that if anybody could make it through it, it was her."" Sarah Haynes, a friend of Eller's boyfriend, told the media, that Amanda got to a place where she started to think she was going to die. ""She fought, fought, fought and then she said, 'OK, whatever you need from me.' Like, dear world, whatever this journey is for me, I'm willing to accept it,"" Haynes said. Haynes said the helicopter that Cantellops discovered Eller from was paid for with some of the $75,000 from a GoFundMe campaign. Haynes confirmed to CNN Sunday that Eller had been released from the hospital and was ""at an undisclosed location with a number of healers and nurses working on her."" ""She's walking on crutches,"" she said. ""She feels great."""

She'd vanished April 23 after leaving Latino Youth High School to pick up her 3-year-old at day care. ""I believe we weren't taken seriously because we're undocumented,"" her widower, Yovani Lopez, told CNN. Though officials stand by how they conducted the case, points of concern raised by Ochoa-Lopez's loved ones -- from the initial police investigation to protocols at the hospital where her baby remains on life support -- reflect the way authorities sometimes treat crime victims who are undocumented or impoverished, said community leaders helping Ochoa-Lopez's family and immigrant rights activists, who also confirmed her immigration status. Chicago officials applaud judge's OK of consent agreement to bring more police reform Justice Department investigators in 2017 described as ""striking"" the consistency with which residents of Chicago's ""challenged communities ... expressed concern about the lack of respect in their interactions with police, whether those interactions come when they are targets of police activity or when they or their family members are the victims of crime."" Latino residents also noted a sense of ""guilt by association."" Read More ""This may not be how CPD intends policing to be conducted or perceived in these neighborhoods, but these experiences impact individual dignity and residents' willingness to work with law enforcement, and should not be ignored,"" noted the report by DOJ's Civil Rights Division , which helped form the basis of a federal consent decree that's guiding efforts to change police use-of-force and impartial policing practices. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson repeatedly has defended how his detectives dealt with the Ochoa-Lopez case, an extraordinary and shocking one that began with a report of a missing woman. Investigations like this one, he's said, don't often include the kind of dramatic revelations and gotcha moments seen on TV. ""Remember, this is real life,"" he said. ""This isn't '48 Hours.' It doesn't work like that. It takes time."" Chicago police are also inundated with serious crimes, including gang violence and hundreds of homicides a year, said Maria ""Maki"" Haberfeld, a professor of police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. That may have played a role in their decision-making, she said, adding that it does not appear the law enforcement response in this case was related to the family's immigration status. ""Unless there is something very tangible, police forces like Chicago that are overwhelmed ... tend to react in a slower mode,"" Haberfeld said, ""especially when it comes to domestic situations when a husband or wife disappears. It takes time before the machine kicks in a higher responsive mode because it happens on a daily basis, and very frequently it has nothing to do with serious crime but rather some sort of disagreement within the household."" Ochoa-Lopez's relatives hold a news conference in mid-May seeking information about her disappearance. As days dragged on after Ochoa-Lopez vanished, police repeatedly questioned Lopez about his wife's whereabouts and made him take a lie detector test, he recalled. Meantime, activists organized search parties, plastered missing-person fliers around the city's West Side and gathered anonymous tips. ""This illustrates how important it is, if we're going to protect victims and fight crime in our communities, for state and local law enforcement to build relationships with immigrants and limited-English-proficient communities and to take these cases seriously, just like they do any other case,"" said Leslye E. Orloff, director of the National Immigrant Women's Advocacy Project at American University Washington College of Law. Indeed, not long after members of Ochoa-Lopez's community turned over their tips to police, the case's big break emerged. Police superintendent: Investigators 'worked tirelessly' The break came May 7, when a friend of Ochoa-Lopez told detectives about the victim's Facebook exchanges with Clarisa Figueroa, 46, who now faces murder charges in the case; her 24-year-old daughter, Desiree, and another suspect also face charges, police said. Before police learned that the victim had gone to Figueroa's home the day she disappeared, they'd seemed to doubt that a random crime had been committed, said activists who helped Ochoa-Lopez's relatives spread the word of her disappearance.

Police: Suspects plotted murder of pregnant teen for weeks 02:15 ""They were downplaying the case because they had doubts about it,"" said Julie Contreras of the Latino civil rights organization League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC. ""They were stereotyping the husband as a suspect and using stereotypes like, 'We think she ran off with a boyfriend.' It was just disgusting."" Yovani Lopez was never publicly identified by police as a suspect. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi last week defended investigators and seemed to expect official scrutiny of the department's actions. ""We will ensure that any complaint filed against the department is investigated independently and thoroughly,"" he said. Guglielmi also acknowledged the ""immense grief and suffering"" of the victim's family, though police officials did not respond when CNN asked whether the case was treated differently because of the family's immigration status. Detectives ""worked tirelessly, following up on leads, interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence"" in the search for Ochoa-Lopez, Johnson said. ""There's going to be anger associated,"" the superintendent told reporters. ""When things of this nature occur, the first thing people do is look, in retrospect, what could we have done to maybe prevent this? I know our detectives do the best they can."" 'We have to get the community involved' Police learned through a tip that Figueroa had visited a Facebook page that helps families in need obtain baby items in order to lure Ochoa-Lopez to her home, said James Murphy, an assistant state's attorney . Figueroa offered the young mother clothes for the baby she was expecting in early May. On the page, Figueroa had pretended she was expecting a child herself. When Ochoa-Lopez visited the home on April 23, Figueroa's daughter, Desiree, distracted the teen as her mother wrapped a cable around Ochoa-Lopez's neck, Murphy said. Desiree peeled the victim's fingers from the under the cable before her mother strangled the young woman to death, he said. Marlen Ochoa-Lopez The elder Figueroa then cut the baby from Ochoa-Lopez's womb, Murphy said. She later called 911 and said she'd just delivered a baby that wasn't breathing. The woman and infant were hospitalized at Advocate Christ Medical Center, though Figueroa showed no signs that might have suggested she had just given birth, according to the prosecutor. Ochoa-Lopez's husband reported her missing on April 24, police said. ""I told them the truth the whole time,"" Lopez said of the police. ""We had the problems that all couples have, but there were no big arguments or fights that would cause her to leave. I felt they were against me because I'm Mexican and undocumented."" Members of Ochoa-Lopez's family did not meet with detectives until nearly two weeks after she vanished, said Emma Lozano, pastor of Lincoln United Methodist Church. Lozano attended the meeting, which she said grew tense when some residents began chanting, ""We want Marlen!"" in Spanish. Officers surrounded the residents and threatened to arrest them, according to Lozano, who calmed the situation by urging people to stop chanting. Chicago police did not respond to a request for comment about this claim. After the meeting, the pastor did not harbor hope about the official search for Ochoa-Lopez, she said. ""This is not going to go well for us,"" she said. ""We have to get the community involved."" Detective: 'I understand the anger the family is going through' On May 4, activists took to the streets of the West Side, handing out fliers with Ochoa-Lopez's photo and a number to call with anonymous tips, Lozano said. The next day, they organized a search party. ""We knocked on doors, looked in dumpsters, went into abandoned homes,"" said Cecilia Garcia, a student pastor. ""Some detectives said our search as a community was a waste of time,"" said Jacobita Cortes, a pastor at Adalberto Memorial United Methodist Church. ""They would say, 'Marlen is very young, and she must have run off with someone or is staying with a girlfriend,'"" Cortes said. ""We told them, 'That can't be. She's about to give birth, and she has another child, and she's a good mother.'"" Chicago police did not respond to CNN's request for comment about Cortes' remarks. Marlen Ochoa-Lopez's father, Arnulfo Ochoa, gets a surprise hug Wednesday from his 13-year-old son, Oscar, while visiting a mural of his slain daughter painted by Milton Coronado in Chicago. Ochoa-Lopez's relatives and the activists believe police initially failed to dedicate enough attention to the disappearance because of the family's immigrant background, they said. Then, as the community effort ramped up -- and Spanish-speaking police officers or interpreters were rarely available -- the activists became the main conduits to detectives, they said. ""We were doing to the investigation,"" Lozano said. Her daughter, Sara Walker, a student pastor, added, ""The police were not moving with any sense of urgency."" Indeed, a translator was assigned to the case at all times, Brendan Deenihan, deputy chief of detectives, told reporters. Detectives were in contact with the missing woman's family and friends from April 25 to May 7, trying to locate her and her car, he said. ""I understand the anger the family is going through,"" Deenihan said. Investigators meet with reticent residents Soon, local residents began calling in anonymous tips to the numbers provided on the fliers the activists distributed. Lozano fielded many of the calls. One anonymous caller said Ochoa-Lopez had entered the one-story brick house on the city's Southwest Side the day she disappeared, Lozano and Walker said. Ochoa-Lopez's car was later found near that home, where Figueroa lived. Her body was found in a garbage can behind the home on May 14. Investigators to check hospital's actions in case of Marlen Ochoa-Lopez's baby Another caller said a middle-aged woman in the home had run out onto the street, claiming she had given birth but her baby was not breathing. The tipster said the woman did not previously appear to be pregnant. The activists gave officers their leads, many from callers who were undocumented and afraid to contact the police directly, Lozano said. Sill, police ""said they were doing everything they could and following up leads,"" Lozano recalled one sergeant telling her. ""I said, 'What leads do you have?' And she read back to me the leads that I had called in. I said, 'How about her phone records?' Marlen's phone was still being used after she disappeared. They said, 'You can't do that. You have to get warrants, and all this takes time.'"" Contreras, of LULAC, arranged a meeting in the basement of a home between detectives and about nine residents who were reluctant to talk to the police because of their immigration status, she said. Immigration advocates have said the Trump administration's hardline enforcement has heightened undocumented immigrants' reluctance to work with law enforcement. But Chicago is a so-called sanctuary city, a broad term applied to jurisdictions with policies that limit police cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions. Cities, counties and some states have a range of informal policies and laws to this effect. ""I gave each resident a lecture and spoke with each one to say, 'Today, it was Marlen's family, and tomorrow it could be your family, and imagine if somebody said they didn't want to help,"" she said. Relatives want to know if rules were skirted On May 7, armed with the tip about Ochoa-Lopez's Facebook exchanges with Figueroa, detectives visited the defendant's home. The lead was the product of Contreras and Lozano's community outreach, they said. A police spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about this. Desiree Figueroa told detectives her mother was in the hospital for problems with her legs. Then, she revealed that her mother had just delivered a baby, police said. When detectives interviewed the elder Figueroa at the hospital, where she had been admitted after claiming to have given birth, she denied Ochoa-Lopez came to her house April 23 but admitted to meeting her in the past, police said.

Baby struggles for his life after mother's murder 01:46 Suspicious, officers spent the next several days securing subpoenas for hospital records and collecting DNA samples from the baby and Figueroa. They discovered she was not the child's biological mother; the tests showed Lopez was the father. Clarisa and Desiree Figueroa were charged with first-degree murder and aggravated battery of a child younger than 13 years old. Clarisa Figueroa's boyfriend, Piotr Bobak, 40, has been charged with concealing the death of a person and concealing a homicidal death; all were still being held last week without bond, and it wasn't clear whether they had attorneys. A medical examiner determined Ochoa-Lopez died of strangulation. Illinois law requires that physicians and other hospital personnel who suspect child neglect or abuse report their suspicions. Lopez and the activists want to know whether the hospital followed protocols, they told CNN. The Illinois Department of Public Health is investigating Advocate Christ Medical Center, spokeswoman Melaney Arnold confirmed this week. She declined to provide additional information, citing an ongoing probe. A hospital spokesman told CNN this week he could not comment on the case. The state Department of Children and Family Services was not contacted by the hospital until May 9, one day after police found Ochoa-Lopez's car, agency spokesman Jassen Strokosch told CNN. Hospitals are mandated to report to DCFS under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act if there is concern about a child, he said. The Cook County Sheriff's Office ""will consult with DCFS on whether the circumstances of this case required DCFS be notified,"" the agency said in a statement obtained by CNN affiliate WGN. ""If DCFS says they should have been notified, the sheriff's office will conduct an investigation into what happened."" 'The city of Chicago needs to awaken itself' Ochoa-Lopez's baby boy remains in intensive care at the hospital, listed in grave condition and fighting for his life. He is surrounded most of the day by his father, grandparents and other relatives who traveled from Mexico on humanitarian parole for his mother's funeral. Meanwhile, Contreras is drafting a public information request for the Chicago Police Department, citing the community's complaints about the case and demanding all records on the availability of Spanish-speaking officers and interpreters, as well as other policies, training, operations and procedures related to contacts with the Latino community, she said. LULAC plans to file a formal complaint after a reviewing of the records, she said. Mourners embrace on Saturday at Ochoa-Lopez's funeral in Chicago. As loved ones gathered Saturday for Ochoa-Lopez's funeral, they vowed something more: a bill, dubbed Marlen's Law, that would aim to require ""any individual who enters a hospital ... to provide identity through ID and DNA to prove (their identity), if they come in with an infant they say is born in their home,"" Contreras said. ""She is the daughter of our pueblo,"" the activist said, ""and she will be etched forever in the laws."" Addressing the mourners, Contreras, her volume rising, also nodded to the treatment she and others have said they felt the case got from the authorities. ""And the city of Chicago needs to awaken itself,"" she said. ""If there is a place where you are not respected because of your accent, instead of your intelligence, don't accept it. ""Marlen is the example of that. Do not accept it,"" Contreras said. ""She is the seed in the middle of this tragedy that will create miracles."""
"Amanda Eller, missing Maui hiker, survived on berries, river water and smarts for 17 days in Hawaii forest",us.cnn.com,"Steve Almasy, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/hawaii-hiker-survived-17-days-in-forest/index.html,"(CNN) It had been more than two weeks that she had been lost in a thick Hawaiian forest, and Amanda Eller was at an end.
The 35-year-old doctor of physical therapy was at a place where she could no longer go forward because of the terrain. With a fractured leg and no shoes, she sure wasn't going to go back. The area she found herself in had little to no food. She stayed there for a day and a half and, as Eller's mother and a friend told reporters Saturday as they detailed the rescued woman's ordeal, she began to resign herself to the dire possibility that she might die there. ""It came down to life and death -- and I had to choose. I chose life. I wasn't going to take the easy way out. Even though that meant more suffering in me for myself,"" Eller told CNN affiliate KHON . A Maui yoga instructor who vanished weeks ago after a hike has been found She tried to keep her spirits up. She had conquered so much to get to this point. Read More She picked berries and guava to eat when she could find them. She drank water only when it was clear enough and looked like it wouldn't make her sicker. She took care of a bum knee and nursed sunburn so bad it got infected. She walked without her shoes, which had been swept away in a flash flood when she was trying to dry them out. She listened for the helicopters. They had come before, several times and she had waved as best she could, but they flew away. On Friday, Javier Cantellops, a friend of Eller's, went up with other searchers in a rented helicopter to look for a place where they could access the woods where Cantellops thought Eller might be headed. They weren't even really looking for her per se, but ways to get dropped off near points of where they might pick up her trail. Still Cantellops and the others kept scanning the woods below, looking for movement, for a sign of life. And suddenly, there she was. She popped out into a ravine and they landed nearby. She had to wait for them as they cut a path to her, but after 17 days a few more minutes were worth it. Eller was in a Maui hospital Saturday, surprising her doctor. Yes, she's lost 15 pounds, has a broken left tibia and they are treating her infections, but Eller looks ""amazing."" ""What she's been through, you'd never be able to tell,"" Dr. Zora Bulatovic said. Eller had been released from the hospital by Saturday evening, according to a news release from the hospital. Julia Eller speaks about her daughter's rescue during a news conference in Maui on Saturday. Eller's mom, Julia, beamed during an earlier hospital news conference, telling reporters her daughter -- the sweetest and most caring person, her mother said -- had gone for a 3-mile walk May 8 on a different path than usual when she stopped to meditate then nap and then when she woke up couldn't figure out how to get back to her car. She hadn't brought her phone, Julia Eller said as she recounted what her daughter has told her about the ordeal, and she was lost in the woods where, as mom said, ""Everything looks the same. It would be very easy to get misguided."" Julia Eller said she had her moments of despair as to whether her daughter would be found but she felt in her heart that Amanda was alive. ""She's a trouper, man; she's a real warrior,"" her mom said. ""And I had no doubt that if anybody could make it through it, it was her."" Sarah Haynes, a friend of Eller's boyfriend, told the media, that Amanda got to a place where she started to think she was going to die. ""She fought, fought, fought and then she said, 'OK, whatever you need from me.' Like, dear world, whatever this journey is for me, I'm willing to accept it,"" Haynes said. Haynes said the helicopter that Cantellops discovered Eller from was paid for with some of the $75,000 from a GoFundMe campaign. Haynes confirmed to CNN Sunday that Eller had been released from the hospital and was ""at an undisclosed location with a number of healers and nurses working on her."" ""She's walking on crutches,"" she said. ""She feels great."""

The Cook County Sheriff's Office ""will consult with DCFS on whether the circumstances of this case required DCFS be notified,"" the agency said in a statement obtained by CNN affiliate WGN. ""If DCFS says they should have been notified, the sheriff's office will conduct an investigation into what happened."" 'The city of Chicago needs to awaken itself' Ochoa-Lopez's baby boy remains in intensive care at the hospital, listed in grave condition and fighting for his life. He is surrounded most of the day by his father, grandparents and other relatives who traveled from Mexico on humanitarian parole for his mother's funeral. Meanwhile, Contreras is drafting a public information request for the Chicago Police Department, citing the community's complaints about the case and demanding all records on the availability of Spanish-speaking officers and interpreters, as well as other policies, training, operations and procedures related to contacts with the Latino community, she said. LULAC plans to file a formal complaint after a reviewing of the records, she said. Mourners embrace on Saturday at Ochoa-Lopez's funeral in Chicago. As loved ones gathered Saturday for Ochoa-Lopez's funeral, they vowed something more: a bill, dubbed Marlen's Law, that would aim to require ""any individual who enters a hospital ... to provide identity through ID and DNA to prove (their identity), if they come in with an infant they say is born in their home,"" Contreras said. ""She is the daughter of our pueblo,"" the activist said, ""and she will be etched forever in the laws."" Addressing the mourners, Contreras, her volume rising, also nodded to the treatment she and others have said they felt the case got from the authorities. ""And the city of Chicago needs to awaken itself,"" she said. ""If there is a place where you are not respected because of your accent, instead of your intelligence, don't accept it. ""Marlen is the example of that. Do not accept it,"" Contreras said. ""She is the seed in the middle of this tragedy that will create miracles."""
Poland rocked by documentary exposing church abuse,us.cnn.com,Antonia Mortensen,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/poland-catholic-church-abuse-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""Father, I wanted to look you in the eye ... I wanted to ask you why?"" demands Anna Misiewicz as she confronts the parish priest she says abused her when she was just 7 and 8 years old.
""You touched me where you were not supposed to, my private parts,"" Misiewicz says, matter-of-factly, telling him that his actions ""really scarred my adult life deeply."" ""I still have nightmares ... I am unable to sleep at night,"" she tells her alleged abuser. ""I still carry it inside me."" The elderly man she is addressing exhales and shifts in his orange-and-brown-striped chair, as a religious service plays out on a TV nearby, in a home for retired priests in Kielce, central Poland. The priest, identified only as Father Jan A., has never been charged with abuse. He pauses briefly, before saying: ""I should never have done it, I should not have touched or kissed you ... I know I shouldn't have."" Read More ""I regret it profoundly,"" he says, insisting that he has reformed in the three decades since the alleged episode detailed by Misiewicz. ""It was the devil who took his toll."" The pair's troubling meeting was captured on secretly filmed footage that is at the heart of ""Tell No One,"" a new documentary that has sent shockwaves through the Polish Catholic Church and wider society in the deeply religious nation. Since its release on YouTube on May 11 the film, which details decades of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in Poland and shows victims confronting their alleged abusers, has been viewed more than 20 million times. 'Erosion' of Catholic Church The Catholic Church -- and its priests -- enjoys a revered status and wields serious influence in Poland, where more than 90% of the country's population is registered as Catholic. The Church has long held powerful ties to politics; together with the late Polish Pope John Paul II, it is widely hailed for its opposition to the Communist regime that collapsed in 1989. Marcin Zaborowski, political analyst at Visegrad Insight, told CNN the Catholic Church has been ""fundamental"" to Polish society. ""The Church is part and parcel of Polish politics,"" he said. ""The current government will find it difficult to distance itself from the Catholic Church,"" Zaborowski added. Only a week before the film was released, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the conservative ruling Law and Justice Party, said: ""Anyone who raises his hand against the church, wants to destroy it, raises his hand against Poland."" After seeing the documentary, he clarified his remarks at a rally, saying: ""That does not mean that we support or tolerate pathology in the Church."" But Zaborowski said the film ""could be a game changer,"" adding that it had ""started the erosion of the position of the Catholic Church in Poland."" The case that's created the biggest outcry since the film's publication is that of Father Franciszek Cybula, the priest of Lech Walesa, leader of anti-Communist movement Solidarity in the 1980s. Confronted on the doorstep of a small, white house in Gowidlino, a village in northern Poland, Cybula is accused of abusing a 12-year-old boy, decades earlier. Cybula, who is unaware he is being filmed, admits he touched the boy in a sexual manner but tries to downplay his actions. ""There was a moment of caressing and then we went back to our daily business,"" he says, arguing that ""it never exceeded any inappropriateness,"" and suggesting that the pair had ""fondled"" each other mutually. Cybula died before the documentary finished production. Poland's prosecutor general has issued an investigation into the alleged crimes detailed in the film. ""Tell No One"" director Tomasz Sekielski told CNN he felt compelled to bring the sexual abuse to public attention after meeting several victims during his career as a journalist. ""The horror of their stories stayed with me, and I knew that I wanted to do something more on the subject; that's why my brother and I decided to make the film."" Alleged abuse carried out by the priest of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, pictured, has caused an outcry in Poland. Taboo subject in Poland It was difficult to find traditional investors willing to back the film because of its polarizing subject, Sekielski said. Ultimately, he and his brother raised more than $100,000 to shoot the documentary via crowdfunding websites. Sekielski says the response to it has far exceeded their expectations: ""This film has been like a shock to Polish society and has managed to create real social awareness of a subject that has been very taboo in Poland."" Sekielski says he does not know if Pope Francis has seen the film, which is available online with Spanish and English subtitles. When CNN asked the Vatican if they had a comment on the film, they said they ""would look into it."" In response to the film, the Vatican's ambassador to Poland, Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio, told CNN: ""The Pope is very concerned, and we express sympathy and solidarity."" The Vatican has announced plans to send Malta's Archbishop Charles Scicluna, the Vatican's top sex crimes investigator, to Poland on June 13 to host a ""study day"" on abuse for Polish bishops on how to protect minors from abuse within the Church. Archbishop Stanisław Gądecki, president of the Polish Bishops' Conference, said he had been ""deeply moved and saddened"" by the film. ""On behalf of the entire Bishops' Conference, I would like all the victims to accept my sincere apologies; I realize that nothing can compensate them for the harm they have suffered,"" he said in a statement, adding that the film would ""definitely contribute to an even more severe condemnation of pedophilia, for which there can be no place in the Church."" Following the film's release, the Polish government proposed raising the maximum prison sentence for convicted pedophiles to 30 years. But that's insufficient, says Polish foundation Have No Fear, which helps victims of child abuse committed by the Catholic Church. The organization worked with the Sekielski brothers, helping to find victims who were willing to participate in the film. Anna Frankowska, a board member of the organization, told CNN it had been ""completely overwhelmed"" by the reaction to the film: ""It has generated a tsunami of calls from new victims to our charity."" Since the film's release more than 100 new cases have come to light, according to the charity. ""On one hand it is wonderful, but on the other it is overwhelming as we do not have the resources to process all the cases,"" said Frankowska. ""The government increase in jail time is not an effective tool,"" she said, arguing that ""it is more symbolic than anything, the courts need to actually start implementing these harsh sentences."" Marek Lisinski as a teenager around the time he was allegedly abused by his local parish priest. 'Gesture gave me huge hope' In February, representatives from Have No Fear delivered a report to Pope Francis in Rome, accusing 26 bishops in the Polish Catholic Church of concealing the perpetrators of sexual abuse of minors. Marek Lisinski, a co-founder of Have No Fear, was one of those who met the Pontiff. ""The Pope took my hand in his hands and looked at me and ... grew sad. It had a huge impact on me. Then ... he kissed my hand. That gesture gave me huge hope,"" Lisinski said. An abuse survivor himself, Lisinski told CNN how he had been groomed by a young vicar when he was a 13-year-old altar boy living in Poniatowo, in central Poland. ""It was in 1981 ... You must remember these were totally different times in Poland, there was a shortage of almost everything. But he had everything, sweets, food. It's important to understand what it meant in those days to get a sweet from someone,"" he said, explaining that ""times were tough."" ""He followed me into the toilet one day and started doing bad things to me,"" Lisinski said. When he tried to tell his mother about the abuse -- on the same day that martial law was declared, in December 1981 -- he said she was ""more worried about the political situation in Poland rather than me."" Lisinski said the sexual abuse ""really hurt my life"" and led him to become an alcoholic. Now sober, he now dedicates his time to helping other victims of abuse. Have No Fear says it has yet to hear back from the Vatican about the report; its members are extremely frustrated at the way the Polish Catholic Church is dealing with what they see as a huge crisis in the country. In March, Poland's Catholic Church released a long-awaited report on the numbers of sexual abuse cases there in the past 28 years -- the first time it has presented data on the scale of the problem. According to data compiled by the church's statistics institute and child protection center, 382 clergymen were reported for sexual abuse involving 625 minors between January 1990 and June 2018. Of these 58.4% were male, while 41.6% were female; more than half of the victims were under the age of 15, the report said. Have No Fear says the numbers do not tell the whole story; they want access to church documents detailing the nature of the abuse, and to find out what -- if any -- punishments the alleged abusers faced. In the absence of those records, the accounts of victims like Anna Misiewicz, who are willing to speak up about the abuse they say they faced as children, are all-important in helping to raise awareness of the issue. Standing outside the pretty wooden church she attended as a child, Misiewicz tells the filmmakers about the day of her first communion, pointing out where she stood alongside her alleged abuser for a photograph to mark the occasion. Dressed all in white, with a lace headdress in her hair and a half-smile on her face, there is little trace of the turmoil she was going through but, she says, ""I was under great stress because ... as a little girl I feared the photo would show that there was 'something between us,' as teenagers say now."" ""He destroyed my life,"" Misiewicz says of her alleged abuser. ""For me he does not even deserve to be called a priest."""
Stan Lee's former manager arrested on elder abuse charges - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/entertainment/stan-lee-manager-arrest/index.html,"(CNN) A former business manager for late Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee was arrested Saturday in Arizona on charges including elder abuse, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.
Keya Morgan faces felony charges of false imprisonment and grand theft from an elder and a misdemeanor charge of elder abuse, police said in a news release. A warrant had been issued for Morgan's arrest earlier this month following an elder abuse estate investigation that began in March 2018. Bail has been set at $300,000 and Morgan is expected to be extradicted to Los Angeles, police said. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Morgan. Read More Among other things, Morgan is accused of collecting money from business transactions -- like autograph signing sessions in May 2018 that totaled more than $262,000 -- and not transferring the money to Lee. Keya Morgan Lee died in November 2018 at age 95. His estate was worth more than $50 million, but no one had clear authority to act on Lee's behalf, police said. ""Morgan exerted his control and influence over Lee,"" police said in the news release. Morgan also is accused of falsely imprisoning Lee when he took Lee from his Hollywood Hills home to what police described as a ""secured Beverly Hills condominium"" in the late night hours in June 2018. Police said Lee was ""removed from Morgan's control"" later that month when he was arrested by LAPD for making fake 911 calls in May 2018. Police said Morgan made the calls in order to make Lee believe he was in danger. Lee had a restraining order against Morgan Morgan reportedly became close to Lee after the death of his wife, Joan Lee, in 2017. Before his death, Lee was granted a temporary restraining order against Morgan that banned him from abusing, harassing or contacting Lee and required him to stay at least 100 yards away from him. At the time, Morgan denied the allegations. ""I have taken great care of Stan Lee for the past many years, and have never had a problem directly with Stan. I have a fantastic relationship with him for the past many years as he has stated countless times on the record and I literally saved his life once,"" Morgan told TMZ in June 2018. ""I will 100% prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the allegations against me are false."" Lee was the creator of dozens of iconic comic figures, including Spider-Man, X-Men, Iron Man and Black Panther."

FAA investigating two airports where Chick-fil-A restaurants were excluded - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Ralph Ellis, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/chick-fil-a-airport-bans-and-faa/index.html,"(CNN) The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating religious discrimination claims against two airports because plans for Chick-fil-A restaurants were scrapped after complaints about the fast food chain's stance on LGBTQ issues.
""The Department of Transportation has received complaints alleging discrimination by two airport operators against a private company due to the expression of the owner's religious beliefs,"" an FAA statement said. ""FAA's Office of Civil Rights has notified the San Antonio International Airport (SAT) and Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF) that it has opened investigations into these complaints. The FAA notes that Federal requirements prohibit airport operators from excluding persons on the basis of religious creed from participating in airport activities that receive or benefit from FAA grant funding."" CNN has reached out to officials at both airports for comment. Chick-fil-A said in a statement released to CNN that the company is not involved in the investigation. ""We are a restaurant company ... and we have no social or political stance,"" the company said. ""We welcome and embrace all people, regardless of religion, race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity."" Read More In March, the San Antonio city council approved a new concessions contract for the airport -- on the condition that Chick-fil-A be excluded. One city council member said that action was needed because of the company's ""legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior."" Backlash on the state level was quick. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said his office would investigate whether the city violated Chick-fil-A's religious liberty. On Tuesday, the Texas House passed a ""Save Chick-fil-A bill,"" which supporters say provides religious protections, but Democrats and critics argue would allow discrimination against the state's LGBTQ community. The San Antonio Express News reported Friday that City Attorney Andy Segovia said his office received the FAA notice but his office would need time to review it before commenting. In New York state, Assemblyman Sean Ryan had complained that the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority had discussed bringing a Chick-fil-A to the airport. Ryan said last month that plans to open a Chick-fil-A were scrapped by Delaware North, the private firm that operates the airport's restaurants, not the airport authority, according to CNN affiliate WIVB. ""(Delaware North) was very quick to realize that this is a potential problem, having a company like this in a state-run facility,"" Ryan said. Kevin Kelly, a Delaware North official, said plans for a Chick-fil-A at the airport were never a done deal and that the company had not gotten enough community input, CNN affiliate WKBW reported in April. ""This was purely a business decision,"" he said. Chick-fil-A has come under fire from supporters of same-sex marriage in recent years after its president, Dan Cathy, said the company supported ""the biblical definition of the family unit."" ThinkProgress, a left-leaning website , reported last week that Chick-fil-A donated $1.8 million in 2017 to groups with a discriminatory record against the LGBTQ community. The company responded, saying in a statement that ""to suggest that our efforts in supporting these organizations was focused on suppressing a group of people is misleading and inaccurate."""

Volunteers face prison after leaving food and water in desert where migrants died,www.cnn.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/us/arizona-aid-volunteers-guilty-trespassing-trnd/index.html,"Volunteers face prison after leaving food and water in desert where migrants died By Ray Sanchez, CNN Updated 10:44 PM EST, Tue January 22, 2019
(CNN) Four aid volunteers are facing prison time after leaving food and water inside an Arizona national wildlife refuge where undocumented migrants have died trying to enter the United States.
The volunteers, who are part of the No More Deaths ministry of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Tucson, could be sentenced to up to six months in prison and fined up to $500 after they were convicted Friday by Federal Magistrate Bernardo Velasco.
The volunteers -- Natalie Hoffman, Oona Holcomb, Madeline Huse, and Zaachila Orozco -- were charged with entering a national wildlife refuge without a permit and abandonment of property, according to a statement from the aid group.
Five other No More Deaths volunteers face charges for ""efforts to place life-saving food and water"" inside the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge , the aid group said. Those volunteers will have trials in February and March.
Cabeza Prieta is Arizona's largest wilderness area, spanning 803,418 acres of isolated and rugged landscape of the Sonoran Desert. A joint investigation was launched by US and Mexican authorities in 2001 after at least 14 migrants died in a single incident after crossing the border in the refuge. They probably were abandoned in the desert by people smugglers, authorities said at the time.
No More Deaths says 155 migrants have died in the area since 2001. No More Deaths aid volunteers found guilty of trespassing after leaving food and water at border Jugs of water and cans of beans
Hoffman was also charged with operating a motor vehicle in a wilderness area. The offenses are all misdemeanors. A sentencing date was to be set within the next week.
""This verdict challenges not only No More Deaths volunteers, but people of conscience throughout the country,"" No More Deaths volunteer Catherine Gaffney said in a statement. ""If giving water to someone dying of thirst is illegal, what humanity is left in the law of this country?""
Velasco said in his ruling that the refuge is ""littered with unexploded military (ordnance), the detritus of illegal entry into the United States, and the on-road and off-road vehicular traffic of the US Border Patrol."" He also noted that the water and food left by volunteers ""erode the national decision to maintain the Refuge in its pristine nature.""
One of the volunteers still awaiting trial is Scott Warren, who the group said also faces charges of felony harboring and conspiracy related to his ""humanitarian aid work."" His trial will be in late May.
An affidavit in support of the summons for Hoffman, Holcomb, Huse and Orozco said the four volunteers entered the designated wilderness area without authorization in August 2017 to leave gallon jugs of water and cans of beans."

The 35-year-old doctor of physical therapy was at a place where she could no longer go forward because of the terrain. With a fractured leg and no shoes, she sure wasn’t going to go back.
The area she found herself in had little to no food. She stayed there for a day and a half and, as Eller’s mother and a friend told reporters Saturday as they detailed the rescued woman’s ordeal, she began to resign herself to the dire possibility that she might die there. “It came down to life and death — and I had to choose. I chose life. I wasn’t going to take the easy way out. Even though that meant more suffering in me for myself,” Eller told CNN affiliate KHON.
She tried to keep her spirits up. She had conquered so much to get to this point.
She picked berries and guava to eat when she could find them. She drank water only when it was clear enough and looked like it wouldn’t make her sicker. She took care of a bum knee and nursed sunburn so bad it got infected. She walked without her shoes, which had been swept away in a flash flood when she was trying to dry them out.
She listened for the helicopters. They had come before, several times and she had waved as best she could, but they flew away.
On Friday, Javier Cantellops, a friend of Eller’s, went up with other searchers in a rented helicopter to look for a place where they could access the woods where Cantellops thought Eller might be headed. They weren’t even really looking for her per se, but ways to get dropped off near points of where they might pick up her trail.
Still Cantellops and the others kept scanning the woods below, looking for movement, for a sign of life.
And suddenly, there she was. She popped out into a ravine and they landed nearby. She had to wait for them as they cut a path to her, but after 17 days a few more minutes were worth it.
Eller was in a Maui hospital Saturday, surprising her doctor. Yes, she’s lost 15 pounds, has a broken left tibia and they are treating her infections, but Eller looks “amazing.”
“What she’s been through, you’d never be able to tell,” Dr. Zora Bulatovic said.
Eller’s mom, Julia, beamed during a hospital news conference, telling reporters her daughter — the sweetest and most caring person, her mother said — had gone for a 3-mile walk May 8 on a different path than usual when she stopped to meditate then nap and then when she woke up couldn’t figure out how to get back to her car.
She hadn’t brought her phone, Julia Eller said as she recounted what her daughter has told her about the ordeal, and she was lost in the woods where, as mom said, “Everything looks the same. It would be very easy to get misguided.”
Julia Eller said she had her moments of despair as to whether her daughter would be found but she felt in her heart that Amanda was alive.
“She’s a trouper, man; she’s a real warrior,” her mom said. “And I had no doubt that if anybody could make it through it, it was her.”
Sarah Haynes, a friend of Eller’s boyfriend, told the media, that Amanda got to a place where she started to think she was going to die.
“She fought, fought, fought and then she said, ‘OK, whatever you need from me.’ Like, dear world, whatever this journey is for me, I’m willing to accept it,” Haynes said.
Haynes said the helicopter that Cantellops discovered Eller from was paid for with some of the $75,000 from a GoFundMe campaign.

Everest mountaineer warned of overcrowding dying on climb,edition.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Angus Watson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/asia/mount-everest-warning-scli-intl-gbr/index.html,"(CNN) A British mountaineer who recently died on Everest warned of overcrowding at the summit in his last post to social media.
Robin Haynes Fisher died of what appeared to be altitude sickness at 8,600 meters (28,215 feet), while descending from the summit on Saturday, May 25. ""I am hopeful to avoid the crowds on summit day and it seems like a number of teams are pushing to summit on the 21st,"" he wrote in a captioned Instagram post on May 19. ""With a single route to the summit, delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people. Unless of course everyone else plays the same waiting game.""
View this post on Instagram Climbed up to camp 3, 7500m but the jet stream had returned closing the summit after only 2 days so I descended to basecamp. Around 100 climbers did summit in those 2 days with sadly 2 deaths, an Indian man found dead in his tent at camp 4 and an Irish climber lost, assumed fallen, on his descent. A go fund me page has been set up for a rescue bid for the Irish climber but it is a well meaning but futile gesture. Condolences to both their friends and families. Both deaths happened above 8000m in the so called death zone where the majority of deaths of foreign climbers happen. Around 700 more people will be looking to summit from Tuesday the 21st onwards. My revised plan, subject to weather that at the moment looks promising, is to return up the mountain leaving basecamp Tuesday the 21st 0230 and, all being well and a lot of luck, arriving on the summit the morning of Saturday the 25th. I will be climbing with my Sherpa, Jangbu who is third on the all time list with an incredible 19 summits. The other 4 members of our team decided to remain on the mountain and are looking to summit on the 21st. My cough had started to return at altitude so I couldn't wait with them at altitude for the window to open without the risk of physically deteriorating too much. Furthermore as I had missed due to sickness the earlier camp 3 rotation best practice was for me to descend to allow my body to recover from the new altitude high so I could come back stronger. This was not an easy decision as the 13 hours climbing from basecamp to camp 2 in a day was the hardest physical and mental challenge I had ever done, now I have it all to do again. Finally I am hopeful to avoid the crowds on summit day and it seems like a number of teams are pushing to summit on the 21st. With a single route to the summit delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people. Unless of course everyone else plays the same waiting game. #everest #everest2019 #lhotseface

Haynes Fisher is one of nine climbers to have died on Everest in the 2019 climbing season as conditions on the world's highest mountain turned lethal. Read More During the week beginning May 20, crowds of climbers became stuck in a queue to the summit, above the mountain's highest camp at 8,000 meters (26,247 feet). The summit of Mount Everest is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) high, an elevation at which each breath contains only one-third of the oxygen found at sea level. Climbers wait to reach the summit of Everest in this image taken May 22. Most people can only spend a matter of minutes at the summit without extra oxygen supplies, and the area where the climbers were queuing is known as the ""death zone."" Mountain guide Adrian Ballinger told CNN that difficult weather conditions during this season led to overcrowding as summit attempts were restricted to a small number of days, and problems were exacerbated by a lack of experience among some climbing teams. Ballinger said people officially die from exhaustion, but what that usually means is they run out of oxygen supplies after spending too long at extremely high altitudes. ""These deaths were entirely preventable,"" he said. ""And they were due to this lack of judgment on a difficult season with difficult weather."" In 2018 high-altitude medical expert Sundeep Dhillon explained to CNN that perhaps the biggest danger is when climbers treat the summit as the journey's end point. According to Dhillon's estimates, ""you've probably got a one in 10 chance of dying on the way down."" ""People are perfectly capable of exerting themselves beyond their capabilities whilst underestimating the demands that those extreme altitudes place on you,"" he said. ""They forget they're in the Death Zone."" Nepali climbing guide Dhruba Bista fell ill on the mountain and was transported by helicopter to the base camp, where he died Friday. And Irish climber Kevin Hynes, 56, died Friday morning on the Tibetan side of Everest in his tent at 7,000 meters (22,966 feet). Two died Wednesday after descending from the summit: Indian climber Anjali Kulkarni, 55, and American climber Donald Lynn Cash, 55. Kalpana Das, 49, and Nihal Bagwan, 27, both from India, also died on Everest this week. Both died Thursday on their return from the summit. Everest traffic jam creates lethal conditions for climbers Ravi, a 28-year-old Indian climber who goes by one name, died the previous week on May 17. Last week, a search for Irish climber Seamus Lawless, 39, was called off, after the Trinity College Dublin professor fell while descending from the peak, according to the Press Assocation. Lawless is missing, presumed dead. The death toll for Everest's 2019 climbing season is not unusual for the mountain. In 2018, five climbers died, while six died in both 2017 and 2016. More than 200 mountaineers have died on the peak since 1922, when the first climbers' deaths on Everest were recorded. The majority of bodies are believed to have remained buried under glaciers or snow. Correction: This story has been updated with the correct date of Fisher's Instagram post."
"Food recall: If you're firing up the grill for the holiday weekend, avoid all these recalled items - CNN",edition.cnn.com,AJ Willingham,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/health/memorial-day-recall-meat-hotdogs-flour/index.html,"(CNN) If you're planning on firing up the grill this Memorial Day weekend, you may want to double check your fridge and pantry before you get a very un-festive surprise.
Several items have been recalled for reasons ranging from possible E. coli contamination to metal fragments. Here are the recalled items: Flour The discount supermarket chain Aldi recalled 5-pound bags of its Baker's Corner All-Purpose Flour on Thursday because they may be contaminated with E. coli. Read More Seventeen people have been reported sick in eight states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Three of those people have been hospitalized. There have been no deaths. Flour sold at Aldi recalled Those who got sick ate, licked or tasted raw, homemade dough or batter. The CDC states that eating or tasting raw dough or batter can make a person sick. The illnesses began December 11, 2018 and the latest began April 18, the CDC said. The recalled flour was sold at Aldi locations in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. Steak, ribs and brisket The US Department of Agriculture issued a recall for more than 62,000 pounds of raw beef Wednesday due to E. coli concerns. The meat was shipped nationwide for distribution, and the products being recalled have the establishment number ""EST. 788"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. 62,000 pounds of raw meat are being recalled The recall includes more than 40 products, most of which are cuts of steak, like ribeyes, as well as ribs and brisket cuts. Read the full list of products being recalled. People sometimes like to freeze cuts of meat for future use, so if you've socked away some beef in your backup freezer recently, you may want to check that as well. The possible E. coli contamination was discovered after a random sampling, and the USDA says there have been no reported cases of illness related to this recall. People usually get sick two to eight days after ingesting the germ, the CDC says. Symptoms of E.coli infections include stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Some infections are mild, but others can be life-threatening. Hot dogs This follows an earlier recall this month of more than 2,000 pounds of Vienna Beef hot dogs over concerns they may contain metal fragments. Vienna Beef recalls hot dogs that might contain metal fragments In the latest recall, Chicago-style dogs were shipped to food service locations in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, according to the US Department of Agriculture. They were packaged in 10-pound cases of Skinless Beef Frankfurters with ""EST. 1"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. Produced May 2, the potentially contaminated products have been identified by the USDA online. The recall was limited to restaurants and had ""nothing to do with grocery store product,"" said Tom McGlade, vice president of marketing for the Chicago-based company. So far, there have been no reports of a health problem caused by eating these products. Anyone concerned about a possible injury or illness should contact a health care provider."

Officials are going door to door to find victims and assess the damage after it touched down in El Reno late Saturday night. One of the areas it hit is a mobile home park, Fire Chief Kent Lagaly said.
It is too early to tell whether the death toll will rise and the number of injured is still unknown, said Andrew Skidmore, a director at the Canadian County Emergency Management.
El Reno, with a population of about 19,000, is about 29 miles west of Oklahoma City.

Ireland to liberalize divorce laws following referendum,edition.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Sarah Dean, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/ireland-divorce-referendum-scli-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Divorce laws in the Republic of Ireland will be liberalized after the results of a referendum were revealed Sunday morning.
Results from Friday's referendum show 82% of voters want to change the existing law, which is enshrined in the constitution, under which a person can only apply for a divorce after living separately from their spouse for four out of the previous five years. The clause will now be removed, allowing lawmakers to decide on a new separation period. Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan tweeted Friday calling exit polls showing overwhelming support for the change ""very positive news."" ""I intend moving speedily with legislation to cut waiting time & thereby reduce upset & trauma on couples & children where marriages have irreconcilably broken down,"" wrote Flanagan. Read More Trump to visit Ireland during D-Day trip to UK and Normandy In March Flanagan said the government intends to reduce the living apart period to two years so both parties can ""move forward with their lives within a reasonable timeframe."" As things stand no one is exempt from the mandatory wait time, including those who are trying to leave abusive relationships, most of whom are women. Women suffering from domestic abuse could benefit from a shorter divorce process in order to protect themselves -- and their children -- from continued abuse from a former spouse, according to the National Women's Council of Ireland. Other individuals in the process of separating argue that the minimum wait time creates unnecessary levels of anxiety, prohibits their ability to move on, wreaks havoc on their emotional well-being and is a terrible financial burden. One man told CNN he had been to court 40 times and spent tens of thousands of euros on legal fees trying to get a divorce. It takes at least 4 years to apply for divorce in Ireland. Friday's vote is another test of the nation's values Michael Rossney said the long wait has fueled a hostile environment that has been exploited by the legal system, and that the proceedings -- and relationship with his ex -- could have been more positive if the mandatory period wasn't so drawn out. Divorced was only legalized in Ireland in 1995 by a small majority, 50.3%. Friday's referendum has become the latest in a series of measures reflecting modern Irish society that have recently questioned, and rejected, the historical role of the Catholic Church's doctrine on its institutions. Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote, with more than 60% voting yes in a referendum in 2015. And, earlier this year, it opened its first abortion services following the 2018 vote that repealed a constitutional amendment that had placed a near-ban on terminations. ""Ireland has really grown into a more tolerant and progressive society over the last 24 years,"" tweeted Irish Senator Catherine Noone following the divorce referendum result."
San Francisco police chief says raid on journalist's home may have violated California shield law - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/25/us/san-francisco-police-chief-journalist-raid/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29,"(CNN) San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott called for an independent investigation Friday into the department's handling of leaked documents and the subsequent raid of a journalist's home.
Freelance journalist Bryan Carmody obtained a confidential police report that included information about the February death of prominent San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi. Carmody, 59, refused to tell authorities how he obtained the documents in April. During a raid of Carmody's home weeks later , officers seized his computers, cameras, phones and notebooks. Jeff Adachi Days after the May 10 raid, Scott said at a news conference there is a criminal investigation into whether Carmody was an ""active participant in the commission of the criminal acts beyond his role with the news media."" Despite those comments, Scott released a statement Friday saying the department is seeking an ""independent, impartial investigation by a separate investigatory body."" Scott said he was concerned ""by a lack of due diligence by department investigators in seeking search warrants and appropriately addressing Mr. Carmody's status as a member of the news media."" ""This has raised important questions about our handling of this case and whether the California shield law was violated,"" Scott's statement read. The shield law protects journalists from being held in contempt for refusing to reveal their sources, according to The Society of Professional Journalists Northern California . Read More Scott's statement also said the Department of Police Accountability will investigate both the search warrant that was executed on Carmody's home and the release of the Adachi police report. The department, Scott said, under the oversight of the San Francisco Police Commission, will also review protocols involving members of the news media. ""We must do a better job,"" Scott said. ""Journalists and everyone in our city deserve a police department that will maintain the constitutional rights of all."" Police Officers Association calls for Scott's resignation Scott said the investigation came at the request of San Francisco Mayor London Breed. The mayor initially supported the raid, but later tweeted, ""The more we learn, the less appropriate it looks to me."" ""A free and independent press plays a crucial role in our society, and we have to work harder to honor not only the letter of California's Shield Law, but also the spirit of it,"" Breed tweeted May 19. In San Francisco, an attack on press freedoms and echoes of autocracy The San Francisco Police Officers Association called for Scott's resignation Saturday because the organization said he ordered the investigation into Carmody and is now trying to throw the officers who carried out the raid ""under a double-decker bus."" ""SFPD Chief William Scott showed everyone in the SFPD, and all San Franciscans, what his character consists of and it was a pathetic, deceitful and shameful display of self-preservation, finger pointing, and political kowtowing. We all deserve better,"" the statement read. The statement said Scott didn't tell the sergeant who signed the search warrant for Carmody's house about his status as a journalist. The POA statement also said Scott's apology ""was clearly meant for him to save face as opposed to accept responsibility for his own actions."" ""He should be immediately placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation,"" the statement read. ""During that time, he should muster up the personal fortitude to do the right thing and resign."" "
German Jews warned not to wear kippahs in public following spike in anti-Semitism - CNN,www.cnn.com,"Matthew Robinson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/germany-antisemitism-kippah-intl-scli-ger/index.html,"(CNN) German Jews have been warned by a leading government official not to wear traditional kippahs in all public settings following a rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country.
Felix Klein, the German government's anti-Semitism commissioner, told the Funke media group Saturday: ""My opinion has unfortunately changed compared with what it used to be. ""I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere all the time in Germany."" Klein suggested that a rise in ""social disinhibition and coarseness"" was to blame for the worsening situation. ""The internet and social media have also strongly contributed to this -- but also the continuous attacks on our culture of remembrance,"" he added. Demonstrators participated in a protest against anti-Semitism in Berlin in April. The commissioner has since called for specific training for police and other officials in order to combat the spike in anti-Semitic crimes. Read More There is ""a lot of uncertainty among the police and government officials in dealing with anti-Semitism,"" he said. He also suggested that many officials do not know what is permitted and what is not, and called for police, lawyers and teachers to be taught what is ""clearly defined"" as unacceptable behavior. Klein's warning comes after the German government published figures that revealed a stark rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. The findings, released by the interior ministry, revealed that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose by nearly 20% last year, while physical attacks against Jews rose from 37 in 2017 to 62 last year. Horst Seehofer, the interior minister, has said that around 90% of the reported incidents were perpetrated by supporters of far-right groups. ""This is a development that we have to confront, especially in this country,"" Seehofer told a press conference in May. ""This is a job for the police as well as the whole society."" Claudi Vanoni, one of Germany's leading legal experts of antisemitism, had also warned that the issue remains ""deeply rooted"" in Germany. ""Anti-Semitism has always been there. But I think that recently, it has again become louder, more aggressive and flagrant,"" Vanoni told the AFP news agency. The two parties have more work to do to fight anti-Semitism Katarina Barley, Germany's justice minister, pledged to protect the Jewish way of life. ""The increasingly frequent attacks against Jews are shameful for our country. Right-wing movements are attacking our democracy and are targeting our peaceful coexistence,"" she told Handelsblatt newspaper. ""We must protect Jewish life with all our means in our nation of laws and hold the perpetrators accountable."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also denounced anti-Semitic crime in Germany and called for a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to tackling it. ""People growing up today must know what people were capable of in the past, and we must work proactively to ensure that it is never repeated,"" she said in a weekly video address in January. "

I think if she wants, 10 grand slams, easy to win,'"" Li, who won the French Open in 2011 and the 2014 Australian Open, told CNN Sport in an exclusive interview in Beijing. 'Pokerface' Read More Only seven women have won 10 grand slam titles or more, but Li said Osaka has the combination of power and mental strength all champions possess. ""(It is) because she is pretty strong, and also, and for her age, she has a lot of experience on the court,"" Li said after attending the Road to Wimbledon China event, the All England Lawn Tennis Club's junior tournament, in Beijing. ""She knows what she has to do, she is smart."" The top-ranked Osaka showed her resilience during a tumultuous US Open final , which was overshadowed by a row between the umpire and her opponent Serena Williams, the 23-time grand slam champion. In the end, Osaka defeated Williams, her idol growing up, 6-2 6-4. Naomi Osaka beat Serena Williams to clinch the US Open title in September 2018. Although Osaka had been in tears at the trophy ceremony as parts of the New York crowd booed the match officials, she followed up her maiden slam with a second major title, beating two-time Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic in three close sets at the Australian Open in Melbourne to rise to the top of the women's rankings. Osaka's strength of character on court has impressed Li. ""I like she has like a pokerface, doesn't matter what happened on the court, she has same face,"" Li said. READ: Why Li Na wants the movie about her life to inspire women 'Can she slide?' So far Osaka has yet to win a tournament on the slower red clay, and hasn't gone beyond the third round of Roland-Garros in Paris in three appearances. When asked if she thought the top-seeded Osaka could win the French Open, Li said: ""Does she know how to slide?"" Shortly after her Australian Open victory, Osaka parted ways with coach Sascha Bajin, the man who had guided her to two major titles and the No. 1 ranking. Having lost some momentum in the months after Melbourne, with early exits in Dubai, Indian Wells and Miami, Osaka has had an injury-marred clay-court season in Europe this spring. 😊 @RafaelNadal + @Naomi_Osaka_ = 😍 VAMOS!! Welcome to the #RafaNadalAcademy ! 🔝📸 pic.twitter.com/5yIZroAP04
— Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar (@rnadalacademy) May 1, 2019 Guided by a new coach, Jermaine Jenkins, Osaka reached the quarterfinals at last month's Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany, battling back from 5-1 down in the deciding set to beat Croatia's Donna Vekic, before an abdominal injury forced her to withdraw from the Stuttgart semifinals. Having spent the next week honing her clay-court skills at the academy of none other than 11-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal in Manacor, on the Spanish island of Mallorca, Osaka had a strong run in Madrid, where she reached the quarterfinals. Then injury struck again in Rome the week after, as Osaka withdrew with a right-hand injury ahead of a highly anticipated quarterfinal clash with Madrid champion Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands. ""My hand is better now, it's gets better every day,"" Osaka told reporters at Roland-Garros. Talking in Rome, the Japanese described her clay-court season as ""rocky,"" but she added in Paris that she has improved with every match. ""I feel I should be an all-court player,"" she said Friday. ""But it's been a bit of a ride trying to figure out how to play better on clay all these years, but this year I've been playing well so I'm really excited to see what happens here."" Big in Japan Born in Osaka, Japan, to a Haitian father and Japanese mother, Osaka has lived in the US since the age of three and is now based in Florida. Her success on the court has turned her into a superstar in Japan, and one of the world's most bankable female athletes. Living in the US may be an advantage, Li said. ""Her luck is, she doesn't live in Japan,"" said Li, who was based in Germany for long stretches during her tennis career. ""She is in America, and I think this is good for her. If she lived in Japan, I think it would be 100 times tougher."""
German Jews warned not to wear kippahs in public spike in anti-Semitism,edition.cnn.com,"Matthew Robinson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/germany-antisemitism-kippah-intl-scli-ger/index.html,"(CNN) German Jews have been warned by a leading government official not to wear traditional kippahs in all public settings following a rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country.
Felix Klein, the German government's anti-Semitism commissioner, told the Funke media group Saturday: ""My opinion has unfortunately changed compared with what it used to be. ""I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere all the time in Germany."" Klein suggested that a rise in ""social disinhibition and coarseness"" was to blame for the worsening situation. ""The internet and social media have also strongly contributed to this -- but also the continuous attacks on our culture of remembrance,"" he added. Demonstrators participated in a protest against anti-Semitism in Berlin in April. The commissioner has since called for specific training for police and other officials in order to combat the spike in anti-Semitic crimes. Read More There is ""a lot of uncertainty among the police and government officials in dealing with anti-Semitism,"" he said. He also suggested that many officials do not know what is permitted and what is not, and called for police, lawyers and teachers to be taught what is ""clearly defined"" as unacceptable behavior. Klein told CNN previously that ""anti-Semitism has always existed in Germany,"" but warned that it is now ""showing its ugly face more openly."" ""The word Jew as an insult was not common in my time when I went to school. Now it is, and it's even an insult at schools where there's no Jews, where there are no Jewish students. So that is a growing concern and of course we have to develop strategies to counter that."" His warning comes after the German government published figures that revealed a stark rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. Data released by the interior ministry reveals that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose by nearly 20% from 2017-18, while the number of physical attacks against Jews increased from 37 in 2017 to 69 last year. Horst Seehofer, the interior minister, has said that around 90% of the reported incidents were perpetrated by supporters of far-right groups. ""This is a development that we have to confront, especially in this country,"" Seehofer told a press conference in May. ""This is a job for the police as well as the whole society."" Claudi Vanoni, one of Germany's leading legal experts of antisemitism, had also warned that the issue remains ""deeply rooted"" in Germany. ""Anti-Semitism has always been there. But I think that recently, it has again become louder, more aggressive and flagrant,"" Vanoni told the AFP news agency. The two parties have more work to do to fight anti-Semitism Katarina Barley, Germany's justice minister, pledged to protect the Jewish way of life. ""The increasingly frequent attacks against Jews are shameful for our country. Right-wing movements are attacking our democracy and are targeting our peaceful coexistence,"" she told Handelsblatt newspaper. ""We must protect Jewish life with all our means in our nation of laws and hold the perpetrators accountable."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also denounced anti-Semitic crime in Germany and called for a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to tackling it. ""People growing up today must know what people were capable of in the past, and we must work proactively to ensure that it is never repeated,"" she said in a weekly video address in January. This story has been updated to reflect the correct number of physical attacks against Jews in Germany in 2018. It was 69."

Markets aren't only fretting trade. Now they're worried about global growth,edition.cnn.com,Julia Horowitz,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html,"London (CNN Business) 1. Bigger than trade: Investor anxiety about trade has quickly morphed into something much bigger: renewed worries about global economic growth.
Treasury yields are down, oil is under pressure and global economic data has disappointed. Stocks could face a rocky ride if that fear really sets in. ""When you actually look at some of the major economies outside the United States, many of them have homegrown problems,"" said Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory firm Yardeni Research. ""It's not all about trade."" Escalating tensions between the United States and China clearly pose a problem. Businesses are saying that new rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs will hit their bottom lines, while economists warn of global ripple effects. The situation is made worse by the fact that there's no end to the fight in sight. ""We don't see the US or China hurrying to reach a deal, and the risk of miscalculation is growing,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said in a recent note. Read More Goldman Sachs analysts said last week that if the United States moves forward with threatened tariffs on all remaining imports from China, it would push the US stock market down an additional 4%. Markets have already been rattled by trade fears: The Dow just declined for the fifth straight week — its longest weekly losing streak in nearly eight years. But it's not just about whether markets wake up to the fact that they'd priced in a trade deal that was far from certain. Apprehension over trade is now magnifying other signs of weakness, resurfacing concerns about slowing global growth that dominated markets in December. Recent economic data has revealed key soft spots. Manufacturing in Europe and China appears weak. Germany's economy appears to have slowed this quarter ""to little more than a crawl,"" according to research firm Capital Economics, which pointed to manufacturing and business climate figures. The chances of Britain crashing out of the European Union without a deal have also increased. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury fell to its lowest level last Thursday since late 2017. Bond yields tend to fall when investors are worried about sluggish growth. Then there's US oil, which fell nearly 7% last week to $58.63 a barrel. It was the worst week in five months. Though prices have since stabilized, a surge of crude inventories disclosed by the US government last week has raised the possibility of another supply glut — not unlike the one that sent crude crashing into a bear market late last year. All this comes as trade starts to weigh on top brands. ""Trade tensions create uncertainty,"" Yardeni said. ""Uncertainty causes companies to cut back on capital spending [and] on expansion."" Earnings expectations are already taking a hit. Kohl's, for example, last week lowered its guidance for the year in part due to higher costs from tariffs. The retailer imports about 20% of its merchandise from China. Roughly 77% of S&P 500 companies that have issued second quarter earnings guidance expect to come in below analysts' expectations, above the five-year average of 70%, according to FactSet. Should this data hold and pessimism sink in, investors could be in for even more trouble. ""Global equity markets are facing the perfect storm of headwinds in the form of persistent US-China trade drama, concerns over plateauing global growth and tumbling commodity prices,"" Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at currency trader FXTM, wrote in a note Friday. He continued: ""For as long as these themes remain in play, investor appetite for stocks is poised to evaporate — ultimately bringing equity bears back into the game."" 2. Economic data: New economic data out this week will be examined closely for signs on a global economic slowdown. Some key reports are due in Europe, including German consumer confidence and Eurozone business confidence on Tuesday, along with UK consumer confidence on Friday. In the United States, investors will watch for the second estimate of first quarter GDP growth. Initial estimates may have been wonky due to the government showdown. 3. Retail earnings: The US-China trade war will stay at the forefront of retail earnings as they roll into another week. Major retailers have developed strategies to blunt the impact of tariffs so far. But they're starting to warn that the trade war is impacting business. Walmart ( WMT ) , Target ( TGT ) , Home Depot ( HD ) , Kohl's ( KSS ) and Macy's ( M ) have all said that the tariffs have forced them to either alter their financial outlooks, remodel carefully crafted supply chains or consider raising price tags for customers. Investors will be on high alert for more problems as they gauge the health of the dollar store sector, as well as clothing retailers such as Gap ( GPS ) . In February, Gap announced it plans to spin off Old Navy into a separate company next year. Costco ( COST ) reports earnings on Thursday. Despite trade strain, Walmart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ) both posted strong starts to the year, and analysts expect Costco to continue big box retailers' hot streak. 4. Coming next week: Monday — US and UK markets closed
Tuesday — S&P/Case-Shiller home price index; US and German consumer confidence; Eurozone business confidence
Wednesday — Abercrombie & Fitch ( ANF ) and Dick's Sporting Goods ( DKS ) earnings; ExxonMobil ( XOM ) shareholder meeting
Thursday — Second estimate of US Q1 GDP; Dollar General ( DG ) , DSW parent company Designer Brands, Gap and Costco earnings
Friday — UK consumer confidence; US personal spending"
Everest mountaineer warned of overcrowding before dying on climb - CNN,www.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Angus Watson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/asia/mount-everest-warning-scli-intl-gbr/index.html,"(CNN) A British mountaineer who recently died on Everest warned of overcrowding at the summit in his last post to social media.
Robin Haynes Fisher died of what appeared to be altitude sickness at 8,600 meters (28,215 feet), while descending from the summit on Saturday, May 25. ""I am hopeful to avoid the crowds on summit day and it seems like a number of teams are pushing to summit on the 21st,"" he wrote in a captioned Instagram post on May 13. ""With a single route to the summit, delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people. Unless of course everyone else plays the same waiting game.""
View this post on Instagram Climbed up to camp 3, 7500m but the jet stream had returned closing the summit after only 2 days so I descended to basecamp. Around 100 climbers did summit in those 2 days with sadly 2 deaths, an Indian man found dead in his tent at camp 4 and an Irish climber lost, assumed fallen, on his descent. A go fund me page has been set up for a rescue bid for the Irish climber but it is a well meaning but futile gesture. Condolences to both their friends and families. Both deaths happened above 8000m in the so called death zone where the majority of deaths of foreign climbers happen. Around 700 more people will be looking to summit from Tuesday the 21st onwards. My revised plan, subject to weather that at the moment looks promising, is to return up the mountain leaving basecamp Tuesday the 21st 0230 and, all being well and a lot of luck, arriving on the summit the morning of Saturday the 25th. I will be climbing with my Sherpa, Jangbu who is third on the all time list with an incredible 19 summits. The other 4 members of our team decided to remain on the mountain and are looking to summit on the 21st. My cough had started to return at altitude so I couldn't wait with them at altitude for the window to open without the risk of physically deteriorating too much. Furthermore as I had missed due to sickness the earlier camp 3 rotation best practice was for me to descend to allow my body to recover from the new altitude high so I could come back stronger. This was not an easy decision as the 13 hours climbing from basecamp to camp 2 in a day was the hardest physical and mental challenge I had ever done, now I have it all to do again. Finally I am hopeful to avoid the crowds on summit day and it seems like a number of teams are pushing to summit on the 21st. With a single route to the summit delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people. Unless of course everyone else plays the same waiting game. #everest #everest2019 #lhotseface

Haynes Fisher is one of nine climbers to have died on Everest in the 2019 climbing season as conditions on the world's highest mountain turned lethal. Read More During the week beginning May 20, crowds of climbers became stuck in a queue to the summit, above the mountain's highest camp at 8,000 meters (26,247 feet). The summit of Mount Everest is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) high, an elevation at which each breath contains only one-third of the oxygen found at sea level. Climbers wait to reach the summit of Everest in this image taken May 22. Most people can only spend a matter of minutes at the summit without extra oxygen supplies, and the area where the climbers were queuing is known as the ""death zone."" Nepali climbing guide Dhruba Bista fell ill on the mountain and was transported by helicopter to the base camp, where he died Friday. And Irish climber Kevin Hynes, 56, died Friday morning on the Tibetan side of Everest in his tent at 7,000 meters (22,966 feet). Two died Wednesday after descending from the summit: Indian climber Anjali Kulkarni, 55, and American climber Donald Lynn Cash, 55. Kalpana Das, 49, and Nihal Bagwan, 27, both from India, also died on Everest this week. Both died Thursday on their return from the summit. Everest traffic jam creates lethal conditions for climbers Ravi, a 28-year-old Indian climber who goes by one name, died the previous week on May 17. Last week, a search for Irish climber Seamus Lawless, 39, was called off, after the Trinity College Dublin professor fell while descending from the peak, according to the Press Assocation. Lawless is missing, presumed dead. The death toll for Everest's 2019 climbing season is not unusual for the mountain. In 2018, five climbers died, while six died in both 2017 and 2016. More than 200 mountaineers have died on the peak since 1922, when the first climbers' deaths on Everest were recorded. The majority of bodies are believed to have remained buried under glaciers or snow. "
FAA investigating two airports where Chick-fil-A restaurants were excluded - CNN,us.cnn.com,"Ralph Ellis, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/chick-fil-a-airport-bans-and-faa/index.html,"(CNN) The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating religious discrimination claims against two airports because plans for Chick-fil-A restaurants were scrapped after complaints about the fast food chain's stance on LGBTQ issues.
""The Department of Transportation has received complaints alleging discrimination by two airport operators against a private company due to the expression of the owner's religious beliefs,"" an FAA statement said. ""FAA's Office of Civil Rights has notified the San Antonio International Airport (SAT) and Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF) that it has opened investigations into these complaints. The FAA notes that Federal requirements prohibit airport operators from excluding persons on the basis of religious creed from participating in airport activities that receive or benefit from FAA grant funding."" CNN has reached out to officials at both airports for comment. Chick-fil-A said in a statement released to CNN that the company is not involved in the investigation. ""We are a restaurant company ... and we have no social or political stance,"" the company said. ""We welcome and embrace all people, regardless of religion, race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity."" Read More In March, the San Antonio city council approved a new concessions contract for the airport -- on the condition that Chick-fil-A be excluded. One city council member said that action was needed because of the company's ""legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior."" Backlash on the state level was quick. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said his office would investigate whether the city violated Chick-fil-A's religious liberty. On Tuesday, the Texas House passed a ""Save Chick-fil-A bill,"" which supporters say provides religious protections, but Democrats and critics argue would allow discrimination against the state's LGBTQ community. The San Antonio Express News reported Friday that City Attorney Andy Segovia said his office received the FAA notice but his office would need time to review it before commenting. In New York state, Assemblyman Sean Ryan had complained that the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority had discussed bringing a Chick-fil-A to the airport. Ryan said last month that plans to open a Chick-fil-A were scrapped by Delaware North, the private firm that operates the airport's restaurants, not the airport authority, according to CNN affiliate WIVB. ""(Delaware North) was very quick to realize that this is a potential problem, having a company like this in a state-run facility,"" Ryan said. Kevin Kelly, a Delaware North official, said plans for a Chick-fil-A at the airport were never a done deal and that the company had not gotten enough community input, CNN affiliate WKBW reported in April. ""This was purely a business decision,"" he said. Chick-fil-A has come under fire from supporters of same-sex marriage in recent years after its president, Dan Cathy, said the company supported ""the biblical definition of the family unit."" ThinkProgress, a left-leaning website , reported last week that Chick-fil-A donated $1.8 million in 2017 to groups with a discriminatory record against the LGBTQ community. The company responded, saying in a statement that ""to suggest that our efforts in supporting these organizations was focused on suppressing a group of people is misleading and inaccurate."""

German Jews warned not to wear kippahs in public following spike in anti-Semitism,us.cnn.com,"Matthew Robinson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/germany-antisemitism-kippah-intl-scli-ger/index.html,"(CNN) German Jews have been warned by a leading government official not to wear traditional kippahs in all public settings following a rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country.
Felix Klein, the German government's anti-Semitism commissioner, told the Funke media group Saturday: ""My opinion has unfortunately changed compared with what it used to be. ""I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere all the time in Germany."" Klein suggested that a rise in ""social disinhibition and coarseness"" was to blame for the worsening situation. ""The internet and social media have also strongly contributed to this -- but also the continuous attacks on our culture of remembrance,"" he added. Demonstrators participated in a protest against anti-Semitism in Berlin in April. The commissioner has since called for specific training for police and other officials in order to combat the spike in anti-Semitic crimes. Read More There is ""a lot of uncertainty among the police and government officials in dealing with anti-Semitism,"" he said. He also suggested that many officials do not know what is permitted and what is not, and called for police, lawyers and teachers to be taught what is ""clearly defined"" as unacceptable behavior. Klein told CNN previously that ""anti-Semitism has always existed in Germany,"" but warned that it is now ""showing its ugly face more openly."" ""The word Jew as an insult was not common in my time when I went to school. Now it is, and it's even an insult at schools where there's no Jews, where there are no Jewish students. So that is a growing concern and of course we have to develop strategies to counter that."" His warning comes after the German government published figures that revealed a stark rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. Data released by the interior ministry reveals that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose by nearly 20% from 2017-18, while the number of physical attacks against Jews increased from 37 in 2017 to 69 last year. Horst Seehofer, the interior minister, has said that around 90% of the reported incidents were perpetrated by supporters of far-right groups. ""This is a development that we have to confront, especially in this country,"" Seehofer told a press conference in May. ""This is a job for the police as well as the whole society."" Claudi Vanoni, one of Germany's leading legal experts of antisemitism, had also warned that the issue remains ""deeply rooted"" in Germany. ""Anti-Semitism has always been there. But I think that recently, it has again become louder, more aggressive and flagrant,"" Vanoni told the AFP news agency. The two parties have more work to do to fight anti-Semitism Katarina Barley, Germany's justice minister, pledged to protect the Jewish way of life. ""The increasingly frequent attacks against Jews are shameful for our country. Right-wing movements are attacking our democracy and are targeting our peaceful coexistence,"" she told Handelsblatt newspaper. ""We must protect Jewish life with all our means in our nation of laws and hold the perpetrators accountable."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also denounced anti-Semitic crime in Germany and called for a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to tackling it. ""People growing up today must know what people were capable of in the past, and we must work proactively to ensure that it is never repeated,"" she said in a weekly video address in January. This story has been updated to reflect the correct number of physical attacks against Jews in Germany in 2018. It was 69."

Ireland to liberalize divorce laws following referendum,us.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Sarah Dean, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/ireland-divorce-referendum-scli-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Divorce laws in the Republic of Ireland will be liberalized after the results of a referendum were revealed Sunday morning.
Results from Friday's referendum show 82% of voters want to change the existing law, which is enshrined in the constitution, under which a person can only apply for a divorce after living separately from their spouse for four out of the previous five years. The clause will now be removed, allowing lawmakers to decide on a new separation period. Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan tweeted Friday calling exit polls showing overwhelming support for the change ""very positive news."" ""I intend moving speedily with legislation to cut waiting time & thereby reduce upset & trauma on couples & children where marriages have irreconcilably broken down,"" wrote Flanagan. Read More Trump to visit Ireland during D-Day trip to UK and Normandy In March Flanagan said the government intends to reduce the living apart period to two years so both parties can ""move forward with their lives within a reasonable timeframe."" As things stand no one is exempt from the mandatory wait time, including those who are trying to leave abusive relationships, most of whom are women. Women suffering from domestic abuse could benefit from a shorter divorce process in order to protect themselves -- and their children -- from continued abuse from a former spouse, according to the National Women's Council of Ireland. Other individuals in the process of separating argue that the minimum wait time creates unnecessary levels of anxiety, prohibits their ability to move on, wreaks havoc on their emotional well-being and is a terrible financial burden. One man told CNN he had been to court 40 times and spent tens of thousands of euros on legal fees trying to get a divorce. It takes at least 4 years to apply for divorce in Ireland. Friday's vote is another test of the nation's values Michael Rossney said the long wait has fueled a hostile environment that has been exploited by the legal system, and that the proceedings -- and relationship with his ex -- could have been more positive if the mandatory period wasn't so drawn out. Divorced was only legalized in Ireland in 1995 by a small majority, 50.3%. Friday's referendum has become the latest in a series of measures reflecting modern Irish society that have recently questioned, and rejected, the historical role of the Catholic Church's doctrine on its institutions. Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote, with more than 60% voting yes in a referendum in 2015. And, earlier this year, it opened its first abortion services following the 2018 vote that repealed a constitutional amendment that had placed a near-ban on terminations. ""Ireland has really grown into a more tolerant and progressive society over the last 24 years,"" tweeted Irish Senator Catherine Noone following the divorce referendum result."
Everest mountaineer warned of overcrowding before dying on climb,us.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Angus Watson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/asia/mount-everest-warning-scli-intl-gbr/index.html,"(CNN) A British mountaineer who recently died on Everest warned of overcrowding at the summit in his last post to social media.
Robin Haynes Fisher died of what appeared to be altitude sickness at 8,600 meters (28,215 feet), while descending from the summit on Saturday, May 25. ""I am hopeful to avoid the crowds on summit day and it seems like a number of teams are pushing to summit on the 21st,"" he wrote in a captioned Instagram post on May 19. ""With a single route to the summit, delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people. Unless of course everyone else plays the same waiting game.""
View this post on Instagram Climbed up to camp 3, 7500m but the jet stream had returned closing the summit after only 2 days so I descended to basecamp. Around 100 climbers did summit in those 2 days with sadly 2 deaths, an Indian man found dead in his tent at camp 4 and an Irish climber lost, assumed fallen, on his descent. A go fund me page has been set up for a rescue bid for the Irish climber but it is a well meaning but futile gesture. Condolences to both their friends and families. Both deaths happened above 8000m in the so called death zone where the majority of deaths of foreign climbers happen. Around 700 more people will be looking to summit from Tuesday the 21st onwards. My revised plan, subject to weather that at the moment looks promising, is to return up the mountain leaving basecamp Tuesday the 21st 0230 and, all being well and a lot of luck, arriving on the summit the morning of Saturday the 25th. I will be climbing with my Sherpa, Jangbu who is third on the all time list with an incredible 19 summits. The other 4 members of our team decided to remain on the mountain and are looking to summit on the 21st. My cough had started to return at altitude so I couldn't wait with them at altitude for the window to open without the risk of physically deteriorating too much. Furthermore as I had missed due to sickness the earlier camp 3 rotation best practice was for me to descend to allow my body to recover from the new altitude high so I could come back stronger. This was not an easy decision as the 13 hours climbing from basecamp to camp 2 in a day was the hardest physical and mental challenge I had ever done, now I have it all to do again. Finally I am hopeful to avoid the crowds on summit day and it seems like a number of teams are pushing to summit on the 21st. With a single route to the summit delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people. Unless of course everyone else plays the same waiting game. #everest #everest2019 #lhotseface

Haynes Fisher is one of nine climbers to have died on Everest in the 2019 climbing season as conditions on the world's highest mountain turned lethal. Read More During the week beginning May 20, crowds of climbers became stuck in a queue to the summit, above the mountain's highest camp at 8,000 meters (26,247 feet). The summit of Mount Everest is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) high, an elevation at which each breath contains only one-third of the oxygen found at sea level. Climbers wait to reach the summit of Everest in this image taken May 22. Most people can only spend a matter of minutes at the summit without extra oxygen supplies, and the area where the climbers were queuing is known as the ""death zone."" Mountain guide Adrian Ballinger told CNN that difficult weather conditions during this season led to overcrowding as summit attempts were restricted to a small number of days, and problems were exacerbated by a lack of experience among some climbing teams. Ballinger said people officially die from exhaustion, but what that usually means is they run out of oxygen supplies after spending too long at extremely high altitudes. ""These deaths were entirely preventable,"" he said. ""And they were due to this lack of judgment on a difficult season with difficult weather."" In 2018 high-altitude medical expert Sundeep Dhillon explained to CNN that perhaps the biggest danger is when climbers treat the summit as the journey's end point. According to Dhillon's estimates, ""you've probably got a one in 10 chance of dying on the way down."" ""People are perfectly capable of exerting themselves beyond their capabilities whilst underestimating the demands that those extreme altitudes place on you,"" he said. ""They forget they're in the Death Zone."" Nepali climbing guide Dhruba Bista fell ill on the mountain and was transported by helicopter to the base camp, where he died Friday. And Irish climber Kevin Hynes, 56, died Friday morning on the Tibetan side of Everest in his tent at 7,000 meters (22,966 feet). Two died Wednesday after descending from the summit: Indian climber Anjali Kulkarni, 55, and American climber Donald Lynn Cash, 55. Kalpana Das, 49, and Nihal Bagwan, 27, both from India, also died on Everest this week. Both died Thursday on their return from the summit. Everest traffic jam creates lethal conditions for climbers Ravi, a 28-year-old Indian climber who goes by one name, died the previous week on May 17. Last week, a search for Irish climber Seamus Lawless, 39, was called off, after the Trinity College Dublin professor fell while descending from the peak, according to the Press Assocation. Lawless is missing, presumed dead. The death toll for Everest's 2019 climbing season is not unusual for the mountain. In 2018, five climbers died, while six died in both 2017 and 2016. More than 200 mountaineers have died on the peak since 1922, when the first climbers' deaths on Everest were recorded. The majority of bodies are believed to have remained buried under glaciers or snow. Correction: This story has been updated with the correct date of Fisher's Instagram post."

Markets aren't only fretting trade. Now they're worried about global growth,us.cnn.com,Julia Horowitz,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html,"London (CNN Business) 1. Bigger than trade: Investor anxiety about trade has quickly morphed into something much bigger: renewed worries about global economic growth.
Treasury yields are down, oil is under pressure and global economic data has disappointed. Stocks could face a rocky ride if that fear really sets in. ""When you actually look at some of the major economies outside the United States, many of them have homegrown problems,"" said Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory firm Yardeni Research. ""It's not all about trade."" Escalating tensions between the United States and China clearly pose a problem. Businesses are saying that new rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs will hit their bottom lines, while economists warn of global ripple effects. The situation is made worse by the fact that there's no end to the fight in sight. ""We don't see the US or China hurrying to reach a deal, and the risk of miscalculation is growing,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said in a recent note. Read More Goldman Sachs analysts said last week that if the United States moves forward with threatened tariffs on all remaining imports from China, it would push the US stock market down an additional 4%. Markets have already been rattled by trade fears: The Dow just declined for the fifth straight week — its longest weekly losing streak in nearly eight years. But it's not just about whether markets wake up to the fact that they'd priced in a trade deal that was far from certain. Apprehension over trade is now magnifying other signs of weakness, resurfacing concerns about slowing global growth that dominated markets in December. Recent economic data has revealed key soft spots. Manufacturing in Europe and China appears weak. Germany's economy appears to have slowed this quarter ""to little more than a crawl,"" according to research firm Capital Economics, which pointed to manufacturing and business climate figures. The chances of Britain crashing out of the European Union without a deal have also increased. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury fell to its lowest level last Thursday since late 2017. Bond yields tend to fall when investors are worried about sluggish growth. Then there's US oil, which fell nearly 7% last week to $58.63 a barrel. It was the worst week in five months. Though prices have since stabilized, a surge of crude inventories disclosed by the US government last week has raised the possibility of another supply glut — not unlike the one that sent crude crashing into a bear market late last year. All this comes as trade starts to weigh on top brands. ""Trade tensions create uncertainty,"" Yardeni said. ""Uncertainty causes companies to cut back on capital spending [and] on expansion."" Earnings expectations are already taking a hit. Kohl's, for example, last week lowered its guidance for the year in part due to higher costs from tariffs. The retailer imports about 20% of its merchandise from China. Roughly 77% of S&P 500 companies that have issued second quarter earnings guidance expect to come in below analysts' expectations, above the five-year average of 70%, according to FactSet. Should this data hold and pessimism sink in, investors could be in for even more trouble. ""Global equity markets are facing the perfect storm of headwinds in the form of persistent US-China trade drama, concerns over plateauing global growth and tumbling commodity prices,"" Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at currency trader FXTM, wrote in a note Friday. He continued: ""For as long as these themes remain in play, investor appetite for stocks is poised to evaporate — ultimately bringing equity bears back into the game."" 2. Economic data: New economic data out this week will be examined closely for signs on a global economic slowdown. Some key reports are due in Europe, including German consumer confidence and Eurozone business confidence on Tuesday, along with UK consumer confidence on Friday. In the United States, investors will watch for the second estimate of first quarter GDP growth. Initial estimates may have been wonky due to the government showdown. 3. Retail earnings: The US-China trade war will stay at the forefront of retail earnings as they roll into another week. Major retailers have developed strategies to blunt the impact of tariffs so far. But they're starting to warn that the trade war is impacting business. Walmart ( WMT ) , Target ( TGT ) , Home Depot ( HD ) , Kohl's ( KSS ) and Macy's ( M ) have all said that the tariffs have forced them to either alter their financial outlooks, remodel carefully crafted supply chains or consider raising price tags for customers. Investors will be on high alert for more problems as they gauge the health of the dollar store sector, as well as clothing retailers such as Gap ( GPS ) . In February, Gap announced it plans to spin off Old Navy into a separate company next year. Costco ( COST ) reports earnings on Thursday. Despite trade strain, Walmart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ) both posted strong starts to the year, and analysts expect Costco to continue big box retailers' hot streak. 4. Coming next week: Monday — US and UK markets closed
Tuesday — S&P/Case-Shiller home price index; US and German consumer confidence; Eurozone business confidence
Wednesday — Abercrombie & Fitch ( ANF ) and Dick's Sporting Goods ( DKS ) earnings; ExxonMobil ( XOM ) shareholder meeting
Thursday — Second estimate of US Q1 GDP; Dollar General ( DG ) , DSW parent company Designer Brands, Gap and Costco earnings
Friday — UK consumer confidence; US personal spending"
Pope likens abortion to 'hiring a hitman' at anti-abortion conference,edition.cnn.com,"Livia Borghese and Matthew Robinson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/pope-francis-abortions-hitman-rome-intl/index.html,"Rome (CNN) Pope Francis likened having an abortion to hiring a ""hitman"" while speaking at the ""Yes to Life"" anti-abortion conference in Rome Saturday.
The Pontiff stated that abortion was never acceptable -- not even in instances when fetuses are seriously ill -- and urged doctors to support women to complete all pregnancies. ""Is it licit to eliminate a human life to solve a problem?...Is it licit to hire a hitman to solve a problem?"" the Pope asked members of the audience. ""It is not lawful. Never, ever eliminate a human life or hire a hitman to solve a problem,"" he added. Pope Francis has suggested that abortions are never acceptable, not even in instances when fetuses are gravely ill. According to the Vatican, about 400 people from 70 countries attended the Vatican-sponsored conference, representing bishops' conferences, dioceses and doctors. Read More Speaking at the international conference, the Pope also criticized the ""dominant culture"" of today which he said promotes ""fear and hostility towards disability"" in children, and the subsequent choice of abortion. ""No human being can ever be incompatible with life, not for his age, nor for his health conditions, nor for the quality of his existence,"" the Pope asserted. ""Every child which arrives in a woman's womb is a gift,"" he added, noting that they all change the ""history of a family."" The Pope has previously compared having an abortion to ""resorting to a contract killer to solve a problem."" In the event that a baby is expected to die shortly after birth, the Pope said it should receive medical treatment while in the womb, and suggested that this approach could help parents grieve. ""Taking care of these children helps parents to grieve and not only think of it as a loss, but as a step on a path taken together,"" he said. The rising wave of abortion restrictions in America The Pope's remarks are not the first time that he has strongly condemned abortion. Last year, he compared abortion to ""resorting to a contract killer to solve a problem,"" while addressing worshipers in the Vatican. He subsequently faced fierce criticism from pro-choice campaigners and politicians. Franziska Giffey, the German family affairs minister, described Pope Francis' remarks as ""absolutely unacceptable."" ""Stigmatizing these women as contract killers is absolutely unacceptable,"" she said. ""Accusations and insults are the wrong way."" The Pope's remarks also come at a time of heightened sensitivity surrounding abortion in the US. ACLU, Planned Parenthood bring lawsuit against Alabama abortion law In early May, Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp signed a bill banning abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected. This can occur as soon as six weeks, before many women even know that they are pregnant. Alabama's Republican-controlled state Senate has also passed legislation that amounts to a near-total ban on abortion, and could lead to doctors who perform the procedure being sentenced to up to 99 years in prison. The bill does not include exceptions for cases of rape and incest, and only allows terminations ""to avoid a serious health risk to the unborn child's mother."""

But not toward impeachment, complained Zelizer --and that's a big mistake. Pelosi and her allies are trying to protect ""their partisan prospects in 2020"" rather than ensure that ""our constitutional checks and balances are working to restrain Trump right now, "" he said. Courage, valor, humility ""The old man said he didn't do anything. I only half believed him,"" began retired Rear Adm. John Kirby . He was writing about Charles Nease, an Army private who survived the Battle of Anzio in Italy during World War II -- and like many in his generation didn't want to take credit for his valor. Kirby visited him in a hospital when Nease was dying, and they talked about his love for his wife and his children. "" He did everything, everything a man could hope to do with his life and still call himself a man."" Memorial Day honors America's war dead, but Richard Morgan wrote that there also needs to be an occasion to "" honor our forgotten fallen — the appalling number of children who have died and continue to die because our way of life ."" He wrote: ""There is no Tomb of the Unknown Child,"" but thankfully, we have student advocates ""leading the movement for our fallen children...Our prayer should be that these students succeed in schooling us."" To infinity and beyond Graduates were tossing mortarboards last week and rushing to meet their futures. But it's hard to imagine a more joyous nudge than the one Robert F. Smith, a billionaire philanthropist, gave to Morehouse College's class of 2019. He said he'd pay off their student loans. ""Incredible generosity,"" wrote I ssac Bailey , but "" a lone billionaire -- or a gaggle of billionaires -- will never be enough to solve our growing student loan debt crisis ."" As LZ Granderson watched his son graduate -- debt free -- from New York University last week, he reflected that ""the hardest decision I ever made as a father was leaving the city where my then-5-year-old son lived with his mother (my ex-wife) so I could take a better-paying job. I did so with one singular goal in mind: to be in a better position to pay for his college tuition."" His happiness at his son's achievement was wound up with a certain regret: ""Presence over presents,"" he pondered. "" Was I second-guessing the strategy with which I accomplished my mission? "" Elbie Seibert , 2019 valedictorian at Columbia High School in Nampa, Idaho, lost his father to cancer a week before graduation. He wrote his commencement speech anyway: ""My body aches from missing him so much,"" Seibert said. ""I can feel him in my bones, hear him in my dreams, see him in my shadows -- and I find some small comfort in all of that."" The last year brought many lessons, he said, among them, "" never take anyone or anything for granted. "" For Evan Mandery , this weekend marks his 30th Harvard reunion. He's boycotting it over legacy admissions, which favor the already-privileged and furthers inequality, he wrote. "" The influence of money is sanitized in the admissions process through the concept of legacy ."" What Justin Amash did Michigan Congressman -- and Tea Party Republican -- Justin Amash took a giant step, all alone, away from his colleagues last weekend: ""President Trump has engaged in impeachable conduct,"" he tweeted. Republican lawmakers lined up to scorn him. Trump tweeted "" loser ."" But Dean Obeidallah cheered: "" Finally, a deeply conservative member of Congress ... has put the US Constitution before partisan loyalty to President Donald Trump."" Mitt Romney disagreed, telling told Jake Tapper he'd ""reached a different conclusion"": the report does not establish that Trump obstructed justice. "" The business of government can move on ,"" he tweeted. Please explain, wrote Teri Kanefield . Mueller himself clearly laid out the evidence of obstruction (though declined to charge), she wrote; Romney and others should show the public ""which particular parts of Mueller's analysis clear Trump and why. Otherwise, we really have no choice but to conclude that they are telling a politically expedient lie. "" Trump vowed to fight every subpoena Congress delivers as it digs into the details of the Mueller probe. One called for his former White House counsel, Don McGahn, to appear before the Judiciary Committee Tuesday. The White House told him to skip it and he did. Trump is winning here, insisted former federal prosecutor Elie Honig : "" The White House, fighting for its survival, is willing to bite, eye gouge and kidney punch , while Congress -- torn between pursuing justice and political expediency -- isn't even sure if it wants to fight at all."" Another smart take: Michael D'Antonio : Don McGahn, the White House official who stood up to Trump . Don't get cocky, candidates Meanwhile, the 2020 Democratic candidates for president (all 23) continued to wave their arms. Hey, America: Look at us. Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke took the stage at a CNN Town Hall Tuesday intent on rebooting his flagging campaign. But first, in an op-ed for CNN, he turned his attention to America's rural communities, suffering both from President Trump's trade wars and massive flooding across the Midwest, he wrote. "" We need to go to forgotten places ... and not only pay lip service to their problems , but listen to their ideas and welcome them to be a part of the solution."" Granderson was appalled to hear during a recent big-ticket, Democratic fundraiser, that donors were reluctant to throw in for a gay presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg, even though they really like the guy. "" I couldn't ignore the irony of hearing so many blue-state-living/rainbow-flag-adjacent /'love-is-love' liberals in one room dismiss Buttigieg's bid for the White House largely because he's gay ."" He added: ""There is a legitimate question about whether Democrats -- for all their talk -- believe it's worth fighting for a gay candidate."" And Jill Filipovic warned Democrats not to get cocky after a Quinnipiac poll this week showed Joe Biden far in the lead among Democrats, with Trump failing to get much credit for the flourishing economy. Voters are ""hungry for an alternative to Trump"" but they need a forward-looking ""dual message of integrity and opportunity,"" she wrote. ""2020 could very easily be a big win for Democrats. But complacency, and even reliance on the perceived safest choice, could mean another four years of Trump ."" San Francisco's raid on a reporter Carrying a sledge hammer and with guns drawn, San Francisco police recently raided the home of freelance reporter Bryan Carmody, handcuffing him for six hours and taking away thousands of dollars of equipment, photos and work materials. "" A stunning intrusion on press freedom, similar to what we see in autocratic regimes ,"" observed journalist Yashar Ali . ""If there isn't more outrage and accountability...other local law enforcement agencies will feel free to engage in the same dangerous conduct."" To the moon, everybody! Long before he was a billionaire and philanthropist, Richard Branson was a little kid watching the 1969 moon landing on a black-and-white TV, marveling at ""the courage it must have taken -- to turn something seemingly impossible into a reality. This fascination with flying, breaking boundaries and exploring the great unknown has never left me ."" Virgin Galactic's spaceship, VSS Unity -- eventually to be used for private paying passengers --reached space for the first time in December and the second in February. ""One of the most important and exciting things about exploring space is how it can bring us all together."" A looming problem for anti-abortion politicians? Back in 2016, before Trump was President, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd asked him: ""When he was a swinging bachelor in Manhattan, was he ever involved with anyone who had an abortion?"" Trump's response? ""Such an interesting question. So what's your next question?"" ""Imagine this for a moment,"" Joe Lockhart mused: President Trump ""standing next to a world leader at a joint news conference while an aggressive reporter asks, Mr. Trump, have you ever paid for an abortion, impregnated a woman and encouraged her to get one, or in any other way supported the termination of a pregnancy?'"" The legacy of restrictive laws on abortion in a slew of states may be a new, aggressive debate about the role men -- including politicians -- may have played in their sexual partners' abortion and how they might have benefited from it , Lockhart contends. It's later than you think Tornadoes and floods are strafing the Midwest, sea level is rising, croplands are swamped, atmospheric carbon dioxide has spiked and animal species are vanishing. Is it too late to save the earth? It's not, but heads of state, ministers, mayors and business leaders better get serious quick , entreated Helen Mountford . ""Global greenhouse gas emissions must peak no later than next year and rapidly decline thereafter"" for humans to stall the worst effects of climate crisis. When world leaders gather next year -- five years after the Paris Agreement of 2015 -- their ""revised plans will point humanity to a future that is either bright or bleak."" Two recent studies that showed both extinctions and sea-level rise accelerating ought to slap humans awake, wrote Carl Safina . Instead, the ""brutalizing affect"" of humans -- the tons of plastics found in the bodies of dead whales, the pesticide slaughter of pollinating insects, the disappearance of more than 80% of mammals -- continues. "" What then would you call something that is wiping out everything besides itself? Here's a short thesaurus of synonyms: disaster, cancer, Armageddon,"" he wrote. A life full of treasure ""Buried at the heart of all great children's literature, even the loveliest and most innocent, is a thread of darkness,"" noted Holly Thomas . And Judith Kerr, beloved author of The Tiger Who Came To Tea, the Mog the Cat stories, and When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, knew just where to find it. Kerr died last week at 95. Her family had fled Nazi Germany when she was a child, Thomas wrote, and her parents worked to shield her and her brother from the horrors swirling around them. ""Her attitude about her early experience seems almost preposterously optimistic -- she described life on the run as a child as 'wonderful,' and in her final years she said that given the chance, she'd not change a thing about her youth."" Her books imagined a better world but were shaded by loss, wrote Thomas. "" Kerr knew the possibilities and the perils life entailed, and chose to treasure every gift it offered. "" Don't miss these: Michael Slepian : Trump backers who were afraid to tell their loved ones . David Andelman : Secretly recorded video casts harsh light on Europe's far right . Grenada Prime Minister Keith C. Mitchell : Climate change is an existential threat for us in the islands . Yuliya Panfil and Tim Robustelli : The devastating storm recovery problem hiding in plain sight. Mark Hertling : Pardoning soldiers accused of war crimes would be immoral. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Fox News aired a video of Nancy Pelosi. The network is Fox Business Network. The video, which President Trump retweeted, was a compilation of Pelosi stammering. In a statement last week, a Fox Business Network spokesperson said ""The Fox Business segment featuring clips from Speaker Pelosi's speech today did not slow down any aspect of her address."""
Ireland to liberalize divorce laws following referendum - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Sarah Dean, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/ireland-divorce-referendum-scli-intl/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter,"(CNN) Divorce laws in the Republic of Ireland will be liberalized after the results of a referendum were revealed Sunday morning.
Results from Friday's referendum show 82% of voters want to change the existing law, which is enshrined in the constitution, under which a person can only apply for a divorce after living separately from their spouse for four out of the previous five years. The clause will now be removed, allowing lawmakers to decide on a new separation period. Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan tweeted Friday calling exit polls showing overwhelming support for the change ""very positive news."" ""I intend moving speedily with legislation to cut waiting time & thereby reduce upset & trauma on couples & children where marriages have irreconcilably broken down,"" wrote Flanagan. Read More Trump to visit Ireland during D-Day trip to UK and Normandy In March Flanagan said the government intends to reduce the living apart period to two years so both parties can ""move forward with their lives within a reasonable timeframe."" As things stand no one is exempt from the mandatory wait time, including those who are trying to leave abusive relationships, most of whom are women. Women suffering from domestic abuse could benefit from a shorter divorce process in order to protect themselves -- and their children -- from continued abuse from a former spouse, according to the National Women's Council of Ireland. Other individuals in the process of separating argue that the minimum wait time creates unnecessary levels of anxiety, prohibits their ability to move on, wreaks havoc on their emotional well-being and is a terrible financial burden. One man told CNN he had been to court 40 times and spent tens of thousands of euros on legal fees trying to get a divorce. It takes at least 4 years to apply for divorce in Ireland. Friday's vote is another test of the nation's values Michael Rossney said the long wait has fueled a hostile environment that has been exploited by the legal system, and that the proceedings -- and relationship with his ex -- could have been more positive if the mandatory period wasn't so drawn out. Divorced was only legalized in Ireland in 1995 by a small majority, 50.3%. Friday's referendum has become the latest in a series of measures reflecting modern Irish society that have recently questioned, and rejected, the historical role of the Catholic Church's doctrine on its institutions. Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote, with more than 60% voting yes in a referendum in 2015. And, earlier this year, it opened its first abortion services following the 2018 vote that repealed a constitutional amendment that had placed a near-ban on terminations. ""Ireland has really grown into a more tolerant and progressive society over the last 24 years,"" tweeted Irish Senator Catherine Noone following the divorce referendum result. "
It looks like any other graduation -- except these graduates earned their degrees in prison - CNN,www.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/25/us/prison-education-programs-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) There was pomp and circumstance. There were caps and gowns. Proud family members sat in the audience.
It looked like just another graduation ceremony -- except it took place at the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center in the town of Pacific, where all 10 of the graduates are incarcerated. The graduates received Associate of Arts degrees earlier this week from Washington University in St. Louis, becoming the university's first class of incarcerated graduates. To earn the degree, the men completed 20 courses across disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and mathematics -- all while serving time in prison. Washington University's Prison Education Project is just one of scores of programs across the country that grant liberal arts degrees to incarcerated or formerly incarcerated people. It's a departure from the vocational training typically offered in prisons, which seeks to find employment for inmates in industries such as welding, plumbing and auto repair after they are released. Prison education improves critical thinking Read More Carl Brock (left), Mark Boyd and Torey Adams congratulate a fellow student. For anyone wondering what benefits learning to solve calculus problems or reading Homer's ""The Odyssey"" provide to people in prison, Washington University's graduates will tell them: It's the critical thinking skills. ""Most people end up in prison because of bad decision-making skills,"" Torey Adams, who has been in prison for nearly 13 years for robbery and armed criminal action, said. Over time, Adams said, taking courses such as sociology and archaeology have helped him approach problems differently and have taught him to think things through before making a decision. ""You can't quite see it when it's happening but some way, somehow, it's teaching you to think critically,"" he said. ""I see how being a Wash U student affects me in other areas of my life."" Harvey Galler has been in and out of prison five times -- currently, he's serving a five-year sentence for statutory rape. He's set to be released in about seven months, and he said he sees an education as the only real opportunity for him once he's out of prison. The market for trade jobs is saturated and having a criminal record makes getting a job even harder. ""We've got this mark on us that other people don't have that we've got to compete with, so it's easier for them to get jobs,"" he said. ""If we're able to get this leap ahead with this education, I think that carries a lot more value."" Robert Henke, director of the school's Prison Education Project and a professor of drama and comparative literature, said he sees a strong determination to learn in his incarcerated students. Many have ambitions of eventually earning a Bachelor of Arts degree, or continuing on to even higher education. ""There's this kind of intensity, this sense for them that something's really at stake,"" Henke said. It also reduces the risk of returning to prison Harvey Galler (right) takes in the moment. Research shows that degree-granting prison education programs have a significant effect on reducing recidivism rates, meaning that programs like this make it less likely that former inmates will end up back in prison. And the idea has bipartisan support. ""Ensuring that people are able to participate in liberal arts programs that might empower them to be entrepreneurs or something like that as opposed to a tradesman is actually beneficial to the people themselves and society as a whole, as it helps them better find a job after prison,"" Ames Grawert, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said. Offering people in prison an opportunity to get a liberal arts education is also humanizing, Grawert said, because it recognizes that education isn't a ""one-size-fits-all solution."" Nikhil Pal Singh, the faculty director of a similar program at New York University, echoed that sentiment, saying that a liberal arts education provides people in prison access to more career opportunities. ""It's mistaken to think that basic liberal arts isn't what's needed for the professional world these days,"" Singh said. ""People need to be able to think, they need to be able to write, they need to be able to communicate. These are the kinds of skills you learn in a basic liberal arts college program."" In addition to courses in writing, math and social sciences, NYU's program also offers electives designed to introduce inmates to certain career paths, such as social work or business. NYU's prison education program also offers other opportunities generally available to college students, such as counseling and workshops on financial literacy and leadership development. The liberal arts empower graduates Torey Adams gets a hug at the ceremony. Back at Washington University, the program seems to have ignited a spark in some of its graduates. Adams said he intends to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and eventually start his own business focusing on entertainment hospitality. Galler said that after earning a bachelor's, he hopes to pursue a master's in social work to be a voice that represents people who have been incarcerated. Henke said he doesn't see Washington University's prison education program as a community service project. Instead, it's ""a chance to get out of the ivory tower"" and find talented students in places might otherwise be neglected. ""It's a matter of, 'Let's find really excellent students. Let's go beyond the normal confines. Let's look for excellence in different places, in some surprising places,'"" Henke said. ""It's not social work. It's not pity work."" That attitude showed at the graduation ceremony, where nothing in the program indicated that the graduates were in prison. From the catered food to the leather-bound diplomas, Adams said it made the experience that much more powerful. ""They really did everything they could to make us feel like we graduated in freedom as opposed to graduating in prison,"" he said. "

German Jews warned not to wear kippahs in public following spike in anti-Semitism,rss.cnn.com,"Matthew Robinson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/HjRwVqtUovM/index.html,"(CNN) German Jews have been warned by a leading government official not to wear traditional kippahs in all public settings following a rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country.
Felix Klein, the German government's anti-Semitism commissioner, told the Funke media group Saturday: ""My opinion has unfortunately changed compared with what it used to be. ""I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere all the time in Germany."" Klein suggested that a rise in ""social disinhibition and coarseness"" was to blame for the worsening situation. ""The internet and social media have also strongly contributed to this -- but also the continuous attacks on our culture of remembrance,"" he added. Demonstrators participated in a protest against anti-Semitism in Berlin in April. The commissioner has since called for specific training for police and other officials in order to combat the spike in anti-Semitic crimes. Read More There is ""a lot of uncertainty among the police and government officials in dealing with anti-Semitism,"" he said. He also suggested that many officials do not know what is permitted and what is not, and called for police, lawyers and teachers to be taught what is ""clearly defined"" as unacceptable behavior. Klein told CNN previously that ""anti-Semitism has always existed in Germany,"" but warned that it is now ""showing its ugly face more openly."" ""The word Jew as an insult was not common in my time when I went to school. Now it is, and it's even an insult at schools where there's no Jews, where there are no Jewish students. So that is a growing concern and of course we have to develop strategies to counter that."" His warning comes after the German government published figures that revealed a stark rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. The findings, released by the interior ministry, revealed that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose by nearly 20% last year, while physical attacks against Jews rose from 37 in 2017 to 62 last year. Horst Seehofer, the interior minister, has said that around 90% of the reported incidents were perpetrated by supporters of far-right groups. ""This is a development that we have to confront, especially in this country,"" Seehofer told a press conference in May. ""This is a job for the police as well as the whole society."" Claudi Vanoni, one of Germany's leading legal experts of antisemitism, had also warned that the issue remains ""deeply rooted"" in Germany. ""Anti-Semitism has always been there. But I think that recently, it has again become louder, more aggressive and flagrant,"" Vanoni told the AFP news agency. The two parties have more work to do to fight anti-Semitism Katarina Barley, Germany's justice minister, pledged to protect the Jewish way of life. ""The increasingly frequent attacks against Jews are shameful for our country. Right-wing movements are attacking our democracy and are targeting our peaceful coexistence,"" she told Handelsblatt newspaper. ""We must protect Jewish life with all our means in our nation of laws and hold the perpetrators accountable."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also denounced anti-Semitic crime in Germany and called for a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to tackling it. ""People growing up today must know what people were capable of in the past, and we must work proactively to ensure that it is never repeated,"" she said in a weekly video address in January."
"Naomi Osaka can win 10 grand slams, says Li Na",rss.cnn.com,Danielle Rossingh,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_tennis/~3/LTQCEi4AHCQ/index.html,"Beijing, China (CNN) Two-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka could dominate the women's game for years to come and win as many as 10 major titles, says Chinese great Li Na.
Osaka became the first Japanese player to clinch a singles slam when she won the US Open last year, and she followed it up by winning the Australian Open title in January. At 21, the US-based Osaka has the tennis world at her feet and Li, the first Asian player to win a grand slam singles title, said she is capable of great things. ""When she was playing tennis in Melbourne, I said to Dennis [her husband], 'She's very good. I think if she wants, 10 grand slams, easy to win,'"" Li, who won the French Open in 2011 and the 2014 Australian Open, told CNN Sport in an exclusive interview in Beijing. 'Pokerface' Read More Only seven women have won 10 grand slam titles or more, but Li said Osaka has the combination of power and mental strength all champions possess. ""(It is) because she is pretty strong, and also, and for her age, she has a lot of experience on the court,"" Li said after attending the Road to Wimbledon China event, the All England Lawn Tennis Club's junior tournament, in Beijing. ""She knows what she has to do, she is smart."" The top-ranked Osaka showed her resilience during a tumultuous US Open final , which was overshadowed by a row between the umpire and her opponent Serena Williams, the 23-time grand slam champion. In the end, Osaka defeated Williams, her idol growing up, 6-2 6-4. Naomi Osaka beat Serena Williams to clinch the US Open title in September 2018. Although Osaka had been in tears at the trophy ceremony as parts of the New York crowd booed the match officials, she followed up her maiden slam with a second major title, beating two-time Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic in three close sets at the Australian Open in Melbourne to rise to the top of the women's rankings. Osaka's strength of character on court has impressed Li. ""I like she has like a pokerface, doesn't matter what happened on the court, she has same face,"" Li said. READ: Why Li Na wants the movie about her life to inspire women 'Can she slide?' So far Osaka has yet to win a tournament on the slower red clay, and hasn't gone beyond the third round of Roland-Garros in Paris in three appearances. When asked if she thought the top-seeded Osaka could win the French Open, Li said: ""Does she know how to slide?"" Shortly after her Australian Open victory, Osaka parted ways with coach Sascha Bajin, the man who had guided her to two major titles and the No. 1 ranking. Having lost some momentum in the months after Melbourne, with early exits in Dubai, Indian Wells and Miami, Osaka has had an injury-marred clay-court season in Europe this spring. 😊 @RafaelNadal + @Naomi_Osaka_ = 😍 VAMOS!! Welcome to the #RafaNadalAcademy ! 🔝📸 pic.twitter.com/5yIZroAP04
— Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar (@rnadalacademy) May 1, 2019 Guided by a new coach, Jermaine Jenkins, Osaka reached the quarterfinals at last month's Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany, battling back from 5-1 down in the deciding set to beat Croatia's Donna Vekic, before an abdominal injury forced her to withdraw from the Stuttgart semifinals. Having spent the next week honing her clay-court skills at the academy of none other than 11-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal in Manacor, on the Spanish island of Mallorca, Osaka had a strong run in Madrid, where she reached the quarterfinals. Then injury struck again in Rome the week after, as Osaka withdrew with a right-hand injury ahead of a highly anticipated quarterfinal clash with Madrid champion Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands. ""My hand is better now, it's gets better every day,"" Osaka told reporters at Roland-Garros. Talking in Rome, the Japanese described her clay-court season as ""rocky,"" but she added in Paris that she has improved with every match. ""I feel I should be an all-court player,"" she said Friday. ""But it's been a bit of a ride trying to figure out how to play better on clay all these years, but this year I've been playing well so I'm really excited to see what happens here."" Big in Japan Born in Osaka, Japan, to a Haitian father and Japanese mother, Osaka has lived in the US since the age of three and is now based in Florida.

PayPal cofounder: Techies must grapple with morality of their creations - CNN,www.cnn.com,Sara Ashley O'Brien,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/24/tech/tech-morality-max-levchin/index.html,"Toronto (CNN Business) For years, tech companies pitched their products as tools for making the world a better place. Now, a growing number of tech veterans who were instrumental in building companies ranging from Google to Facebook and Twitter have admitted they didn't give enough thought into how their products could be used to do the opposite.
The latest to speak up about the lack of foresight by the tech set is seasoned entrepreneur and investor Max Levchin, who is best known as the cofounder and former chief technology officer of PayPal. Levchin says that in the early days of building the online payments system, which was founded in 1998, founders were mostly thinking of the benefits it would provide. ""I remember building PayPal, we were filled with libertarian ideals. We thought that it would be great to give the world a new currency,"" he said during an interview with CNN Business at the Collision tech conference in Toronto this week. ""We were not really asking the question, 'Is it good for humanity?'"" Most tech entrepreneurs idealistically focused on scaling their products at all costs, and the hype around their services centered on the promises of doing something good. Facebook and Twitter, for example, harped on the intention to connect the world and allow for freedom of expression, respectively. But these very services have been used to corrode democracies, spread misinformation, and to abuse and harass individuals, for example. Google, which had a ""don't be evil"" clause listed on its code of conduct for 18 years, has found itself in the spotlight over various ethical concerns including its canceled ""Project Maven"" collaboration with the Pentagon. Twitter co-founder calls President Trump 'master of the platform' Some Silicon Valley names joined together last year to launch the nonprofit Center for Humane Technology , including Roger McNamee. The tech investor and former adviser to Mark Zuckerberg has been a vocal critic for the past couple years, taking issue with the business models of Facebook and other tech giants and their prioritization of ad dollars. Other former Facebook executives have also publicly questioned the company's ethics. Read More There are also growing concerns about the emergence of new technologies like Amazon's facial recognition software, Rekognition, which critics worry could have potential civil and human rights repercussions. Ev Williams, the former CEO and cofounder of Twitter, said Twitter should have invested more heavily in abuse earlier, and that he ""personally underestimated the looming problem during my brief tenure as CEO."" Mounting antitrust scrutiny has Silicon Valley on the defensive Entrepreneurs today should be prepared to have nuanced answers to questions about morality, says Levchin, who is currently CEO of financial services startup Affirm, which he co-founded, as well as chairman and cofounder of period-tracking app Glow. He said entrepreneurs need to have the tough conversations early on, and be prepared to throw their weight behind their moral stances. ""You have to stand for something and deliver on that stance. ... Any Silicon Valley company that wants to scale itself to real meaningful size has to take an extremely moral view and speak to and be able to defend its actions and occasionally contend with very challenging, moral questions. The only way that Silicon Valley establishes that trust is by actively talking about those questions and answering with actions."" He says that when founding Affirm in 2013, morality was a central question. The company wants to offer a credit card alternative by providing loans for purchases, specifically for people who may not normally be approved by traditional banks. The loans come with a simple interest rate and no late fees. It says it does not sell or share user data with third parties. Levchin moved to Chicago from the Soviet Union in 1991 when he was just 16 and his family had ""just a few hundred dollars to our name."" He said he was ""declined for more credit cards than I can recall"" because he didn't have a credit history in college. He says he was fiscally responsible but no banks would take a chance on him. Sri Lanka's social media ban enters its second day ""We can choose to decline an application for a loan if it is for an item that we don't support,"" Levchin said, adding that debt is ""a very weighty, morality-centric issue."" He asks: ""Is it good to borrow money? I think it is, if you are investing it in a better version of your future self."" As questions about the ethics and morals of tech platforms continue to be raised by critics, entrepreneurs may have to be more realistic about the benevolence and malevolence of their services. Meanwhile, some are growing tired of the frequently cited notion that technology is amoral, and that people make it bad or good. ""If we continue to say ... 'we are building devices, they get used for good and they get used for bad. That's not really our concern.' I think that's exactly what brought us to this point,"" Levchin added. "

Pope likens abortion to 'hiring a hitman' at anti-abortion conference,us.cnn.com,"Livia Borghese and Matthew Robinson, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/pope-francis-abortions-hitman-rome-intl/index.html,"Rome (CNN) Pope Francis likened having an abortion to hiring a ""hitman"" while speaking at the ""Yes to Life"" anti-abortion conference in Rome Saturday.
The Pontiff stated that abortion was never acceptable -- not even in instances when fetuses are seriously ill -- and urged doctors to support women to complete all pregnancies. ""Is it licit to eliminate a human life to solve a problem?...Is it licit to hire a hitman to solve a problem?"" the Pope asked members of the audience. ""It is not lawful. Never, ever eliminate a human life or hire a hitman to solve a problem,"" he added. Pope Francis has suggested that abortions are never acceptable, not even in instances when fetuses are gravely ill. According to the Vatican, about 400 people from 70 countries attended the Vatican-sponsored conference, representing bishops' conferences, dioceses and doctors. Read More Speaking at the international conference, the Pope also criticized the ""dominant culture"" of today which he said promotes ""fear and hostility towards disability"" in children, and the subsequent choice of abortion. ""No human being can ever be incompatible with life, not for his age, nor for his health conditions, nor for the quality of his existence,"" the Pope asserted. ""Every child which arrives in a woman's womb is a gift,"" he added, noting that they all change the ""history of a family."" The Pope has previously compared having an abortion to ""resorting to a contract killer to solve a problem."" In the event that a baby is expected to die shortly after birth, the Pope said it should receive medical treatment while in the womb, and suggested that this approach could help parents grieve. ""Taking care of these children helps parents to grieve and not only think of it as a loss, but as a step on a path taken together,"" he said. The rising wave of abortion restrictions in America The Pope's remarks are not the first time that he has strongly condemned abortion. Last year, he compared abortion to ""resorting to a contract killer to solve a problem,"" while addressing worshipers in the Vatican. He subsequently faced fierce criticism from pro-choice campaigners and politicians. Franziska Giffey, the German family affairs minister, described Pope Francis' remarks as ""absolutely unacceptable."" ""Stigmatizing these women as contract killers is absolutely unacceptable,"" she said. ""Accusations and insults are the wrong way."" The Pope's remarks also come at a time of heightened sensitivity surrounding abortion in the US. ACLU, Planned Parenthood bring lawsuit against Alabama abortion law In early May, Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp signed a bill banning abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected. This can occur as soon as six weeks, before many women even know that they are pregnant. Alabama's Republican-controlled state Senate has also passed legislation that amounts to a near-total ban on abortion, and could lead to doctors who perform the procedure being sentenced to up to 99 years in prison. The bill does not include exceptions for cases of rape and incest, and only allows terminations ""to avoid a serious health risk to the unborn child's mother."""
Trump dances with danger in Middle East by deploying aircraft carrier and a 'peace plan',us.cnn.com,Analysis by Tamara Qiblawi,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/middleeast/trump-middle-east-iran-analysis-trump-intl/index.html,"(CNN) In the Persian Gulf, a US aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln , lurks off the Iranian coast, sending out a message of aggression. Meanwhile, in the Levant, the administration of US President Donald Trump starts to roll out his version of a widely anticipated peace plan for the Israelis and the Palestinians.
The US appears to be banging war drums at the same time it's, conversely and perhaps superficially, extending an olive branch just a few hundred miles away. But the events in the Levant and the Persian Gulf could be two sides of the same coin. Both are aimed at strong-arming parties into accepting the tough demands of America and its allies, and both could propel decades-long tensions toward a new, and possibly more violent, chapter in the region's history. The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge, right, the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, and the Spanish navy Alvaro de Bazan-class frigate ESPS Méndez Núñez transit the Strait of Gibraltar, entering the Mediterranean Sea. Charting dangerous waters in the Persian Gulf For long-time experts in the region, recent events in the Persian Gulf tread into dangerous territory. The escalation of tensions between Iran and the US, as well as its allies, could easily spiral out of control. All the while, Trump has intensified his bid to get Iran to negotiate. Read More When Trump first pulled out of the landmark nuclear accords in 2018, he slammed it as a ""bad deal"" and tightened the noose on Iran's economy with several rounds of sanctions. Iran's government responded with what experts dub ""strategic patience."" The Islamic Republic's diplomats appealed to Europe for support in keeping the nuclear deal afloat, as the country, by all accounts, continued to abide by its end of the bargain. But on May 8, exactly a year after Trump's pull-out from the deal, the tide changed. In Tehran, specter of war met with more defiance than fear In April, Trump ratcheted up pressure on Iran, removing oil export exemptions that acted as a lifeline for sanctions-ridden Tehran, and announcing that he intended to deploy the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region. The aircraft carrier began to make its way to the Persian Gulf on May 5. Rather than absorb the shocks, Iran retaliated. It announced a part-suspension of its commitment to the nuclear accord, and said it would increase uranium enrichment, a potential step to creating a nuclear weapon. And a series of flashpoints in the region began to flare up. An Iranian woman walks past a currency exchange shop in the capital Tehran, Iranians, where locals are hard hit by punishing US economic sanctions ""The main premise of the maximum pressure campaign has been economic coercion,"" said Crisis Group's Iran analyst, Naysan Rafati. ""By issuing close to 1,000 sanctions designations, by putting a 'foreign terror organization' tag on the [elite wing of Iran's military] Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, by cutting Iran's oil's exports ... (the US hoped) that Iran would come back to the table. ""But what we've definitely seen is a response from Iran on the nuclear front ... and the risk has always been that there would be a response on the regional front,"" said Rafati. ""It's as if (the Iranians) suggest that 'you can put us under significant economic duress, but we also have cards to play.'"" Iran tensions spotlight Trump's questionable credibility It is unclear if Iran has activated its regional network of sympathetic armed groups to act on its behalf. But in the days that followed the May 8th announcement, the UAE reported a sabotage attack on four oil tankers off the coast of the strategic port city of Fujairah -- Iran has denied any involvement. Iran-backed Yemen rebels mounted a first-ever attack on a Saudi oil pipeline , and a Katyusha rocket was launched into Baghdad's Green Zone, where the US embassy is. ""We've certainly had a series of escalations,"" said Rafati. ""Clearly, Iran's 'strategic patience' is giving way to some degree of strategic impatience."" Iran refuses Trump's offer of talks unless US shows 'respect' And there's no end in sight. Tehran has rebuffed Trump's overtures to talk. The economy has buckled under incessant sanctions and political discontent is rising, putting pressure on Tehran to act. The Iranian government has warned that it should not be tested, while assuring the public that it does not expect war. In countering Tehran's rhetoric, the US largely mirrored it. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that the US does not want war, while Trump threatened to bring the ""official end to Iran"" in case of conflict. US narrative on Iran questioned as allies call for 'restraint' ""Even if the (the US) aim is not to initiate some sort of armed conflict, the higher you raise tensions the more chance for a mistake, for something to happen that will spiral out of control really fast,"" said former US Secretary of the Navy and former ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ray Mabus. ""I think we're significantly closer (to war), certainly than we were when we negotiated the (nuclear) treaty which from all appearances was working,"" said Mabus. ""Now we have a president that pulled us out of it and said 'I can make a better deal.' Well, he hasn't. In fact, he's made things much worse."" 'The deal of the century' Many in the region believed the days and weeks that followed the May 8 announcement to be critical. The UAE sabotage attacks sounded alarm bells in a country that consistently champions its political stability and safety. The Saudi pipeline attacks sent oil prices upward. But amid the erratic developments in the Persian Gulf, Trump's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner unfurled the first part of his long-awaited peace plan for the Israelis and the Palestinians. The events appeared out of sync, but the underlying messages were similar. Though only the economic dimension of the so-called peace plan has been unveiled, Kushner has signaled that the Palestinians should make political concessions. ""People are letting their grandfather's conflict destroy their children's futures. This will present an exciting, realistic and viable pathway forward that does not currently exist,"" Kushner told CNN in a statement. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner, US President's daughter Ivanka Trump, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Israel's President Reuven Rivlin attend the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018. The senior administration official said the plan would discuss four major components: infrastructure, industry, empowering and investing in people and governance reforms. The initiative comes after Trump strengthened Israel's hand on some final-status issues such as the status of Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. He has recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and withdrawn vital funds for Palestinian refugees. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also vowed to annex West Bank settlements, illegal according to international law. The promise, made in the closing days of an election campaign, received no objection from the US. The Palestinians have already spurned the Kushner proposal, which centers on an economic ""workshop"" in the Bahraini capital to encourage investment in the West Bank, Gaza, and the region. Iran stance is straight from Trump's North Korea playbook ""The Trump administration's vision is being implemented on the ground with their decisions and positions on Jerusalem, settlements and refugees, among others,"" Palestine Liberation Organization Secretary General Saeb Erekat said in a statement. Erekat said the solution to conflict ""is not about improving living conditions under occupation but about reaching Palestine's full potential by ending the Israeli occupation."" To some, the Trump administration's sidelining of the Palestinian leadership spells the end of the two-state solution, long favored by the international community, where an independent Palestinian state would be established alongside Israel. ""My hope is that (Kushner's proposal) leads to a situation where the political deal is not released, thereby not leading to this vicious cycle where we end up with further Israeli annexations of the West Bank, the further destabilization of the Palestinian Authority, and an end to the possibility of the two-state solution,"" said Hady Amr, a former deputy special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under former President Barack Obama's administration. ""As unlikely as the two-state solution is, I still think it's a more likely outcome than any other in the coming decade."" With both the Iranians and the Palestinians, Trump appears to try to extract major political concessions with promises of vast economic riches. ""(Trump) is using a very big stick with a very small carrot,"" said Iran expert Rafati. In both these cases, the moves are seen as a bid to chip away at sovereignty, and it is being met with considerable resistance. But while the counter-forces have so far rendered the political situation inert, it could soon take on new dimensions that policy-makers may be ill-equipped to tackle."

Joni Ernst said Sunday that the US-China trade war is ""hurtful"" to farmers, a group that makes up a considerable portion of her Iowa constituency.
""But as we have heard from our farmers, they do want us to find a path forward with China. The tariffs are hurtful right now, but the President will continue negotiating. We hope that we can get a deal soon,"" Ernst told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" Trump sends $16 billion to bailout farmers hurt by China trade war ""This is a really difficult situation that the farmers are in. Just to remind the viewers that one in five jobs in Iowa is tied directly to trade. Most of that is around the farming sector, our agricultural sector. So it is very tense times,"" Ernst said. The senator added that while she would like to see a trade deal between the two countries reached in the coming months, she ""doesn't see that happening this summer."" ""The President has asked those farmers to hang on just a little bit longer. It is tenuous, it is hurting in the Midwest. It's hurting all over the country with the tariffs, but at the same time we do have to get China to the table,"" she said. ""We have to stop them from stealing intellectual property. We have to stop them from forced technology transfers. Read More ""All of that is detrimental, not only to our economy, but to our national security. So the President has called our farmers patriots. It doesn't pay the bills. It doesn't pay the bills. But we will see in the upcoming months how long we can sustain."" US farmers have been among the hardest hit by the escalating trade war between the two countries, and both sides are bracing for additional pain resulting from the latest volley of tariffs announced earlier this month. No, China is not paying for Trump's bailout for US farmers Last week, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced that the federal government will spend an additional $16 billion to help farmers hurt by the trade war. Perdue said that the farmer aid will be paid for by an equivalent amount the US expects to pull in through tariffs. But Perdue also claimed that ""China's gonna pay for these"" -- a false assertion made repeatedly by Trump . The bailout was approved by Trump, Perdue said, in order to undermine China's efforts to retaliate against US tariffs. The President is expected to address the new farmer aid package later this week at the White House."

Ireland to liberalize divorce laws following referendum - CNN,www.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Sarah Dean, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/ireland-divorce-referendum-scli-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Divorce laws in the Republic of Ireland will be liberalized after the results of a referendum were revealed Sunday morning.
Results from Friday's referendum show 82% of voters want to change the existing law, which is enshrined in the constitution, under which a person can only apply for a divorce after living separately from their spouse for four out of the previous five years. The clause will now be removed, allowing lawmakers to decide on a new separation period. Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan tweeted Friday calling exit polls showing overwhelming support for the change ""very positive news."" ""I intend moving speedily with legislation to cut waiting time & thereby reduce upset & trauma on couples & children where marriages have irreconcilably broken down,"" wrote Flanagan. Read More Trump to visit Ireland during D-Day trip to UK and Normandy In March Flanagan said the government intends to reduce the living apart period to two years so both parties can ""move forward with their lives within a reasonable timeframe."" As things stand no one is exempt from the mandatory wait time, including those who are trying to leave abusive relationships, most of whom are women. Women suffering from domestic abuse could benefit from a shorter divorce process in order to protect themselves -- and their children -- from continued abuse from a former spouse, according to the National Women's Council of Ireland. Other individuals in the process of separating argue that the minimum wait time creates unnecessary levels of anxiety, prohibits their ability to move on, wreaks havoc on their emotional well-being and is a terrible financial burden. One man told CNN he had been to court 40 times and spent tens of thousands of euros on legal fees trying to get a divorce. It takes at least 4 years to apply for divorce in Ireland. Friday's vote is another test of the nation's values Michael Rossney said the long wait has fueled a hostile environment that has been exploited by the legal system, and that the proceedings -- and relationship with his ex -- could have been more positive if the mandatory period wasn't so drawn out. Divorced was only legalized in Ireland in 1995 by a small majority, 50.3%. Friday's referendum has become the latest in a series of measures reflecting modern Irish society that have recently questioned, and rejected, the historical role of the Catholic Church's doctrine on its institutions. Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote, with more than 60% voting yes in a referendum in 2015. And, earlier this year, it opened its first abortion services following the 2018 vote that repealed a constitutional amendment that had placed a near-ban on terminations. ""Ireland has really grown into a more tolerant and progressive society over the last 24 years,"" tweeted Irish Senator Catherine Noone following the divorce referendum result. "
Bill de Blasio: 1994 crime bill was a 'huge mistake' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/politics/bill-de-blasio-1994-crime-bill-huge-mistake-cnntv/index.html,"(CNN) New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday said the 1994 crime bill was a ""huge mistake"" and those responsible for the legislation, including former Vice President Joe Biden , must be accountable and ""speak to it.""
""That crime bill was one of the foundations of mass incarceration in a very painful era in our nation's history,"" de Blasio, a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" ""The (former) vice president and anyone else has to be accountable for every vote they take and what's on their record, and I think that was a huge mistake,"" he said. De Blasio said there is a ""mass incarceration crisis"" in the US and said ""federal policies, including that crime bill, were a big part of why untold thousands of people and families had their lives entirely disrupted and in many ways destroyed because folks who had done very little were sent to very long sentences."" Fact-checking Biden's claim the '94 crime bill didn't cause mass incarceration ""We've got to break out of that and anyone responsible has to be accountable and has to speak to it,"" he said. Read More Biden recently said the bill, which he helped write as senator from Delaware, ""did not generate mass incarceration."" Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris of California said she disagrees with Biden's assessment of the bill, which tightened federal sentencing guidelines and provided federal funds for new cops and prisons. Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor and Democratic presidential candidate, said the ""bad"" caused by the controversial bill ""outweighs the good."" He said the bill contributed to mass incarceration and its biggest impact could be the breaking up of families, especially those of color, and how that has affected children. Debate over the crime bill's lasting implications has been playing out on the 2020 campaign trail and is expected to continue in the crowded race for the Democratic nomination. Three 2020 Democratic candidates for president supported the crime bill: Biden, then-Rep. Bernie Sanders and then-Rep. Jay Inslee. But Biden, who was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, played the largest role in the legislation."

"Food recall: If you're firing up the grill for the holiday weekend, avoid all these recalled items - CNN",www.cnn.com,AJ Willingham,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/health/memorial-day-recall-meat-hotdogs-flour/index.html,"(CNN) If you're planning on firing up the grill this Memorial Day weekend, you may want to double check your fridge and pantry before you get a very un-festive surprise.
Several items have been recalled for reasons ranging from possible E. coli contamination to metal fragments. Here are the recalled items: Flour The discount supermarket chain Aldi recalled 5-pound bags of its Baker's Corner All-Purpose Flour on Thursday because they may be contaminated with E. coli. Read More Seventeen people have been reported sick in eight states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Three of those people have been hospitalized. There have been no deaths. Flour sold at Aldi recalled Those who got sick ate, licked or tasted raw, homemade dough or batter. The CDC states that eating or tasting raw dough or batter can make a person sick. The illnesses began December 11, 2018 and the latest began April 18, the CDC said. The recalled flour was sold at Aldi locations in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. Steak, ribs and brisket The US Department of Agriculture issued a recall for more than 62,000 pounds of raw beef Wednesday due to E. coli concerns. The meat was shipped nationwide for distribution, and the products being recalled have the establishment number ""EST. 788"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. 62,000 pounds of raw meat are being recalled The recall includes more than 40 products, most of which are cuts of steak, like ribeyes, as well as ribs and brisket cuts. Read the full list of products being recalled. People sometimes like to freeze cuts of meat for future use, so if you've socked away some beef in your backup freezer recently, you may want to check that as well. The possible E. coli contamination was discovered after a random sampling, and the USDA says there have been no reported cases of illness related to this recall. People usually get sick two to eight days after ingesting the germ, the CDC says. Symptoms of E.coli infections include stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Some infections are mild, but others can be life-threatening. Hot dogs This follows an earlier recall this month of more than 2,000 pounds of Vienna Beef hot dogs over concerns they may contain metal fragments. Vienna Beef recalls hot dogs that might contain metal fragments In the latest recall, Chicago-style dogs were shipped to food service locations in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, according to the US Department of Agriculture. They were packaged in 10-pound cases of Skinless Beef Frankfurters with ""EST. 1"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. Produced May 2, the potentially contaminated products have been identified by the USDA online. The recall was limited to restaurants and had ""nothing to do with grocery store product,"" said Tom McGlade, vice president of marketing for the Chicago-based company. So far, there have been no reports of a health problem caused by eating these products. Anyone concerned about a possible injury or illness should contact a health care provider. "

""That was definitely the hardest race I've had but nonetheless I really was fighting with the spirit of Niki [Lauda],"" said an emotional Hamilton after the race. After recovering from a near-fatal accident to become one of motor racing's greatest drivers, Lauda served as a non-executive chairman of Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix and was influential in bringing Hamilton to the team.

However, it was the first time this season that a Mercedes one-two was disturbed, with Hamilton's teammate Bottas falling to third after starting the race second on the grid. Much of that was down to a controversial pit stop that saw Verstappen make contact with Bottas as they both exited the pit lanes, causing the Finnish driver to fall behind both the Dutchman and Sebastian Vettel. ""It was small margins yesterday and that made today difficult. Max got me in the pit lane and left me with no room and then I was stuck behind, it was like a Sunday drive,"" said a frustrated Bottas, after finishing the race behind Ferrari's Vettel.

"Sophie Toscan du Plantier trial: More than two decades after a woman was killed in an Irish village, French prosecutors hope to close the case - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Kara Fox and Antoine Crouin, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/sophie-toscan-du-plantier-trial-ian-bailey-france-intl/index.html,"Schull, Ireland (CNN) Perched on a bench in the quiet courtyard of a pub, Ian Bailey is signing a copy of his self-published book of poetry for a young American woman. He then opens a folded paper printout of his latest work.
It best describes his current state of mind, he says. The poem, ""I'm feeling like John Wayne"" describes a man aggrieved. The prose is pained and indignant -- a mood that's worlds away from the roar of laughter that flows from inside the packed pub. Schull, a picturesque fishing village nestled along the craggy coastline of Ireland's southernmost peninsula, sees a very short tourist season. But today, the rural community of 700 people is enjoying the atmosphere as hundreds flood the streets for its annual international film festival. The area of West Cork however, is no stranger to foreigners. It's long served as an outpost for artists from across the globe seeking solace and space, with its holiday homes and winding roads well traversed by wealthy travelers looking to disconnect from the daily grind. Read More Bailey is one of those ""blow-ins,"" a local term to describe a person not born in the locality. The Manchester, UK-born former journalist moved to the area in 1991 with a plan to focus on his writing and poetry, enticed by the lure of the area. So had Sophie Toscan du Plantier, a 39-year-old French television producer who found refuge from her busy Parisian life at her isolated farmhouse on the northern side of the Mizen peninsula, a 25-minute drive from Schull. It was an area where people would leave their keys in the doors in case a visitor got stuck in the rain but there was no one at home to receive them; a place where children were safe to run errands on their own because everyone knew who ""belonged to who,"" according to a dozen locals that CNN spoke with. But all that changed on December 23, 1996, when Toscan du Plantier was found bludgeoned to death near the gate of her holiday home with some 50 wounds found on her slight frame. Sophie Toscan du Plantier is seen in this undated handout photo. Days after her murder, local police began questioning Bailey, who lived nearby and had been tasked with reporting on the murder for a national paper. He was arrested twice: first in February 1997 alongside his partner Jules Thomas and then again in January 1998. No forensic evidence linked Bailey -- or Thomas -- to the scene of the crime, and they were released without charge. Both have denied any involvement in Toscan du Plantier's death. Bailey's actions throughout the ordeal however, created a cloud of suspicion, according to many locals, one that has continued to follow him around West Cork in the two decades since. Weeks after the murder, Bailey's editor at the now defunct Sunday Tribune told police that he told her that he killed Toscan du Plantier to resurrect his career. According to police documents Bailey admitted it but said it was a joke. A 44-page file from the Irish Office of the Director of the Public Prosecution also reveals other alleged informal admissions by Bailey, but also notes that some of those statements were unreliable and that Bailey has always held a public position of innocence. In the years following his arrests, Bailey alleged he was wrongfully arrested and a victim of police corruption. In 2015, Bailey lost a civil action in the High Court on those claims. A subsequent review by the Irish policing watchdog found problems in the way that Bailey's arrest was handled, but concluded in 2018 that there was no evidence of police corruption. No one else has been charged for Toscan du Plantier's death as the years have passed. A memorial marks the spot where Sophie Toscan du Plantier was killed outside her holiday home in County Cork, Ireland. 'Don't be surprised if you get arrested' In Goleen, a tiny village between Toscan du Plantier's farmhouse and Schull, one woman who asked not to be identified out of concern of potentially being recognized in the small town community, said that after two decades of thinking about it, she still wasn't sure how she felt -- other than uneasy. ""If he didn't do it, his life has been a nightmare for 20-odd years,"" she said. ""But if he did do it, he's gotten away with murder."" Pete Beleski, a former neighbor and friend of Bailey's told CNN that Bailey often loved being the center of attention, saying that ""there's a sort of a notoriety he possible enjoys to a degree."" Beleski added that Bailey shouldn't have been surprised that he was arrested, saying that he knew of a number of occasions in which Bailey had professed -- whether serious or not -- to having done the crime. Beleski's relationship with Bailey was crafted around their mutual love for traditional music. Beleski said it came to an abrupt halt after he bore witness to the aftermath of a brutal domestic violence incident. Six months before Toscan du Plantier's death, Beleski said that he drove Thomas, Bailey's partner, to the hospital after Bailey violently assaulted her. The assault Beleski detailed to CNN is one Bailey has publicly admitted to in court proceedings, saying that the domestic violence he had committed against her was to ""my eternal shame ,"" and one that Beleski recounted as a witness. Beleski says that he hasn't come to any conclusion about Bailey's alleged involvement in Toscan du Plantier's death. ""If we can't prove it, how can anyone else?"" Beleski asked. Ian Bailey, and his solicitor, Frank Buttimer, leave Dublin High Court after he won the right to appeal his extradition order to France. But the French feel differently. Under France's Napoleonic law, authorities can investigate crimes against French citizens committed outside of its French borders, although they cannot insist that witnesses travel for questioning. In 2010, France first tried to bring Bailey before a French court by issuing a European arrest warrant. An Irish High Court ordered that Bailey surrender to France, but Bailey won the right to stay on appeal in 2012, a decision again upheld by the Supreme Court in 2017 . Now, the French prosecution is going a step further. On Monday, Bailey will be tried for murder in absentia in Paris. Toscan du Plantier's family has long pushed for Bailey to be brought to trial in France. A judiciary source at the French public prosecutor's office told CNN that they are basing their case on the testimony of 30 quoted witnesses, five quoted experts and information from a French fact-finding mission. The source would not confirm if any witnesses would be attending in person. Beleski, who had provided testimony to Irish police, said that he had not been contacted by the French authorities, nor had other former witnesses that he has recently spoken to. 'An exceptional case' While trials in absentia are not unusual in France, the Bailey case is quite rare, according to legal expert and criminal defense attorney Stephane Babonneau, who is not affiliated with the case. ""It is an exceptional case to have two countries, two justices, two laws, who have (come to) such a different conclusion,"" Babonneau told CNN, noting that cases like this happen only once in every four or five years. Bailey's Irish solicitor, Frank Buttimer, and his French lawyer, Dominique Tricaud, said they will not being attending the trial, which Buttimer characterized as a ""paper exercise."" Speaking to CNN, Buttimer said that the French system has ""no respect"" for the Irish judiciary, who has twice dropped charges against Bailey. He believes the French prosecution has already made a decision and a ruling will be made in the time it takes for the ""rubber stamp to hit the page."" The judiciary source at the French public prosecutor's office said, ""It isn't a show trial, it is a trial that needs to happen because it is part of French law."" ""Justice does not stop in France,"" he added. The strategy on the part of the local Irish police to have Bailey ostracized was a device used back in 1996 and 1997, when they targeted him as the killer, Buttimer said. Part of the ostracizing process was to make people afraid of him, fearful that he might commit the same type of offense so they might say things that might be beneficially to the prosecution, he added. But that line failed, Buttimer said, noting that the director of public prosecution at the time described evidence gathered by Irish police as ""thoroughly flawed and prejudiced."" ""That's 22 years ago. Yet the French are coming around now using the exact same evidence -- nothing new, nothing different,"" Buttimer said. If Bailey is found guilty, France will once again demand his extradition, according to a judicial source at the Paris prosecutor's office. The Church of Our Lady, Star of the Sea, and St. Patrick in Goleen, where Pierre Louis Baudey Vignaud, appealed to local witnesses to travel to Paris to testify at the trial. Toscan du Plantier's son, Pierre Louis Baudey Vignaud, who was 15 at the time of his mother's killing, told CNN that he ""cannot imagine Ireland not moving if there is a condemnation is France."" ""Little by little, the noose is tightening. The French justice will be an important guide,"" he added. Last week, Vignaud attended a memorial mass in Goleen, where he urged local witnesses to travel to Paris to testify at the upcoming trial. A woman from Goleen who asked to remain anonymous, said while she understood Vignaud's pain, the ""pulpit is not a place for this,"" a sentiment expressed by a handful of other locals CNN spoke to in Schull. And while securing a conviction in France might provide some closure for Toscan du Plantier's family, many people in West Cork say that it wouldn't change their feelings either way. Inside O'Sullivan's bar in Crookhaven, believed to be one of the last places Sophie Toscan du Plantier was seen before she was murdered. At O' Sullivans Bar in Crookhaven, a 15-minute drive from Toscan du Plantier's holiday home, and one of the last places she was seen before her murder, owner Billy O'Sullivan says there's nothing left to say. ""Even if they try and prove him guilty, how does that change anything if they can't get at him?"" O'Sullivan asked.

""This is our final ride in Washington, DC. Until we can get into the White House and talk to President Trump and see what he can do for us -- this is our final ride in Washington,"" Bean said, after being informed of Trump's tweet. In December, the group said it would be hosting its last event in Washington during Memorial Day weekend in 2019.

They are great Patriots who I have gotten to know and see in action. They love our Country and love our Flag. If I can help, I will!"" The Pentagon, which works with Rolling Thunder to to help plan the event, said last week that the group ""pays only a portion"" of the costs associated with reserving space outside the building. ""All outside events pay fees to use the Pentagon Reservation. The fee includes costs for overtime for security and reimbursement for clean up after an event. Rolling Thunder, Inc. pays only a portion of the total costs incurred by the Pentagon to support the event,"" Sue Gough, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense, said in a statement to CNN. ""We are proud of our history of providing a safe operating area for events on the Pentagon Reservation, to include Rolling Thunder every year,"" Gough said. ""The Pentagon civilian workforce, including PFPA, have a large veteran presence, and we especially appreciate the opportunity to support events that honor those who've served and sacrificed."" Instead of the gathering in the nation's capital, there will now be regional events organized by various chapters to honor those killed in action or who were prisoners of war, according to the group's organizers.

Venezuela's gas shortages create days-long lines - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Stefano Pozzebon,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/americas/gas-shortages-venezuela-intl/index.html,"(CNN) For many Venezuelans, oil is a birthright in the country blessed with the largest crude reserves in the world. Despite wild hyperinflation, Venezuela's government has never increased the price of gasoline. Today, amid a crushing economic crisis, filling up a tank in Venezuela is still basically free -- but only if you can afford to wait for days in line.
Over the last two weeks, people from several states in Venezuela have described severe gas shortages. It's not the first time that the country has suffered gas shortages, but previous crises were blamed on bad distribution and logistical inefficiency. This time, as citizens find themselves queuing for days at the gas stations, many are starting to fear there simply is not enough oil for all. Caracas is still fueled by a steady supply, which critics of the embattled President Nicolas Maduro describe as politically motivated favoritism: Keeping the capital well supplied helps prevent further anti-government protests, after months of violent unrest. But in the western city of San Cristobal del Tachira, Lorena Amaya, 42, spent three days sleeping in her car with her sister, as they waited in line to fill the tank with gas. The two sisters parked their vehicles one in front of the other and placed a mattress in the first one to create a bed. ""Today, it's my son's birthday, and look where am I,"" she told CNN. She only briefly left the gas queue to visit her 10-year-old son that morning, while her sister held the spot. Read More ""I ask the neighbor to keep an eye for him while I am here, but he's home by himself,"" she said. Her sister Ymara, 40, describes the fuel as ""the most expensive gasoline we ever bought"" because of the three days of lost work and life that she has spent waiting in line. How this happened In 1989, large riots hit Caracas after the government of then-president Carlos Andres Perez announced the end of a gasoline subsidy which had maintained the prices well beneath market level. Since then, increasing the price of oil has become taboo for Venezuelan politicians. Thirty years later, and after five years of deep economic crisis under Maduro, oil is still cheap, but production has dropped to levels unseen since the 1940s. In April 2019, Venezuela only produced 830,000 barrels per day, down from 1.2 million at the beginning of the year, according to new data from the United States' Energy Information Administration. State oil company PDVSA is struggling to keep production afloat. Most of its machinery is obsolete and its production facilities under-resourced. Since March, waves of blackouts have only made the situation worse. PDVSA does not publish production figures, so it is impossible to know exactly how much oil the country actually produces. However, shipments from key international allies such as Russia have increased this year, suggesting that the oil company is supplementing its dwindling production with foreign supply. Maduro's government has blamed the production crisis on corruption by former managers and the increasingly painful sanctions from the United States. Since the US sanctioned PDVSA in January 2019, the company has been unable to plug into the international oil market, where it buys ingredients needed to refine its thick, heavy crude into gasoline. Venezuela's Ombusdman, Alfredo Ruiz Angulo, has said that he intends to denounce US sanctions as human rights violations , saying ""All these unilateral coercive measures led by the United States are causing real trouble for the health of Venezuelans."" For the opposition, however, the shortages are proof of Maduro's inability to run the country sustainably. On social media, the hashtag campaign #VenezuelaSinGasolina has attacked the government for failing to maintain the country's most prized industry. ""The solution to get out of this mess is for Maduro to go,"" said Miguel Pizarro, a leading opposition congressman in a statement to CNN. The shortages are also compounding Venezuela's already dire food insecurity. Venezuela doesn't have a rail system, and most of its largest cities are far away from the coast; without petrol, food supplies cannot be moved from city to city. On May 20, the country's Federation of Cattle Ranchers issued a public plea for fuel to the government, citing their difficulty in moving the cattle across the country."
Trump administration questions why a single judge can block policies nationwide - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,"Ben Geldon, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/politics/inside-politics-forecast-may-26-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast.
1. Border wall loses another round in court A federal judge in California is blocking President Donald Trump's plan to use Pentagon funds to build his border wall. New York Times reporter Michael Shear says it's the 38th time a federal court has blocked one of Trump's policies. Shear said what's particularly galling to the President is that a single district court judge has the power to block his plans everywhere, through a nationwide injunction. ""Attorney General Bill Barr complained about it last week, saying that this practice is a violation of Constitutional principles,"" Shear said. ""So the Trump Administration will be going to the Supreme Court to ask the justices to stop this practice. Legal scholars say that's highly unlikely, but there's more than a little bit of irony here -- during eight years of Barack Obama's administration, a favorite tool of Republicans was, you guessed it, going to federal judges asking them to block policies they didn't like."" Read More 2. Democrats gear up for election-year fight over abortion Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws last week, barring the procedure beyond the eighth week of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest. Missouri joins a growing list of red states seeking to all but ban the vast majority of abortions. Time's Molly Ball says Democrats want to make the future of Roe v. Wade a signature 2020 issue. ""Thousands of women and others all over the country came out to protest these laws, and you have all of the 2020 Democratic candidates coming out against them,"" Ball said. ""Even some Republicans say some of these laws go too far. So this is an issue that's going to continue to simmer. You can expect it to still be going on when we get to next year, and you'll hear the candidates talking about this a lot."" 3. Saudi weapons sales fight President Trump said on Friday he's bypassing Congress to sell more than $8 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia -- an announcement that drew condemnation from lawmakers in both parties who want to punish the Saudis for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and other human rights abuses. ""This is something Congress had been blocking for months, and now they have gone around Congress to complete the sales,"" CNN's Phil Mattingly said, and that's something lawmakers never like. ""Saudi Arabia's support on Capitol Hill has really wilted over the course of the last 10 or 11 months, and that is bipartisan,"" Mattingly said. ""You're going to see lawmakers consider a number of ways to try and stop this from happening in the future."" 4. Congress & Iran And that's not the only foreign policy flashpoint on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are also concerned about the President's plan for Iran -- last week he approved sending an additional 1,500 troops to the region. ""You've seen steps be taken in the last week where the administration finally came down to Capitol Hill to explain the escalation and the movement of a combat strike group and everything else that's been going on in the Persian Gulf,"" Washington Post reporter Karoun Demirjian said. One question, Demirjian said, is whether some lawmakers will push for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force -- known as an AUMF -- rather than relying on the one passed soon after 9/11 that's been used as the legal justification for military action in the region ever since. 5. Recession worries in 2020 And from CNN Chief National Correspondent John King: This weekend's presidential trip to Japan is more style than substance . The next one will be far more important -- for the global economy and for Trump's reelection hopes. The Dow was down last week, and it was the fifth losing week in a row. That hasn't happened since 2011. Trade tensions are the biggest factor, and specifically trade tensions with China. It is easy to find analysts who say the market selloff would be even worse were it not for the anticipation that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will strike a deal -- or at least the outlines of an agreement -- when they meet next month at the annual G-20 summit in Osaka. But there are also a growing number of market watchers, or US-China relations experts, who look back at the last week and see steps by both countries that suggest longer-term nationalist instincts are trumping shorter-term economic concerns. Here in the states, the Trump administration's new restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei complicate any effort to resolve major trade differences. And those watching President Xi this past week as he traveled and focused on economic issues at home also see a leader digging in for a longer-term showdown. ""Huawei is very iconic to the Chinese, kind of like Apple to us, so putting them on the entity list is a real slap in the face and threatens to take the trade war from economics to war over nationalistic pride,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""It makes it very difficult to stand down."" Trump says standing up to China's unfair trade and other economic policies is long overdue, and he continually voices the belief that the American economy is strong enough to absorb the pain of a trade war. But he also wants that humming economy as his re-election calling card, and a prolonged trade war could put that at risk. Zandi pegs the odds of 2020 recession at 30 percent if nothing changes in the current economic climate. And Zandi says, in his view, the odds of a pre-election recession jump to 50 percent or more if the US-China feud escalates and additional tariffs are added."

Tearful Roger Federer remembers late coach 03:21 Federer's own career, one in which he leads the men's grand slam count on 20 and remains a viable threat at majors despite his advanced tennis years, has been inspiring too. That is, of course, a huge understatement. Read More Playing for three decades -- he will probably reach a fourth -- Federer first began as the young, temperamental upstart. Visit CNN Sport for more news and videos He soon became the most dominant player in tennis, later overtaken by Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic and subsequently overcame a loss of form and injury to engineer one of the most dramatic comebacks in sport at the 2017 Australian Open. Being, thus, accustomed to almost every scenario possible in sporting terms, Federer found himself in rather unfamiliar territory Sunday in coming back to a major following a lengthy, lengthy pause.

READ: Nick Kyrgios throws chair during Italian Open meltdown Away for a while Since his last appearance in a Parisian spring in 2015 -- the banged up Swiss withdrew on the eve of the 2016 edition, ending a run of 65 straight majors contested -- the French Open has decided to undergo a much needed refurbishment. The seat colors, for example, on the main Philippe-Chatrier court changed from green to grey and come next season a roof will finally be in place to match the three other majors. Federer's French fans must have had a lump in their throats when he withdrew mid-tournament from the Italian Open a week and a half ago with a leg complaint but there he was Sunday looking completely at ease, dispatching Lorenzo Sonego 6-2 6-4 6-4. Federer admitted he had more nerves than usual but was eased by the predictably warm welcome. ""The reception I got today was crazy, was really nice to see a full stadium for a first round like this,"" Federer told reporters. ""It was a beauty. So I'm very, very happy. ""I feel that the public missed me, and I missed them, as well. ""So 10 or 20 years later or after not playing here for many years, there was some buzz, which I could feel on the central court when I was training and when I was playing today,"" Federer, who made his French Open debut in 1999 and won his lone Roland Garros title in 2009, later said in French. ""So it was rather cool, rather pleasant, and I really loved the welcome I got on the court. I hope that it continues like this."" JUST WATCHED Rise of Naomi Osaka Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

— Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 26, 2019 If Federer is to do the almost unthinkable at this stage of his career and win a second French Open title -- Nadal, Djokovic and Dominic Thiem are the top contenders -- he'll have to breeze through the first week. Only spending one hour, 41 minutes on court made for a perfect start. ""No problems with my body before or after the match,"" said Federer, in the same half of the draw as French Open king Nadal. ""It's ideal for me for the start of the tournament."" Federer admitted recently that his children enjoyed watching Sonego's fellow Italian, Cecchinato. They will have to find another player to root for -- besides, obviously, dad -- after Mahut's sensational comeback. Mahut, like Federer, particularly enjoys playing on grass, despite that 70-68 fifth-set reverse to Isner. And when he dropped the first two sets to Cecchinato, a third consecutive first-round exit at the French Open appeared a certainty. Even more so since he had been dealing with a back injury. Yet the 253rd-ranked Mahut weathered three break points at 3-3 in the fifth set -- a game in which he struggled to find first serves -- and broke to end proceedings for a second career victory from two sets down on the court surrounded by tropical plants. He clearly justified his wildcard. JUST WATCHED Yannick Noah: The last Frenchman to win Roland Garros Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

"Sophie Toscan du Plantier trial: More than two decades after a woman was killed in an Irish village, French prosecutors hope to close the case - CNN",www.cnn.com,"Kara Fox and Antoine Crouin, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/sophie-toscan-du-plantier-trial-ian-bailey-france-intl/index.html,"Schull, Ireland (CNN) Perched on a bench in the quiet courtyard of a pub, Ian Bailey is signing a copy of his self-published book of poetry for a young American woman. He then opens a folded paper printout of his latest work.
It best describes his current state of mind, he says. The poem, ""I'm feeling like John Wayne"" describes a man aggrieved. The prose is pained and indignant -- a mood that's worlds away from the roar of laughter that flows from inside the packed pub. Schull, a picturesque fishing village nestled along the craggy coastline of Ireland's southern-most peninsula, sees a very short tourist season. But today, the rural community of 700 people is enjoying the atmosphere as hundreds flood the streets for its annual international film festival. The area of West Cork however, is no stranger to foreigners. It's long-served as an outpost for artists from across the globe seeking solace and space, with its holiday homes and winding roads well traversed by wealthy travelers looking to disconnect from the daily grind. Read More Bailey is one of those ""blow-ins,"" a local term to describe a person not born in the locality. The Manchester, UK-born former journalist moved to the area in 1991 with a plan to focus on his writing and poetry, enticed by the lure of the area. So had Sophie Toscan du Plantier, a 39-year-old French television producer who found refuge from her busy Parisian life at her isolated farmhouse on the northern side of the Mizen peninsula, a 25-minute drive from Schull. It was an area where people would leave their keys in the doors in case a visitor got stuck in the rain but there was no one at home to receive them; a place where children were safe to run errands on their own because everyone knew who ""belonged to who,"" according to a dozen locals that CNN spoke with this week. But all that changed on December 23, 1996, when Toscan du Plantier was found bludgeoned to death near the gate of her holiday home with some 50 wounds found on her slight frame. Sophie Toscan du Plantier is seen in this undated handout photo. Days after her murder, local police began questioning Bailey, who lived nearby and had been tasked with reporting on the murder for a national paper. He was arrested twice: first in February 1997 alongside his partner Jules Thomas and then again in January 1998. No forensic evidence linked Bailey -- or Thomas -- to the scene of the crime, and they were released without charge. Both have denied any involvement in Toscan du Plantier's death. Bailey's actions throughout the ordeal however, created a cloud of suspicion, according to many locals, one that has continued to follow him around West Cork in the two decades since. Weeks after the murder, Bailey's editor at the now defunct Sunday Tribune told police that he told her that he killed Toscan du Plantier to resurrect his career. According to police documents Bailey admitted it but said it was a joke. A 44-page file from the Irish Office of the Director of the Public Prosecution also reveals other alleged informal admissions by Bailey, but also notes that some of those statements were unreliable and that Bailey has always held a public position of innocence. In the years following his arrests, Bailey alleged he was wrongfully arrested and a victim of police corruption. In 2015, Bailey lost a civil action in the High Court on those claims. A subsequent review by the Irish policing watchdog found problems in the way that Bailey's arrest was handled, but concluded in 2018 that there was no evidence of police corruption. No one else has been charged for Toscan du Plantier's death as the years have passed. A memorial marks the spot where Sophie Toscan du Plantier was killed outside her holiday home in County Cork, Ireland. 'Don't be surprised if you get arrested' In Goleen, a tiny village between Toscan du Plantier's farmhouse and Schull, one woman who asked not to be identified out of concern of potentially being recognized in the small town community, said that after two decades of thinking about it, she still wasn't sure how she felt -- other than uneasy. ""If he didn't do it, his life has been a nightmare for 20-odd years,"" she said. ""But if he did do it, he's gotten away with murder."" Pete Beleski, a former neighbor and friend of Bailey's told CNN that Bailey often loved being the center of attention, saying that ""there's a sort of a notoriety he possible enjoys to a degree."" Beleski added that Bailey shouldn't have been surprised that he was arrested, saying that he knew of a number of occasions in which Bailey had professed -- whether serious or not -- to having done the crime. Beleski's relationship with Bailey was crafted around their mutual love for traditional music. Beleski said it came to an abrupt halt after he bore witness to the aftermath of a brutal domestic violence incident. Six months before Toscan du Plantier's death, Beleski said that he drove Thomas, Bailey's partner, to the hospital after Bailey violently assaulted her. The assault Beleski detailed to CNN is one Bailey has publicly admitted to in court proceedings, saying that the domestic violence he had committed against her was to ""my eternal shame ,"" and one that Beleski recounted as a witness. Beleski says that he hasn't come to any conclusion about Bailey's alleged involvement in Toscan du Plantier's death. ""If we can't prove it, how can anyone else?"" Beleski asked. Ian Bailey, and his solicitor, Frank Buttimer, leave Dublin High Court after he won the right to appeal his extradition order to France. But the French feel differently. Under France's Napoleonic law, authorities can investigate crimes against French citizens committed outside of its French borders, although they cannot insist that witnesses travel for questioning. In 2010, France first tried to bring Bailey before a French court by issuing a European arrest warrant. An Irish High Court ordered that Bailey surrender to France, but Bailey won the right to stay on appeal in 2012, a decision again upheld by the Supreme Court in 2017 . Now, the French prosecution is going a step further. On Monday, Bailey will be tried for murder in absentia in Paris. Toscan du Plantier's family has long pushed for Bailey to be brought to trial in France. A judiciary source at the French public prosecutor's office told CNN that they are basing their case on the testimony of 30 Quote: : d witnesses, 5 Quote: : d experts and information from a French fact-finding mission. The source would not confirm if any witnesses would be attending in person. Beleski, who had provided testimony to Irish police, said that he had not been contacted by the French authorities, nor had other former witnesses that he has recently spoken to. 'An exceptional case' While trials in absentia are not unusual in France, the Bailey case is quite rare, according to legal expert and criminal defense attorney Stephane Babonneau, who is not affiliated with the case. ""It is an exceptional case to have two countries, two justices, two laws, who have (come to) such a different conclusion,"" Babonneau told CNN, noting that cases like this happen only once in every four or five years. Bailey's Irish solicitor, Frank Buttimer, and his French lawyer, Dominique Tricaud, said they will not being attending the trial, which Buttimer characterized as a ""paper exercise."" Speaking to CNN, Buttimer said that the French system has ""no respect"" for the Irish judiciary, who has twice dropped charges against Bailey. He believes the French prosecution has already made a decision and a ruling will be made in the time it takes for the ""rubber stamp to hit the page."" The judiciary source at the French public prosecutor's office said, ""It isn't a show trial, it is a trial that needs to happen because it is part of French law."" ""Justice does not stop in France,"" he added. The strategy on the part of the local Irish police to have Bailey ostracized was a device used back in 1996 and 1997, when they targeted him as the killer, Buttimer said. Part of the ostracizing process was to make people afraid of him, fearful that he might commit the same type of offense so they might say things that might be beneficially to the prosecution, he added. But that line failed, Buttimer said, noting that the director of public prosecution at the time described evidence gathered by Irish police as ""thoroughly flawed and prejudiced."" ""That's 22 years ago. Yet the French are coming around now using the exact same evidence -- nothing new, nothing different,"" Buttimer said. If Bailey is found guilty, France will once again demand his extradition, according to a judicial source at the Paris prosecutor's office. The Church of Our Lady, Star of the Sea, and St. Patrick in Goleen, where Pierre Louis Baudey Vignaud, appealed to local witnesses to travel to Paris to testify at the trial. Toscan du Plantier's son, Pierre Louis Baudey Vignaud, who was 15 at the time of his mother's killing, told CNN that he ""cannot imagine Ireland not moving if there is a condemnation is France."" ""Little by little, the noose is tightening. The French justice will be an important guide,"" he added. Last week, Vignaud attended a memorial mass in Goleen, where he urged local witnesses to travel to Paris to testify at the upcoming trial. A woman from Goleen who asked to remain anonymous, said while she understood Vignaud's pain, the ""pulpit is not a place for this,"" a sentiment expressed by a handful of other locals CNN spoke to in Schull. And while securing a conviction in France might provide some closure for Toscan du Plantier's family, many people in West Cork say that it wouldn't change their feelings either way. Inside O'Sullivan's bar in Crookhaven, believed to be one of the last places Sophie Toscan du Plantier was seen before she was murdered. At O' Sullivans Bar in Crookhaven, a 15-minute drive from Toscan du Plantier's holiday home, and one of the last places she was seen before her murder, owner Billy O'Sullivan says there's nothing left to say. ""Even if they try and prove him guilty, how does that change anything if they can't get at him?"" O'Sullivan asked. Another local, who declined to give his name, said that ""an unsolved murder is an open sore in a small community,"" but that a conviction in France would not close that wound. ""It's a fig leaf for the French,"" he added. Back in the pub in Schull, Bailey says he doesn't want to talk about Monday, noting that he's focusing on his poetry and ways to stay calm. For more than 22 years he's been in the public eye, and he knows that next week's trial will turn the spotlight on him once again. ""I'm going to get buried,"" he said. "
