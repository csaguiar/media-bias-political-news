The Democrats have a big field of candidates running for President in 2020. To briefly use a sports analogy, I see our candidates as the starting players on the Blue team, each bringing their own unique strengths to the table in a bid to take our country in a very different direction than the one we’re on today.
But as we well know from 2016, the media (and especially social media) gets fixated on non-substantial issues that take up all the oxygen. Plus, they don’t give the candidates the same treatment or the same amount of airtime.
In order to help voters get to know the Democratic candidates, I’ve enlisted the help of a team of terrific volunteers who have helped gather quotes and information about what the candidates have said or done in regards to the 7 issues that midterm voters identified as… View original post 1,614 more words Share this:"

PHOENIX — Ketel Marte homered from both sides of the plate, including a grand slam, and Arizona kept the Boston Red Sox in a season-opening funk with a 15-8 romp on Friday night in the Diamondbacks' home opener.
Adam Jones homered and doubled for the Diamondbacks, who scored seven times in the sixth inning for a 14-1 lead. Red Sox infielder Eduardo Nunez came in to pitch the eighth and gave up a home run to Alex Avila.
Mookie Betts, who had three hits, and Mitch Moreland homered for Boston.
The defending World Series champions have lost seven of their first nine on an 11-game road trip, the longest to open a season in franchise history. They are off to their worst start since 2011, when they began 2-10 before finishing 92-70 and missing the playoffs by one game.
Rick Porcello (0-2) gave up 10 hits and seven runs in 4 2/3 innings. He flung a water cooler against the back wall of the Red Sox dugout after being removed in the fifth.
Porcello has given up 16 runs, 11 earned, in 7 1/3 innings in his first two starts. Boston has yielded double-digit runs three times, and its starting rotation has given up 43 earned runs in 40 1/3 innings.
Jones hit his fourth homer while extending his hitting streak to eight games and Nick Ahmed and Jarrod Dyson had three hits apiece for the Diamondbacks, who have scored at least five runs in seven of their eight games.
Marte set a career-high with five RBI. His performance marked the seventh time in team history a hitter has homered as a lefty and righty in the same game.
Zack Godley (1-1) gave three hits and one run in 5 2/3 innings. He also singled twice, scoring one run and driving in another.
Marte hit a solo homer in the fourth. His grand slam off reliever Brian Johnson came in a big sixth that also included a pinch-hit homer by Ildemaro Vargas, recalled earlier Friday when Jake Lamb was placed on the injured list.

Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee) was 2-for-3 with a double and a walk in nine innings of a rehab game for Class-A Greenville on Thursday. He was to play again on Friday, take Saturday off and be reevaluated on Sunday, manager Alex Cora said.?
Diamondbacks: LHP T.J. McFarland (shoulder) is to pitch in a simulated game on Saturday.

Inside Megyn Kelly’s 2020 Campaign—for a New Job in Right-Wing Media,www.thedailybeast.com,lloyd.grove@thedailybeast.com (Lloyd Grove),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-megyn-kellys-2020-campaignfor-a-new-job-in-right-wing-media,"NEXT STEPS Inside Megyn Kelly’s 2020 Campaign—for a New Job in Right-Wing Media Megyn Kelly’s antipathy towards Donald Trump may torpedo a return to right wing media—while the NBC ‘blackface’ controversy may prevent her from rejoining the media mainstream. 04.06.19 12:53 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos by Getty
Nearly six months after NBC News chairman Andy Lack abruptly cancelled Megyn Kelly Today —the culmination of a series of unwelcome controversies , coupled with weak ratings, that imploded with her blurted endorsement of white people wearing Halloween blackface —the former Fox News star is starting to formulate a comeback strategy and getting ready to test the marketplace.
“Part of that readiness is just getting informed on the landscape,” said a source close to Kelly, who was reportedly paid an eye-popping $23 million a year by NBC, and is pocketing the full value of her three-year deal—an estimated $69 million—although she was taken off the air after only 17 months.
“She has always been such a hard worker. It has always been nose to the grindstone, like ‘I’ve got to put on a great show for these 60 minutes.’ So she’s never really looked up at what do new media-type things look like, what do podcasts look like, what does radio look like? So part of it is just a real broad step back and a look at media generally.”
This person added: “The urgency to fire it back up for the next day to three months is pretty low. But ever? Like in a year? Much higher. It’s not like she’s sprinting and saying ‘I gotta get there now.’ But she does want to get informed and get to a place where she can make a really good decision. So she’s sort of setting herself up for that now and patiently going about that process. But no doubt, the engines will fire up at some point.”
The 48-year-old Kelly has been “healing” and “chilling,” according to friends, since last Oct. 24, her final day of work on network television—going to yoga classes, attending school events and field trips with her kids, experimenting in the kitchen, skiing in Montana, and having date nights with her husband.
Kelly herself predicted—to a TMZ crew that miraculously ran into her one January night on an Upper East Side sidewalk—that she’ll be back on television sometime this year. The encounter was a prelude to what looked to media observers like a planted Feb. 26 Page Six item headlined “Megyn Kelly eyes October return for 2020 race.”
But it’s going to be, by most accounts, a challenging reboot.
During the 2016 presidential campaign that cast Kelly as a polarizing adversary of the eventual winner, Donald Trump , she became perhaps the biggest star in television news, worthy of a Vanity Fair cover story that celebrated her as “a newly minted role model for women… and a conservative champion who transcends politics with her skillful skewering of windbags of both parties.”
Barely two years after Kelly joined NBC News—with the sort of media fanfare generally reserved for a conquering hero—she is unemployed.
A spot survey by The Daily Beast of her most financially rewarding possible destinations—ABC, CBS, CNN—didn’t turn up any current enthusiasm for her services. At Fox News, where some former colleagues might welcome her return, a larger group both behind and in front of the camera is said to reject it out of hand.
“It would be difficult for a mainstream news network to hire her,” said a longtime industry executive, “given what she said” in the blackface controversy that cost Kelly her job, even though she made an apparently heartfelt apology both on the air and inside NBC; never mind that her African-American Today show colleagues Al Roker and Craig Melvin — and Andy Lack himself —publicly condemned Kelly’s blackface comments in the harshest of terms.
Melvin, for one, called them “ignorant and racist” as well as “stupid” and “indefensible.”
In the immediate aftermath, Kelly parted ways with her high-powered Hollywood talent agency, CAA—ostensibly because it also represented NBC News President Noah Oppenheim—while her urgent talks with rival agency UTA quickly fizzled. “Whoever embraced her would, I assume, just be unapologetically right-wing, and unafraid to embrace dog-whistle racism, even if hers was unintentional”
She ultimately settled on Los Angeles entertainment lawyer Bryan Freedman, who negotiated an exit package that places no restrictions on her future employment.
“Whoever embraced her would, I assume, just be unapologetically right-wing, and unafraid to embrace dog-whistle racism, even if hers was unintentional,” the industry exec added.
Donald Trump-friendly outlets such as Newsmax, Sinclair and One America News Network—mentioned by industry insiders as possible future employers—would be unlikely to offer Kelly the level of financial compensation to which she has grown accustomed.
Newsmax chief ( and presidential confidant ) Christopher Ruddy, for one, has said that he’d welcome the opportunity to speak with Kelly about a potential role, but such a meeting has yet to occur.
“She’s the biggest free agent on the market,” insisted the source close to Kelly. “Very few people can command the level of attention she does, not by her choosing. She has become a big star within the news. Not only only that, she’s got the goods. If she were doing a nightly news show, wouldn’t you watch it?”
An obvious problem when it comes to a future job in right-wing media, industry insiders said, is Kelly’s lingering public persona as an enemy of President Donald Trump—which Trump and his campaign underlings relentlessly promoted (to the point where she received credible death threats and was compelled to hire a security team) after she asked him that famous question about his misogyny at the August 2015 Fox News debate.
Requesting anonymity, several industry insiders speculated that Fox News, which critics have tagged as both the president’s principal policy adviser as well as an extension of the Trump propaganda machine, could nevertheless be a logical destination for Kelly.
After all, she spent a dozen years there under the tutelage of Fox News founder Roger Ailes (whom she ultimately accused of sexually harassing her when she was a cub reporter in Washington), and she thrived in primetime with her 9 p.m. program The Kelly File .
“This woman needs a show on Fox News and she will do great,” said a television insider. “I would take Megyn Kelly on in a heartbeat. She’s polarizing, but so was Bill O’Reilly. And guess where polarizing personas succeed? Cable news, and Fox News in particular. She’s already got the familiarity there, and not everybody who watches Fox News is blindly in love with Donald Trump—which is where she first alienated that audience. I do not understand—other than the Murdoch pride factor—why they wouldn’t rehabilitate her and bring her back.”
As Kelly was considering her professional future in late 2016, Rupert Murdoch publicly expressed his desire that she remain; rumors circulated internally at Fox News—stoked by Kelly, some suspected—that Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch had offered her a long-term contract worth $100 million, an offer she ultimately spurned.
In recent months, however, Kelly has been sending what media observers see as signals that she would not be averse to a Fox News homecoming. At the web site Mediaite’s holiday party in December, she was seen in convivial conversation with Sean Hannity, an erstwhile rival at the Murdoch cable network. “It looks like she’s campaigning for a job in right-wing media”
Meanwhile, her Twitter feed has become a reliable source of center-right media criticism where she happily tangles with the likes of CNN’s Brian Stelter and Christiane Amanpour and especially her former NBC News antagonist Craig Melvin.
“No, actually ‪@ craigmelvin , Chicago PD’s reputation is not ‘damaged’ here at all,” she scolded her ex-NBC colleague last week, after Melvin suggested that the Jussie Smollett imbroglio had damaged the reputation of the Chicago Police Department. “Even the state’s attny said CPD “did an outstanding job” & their decision to charge was right. Check your facts.”
“It looks like she’s campaigning for a job in right-wing media,” said an industry insider.
After what many industry insiders considered NBC’s ill-conceived experiment that miscast Kelly as a warm and fuzzy morning talk show host, she has re-occupied her more authentic public persona as a pugilistic former litigator—a presence that, for now, is restricted to Twitter.
Kelly is said not to regret her decision to leave for NBC, even though her Sunday magazine show, her initial project there during the summer of 2017, was cancelled after a mere eight of 10 planned episodes. Even Kelly is said to accept that her efforts to reinvent herself as a homey, female-friendly morning television host were less than successful.
Within Fox News, it is at best a minority view that Kelly could attract better ratings at 7 p.m. than Martha MacCallum’s The Story —which decisively beats the cable competition, but, like its 7 p.m. rivals, has experienced a falloff in the 25-54 age demographic on which news advertising is sold. That scenario, in any case, would appear to be a non–starter.
“As we have said numerous times, we are extremely happy with every hour of our line-up and we have no intention of making any changes to it,” a Fox News spokesperson told The Daily Beast.
Indeed, the door at Fox, for now anyway, seems to be slammed shut. Lachlan Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of Fox News’s corporate parent Fox Corp. (the new Murdoch-controlled company that emerged after Disney recently bought 21st Century Fox’s film studio and other entertainment assets) said as much last November.
“Look, I’m a big fan of Megyn’s, I like her a lot. We didn’t want her to leave Fox when she did,” Murdoch told CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook conference. “Having said that, I’m very happy with our current lineup on Fox, and we won’t be making any changes there.”
“Is she damaged because of of this whole experience?” Sorkin asked.
“Sure,” Murdoch answered. “I think she is.”
“Do you think she can go back into media after this?”
“I hope she does because she’s very talented.”
Fox Corp.’s chief spokesperson, Executive Vice President Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director and Donald Trump confidante, this week emailed The Daily Beast: “No change.”
While acknowledging Kelly’s obvious talents as a sharp-witted interviewer and on-camera pugilist who possesses a flair for drama and a face for television, most industry insiders agreed that Kelly would be a risky hire, given the negative narratives that have attached to her image like barnacles.
Indeed, she did little to endear herself to coworkers at 30 Rock—where her show’s fired head writer, Kevin Bleyer, claimed in a leaked memo that Megyn Kelly Today fostered a “toxic and demeaning” workplace environment—or at her previous employer, Fox News, where she was seen by many as an uncollegial diva.
Still, that portrayal is at odds with the private Megyn Kelly that friends and acquaintances describe as charming, funny, and down-to-earth—an attentive mother to the three young children she shares with her husband of the past 11 years, businessman-turned-novelist Douglas Brunt.
“I know that her family means a lot to her,” said Heather Mullins, Kelly’s friend since middle school in the upstate New York town of Delmar more than three decades ago.
Mullins wrote an impassioned letter to the Albany Times Union defending her old friend during the blackface flap. As Kelly wrote in her 2016 memoir, Settle for More , in a chapter titled “Mean Girls,” it was Heather who befriended 12-year-old Megyn, conspicuously sitting next to her in the middle school cafeteria when Megyn was a vulnerable social outcast and getting bullied by her classmates. “I really admire Megyn’s courage, her bravery—to be out there in front of everybody. And I think that she has handled every setback and every adversary with grace and dignity, and I just think she rises above all the controversy”
“I thought she handled it like a champ,” Mullins told The Daily Beast about the NBC News controversies. “I really admire Megyn’s courage, her bravery—to be out there in front of everybody. And I think that she has handled every setback and every adversary with grace and dignity, and I just think she rises above all the controversy.” READ THIS LIST"
The New Orleans Hotel Perfect for the AirBnB Lover,www.thedailybeast.com,malcolm.jones@thedailybeast.com (Malcolm Jones),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/domio-baronne-the-new-orleans-hotel-perfect-for-the-airbnb-lover,"ROOM KEY The New Orleans Hotel Perfect for the AirBnB Lover If you took the AirBnB concept and built a hotel out of it, this is what it would look like. 04.05.19 11:09 PM ET Malcolm Jones/The Daily Beast
I read Arthur Hailey’s bestselling novel Hotel when I was teenager. Recently I went back and read it again, because all I remembered from that initial reading long ago was that Hailey did a great job of explaining to his readers how a big hotel works. My memory was accurate in all but one respect: I would now say, “how a hotel worked.”
For those who have no idea who Hailey was (bestsellers may make you rich, but they will not make you immortal), he wrote a string of popular novels in the ’60s and ’70s and ’80s that each focused on a large institution or public facility (a hotel, an airport). He researched the hell out of these things and then put together a novel in which he married a usually cheesy plot with all the facts and trivia he’d learned about his subject.
Hailey was a serviceable fiction writer (by today’s bestselling novelist standards, he was a damned stylist), and he knew how to construct a story-line out of several subplots that all came to a boil in the last 50 pages. It was pure formula, but a good formula, and what set it apart was the research: you didn’t read Hailey novels for their literary value but as an easy, entertaining way to get a backstage pass into worlds to which you would never have had access otherwise.
Hailey set Hotel in New Orleans, and his fictional St. Gregory Hotel is supposedly based on the Roosevelt Hotel. So more than once I found myself thinking about Hotel after I checked into the four-month old Domio Baronne Hotel in New Orleans recently. And mostly what I thought was, wow, how times have changed and keep changing for the nation’s innkeepers.
Housed in a former factory, Domio Baronne is a six-story, 50-room hotel in the Crescent City’s warehouse district, the part of the Central Business District between the French Quarter and the Garden District that’s currently being rehabbed back to vibrancy with condos and boutique businesses.
Domio, a nascent company that styles itself “a technology platform focused on travel,” began by offering vacation apartment rentals. Co-founder Jay Roberts, a former investment banker, told me that he AirBnB-ed a spare bedroom in his Brooklyn apartment three years ago, and then just kept going; Domio now offers apartment rentals in seven cities. Domio Baronne is the company’s first full-scale apartment/hotel, and if the eight versions on the drawing boards in other cities turn out as nice, this is likely what hotels of the future will be.
If you took the AirBnB concept and built a hotel out of it, this is what it would look like: studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments, with maid service. If you don’t care about having a bar or a restaurant in your hotel (and who cares about that in New Orleans, where you can throw a rock in any direction and hit a restaurant or a bar?), this is for you. If you’re traveling with a family or a small group, this is for you. And it’s not pricey.
The Presidential Suite in the hotel in Hailey’s novel was probably not as big as my “room,” which ran to almost 1,000 square feet and included a large living room with two huge windows facing the street, an ample, fully stocked kitchen, one bedroom with two single beds, one bedroom with a double bed, two baths, and access to a roomy deck with its own set of comfortable furniture.
The furnishings throughout were chic but comfortable, the art on the wall was something you’d actually want to look at (that goes for the area rugs on the hardwood floors, too). And inside one closet was a full-size washer and dryer, with detergent supplied! A full-service grocery store that stays open until midnight is two blocks down the street.
The neighborhood is quiet (but not creepy quiet) and within easy walking distance of downtown and the French Quarter (my walk to Cafe du Monde for beignets and cafe au lait was just far enough for me to convince myself that I’d walked off the damage by the time I got back to the hotel). The Ogden Art Museum, the World War II Museum, and the streetcar line are right around the corner.
Domio Baronne has a few standard hotel amenities (workout room, conference rooms, and a game room—a rooftop pool is coming soon), but the most important thing it shares with more traditional inns is quality service. This is, in fact, the most traditional part of the hotel.
In Hailey’s novel, a considerable amount of space is given to the subject of good service (the chef gets the point, the head bellboy does not). But clearly most of the people Hailey talked to during his research were deep-dyed believers in good service as the chief amenity of any reputable hotel. Quite a few other things in the novel are quaintly anachronistic (hotel keys, a house detective), but service then and service now aren’t much different, and the staff at Domio Baronne seem to have embraced this idea wholeheartedly: there’s a digital, Siri-like thing in your room to answer questions, but why use that when the staff is so knowledgeable and friendly?
The Roosevelt Hotel that Hailey studied to write his novel is still in business (having gone through several owners and even a few name changes before reverting to “Roosevelt” a few years ago). Its long time success argues that great traditional hotels will always have a place in New Orleans, whose life blood is tourism and the convention business. People traveling for fun like luxury, and luxury in hotels for most people translates into spas and room service. So hoteliers keep offering these loss-leader options because otherwise the guests might as well decamp to the Holiday Inn Express (after all, when you get down to it, a hotel room is really just a bed in a box).
But if your idea of luxury extends beyond those traditional offerings, if space means a lot to you or even separate bathrooms, then Domio Baronne is serious competition to the traditional hotels. On my next trip, I may even buy some beignet mix and bring it back to my apartment kitchen and see what kind of catastrophe I can cook up on my own.

What Happened to Shakespeare’s Library?,www.thedailybeast.com,Stuart Kells,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/shakespeares-library-inside-the-hunt-for-the-playwrights-books,"Wherefore Art Though? What Happened to Shakespeare’s Library? The search for William Shakespeare’s library has always been marvelously colorful, and devilishly contentious. Some of his books might still be out there, just waiting to be found. 04.05.19 10:57 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photo by Getty
Today, William Shakespeare is famous. Very famous. But things weren’t always so. Before the eighteenth century, he was somewhat obscure and noticeably disreputable.
More than a century after his death, people such as David Garrick and Samuel Johnson made Shakespeare fashionable, and respectable. They helped him pull off a remarkable transformation, from scrabbling playwright and scandalous poet to the Immortal Bard. The National Poet. Gentle, mellifluous Shakespeare.
And once that transformation was complete, an inescapable logic took hold. An author of Shakespeare’s exemplary stature and accomplishment just had to have an important personal library, rich with source-books and letters and manuscripts, and perhaps even diaries and unpublished works.
Late in the eighteenth century, the first searchers set out to find that library. Samuel Ireland was one of them. He lived in London with a Mrs Freeman, formerly a favorite of the Earl of Sandwich, now Samuel’s housekeeper, mistress and the mother of his children: Anna, Jane and William-Henry.
In the summer of 1793, William-Henry was eighteen when Samuel took him to Shakespeare’s home town of Stratford-upon-Avon. Father and son had as their escort an amateur tourist guide by the name of John Jordan.
Jordan took the Irelands to attractions in and around the town. Along the way, Samuel asked people if they’d seen the manuscripts that would provide a window into Shakespeare’s creative life and work.
Most people hadn’t seen anything, but one rumor sounded promising. Apparently a quantity of manuscripts had been moved, at the time of the Stratford fire of 1742, from New Place, Shakespeare’s former home, to Clopton House.
Giddy with the prospect of finding rare paper, Jordan and the Irelands went to Clopton House full of expectation. The building’s occupant, a gentleman farmer named Williams, got straight to the point.
‘By God I wish you’d arrived a little sooner!’ he said. ‘Why, it isn’t two weeks since I destroyed several baskets of letters and papers to clear a small chamber for some young partridges which I wish to bring up alive. And as to Shakespeare, there were many bundles with his name wrote upon them. Why it was in this very fireplace I made a roaring bonfire of them.’
A stunned and appalled Ireland cried out.
‘My God sir, you are not aware of the loss that the world has sustained! Would to heaven I had arrived sooner!’
Farmer Williams’ wife verified the awful story and chided her husband.
‘I do remember it perfectly well!’ she said. ‘And, if you will call to mind my words, I told you not to burn the papers, as they might be of consequence.’
In shock, Ireland inspected the little chamber. He found nothing but partridges.
Another important search has an earlier date.
Born in Warwick in 1726, Reverend James Wilmot became a Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, before leading an eminent life in London. Retiring in about 1781, he became rector at the village of Barton-on-the-Heath, some sixteen miles south of Stratford-upon-Avon.
When a local bookseller suggested that he write a biography of Shakespeare, Wilmot went to Stratford in search of the traces he expected to see left behind by a writer of Shakespeare’s stature.
He interviewed townsfolk and conducted other research in and around the town. The people of Stratford regaled him with colorful local folklore, like the story of the cakes that hailed down one Shrovetide and injured hapless pedestrians. And the one about the church tower wickedly removed by the devil. And the one about the unusually tall man who threatened to bewitch the local farmers’ cattle.
Why, Wilmot wondered, had Shakespeare not used these fascinating characters and stories in his plays? Most importantly for Wilmot’s search, the local people told him Shakespeare was the son, not of a glover or leather-trader, but of an illiterate butcher. When Shakespeare went to seek his fortune in London, he was a country clown.
Thoroughly, painstakingly the reverend searched the neighborhood for Shakespeare’s books and manuscripts. Interrogating bookcases, chests, drawers, closets and cabinets, Wilmot inspected every private library and every holding of letters and documents within fifty miles of Stratford.
His search encompassed Charlecote Park, home of the Lucy family; Coughton Court, home of the Throckmortons; Ragley Hall, home of the Conways; Baddesley Clinton, home of the Ferrers; Packwood House, the Fetherstons; Upton House, the Childs; Farnborough Hall, the Holbechs; and Arbury Hall, the Newdegates.
Most of the local gentry had roots dating back to Shakespeare’s day. Surely they purchased a selection of his books upon his death, or otherwise came upon his manuscripts and other papers?
Yet none of them seemed to have done so. None of them, in fact, seemed to know anything useful at all. Wilmot found nothing that Shakespeare might’ve owned. He calculated that the poet must’ve produced over a quarter of a million manuscript pages. Yet he discovered not a single one.
The failure of his search led Wilmot to an earth-shaking conclusion. Shakespeare wasn’t an author at all. He was an illiterate frontman for the true creator of the plays and poems, Sir Francis Bacon.
Bacon, Wilmot reasoned, was the only man who possessed the necessary depth of intellect and breadth of learning, encompassing an intimate knowledge of France, Italy, the law, government and philosophy. Having made this dramatic deduction, Wilmot wrote extensive notes and shared his conclusions with friends and visitors. Then he burned his papers. They were just too dangerous.
The Australian spiritualist and distiller, Hugh Junor Browne, was also implicated in the search for Shakespeare’s library. In his 1888 book The Grand Reality, Brown rebutted the case for Baconian authorship of Shakespeare’s plays. That book was followed by a further work, The Baconian Authorship of Shakespeare’s Plays Refuted.
The latter pamphlet included a striking revelation: Shakespeare had composed his plays while under the supernatural control of a band of poetic spirits, led by a chief called Busiris. Thus controlled, Shakespeare couldn’t ‘blot a line’, because he lacked the skill to amend the spirits’ writing.
Using séances, automatic writing and intermediating ‘sensitives’, Browne conversed extensively with Shakespeare. Revelations came thick and fast. According to Browne, the Bard had spent his youth slaughtering sheep and delivering the flesh to customers. With Busiris in charge, Shakespeare’s hand would be controlled to write all over the hides of the sheep he’d just skinned.
Not having any knowledge about automatic writing, he placed no value on what had thus been written. As a consequence, Browne said, many plays almost equal to Shakespeare’s best were lost to the world. Apart from making such unprecedented findings about Shakespeare, Browne also described how Mozart composed under the control of spirit musicians.
The search for William Shakespeare’s library has always been marvelously colorful, and devilishly contentious.
Hugh Browne wrote in a period of rampant spiritualism, but few people seem to have taken his discoveries seriously. The other two search accounts, however, were long accepted on face value. That was a mistake.
The Irelands really did search Stratford-upon-Avon, but farmer Williams’ bonfire story turned out to be a hoax: he was making fun of the nosy and bumbling antiquarians from London. After their Stratford search, the Irelands themselves went on perpetrate one of the biggest Shakespeare hoaxes of all time: the fabrication of letters and signed copies and other Shakespearean documents.
The Wilmot story was crucial to the Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship. It was taken seriously throughout the twentieth century, and well into this century. But recently it, too, was shown to be a hoax. What are we to make of this?
The entire field of Shakespeare studies is full of forgeries and frauds and fake news, and the library search conforms to that bigger picture. And it leaves us at a very important conclusion. If some of the earliest and most thorough searches for Shakespeare’s library never actually happened, then some of his books and manuscripts might still be out there, sitting quietly on shelves, just waiting for us to find them.
Things do turn up. In 1904, the sole surviving copy of the first edition of Titus Andronicus was found among items inherited by a Swedish postal clerk. A lost play by Ben Jonson, The Entertainment at Britain’s Burse (1609), was rediscovered in 1997.
In my own search, I’ve found books that Shakespeare might’ve owned, and fragments of a letter he might’ve received. I also found, on a bedroom bookshelf in a suburban home, two rare plays by George Chapman. They are now two of the treasures in Melbourne’s marvelous State Library.
So I urge you to check your own shelves and those of your friends. You never know what you might find."
John Bolton Trashes the Lessons Learned After the Deaths of 241 Marines,www.thedailybeast.com,John Gans,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-bolton-trashes-the-lessons-learned-after-the-deaths-of-241-marines,"John Bolton Trashes the Lessons Learned After the Deaths of 241 Marines opinion Chip Somodevilla/Getty A national security advisor who wants to make policy more than manage the process is a proven recipe for disaster. John Gans 04.05.19 10:49 PM ET
In the middle of the night on October 23, 1983, White House operators started calling National Security Council staffers with the news that a yellow Mercedes truck weighed down with explosives and gas canisters had detonated at the Beirut Airport where U.S. Marines were trying to bring peace to the Lebanon’s long civil war. As casualty reports poured in, the staff rushed to help President Ronald Reagan figure out what to do next.
“The Beirut Massacre,” as one headline called it, killed 241 Marines and injured 100 more. Yet the decision days later by NSC staffers and National Security Advisor Robert “Bud” McFarlane to push for an aggressive response to the bombing, without consulting the Pentagon, proved far more consequential. Their shortcut undermined trust between the White House and Defense Department and set the stage for even bigger mistakes in the years ahead.
The tragic history of the Marines in Beirut and the breakdown in Washington is becoming better understood as top-secret documents from the Reagan administration are declassified. What is being revealed is a stark warning for John Bolton, who next week will mark his one-year anniversary as President Donald Trump’s truculent national security advisor, of what might happen—and who may pay the price—for his continued neglect of a regular process of making policy decisions. Secretary of Procurement and Pacifism
The only reason the Marines were in Beirut in the first place was because in September 1982 the NSC staff pushed Reagan, over the vocal opposition of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Vessey, to try to bring some peace to a restive Lebanon. As State Department diplomats worked for a ceasefire, U.S. troops were assigned to serve as a “presence” from their Beirut Airport barracks between the struggling Lebanese Armed Forces, communal groups battling for a greater say in government, burgeoning terror entities, and Israeli, Iranian and Syrian personnel and proxies.
The mission gave everyone in Washington something to complain about. For those on the NSC, who wanted the Marines to do more to bring about peace, a presence was too limited. Meanwhile, it unnerved Weinberger and many others at the Pentagon, who believed the risks outweighed the reasons for being in Lebanon and that presence was not a mission the Defense Department trained for. As months rolled by, some at the NSC complained of “déjà vu”: every time they pushed on the State Department for results or the military for more firepower, the answer was no.
With a hands-off president, these sorts of policy disagreements tended to grow personal in the Reagan administration. NSC staffers questioned the motives and even the courage of their counterparts: some called Weinberger the “Secretary of Procurement and Pacifism.” The ill feelings were mutual. The defense secretary believed the NSC staff was so eager “to get us into a fight somewhere— anywhere” that he was reminded of the “old joke ‘Let’s you and him fight this out.’” Those at the Pentagon were not the only ones frustrated; at one point, a State diplomat told one staffer: “Butt out, I don’t need the NSC staff telling me when and how to get things done in Lebanon.”
Still for more than a year, the NSC staff pushed through the normal policy process—in draft decisions memoranda, interagency meetings, and briefings for the president in the Situation Room and Oval Office—for the United States to take more action and support the Lebanese Armed Forces in the fight. In the days after the bombing, though the NSC’s recommendation to join the fight directly did not change, how they pushed for it did. Rather than debate the plan with the Pentagon, McFarlane’s deputy ordered, in a handwritten note I found in the archives while researching for a forthcoming book on the NSC: “We’ll go direct to President.” Direct to President
Reagan sided with the NSC and decide to launch air strikes, but the staff’s end-run decimated the trust that’s essential to an effective policy process. In response, Weinberger and defense leaders tried every bureaucratic trick in the book to slow down the new policy, which McFarlane and the NSC believed “constituted insubordination.”
In the end, Reagan, based on the increasingly vocal warnings of Pentagon leaders and the re-election worries of his political advisers, ended the Marines’ mission early in 1984.
Even with the Marines out of Beirut, the NSC had gotten into the habit of taking shortcuts and conspiring behind the White House gates. Eventually, Oliver North, a lieutenant colonel on loan to the staff from the Marines, would go even further. From the staff, he orchestrated a complicated scheme to sell Iran weapons and then illegally use the proceeds to fund Contras battling a socialist government in Nicaragua. Though many blamed North and his co-conspirators, including McFarlane, for what became known as Iran-Contra, one White House insider said the NSC staff had begun to feel the need to “risk doing something” during Lebanon.
Iran-Contra brought reforms to how Washington makes national security policy, including the establishment of a regular order of consultations managed by the national security advisor and NSC staff. The process — based on the belief that if all voices are heard and options tested, the president will make better decisions and those charged with implementing policy will trust it is the right one — has now governed U.S. national security for 30 years. A good bureaucrat
It’s a process that is now in Bolton’s hands. Like the irregular president he serves, Bolton, who has previously served at the State Department and United Nations, is not a perfect fit for regular order. Though he has claimed, “I’m proud to say I’m a good bureaucrat,” Bolton’s measure of effectiveness has always been not about serving the process but winning in it. To win, he explained recently, “You have to judge what you want, where the opposition to it is going to be, where the support for it will be. You mobilize the support and overcome the opposition.”
Even typical bureaucratic warfare seems orderly compared to the messy, fractious Trump-world. Before he was fired, Michael Flynn’s tenure was weighed down by a messy transition and the scandal that later led to a guilty plea. His successor, H. R. McMaster, tried to reboot and regularize the disorderly Trump administration, but the process was undermined by interpersonal and bureaucratic intrigues as well as a testy relationship with the president.
Compared to Flynn’s and McMaster’s disadvantages, Bolton appears to have purposely let the regular policy process—the meetings in the Situation Room, writing of strategies, and coordination of outcomes—fall apart. As a result, in the words of one official quoted by the Washington Post last month, “The wheel doesn’t connect to the engine.” The President does not know what everyone in Washington is recommending, and few in the capital, or outside it, know what he is thinking.
That appears to be fine by the national security advisor, who told The Atlantic , “I don’t view writing strategy papers as big accomplishments.” To Bolton, who said recently “The NSC is not a think tank,” policy outcomes—not process outputs—are the real job. The national security advisor, who has been seen sprinting to the Oval Office for meetings and prefers ones behind closed doors, appears willing to leave people out of the loop and break trust in the name of getting something done. The results are bad habits in the White House and a breakdown in the regular order.
That was clear to anyone with a Twitter account late last month. On Friday March 22nd, Trump tried to overrule the Treasury Department’s decision to impose additional sanctions on North Korea—a policy Bolton had endorsed on Twitter just hours earlier. Although the White House tried to concoct a cover story, one Bloomberg exposed as untrue , the episode proved again that messy coordination is hard to hide.
The history of Lebanon and Iran-Contra also show how dangerous it can be. After all, bad process can trump the best of intentions, undermine even good policies and make real tragedies of bad ones.
So far, the breakdowns on Bolton’s watch have resulted in uncoordinated tweets. But one night the White House operator is going to call with a real crisis on Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, or somewhere else altogether. When that alert comes, few serving in Washington or in harm’s way abroad can trust that Bolton will have ensured all the considerations have been weighed and consultations made. The only question then will be who pays the price for the breakdown he has presided over in Washington."
"Sara Bareilles Embraces the ‘Chaos’ and Finds Her Political Voice: ‘Truthfully, I Took Things for Granted’",www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/sara-bareilles-embraces-the-chaos-and-finds-her-political-voice-truthfully-i-took-things-for-granted,"QUEEN OF ANYTHING Sara Bareilles Embraces the ‘Chaos’ and Finds Her Political Voice: ‘Truthfully, I Took Things for Granted’ The singer-songwriter opens up about her new album, ‘Amidst the Chaos,’ its response to our new “fucked-up” political reality, and her J.J. Abrams-produced new Apple TV show. 04.05.19 10:47 PM ET James Dimmock/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty
Sara Bareilles has lived the life one of her favorite TV characters, Felicity Porter , might’ve if she had stayed in California. Both the Grammy-nominated singer and the Felicity TV character grew up in comfortable Northern California households. Felicity, set up on a pre-med Stanford path, fled to New York City to pursue art, only to quickly go back to her medical studies. Bareilles, on the other hand, grew up a community theater performer but stayed on the West Coast to study communications at UCLA. There, she immediately hopped right back into the theatrical saddle and has been riding the musical track with great success ever since.
Then, suddenly, six years ago Bareilles had a “mini-meltdown,” shoved her entire Los Angeles life into a storage unit and fled on a month-long “little rumspringa” to New York. In 2013 and at 33 years old, Bareilles finally lived her Felicity Porter fantasies, staying out late with friends, frequenting Broadway and even taking a few business meetings—including one that brought her face-to-face with the creator of her beloved show.
“I met J.J. Abrams a few years ago. He asked, ‘Have you ever considered doing something for television?’ I really hadn’t even considered it, but I’m sitting across the table from J.J. Abrams,” Bareilles, 39, told The Daily Beast over the phone last month. Felicity was “deeply important” to her in college, so she only had one answer for the show’s famed creator: “Sure, what do you have in mind?”
What he had in mind was Little Voice , a forthcoming half-hour dramedy featuring original music. Bareilles and Abrams are co-creators of the Apple+ streaming show currently shrouded in secrecy. Thankfully, Bareilles shared some information. The premise: “A young woman who’s a songwriter who’s sort of finding her voice in the spirit of Felicity but deeply musical.” The release date: “We don’t have a release date set yet.” The state of completion: “We’re currently in production, so we’re making it.” The format: “I wouldn’t say it’s a musical. All of the performances will be reality-based.”
Finally, the why: “At a certain point in my life I had to start saying ‘yes’ to the things that felt scary.”
Her latest album Amidst the Chaos , which dropped Friday, is the manifestation of Bareilles’s past six years saying “yes” to career opportunities. Following the success of The Blessed Unrest (which garnered her a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year), Bareilles took time off her solo career to work on collaborative projects. She wrote a New York Times bestselling essay collection called Sounds Like Me in 2015; signed on to adapt Waitress , the movie starring the real-life Felicity, Keri Russell, into the smash-hit musical ; and recently took the stage herself as Mary Magdalene in NBC’s critically acclaimed live musical special Jesus Christ Superstar . Along the way, she racked up Grammy, Tony and Emmy nominations.
“I learned from just even a few album cycles in my career, oh, I’m going to get bored really fast and feel kind of uninspired,” Bareilles said. “I’ve been very fortunate that there has been the kind of mechanisms of ‘work begets work’ in my life.”
Part of the lifestyle shift included realizing what’s going on outside of the recording studio and offstage. Bareilles has been vocal about how the 2016 election left her hopeless. She watched the results roll in from the comfort of her Manhattan apartment accompanied by a friend visiting from Nashville. They hugged. They cried. And they woke up. “It’s something I’m grateful for in this fucked-up way,” Bareilles said. “Truthfully, I have been disengaged, paying attention to other things and kind of got lazy and took for granted things were being taken care of on some level. That’s not the truth, and so here we are.”
She lent her voice to the Pulse nightclub tribute song “Broadway for Orlando,” partnered with the Women’s March to get out the vote in 2018 and simply stopped being afraid of getting political.
“The truth is in some ways I am naive,” she said. “I still, like so many people, just want to be committed to being part of the conversation—to learn, to ask questions and to hopefully lend my voice where it can make sense. It’s a process, I think.”
She’s lent her voice quite literally, channeling her newfound activism into song. Amidst the Chaos is heavily inspired by her love for the Obamas. At a Los Angeles concert last month , Bareilles told the crowd her new, bluesy song of thanks “If I Can’t Have You” and her feminist rally cry ( released early in response to the Kavanaugh hearings ) “Armor” are partial responses to no longer having her favorite First Family in office.
But Bareilles isn’t always in the business of writing protest music. A masterful songwriter, she often sneaks political undertones into her signature love songs—or anti-love songs. Her first big hit, 2007’s “Love Song,” is her “fuck you” to her record label for road-blocking her songwriting style. Then came her second major label album, Kaleidoscope Heart , and the tongue-in-cheek “King of Anything,” a searing retort to mansplaining . With 2013’s The Blessed Unrest , she turned her frankness toward her loved ones, with that album’s smash single, “Brave,” inspired by a close friend’s struggle to come out as gay . The only person Bareilles hadn’t brought to the hot seat yet was herself. Cue Amidst the Chaos.
“There was a deep connection between the personal and the political in this period in my life,” Bareilles said. “So that’s what needs to be reflected in the music because that’s my job: to take a snapshot of where I’m at.” READ THIS LIST"
‘Pet Sematary’ Is an Insult to Stephen King,www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pet-sematary-is-an-insult-to-stephen-king,"DO-OVER ‘Pet Sematary’ Is an Insult to Stephen King The horror-remake is all about LOUD NOISES and has robbed its complex source material of any nuance. 04.05.19 10:46 PM ET Kerry Hayes/Paramount Pictures
Stephen King’s 1983 novel Pet Sematary is a story about grief, which is its true monster. Recounting the ordeal that befalls the Creed family after they relocate to Maine, befriend their elderly neighbors, suffer loss, and then find ruination courtesy of a Native American burial ground that can bring the deceased back to life, it’s a cautionary tale about the terrible, spiraling power of sorrow—how it consumes the heart and soul if allowed to fester, beckoning one toward an abyss of corruption and madness. In King’s original, love (and sex) serve as barricades against its destructive allure, although ultimately, the only hope of escaping its grasp comes from accepting that death is a natural part of life, and preferable to the nightmares wrought by anguished men’s darkest impulses. As its most famous line warns, “Sometimes dead is better.”
Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer’s film adaptation, on the other hand, is about jump scares.
This isn’t the first time King’s masterful tome has received subpar cinematic treatment; director Mary Lambert’s 1989 version lacks much of its source material’s moral dread and horror, this despite the fact that King penned it himself, and it boasts standout supporting turns from Fred Gwynne and Miko Hughes (who both factor into the greatest Achilles tendon-related incident in movie history). Still, Lambert’s predecessor was far less shallow and shoddy than this latest iteration. There’s scant life in Kölsch and Widmyer’s modern update, but there’s plenty of slipshod plotting, ham-fisted dialogue and SUDDEN LOUD NOISES to be found throughout this torturous return trip to the unholy animal graveyard.
Dutifully rehashing King’s set-up, Pet Sematary concerns Louis (Jason Clarke) and Rachel Creed (Amy Seimetz), who along with their daughter Ellie (Jeté Laurence) and son Gage (Hugo Lavoie) relocate from the big city to rural Ludlow, Maine, so Louis can begin a physician’s job at a university hospital. They soon meet across-the-way senior citizen Jud Crandall (John Lithgow), who’s a widower because his wife Norma has, like Rachel’s nasty parents, been excised from these streamlined proceedings (Lambert’s edition did this as well). Early on, Kölsch and Widmyer cast Jud as a potentially threatening old coot in order to generate additional unease. Yet it’s false to the character, who’s been neutered of his kindness and complexity, and it exposes their preoccupation with altering key elements of King’s saga as a means of keeping fans on their toes.
Despite that surprise-centric m.o., Pet Sematary ’s advance trailers have already revealed its biggest change to King’s narrative. While I won’t restate that spoiler, the film sticks to a familiar script for its first half before switching things up in ways that are always for the worse. Upon arriving at their new home, Ellie witnesses a procession of kids in creepy masks heading to the pet cemetery (whose name the children have misspelled on a sign)—a sight that affords the directors a feeble creepy-mask motif. At work, Louis fails to save critically wounded student Victor Pascow (Obssa Ahmed), and is shortly thereafter haunted by his ghost, who tries to alert him to the burial ground’s evil. Nonetheless, when the Creed’s cat Church is killed by one of the scary trucks that speed down their road, Jud takes Louis past the cemetery, over a monolithic deadfall and through a misty landscape (inhabited by a wendigo?) to a more ancient place, where he buries the feline.
The next day, Church is back—albeit in altered form. Kölsch and Widmyer repeatedly attempt to jolt viewers with the cat’s Dolby-enhanced hisses and scratches, as well as blaring truck horns and crashing sound effects. It’s all very hollow and cheap, which goes double for Pet Sematary ’s portrait of heartache. Louis and Rachel squabble about the afterlife and whether their brood should learn about death. Rachel then confesses the real reason she hates such topics: her late, meningitis-afflicted sister Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine), whose twisted body and dumbwaiter demise still haunt her. Zelda is also around just to provide some tacky shocks. None of them are very effective (unless you’re prone to SUDDEN LOUD NOISES!), but at least the subplot gives Seimetz something to do.
More objectionable than its second-rate scare tactics (and humdrum visuals) is the flippancy with which the film races through its action. Jeff Buhler’s script condenses King’s story with the grace of a trash compactor; scenes last only as long as it takes to dispense key plot information, and not a single second longer. It’s akin to experiencing the novel in fast-forward, with any observations about longing, regret and guilt addressed via the absolute minimum amount of dialogue, as if the filmmakers were petrified of letting events and performances breathe. At such a pace, every statement is a hastily-scrawled signpost pointing the way to the big finale. No wonder Clarke, a capable actor squandered by this mess, looks so harried.
That Kölsch and Widmyer don’t approximate King’s soulful storytelling might be more forgivable if it felt like they were at least trying to. Yet the further Pet Sematary travels down its supernatural path, the more it reveals itself to be a clunky carnival ride, full of portentous suggestions it can’t be bothered to develop, and gotcha moments that fail to getcha. Sadly, Lithgow, Clarke and Seimetz are reduced to cardboard cut-out pawns in a game with minimal stakes, since their characters haven’t been blessed with more than two dimensions (if that). Only a couple of fleeting vistas of the forest treetops blanketed by the cloudy night sky convey a whiff of New England atmosphere. The rest is dull and, in the case of some CGI-enhanced shots, ungainly too.
Then there’s the big switcheroo peddled by Pet Sematary , solely for the purpose of upending the expectations of King die-hards. The lame twists that follow in its wake are equally dismal, lowlighted by a reaction shot of a stunned Louis that’s played for misplaced laughs. As with a confrontation that directly exploits cinephiles’ memories of the aforementioned Achilles tendon massacre, these modifications pay no appreciable dividends, except to highlight the enterprise’s pointlessness. “If you’ve done something, Louis, it’s not too late to undo it,” Jud pleads shortly before the conclusion. Were that only true about the film itself. READ THIS LIST"
"If You Want to See an Unspoiled Yucatán, You Better Go Now",www.thedailybeast.com,Megan Frye,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/if-you-want-to-see-an-unspoiled-yucatan-you-better-go-now,"TREAD LIGHTLY If You Want to See an Unspoiled Yucatán, You Better Go Now Cruising the peninsula in a van with a local guide is an idyllic yet eco-responsible way to avoid the environmental destruction wrought by shameful tourist traps. 04.05.19 10:37 PM ET Courtesy Jenna Belevender
PUNTA LAGUNA, Mexico—Howler monkeys alert the world that it’s time to wake up. It’s 6 a.m. and the jungle around Punta Laguna is already illuminated by the blazing sun. We can see them roaming through the trees, vocally making their presence known. Mist rises from the lagoon that is part of a wildlife sanctuary. We light a camp stove and heat water for tea.
I’m with Detroit editorial photographer Jenna Belevender, whom I’ve dragged here likely beyond her better judgment. Last night, we slept in a van. Down by the lake. In the middle of the jungle. Pitch black by 7 p.m., the site seemed a bit eerie. Our guide navigated the bumpy roads to get in, and then slept atop the observatory post, in a hammock with a mosquitero “mosquito net,” of course. Mosquitoes, among myriad other insects, are mighty prevalent here. It was silent with the exception of the song of tree frogs, and we fell asleep around 9 p.m., as it would go for the next few days. The jungle never truly sleeps, but when the sun rises, it goes into full gear. And even in November, on the decline of the dreaded hot season, the Yucatán peninsula bakes under a perpetually scorching sun.
Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula makes up a large part of the ancestral home of the Mayan people . It is dotted with archaeological sites that exhibit the architectural prowess of the ancient Mayans as well as their superior grasp of astronomy and mathematics; it is said they are the culture that invented the concept of “zero.”
Below the surface, literally, is Mexico’s largest quantity of freshwater, in the form of underground rivers that pool up into thousands of cenotes: divine natural reservoirs that entice swimmers and divers alike and where ancient burial sites have been located. Adventurous (or let’s say bat-shit crazy, adrenophilic) divers follow these narrow ancient rivers from cenote to cenote. The waters are created by eons of rainwater filtration through the thin limestone crust that makes up the vast majority of the Yucatán’s geology, since it was hit with a giant asteroid , said to have been the cause of the extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago and which left behind the Chicxulub crater.
While the Mayan sites and cenotes have long been a major draw to the three states that the peninsula comprises, the region has become tourism-heavy since the ’70s, when Cancún, once a quiet fishing village, gained recognition on the international scene and developers ate up the opportunity, and the land. That’s happened across the Riviera Maya, a roughly 80-mile stretch of Caribbean coastline encompassing resort areas and beach towns, including Playa del Carmen and Tulum, which have both become synonymous with foreign and national party-goers, and where the accommodations and restaurants continue to test what their spending limits could be.
We came to camp in the jungle with a local campervan rental company called Van Balam , owned by our guide, Lutgardo García Escalero, and Omid Khayyam. Balam signifies jaguar in the local Mayan dialect. The campervans are equipped with mosquito nets, solar powered electricity (for plugging in your electronics), a gravity shower, camper stoves, and storage space. There is an organic compost bin to separate waste and return it to the pachamama. Even the dish soap is biodegradable, and there are reusable shopping bags on board. Khayyam and García Escalero are avid kitesurfers and nature lovers, and their goal is to share the beauty of the Yucatán with adventurous travelers in a way that doesn’t further exploit the region.
This all said, most Mexicans will tell you that camping in a van around Mexico is not advisable. Of course there are designated campsites in certain areas, but there are few regions as consistently safe and secure as Yucatán. It’s something I myself had reservations about, having spent several years living in Mexico.
“Mexico is not yet positioned in the world as a destination for campers,” Khayyam said. “However this region, being a funnel of travelers from Canada to Tierra del Fuego, already has a significant influx of adventurers. We ourselves feel like we are part of this tribe, and our goal is to fulfill the dream of many.”
We met Lut and Omid and picked up the van in Tulum, then headed out on the highway west toward the colonial city of Valladolid, stopping at the Nojoch Keej, an animal sanctuary in Nuevo Durango in the state of Yucatán.
Following a hurricane some years back, local man Don Manuel found a jaguar in the streets of his village. It had escaped from the flooded jungle that surrounds the small Mayan village. His neighbors were conspiring to kill it, as they were afraid it would attack humans. Being an animal lover and recognizing the majesty of the jaguar, he decided to capture it and keep it in safe housing until it could return to the jungle.
Years later, he’s now turned the land (ceded to his family following Mexico’s agrarian reform in the early 20th century) into an animal sanctuary for native species that are in threat of extinction. While disoriented or ill wild felines pass through from time to time, it’s mostly a refuge for the region’s over-hunted whitetail deer, ocellated turkeys, endemic plants and vegetables such as the rare chahuaik chile pepper, and several species of bees.
As we dine on handmade tortillas, omelets, pickled onions, habanero salsa and fresh pineapple juice prepared for us by his family, Don Manuel tells us that he had recently been approached by an “adventure” tour company from the Riviera Maya that offered 1,000 tourist visits per week if he and his family agreed to dress up in “traditional” Mayan clothing. He declined the offer. “We just want to live here with nature, respecting nature,” he told me. “We are happy to greet visitors who come for the right reasons.”
Our next visit was close, as the zopilote (vulture) flies: a cenote located about an hour from the rural highway, down a bumpy dirt road, and part of a roughly eight-mile cave system used for ritual practices among the Mayans for centuries. Needless to say, it’s not on the map. This may have been the most divine dip I’ve ever taken, and I’m from the Great Lakes region where cool, clear freshwater abounds.
Aurelio “El Bronco” Xiu, the property’s owner, discovered the underground oasis after seeing a jaguar emerge from a hole in the ground. Shimmying into the hole himself, with a rope and flashlight, he followed the course of the pitch-black cave to this sublime pool. Now open for visitors, the cave is equipped with steps and flood lights for optimal swimming pleasure. “The Yucatán Peninsula, sprawling across 76,300 square miles, is obviously much more than its resorts.”
Don Manuel and El Bronco are two examples of local people who are not directly involved in the region’s tourism explosion. Actually, many locals are not involved in it. They’ve been priced out of any potential accommodations: Beach towns like Tulum cater to upscale tourists who can afford resorts costing a minimum $300 per night, while local authorities and foreign investors continue to ignore environmental regulations and close off the beaches to all except high-roller guests. Tulum particularly has come under fire lately for its blatant disregard of the region’s ecology and the rampant corruption that permits such abhorrent behavior. The depredations are severe enough to have inspired a new documentary, The Dark Side of Tulum .
But the Yucatán Peninsula, sprawling across 76,300 square miles, is obviously much more than its resorts. That’s what Van Balam hopes to show, and it was certainly what we witnessed.
“To have the freedom to move around between the hundreds of hidden gems that are available on the campervan map, to be able to change plans in an instant,” says Khayyam. “To plan a day or two on the beach, then be given a tip about a hidden virgin cenote, pack the van and go. There are campsites across the peninsula where you can rent space and get food from local families, where you can wake up to the sound of the monkeys and birds; beaches where the reef is vibrant, and meet local people who share a piece of their lives with you, this is why we are here. And this is what we hope to share with others. Others who choose to be respectful of the epic place they are visiting.”
On our last morning with Van Balam, we woke up with the sun shining through the mosquito netting of the van’s open rear doors and glistening over Bacalar: a lagoon known as the lake of seven colors. This 26-square mile freshwater wonder was once a pirate looting ground, close to the border with Belize, and a place where you can find one of the greatest reservoirs of the Yucatán’s freshwater. We camped at the stunning Cayuco Maya property, about a 10-minute drive north of the village of Bacalar, where you can find rustic cabins and a kitchen. Occasionally there are yoga retreats, mostly attracting city-slicker Mexicans, especially during Semana Santa vacation, when the two weeks surrounding Easter see the place turn into a wild party zone.
But on this occasion, we were the only people there and found ourselves in pure tranquility. There’s a small kitchen run by some local women where our mouths were set on fire from the habanero pepper salsa, only to be soothed by fresh guanabana juice. “Playa del Carmen and Tulum went up in smoke rapidly once Cancún had lost its bohemian appeal, a result of the never-ending search for the next 'hidden gem.'”
Heading down to the lake in the morning to take a refreshing dip in its calm waters, looking across into the pure jungle, it’s hard to imagine how anyone could be willing to let this natural paradise be lost to greed. It also made me grateful that the way I had been able to experience this region was through camping on my own terms: depending on the food and hospitality of the local people—and at the prices they dictated. It’s far better than the resort alternative.
But the resorts will only proliferate with the arrival of the proposed “Tren Maya,” the atrociously ecocidal high-speed tourist train set to tear through the jungle from Cancun into territory previously attainable only with some determination and at least a basic Spanish vocabulary. Even Bacalar is already seeing a rush to develop, with new luxury hotels being built in anticipation of the arrival of foreign dollars.
Cancún expanded with ease. Playa del Carmen and Tulum went up in smoke rapidly once Cancún had lost its bohemian appeal, a result of the never-ending search for the next “hidden gem.” And all we can hope is that someone with political power stands up against it. The Mayan people, whose ancestral name is so offensively emblazoned on the train’s destructive cars, have spoken out against having their territory slaughtered. So far, the Mexican government hasn’t listened.

The Gold Miner Who Hiked Into Colorado’s Worst Blizzard on a Mission for Love,www.thedailybeast.com,Anthony Effinger,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-gold-miner-who-hiked-into-colorados-worst-blizzard-on-a-mission-for-love,"The Gold Miner Who Hiked Into Colorado’s Worst Blizzard on a Mission for Love Courtesy Glenwood Springs Historical Society Loren Waldo tried to cross the Rockies during one of the worst winters in U.S. history. His foolishness in the face of extreme weather remains a potent, symbolic warning. Anthony Effinger 04.05.19 10:32 PM ET
B y 7 p.m. exactly 120 years ago, Loren Waldo was dead. No one can say that for sure because he was alone. But if you lie down in the snow for just five minutes as if you’d fallen there, unable to ski through a sub-zero night, you’ll know.
I’m writing this from the inside of a 150-year-old cabin at the very top of Boreas Pass, a gale-prone gap on the Continental Divide in Colorado. It’s below zero, and if not for the wood stove at my feet and the down bag that I will zip into soon, I’d be as dead as Waldo on the anniversary of his death: February 11.
I skied up here to see the winter day that Waldo, a 27-year-old bookkeeper from Breckenridge chose to try and cross Boreas and get to Como, on the Eastern Slope of the Rockies, and then on to Denver, where his lovely young wife waited for him.
Normally, he’d have taken the narrow-gauge train that snaked east out of town. But the tracks were buried by the Big Snow of 1899, the worst winter to hit Colorado since miners had shambled into the high country looking for gold 40 years before.
There hasn’t been a winter like it since. More than 31 feet of snow fell from December through April alone, a record never beaten. Not even close. Few people ventured into it the way Waldo did, in a light overcoat, a fedora, and 10-foot skis he could hardly use. A potent combination of love and—you gotta believe—lust drove him on as the sun went down over the Tenmile Range and the temperature dropped to 35 below zero.
Why ski into a blizzard dressed like a businessman in Chicago? We will never know. Waldo went over the pass with two other men, both of whom had dressed for near-Arctic conditions. I think Waldo, an Illinois native, had come to rely on the luxuries of the day: trains that scaled the steepest mountain passes; wood stoves that kicked out furnace-like heat; and beds covered in quilts. Flatlanders like Waldo could arrive in mining towns without hiking a single pass, then live like city dwellers.
“Big, kind-hearted Waldo,” as the people of Breckenridge called him (he stood over six feet tall), was the victim of a climate anomaly that year. He might have made it in any other winter. But the whole country froze in 1899. There were 45 states at the time, and the mercury in every one of them fell below 0.
Temperatures in Montana plummeted to a Siberian minus 61. Storms dumped 30 inches of snow in New Jersey in a matter of days. Food shipments in Chicago stopped for three weeks. Ice floes drifted past New Orleans on the Mississippi. Sleet clung to telegraph lines in Florida, snapping them to the ground. Kids had a snowball fight on the steps of the capitol in Tallahassee.
The weather event became known as the Great Arctic Outbreak of 1899. A massive pool of Arctic air migrated south over the U.S. The culprit was the jet stream, the west-to-east air flow high in the atmosphere that—normally—pens Arctic air in the north. That winter, the jet stream dipped farther south than it had in recorded history, and frigid air followed.
These days in the American West, it’s hard to imagine the blizzards of 1899. Most every winter is warmer than the last, and the summers are often ruined by smoke from wildfires. All of that, and worse, is predicted by climate change. Surprisingly, so are Arctic outbreaks like the one in 1899 (the journal ​Nature​ described the mechanics in a study last March).
The East Coast and Midwest are expected to freeze most often. December’s deadly snow in North Carolina is evidence. So is January’s fatal Arctic outbreak in the Midwest. In March, another, bigger outbreak stretched across the country, driving temperatures down to just 9 degrees as far south as Tulsa, Oklahoma. North Platte, Nebraska, fell to a March record of minus 25.
In Colorado, it snowed like it was 1899. Breckenridge got 40 inches in three days. On March 3, an avalanche crashed down the granite walls of Tenmile Canyon. Video of the slide showed a towering plume of snow filling the canyon. Four days later, another avalanche buried four cars under 15 feet of snow near Copper Mountain Resort. Next, a “bomb cyclone” hit the Colorado plains. Winds at the Denver airport howled to a record 80 miles per hour as a Florida-worthy hurricane, but with snow, struck the middle of the country. Tornadoes tore across New Mexico. Hail the size of baseballs hammered Texas. A biblical flood swept away whole towns and herds of cattle in Nebraska and Iowa.
Unless we act fast, weather anomalies like this are going to become routine. The frigid winter of 2019 shows that the world isn’t going to end in fire, as one might expect from global warming—but maybe in ice. Given that, it might be wise to study the winter of 1899 on the roof of America and see how people coped.
Mattie Walker, a 27-year-old school teacher from Kokomo, a vanished mining town near Copper Mountain, wrote about the winter. It began, she said, just like any other.
“Large feathery flakes fell until Kokomo was a city of whiteness,” she wrote in a letter. “The wind would blow occasionally and heap the snow into great drifts, but this was nothing uncommon for this place and passed almost unnoticed.”
Then the winter got real. Snow started falling by the foot in January, and the wind blew constantly. A train left Kokomo on January 17, and one didn’t return until April 27. It wasn’t for lack of trying. Railroad operators outfitted trains with rotating blades that bored through snow like mammoth drills. But even those couldn’t dislodge the soaring drifts that walled off the tracks on the Continental Divide. “ When men came on a wrecking train to shovel out the tracks, another slide ripped down and pushed them and their rig into the river, killing three. ”
Coal ran out, and townspeople had to dig through snow to get wood off nearby hills. Telegraph lines fell, and the only mail came from Leadville, 20 miles away, by snowshoe. Fresh food disappeared. People left the table hungry, and everyone, not just the miners, played cards, a game considered too rough for women.
“I began to be haunted by the dreadful fear that the snow would continue to fall until the valley was filled,” Mattie Walker wrote, “and the people of this little camp, like the inhabitants of Pompeii, might in long years after be dug from this tomb.”
People in nearby Breckenridge paid men to ski 20 miles over Boreas Pass to Como, on the eastern side of the Divide, for supplies and mail. Bored, and tired of trudging through snow, a group of Breckenridge men tried to build a “snow bike,” with a paddle wheel on the back to push it along. It broke on the first outing and became kindling.
Dances in Breckenridge that winter often went until 4 a.m.
Elmer Peabody, 14, had to trudge through feet of snow every day to feed the family’s cow. The animal never left the barn all winter because its small pasture was buried, and that probably saved its life, Peabody wrote years later. When their neighbor went out to milk her cow, she found it butchered by a group of men desperate for food. They paid her, at least.
Loren Waldo didn’t last long, marooned in a mountain town without his pretty new wife, Minnie. She lived with her mother in Denver, while Waldo stayed in Breckenridge to watch over mining claims he had made. In 1887, two lucky diggers had pulled a 12-pound chunk of crystallized gold out of nearby Farncomb Hill, the biggest ever found in Colorado. The monster rock, called Tom’s Baby, stoked gold lust in a town that already had it bad.
Waldo had been torn between gold and his girl. Now, his claims were buried. His gold, if there was any, was safe under feet of snow, and he had little reason to stick around.
It had to feel bleak. Avalanches fell around Breckenridge, obliterating whole hamlets. One slide blocked trains near Glenwood Springs. When men came on a wrecking train to shovel out the tracks, another slide ripped down and pushed them and their rig into the river, killing three. Cabins in Swandyke, just a few miles from Breckenridge, disappeared in a slide soon after. Another one near Central City smothered a mother and her baby daughter in their cabin. Her two young sons survived. Mattie Walker wasn’t crazy: Colorado was becoming Pompeii.
Waldo saw his exit on February 10, when two men came into J.H. Hartman’s general store, where Waldo worked, looking for some tallow candles. Tallow kept snow from freezing to the bottoms of wooden skis, and the men, Eli Ruff and Ed Flanders, were fresh out of it after skiing 19 miles from Kokomo to Breckenridge. They, too, wanted to get over Boreas to Denver.
Ruff and Flanders were hardcore, especially Flanders. He worked as a fireman on the railroad, shoveling coal into engines. Before coming to Colorado, the wiry 32-year-old fought bloody battles in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. “His constitution is that of iron,” wrote a Denver Post journalist who interviewed him after the Boreas crossing.
When Waldo learned that Flanders and Ruff planned to cross Boreas Pass on skis, he pleaded to join them. He had recently purchased a pair of Norwegian shoes , which is what people called skis at the time. He hadn’t done any “extended walking” on them, he told Flanders, but he “had been practicing in the vicinity of Breckenridge with some success.”
Waldo was a big man, but even for him, his skis were abnormally long (10 feet) and absurdly heavy (made of ash). Flanders, by contrast, had a lighter 8-foot pair, and he knew how to use them. So did Ruff. To climb, they wrapped burlap sacks around them under foot, giving traction.
Flanders and Ruff stayed in Breckenridge that night. They left the next day at 11:20 a.m. after Waldo collected his pay from Hartman. Waldo’s gear must have alarmed them. He dressed for a winter walk in Denver, with a skull cap under his fedora and a pair of black mittens. He had lashed a suitcase over his shoulder. It was the 1899 equivalent of skiing in jeans.
Worse, it became clear immediately that Waldo couldn’t handle his Norwegian shoes. Instead of skiing up the railroad line, the men slogged up Indiana Gulch, a shorter route to the top of Boreas Pass. There was six feet of fresh snow, and the wind blew hard. Waldo lagged. Flanders and Ruff, sweating from the climb, froze every time they stopped to wait.
The three men took a longer rest three miles from the top of Boreas at Sutton’s mill. History doesn’t say if the place milled rock or timber, but the owner had a warm stove and plenty of coffee, and Waldo drank a lot of it. This was a certainly a blunder. Caffeine constricts blood vessels, denying blood flow to the hands and feet. It’s also a diuretic, flushing out crucial fluids along with all the sweat. Waldo may have felt better after his stop at Sutton’s mill, but it wouldn’t last.
“We kept together for some time, but he began again to drop behind,” Flanders told the Denver Post . Ruff warned that if they kept stopping, their sweat would freeze them to death. They waved for Waldo to follow as he struggled in the snow, but they kept moving, losing sight of him after a mile.
The old mountain railroads needed a lot of maintenance, so workers lived year-round in houses along the line and minded their section of track. These “section” houses dotted rail lines throughout the Rockies. Flanders and Ruff bypassed the tall, inviting house at the top of Boreas and skied down to a lower one, arriving at 6:30 p.m., just before dark.
Waldo, meantime, reached the top of the pass at 5:30 p.m. He warmed himself in the section house that Flanders and Ruff had skied past. Science says that Waldo should have been dead long before he reached the top of Boreas. It’s tempting to argue that love kept him going, but the Illinois native had probably acclimatized to the altitude and cold soon after he arrived in Summit County from Denver. Record snow and blistering cold had almost certainly become routine for him by the time he took off for Como, lulling him into thinking he could survive outside the safety of his house in town.
The agent at the summit section house told him to stay the night. I can tell you from experience that he absolutely should have. As it happened, we rolled into the smaller, older cabin next to the summit section house 90 minutes before Waldo did, exactly 120 years later. He would have been trudging through the snow field just to the west of us as we lit the wood stove and started water for hot cocoa. “ At 1 below zero, with a steady wind, frostbite can start in 30 minutes. At minus 30, in can begin in just 5 minutes. ”
I went out at 5:30 p.m. to see the world as Waldo did. The sun hung at the very same angle: low in the southwest and diminished. The wind tore across the ridge, blowing snow over to the Atlantic side of the Continental Divide. Clouds skittered eastward. Remove a glove for too long to take a picture, and it took an hour to warm your hand.
Waldo ignored the station agent and went back out in this frozen world, but worse. When we were there, the thermometer at the top of Boreas read 1 below zero. On Waldo’s final night, it fell to minus 35. I can’t imagine that he lasted more than a few more hours after leaving. At around 7:30 p.m., I put on my skis and headed east toward Como. The trees had turned black in the twilight. All but the tallest ones would have been buried completely in Waldo’s day, leaving a field of white.
South Park, one of Colorado’s three broad mountain basins, spread out far below me. Somewhere down there was Como. If he could see South Park, lit by a far-off sunset like it was for me, the pleasant, flat valley would have drawn Waldo onward.
I stopped, dropped my poles, and laid down on the wind-crusted snow. Within seconds, the cold penetrated all my layers. Blowing snow collected in the creases of my jacket. I could imagine freezing there and being covered in no time. At 1 below zero, with a steady wind, frostbite can start in 30 minutes . At minus 30, in can begin in just 5 minutes.
Was it madness to go? Yes, but it may not have looked that way to Waldo. In 1899, people lived all over the mountains of Summit County. Railroad agents lived in section houses at 11,500 feet. Men worked in mines and mills just below timberline. Waldo may have felt safe until the end, given the crowd.
A few days after Waldo disappeared, a Denver Post reporter visited Minnie at her mother’s house in Denver and described the scene: “Two helpless women, wrung with anxiety, sat in a cozy back room of the neat cottage at 1855 Lafayette Street this morning, as they have sat for many days, waiting for news they almost dread to receive.”
A friend arrived and tried to calm Minnie by suggesting that Waldo could be holed up in a miner’s cabin, snowed in and suffering from exposure, but very much alive. “Oh, but if he is sick, I want to be with him,” Minnie said.
Waldo’s father, Nathan, spent much of the spring looking for his son, helped by Waldo’s friends from Breckenridge. Late storms thwarted the search well into April, piling more snow on the dead man. A train arrived in Breckenridge on April 24, the first one in 79 days. In May, searchers found a pile of clothes beside a dead dog. The clothes contained theater tickets, but no money, and Waldo was known to have been carrying a wad.
In May, Waldo’s father offered a $200 reward for his son’s body, about $6,000 in today’s dollars. Finally, on June 3, a man named James Craig found Waldo, face-down in a stand of pine. He shouted to Waldo’s father, who searched nearby. “ Waldo was one of 105 Americans who died in the first two weeks of February 1899 alone. Avalanches killed many of them, and the cold got the rest. ”
The body was black from exposure, the face weathered beyond recognition. Waldo had tried to save himself by wrapping shirts from his valise around his legs. Then, he must have given up. One glove was off, and a pencil lay beside him. His father concluded that Waldo had been writing to his wife.
“He realized that death was at hand,” his father told the Denver Post . “He pulled off one glove and got out his pencil and paper. If he wrote a note, the wind blew it away, for death came before he got the glove on again.”
Waldo was one of 105 Americans who died in the first two weeks of February 1899 alone. Avalanches killed many of them, and the cold got the rest. None of them had ever seen a winter like that, and many, like Waldo, underestimated its danger.
With the climate changing, we have to ask ourselves what dangers we’re not seeing, what catastrophes we’re laughing off. Some of us are going to find ourselves in frigid white-outs in the Rockies, watching our SUVs run out of gas after avalanches close the Interstate. Others are going to be swept away in ice-laden floods like the one this month that submerged Verdigre, Nebraska, and Hamburg, Iowa. These deaths will make headlines, until they become routine.
A tip if you’re the person in the SUV: put some candles and matches in the glove box. A single candle will heat your rig for hours while you wait for a rescue. In the meantime, try to shrink your carbon footprint. It’s your only hope.

The end of Come From Away is as rousing as the rest of this heart-warming, slickly executed show, which offsets any mawkishness with salty Newfoundland wit and practicality.
The hit musical focuses on what happened when the town of Gander took in 6,579 international plane passengers after 38 flights were forced to land there on Sept. 11, 2001 . Come From Away contrasts the experiences of the travelers and locals as they live alongside one another for a week, all undergoing various changes and mini-transformations.
The Tony-winning show has been nominated for multiple awards, including nine Olivier Awards in London this weekend; and to mark this and its second anniversary on Broadway, the producers made a video of its four casts—on Broadway, in Toronto, touring North America, and in London—performing the finale. The Daily Beast reveals this exclusively below.
In the musical, Gander’s residents readily open their homes to the planes’ passengers, feeding them, and taking care of them.
The amount of detail—right down to the men of the town making sure female travelers had enough sanitary pads—was gleaned through hours of patient listening and interviewing by Canadian husband and wife Irene Sankoff and David Hein, who wrote the book, music, and lyrics of the musical, and who met the townsfolk and passengers at a 10th anniversary event in 2011. From this set of interviews the musical took shape.
We first met before their Broadway opening and spoke this week as they prepared to travel to London for the Olivier Awards—and as they mulled the script of the planned Come From Away movie and anticipated further openings of the show in Melbourne this summer and Buenos Aires. Come From Away , a story of worlds coming together and understanding across so many boundaries, really has conquered the world.
The couple had just returned from California where they had had meetings about the film, “imagining what 38 planes and 7,000 people in a town of 10,000 people will look like on screen.” Yes, there will be special effects but the intention is also to film in Gander itself, leading—how meta—to the likelihood, said Hein, of “the film crew, actors and staff being invited in people’s homes, just as it was in the story.”
A production company, which the couple decline to name, wants to start shooting the film “as soon as possible.”
When asked if the dream cast would include Hollywood stars, Sankoff issues an emphatic no. “We don’t want Hollywood celebrities in it because we don’t want the audience to be taken out of the moment. We want it to be regular people.” The movie cast may come from existing Come From Away casts, or from actors the couple have liked in auditions but not been able to cast yet, or yet-to-be-seen actors. “I think we will know our dream cast when we see them,” Sankoff said.
Hein added, “The real dream cast will be the people of Gander, who I hope will be extras.”
Traveling the world with the show has been illuminating, the couple said. “It makes the world a smaller place,” said Sankoff. “It’s so universal audience reactions are pretty much the same. We’ve met people who lost people that day, who knew passengers or flight attendants on the planes, or who were in the towers (like Hein's cousin, who thankfully survived).” “It’s never bad to tell a story about human kindness but particularly right now. Our social media and newsfeeds are filled with so much divisiveness and anger”
The success of the show, Sankoff said, “shows how much the world needs a story like this right now. It’s humbling that it has helped people who have kept their feelings so bottled up till now. These stories of kindness, generosity, and open-mindedness have shown people that hope is possible from that day.”
Hein said: “It’s never bad to tell a story about human kindness but particularly right now. Our social media and newsfeeds are filled with so much divisiveness and anger.”
The mayor of Gander, said Hein, once noted the week had begun with 7,000 strangers stranded on Tarmac. By the middle of the week they were 7,000 friends staying in people’s homes, and by the end of the week the townsfolk were saying farewell to 7,000 family members. Hein also said that Come From Away , its multiple city and touring performers and staff, has become its own global family.
The show’s first preview in 2015 was on the night of the Paris Bataclan club attack. There was a discussion that night about if the show should say something direct to the audience about the atrocity; the decision was to perform the show and let the message of inclusion and kindness make its own statement.
At one New York performance in March 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau escorted Ivanka Trump—the message of the show at sharp variance to the policies and rhetoric of her father.
“We welcome everyone,” said Sankoff. “We hope they take some of what they see back into their own lives. We didn’t meet or talk to her. I saw her say to Nikki Haley (then the American ambassador to the United Nations)at the end: ‘That was great.’”
President Trump had been due to fly to New York, but when told about the plan to see the show, reportedly said, “Absolutely not.”
Hein said, “I want to share the story of Come From Away in light of the travel bans or current discussions of walls and ‘us and them.’ This is a story that reminds us of our similarities, and how hopefully we can work things out together. At each step we have been amazed at how far this little show has gone and been embraced by all our audiences. It’s kind of incredible.”
It’s always great, the couple said, to see Newfoundlanders and Canadians waving flags. There is one moment when a character says the Gander landscape is “trees, rocks and nothing.” It is meant insultingly, but Hein recalled Newfoundlander audiences saying proudly, “Yeah, got that right.” (The show has been performed in Gander and St. John’s in Newfoundland.)
In London, Hein added, the voice of Tom Brokaw has been replaced by that of Oprah Winfrey, in a voice message left for a local reporter (the Brits didn’t know who Brokaw was, said Hein).
The success of the show has been life-changing, and has left the couple, he said, in “a constant sense of wonder.”
It’s good that Molly, their 5-and-a-half-year-old daughter, keeps them grounded; she is happily installed in her New York school and, Hein said, “from her perspective it’s totally normal to go from city to city telling this story about people being kind to one another.”
The success of Come From Away has not been a burden; other projects which the couple decline to name, are bubbling away. Their focus is on the film and also a book about how Come From Away came to be, while also containing other real-life stories from that extraordinary week in Gander that had to be excised from the musical for reasons of space.
“It’s a privilege and blessing to be able to tell this story, never a burden,” said Sankoff.
The couple oversee charity drives, and also wryly note the increase in tourism in Central Newfoundland since Come From Away began. “You will honestly, truly find people asking you to come back to their place for dinner when you step out of Gander airport,” insisted Hein.
“It some ways it feels like yesterday and in some ways it feels like years of our lives,” said Sankoff of the globe-conquering success of Come From Away . “But it’s amazing to travel around the world and celebrate a story about kindness and friendships.” What happened in Gander was unique, but its impact and message has turned out to be—in every sense of the word—universal.

Porn Stars Find 2020 Democratic Candidates ‘Extremely Depressing’,www.thedailybeast.com,Aurora Snow,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/porn-stars-find-2020-democratic-candidates-extremely-depressing,"Porn Stars Find 2020 Democratic Candidates ‘Extremely Depressing’ Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast With nearly all of them having supported FOSTA/SESTA, those in the adult film world are finding it hard to get excited about the crop of Democratic presidential candidates. Aurora Snow 04.05.19 10:27 PM ET
W ith the presidential election approaching, many constituents in the adult industry are struggling to forgive Democratic candidates’ past voting record . Less than a year ago, most of the 2020 frontrunners voted in favor of two bills: “Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act” and “Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act” (commonly known as FOSTA/SESTA), legislation that has negatively impacted sex workers more than the sex trafficking it purports to stop. The new legislation pushes responsibility, and thus legal consequences, to the online platforms that “ promote or facilitate prostitution ” without distinguishing consenting sex work from coerced sex trafficking.
In an attempt to excuse some of the candidates for their uneducated voting faux pas in passing FOSTA/SESTA, porn star Nina Kayy offers a rather empathetic view. “They probably signed it blindly without talking to anyone in the industry or talking to sex-trafficking victims,” she says. “Sure, a lot of sex workers are mad about it but you have to look at the bigger picture: yes, it’s part of the candidate’s job to reach out and educate themselves, but imagine if they didn’t sign a bill against sex trafficking? How would that look to the people that voted for them?”
According to Kayy, all of the congresspeople vying for the 2020 ticket—Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Corey Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, etc.—are guilty of doing what the majority of voters do at the polls: voting for the header. Hence a bill even the DOJ expressed uncertainty over was passed, 97-2 in the Senate and 388-25 in the House.
Independent contractors (i.e. sex workers) use online forums to discuss clients, post reviews and warn fellow co-workers of potential dangers. Those options have now largely been removed, with sites—fearing prosecution for “sex trafficking”—hesitating to allow consenting sex workers a platform to validate the safety of clients or independently advertise and book work. It’s thus driven many consenting sex workers off-line and underground, endangering them.
“I think the original intent of FOSTA/SESTA was to prevent sex trafficking but as a result, and what all sex workers have realized, is that it really has taken away a lot of our resources to do our job safely. It’s backfired without completing the original goal,” offers porn star Christiana Cinn.
Prolific porn agent Mark Spiegler doubts the legislation will have an impact on sex trafficking. “Even though the law doesn’t do what it’s intended to do it’s an easy vote-getter, but there’s no real sex trafficking that’s going to be stopped by this,” he says. “A lot of people I’d consider regular sex workers are kind of stymied now that Craigslist is down. Other sites where escorts went to discuss johns or post reviews have also been stymied, so it’s lowered the possible protections sex workers had.” “ My biggest concern moving forward into 2020 is that sex workers will continue to be othered and disregarded when it comes to policy and procedure. Stop talking *about* us, and start talking *to* us! ”
Politicians frequently conflate consensual sex work and sex trafficking despite their drastic differences, whether to push moral agendas or due to ignorance. As seen in the recent massage parlor sting ensnaring New England Patriots’ owner Robert Kraft , the police have repeatedly referred to it as a “sex trafficking” operation, yet no trafficking charges were filed and even the Palm Beach District Attorney admitted ""there’s no allegation that any defendant engaged in human trafficking.” Many have speculated that “trafficking” is a term loosely used by law enforcement to sanction prostitution busts.
From the prosecutor’s office to defense attorney, Judge Herb Dodell has argued both sides and calls the trumped-up Kraft sting ridiculous. Sex work and sex trafficking are separate issues, he argues. “There are criteria that have been established on what represents human trafficking versus something else—even in California. Though you don’t have to show there was a force of coercion, human trafficking is basically where you take people and you make them slaves,” explains Dodell. “Prostitution is very, very different—an example clearly represented within the brothels in Nevada.”
Sex worker Alice Little, who works at one of Nevada’s legalized brothels, says she feels invisible knowing the next crop of candidates voted on SESTA/FOSTA. Little is frustrated by the policymakers’ willful ignorance, casting votes that impact sex workers without bothering to educate themselves on the subject. Like many of us, Little expects better from a presidential candidate. “There is no excuse for not understanding the full implications of a bill before choosing to vote on it,” says Little. “My biggest concern moving forward into 2020 is that sex workers will continue to be othered and disregarded when it comes to policy and procedure. Stop talking about us, and start talking to us!”
Discouraged by the options, or lack thereof, adult star Sydney Leathers calls the current selection of candidates “extremely depressing.” During the last election Leathers recalls feeling as though there was “no one to vote for,” and given her issues with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Leathers has adopted a similar position. The “End Banking for Human Trafficking Act,” which a bill Warren co-sponsored with Republican Marco Rubio, is more injurious than just, given banks’ well-known history of targeting sex workers by closing their accounts .
“We’ve already seen politicians have no real idea what sex trafficking actually is and they make no real effort to separate consensual sex work from trafficking in their legislation.

Trump Slams Nonexistent ‘Judge Flores’ for Landmark Immigration Ruling Actually Named After Migrant Teen,www.thedailybeast.com,julia.arciga@thedailybeast.com (Julia Arciga),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-slams-nonexistent-judge-flores-for-landmark-immigration-ruling-actually-named-after-migrant-teen,"TRUMP’S GREATEST HITS Trump Slams Nonexistent ‘Judge Flores’ for Landmark Immigration Ruling Actually Named After Migrant Teen ‘I have to tell you, Judge Flores, whoever you may be, that decision was a disaster for our country,’ he said, at least acknowledging he has no idea who Flores is. 04.05.19 9:14 PM ET Kevin Lamarque/Reuters
President Trump had a lot to say Friday about a landmark immigration ruling that limits how long the government can detain undocumented migrant children. Unfortunately, his argument took a turn for the incoherent as soon as he publicly called out a nonexistent judge for a 20-day cap on detaining immigrant minors.
Complaining about a build-up of migrants at the border while visiting Calexico, California, Trump blamed it on “some very bad court decisions,” singling out the “Flores decision” as a “disaster.”
“I have to tell you, Judge Flores, whoever you may be, that decision is a disaster for our country,” Trump said during a meeting with border patrol officials.
The “decision” the president was referring to was Reno v. Flores—otherwise known as the Flores Settlement—which protects migrant children from being held indefinitely in custody and grants them certain basic rights, like the right to food, medical assistance, drinking water, and toilets while in detention. The Trump administration tried unsuccessfully to modify the agreement last year to allow for longer detention periods for minors.
The agreement was named not after a judge, but 15-year-old Jenny Lisette Flores, who fled El Salvador in the 1980s and was detained upon trying to enter the U.S. to live with her aunt. The teen was the lead plaintiff in the case, which came before the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court . It was settled in 1997, with Clinton-era Attorney General Janet Reno as the defendant.
The Flores Settlement has been an obstacle for the Trump administration since their family separation policy rollout and for current immigration policies, with lawsuits claiming the government is holding children indefinitely and violating the settlement.
Trump’s criticism of the imaginary judge sparked a barrage of mockery on social media, where many were quick to point out the flub came in the same week the president claimed windmills cause cancer and falsely said his father was born in Germany .
Earlier Friday, the president also claimed those approaching the southern border to seek asylum in the U.S. were running a “scam” during his visit to Southern California.
“Asylum, you know I look at some of these asylum people, they’re gang members. They’re not afraid of anything... and they say ‘I fear for my life,’ they’re the ones causing fear for life. It’s a scam, it’s a hoax,” he said , before fitting in a jab at Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential Russian interference in the 2016 election.
“I know about hoaxes, I just went through a hoax,” Trump said, referring to his previous remarks claiming the “Russia hoax” was “finally dead.”
Trump also claimed the United States no longer had the capacity to accept more asylum seekers or undocumented migrants entering through the southern border.
“The system is full. We can’t take you anymore. Whether it’s asylum. Whether it’s anything you want. It’s illegal immigration,” Trump said, according to CNN. “Can’t take you anymore. Can’t take you. Our country is full… Can’t take you anymore, I’m sorry. So turn around. That’s the way it is.” READ THIS LIST"
Lil Nas X’s ‘Old Town Road’ Is a Fascinating Turning Point for Country Music,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lil-nas-xs-old-town-road-remix-feat-billy-ray-cyrus-is-a-turning-point-for-country-music,"COWBOY HAT FROM GUCCI Lil Nas X’s ‘Old Town Road’ Is a Fascinating Turning Point for Country Music The 19-year-old rapper’s unlikely story of trap-country music domination could only have happened on the internet. 04.05.19 7:38 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast
Lil Nas X is riding back stronger than ever. The 19-year-old Atlanta rapper behind the hit single “Old Town Road” was removed from the Hot Country chart last week after Billboard deemed the track not “country” enough. The move immediately spurred accusations of discrimination from fellow rappers, including Tyga and Ski Mask Slump.
The outcry has only spurred Lil Nas X to further success, however, as the rapper returned with a remix, this time with the support of another country outlaw. “Old Town Road (Remix)” by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus dropped Thursday night, and climbed to No. 2 on Apple Music by Friday evening. The original “Old Town Road,” meanwhile, is sitting pretty at No. 1 on the platform. (Billboard won’t release their charts until next week.)
Cyrus tweeted his support of Lil Nas X earlier this week. “When I got thrown off the charts, Waylon Jennings said to me ‘Take this as a compliment’ means you’re doing something great!” he wrote. The two met up Thursday night to record the remix, according to a video of the two of them in a recording studio that Lil Nas X posted on Twitter. In the video, Cyrus further praises the rapper: “You’re a light in this world, man. You’re gonna shine. People are gonna see you from all over the universe.”
The up-and-down journey of “Old Town Road” started on the social media platform TikTok. A prolific user, Lil Nas X posted his song on the app, which is largely dominated by teenagers making short-form, highly edited videos. As Gen Z does, it quickly turned “Old Town Road” into a musical meme: the “Yeehaw Challenge.”
Following the rules of viral success, the song then leaped over to Twitter, Instagram and YouTube before populating streaming platforms like SoundCloud, Spotify and Apple Music. Lil Nas X did it all without being signed to a label, meaning he never officially released a studio song ready for airplay. The song sparked a bidding war, however, and Lil Nas X is now with Columbia Records.
Radio stations, wanting to capitalize on the viral hit, ripped the song straight off YouTube. According to New York magazine , the YouTube version—which became the track’s unofficial music video—uses montage footage from the video game Red Redemption 2. With both social media and traditional music avenues on board, the song then hit Billboard’s charts , debuting at No. 36 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop, No. 83 on the Hot 100, and No. 19 on the Hot Country charts.
Then, suddenly, it was taken off the charts. Rolling Stone was the first to report that Billboard had quietly removed the country rap single from the Hot Country chart. Billboard told Columbia Records that his inclusion was accidental and, upon review, did not meet the requirements for country “musical composition.” On “Old Town Road,” Lil Nas X raps with a twang, “My life is a movie / Bull ridin' and boobies / Cowboy hat from Gucci / Wrangler on my booty” over banjo strings and a trap beat.
“While ‘Old Town Road’ incorporates references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version,” Billboard said in a statement. Had they not removed the track, “Old Town Road” would’ve likely topped Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart .
Lil Nas X has “hope” the remix will bring him back to Billboard’s country charts, but there’s no guarantee. Billboard often considers original and remixed songs as one when it comes to charting. In 2016, for example, Beyoncé released a studio remix of her country R&B tune “Daddy Lessons” featuring The Dixie Chicks, but it was not considered for Billboard’s country charts. Instead, any chart success it garnered was attributed to the original version of song on Beyoncé’s Lemonade album. The Grammys also infamously rejected Beyoncé’s 2016 submission of the song for consideration in country categories.
Another obstacle: Billboard’s charting criteria includes radio performance. A Billboard spokesperson told The Washington Post that “Old Town Road” recieved 63 plays on mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop radio stations but “zero on country equivalents.” Country radio is notoriously a highly-guarded, selective unit. Both Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris, artists who straddle the line between country and pop, have vocally criticized country radio for also limiting female artists’ airplay.
Former Nashville-based employee of Sony Music Shane Morris tweeted about country music’s racism last week, noting Billboard’s country charts did not shun Taylor Swift’s distinctly pop album Red or Sam Hunt’s use of autotune and rap beats on Montevallo . “By removing Lil Nas X from the Country Charts, the powers that be (and yes, I'm openly saying the Country music industry operates like the mafia) continue what they want country music to sound like, and more importantly... LOOK like,” he said.
“Old Town Road” is part of a bigger social media movement known as the Black Yeehaw agenda . With the obsession over Bradley Cooper as Jackson Maine in A Star Is Born and pop-disco-country star Kacey Musgraves, there has come an impassioned push to acknowledge the presence of black artists in the country world, from Solange’s album When I Get Home to the artists influenced by country in their aesthetics and sound, including Megan Thee Stallion and Young Thug .
In an interview with Time magazine this week, Little Nas X credited Young Thug with pioneering country trap. That’s where Little Nas X wants “Old Town Road” to live, regardless of what Billboard, country music or even Billy Ray Cyrus say. He told Time , “The song is country trap. It’s not one, it’s not the other. It’s both. It should be on both.” READ THIS LIST"

"Commentary: A History Textbook That Inspires, Not Lectures, Students About America",tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/a-history-textbook-that-inspires-not-lectures-students-about-america/ ,"by Jenna Robinson
From the very beginning, it’s clear that Wilfred M. McClay’s Land of Hope: An Invitation to the Great American Story isn’t a typical textbook. The title alone alerts readers that McClay’s book will not be the kind of history text that has become so popular in today’s high school and college courses—a diatribe against America’s many sins. Instead, it is an accurate, but loving, story of our country and our shared culture. McClay describes his book as “a patriotic endeavor as well as a scholarly one.”
In his introduction, McClay explains that the purpose of his text is:
to offer to American readers, young and old alike, an accurate, responsible, coherent, persuasive, and inspiring narrative account of their own country–an account that will inform and deepen their sense of the land they inhabit and equip them for the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship.
McClay is just the person to provide such an account. He is the G.T. and Libby Blankenship Chair in the History of Liberty at the University of Oklahoma and the Director of the Center for the History of Liberty. His other works include Why Place Matters: Geography, Identity, and Civic Life in Modern America and The Student’s Guide to U.S. History . The text will be available on May 21 and published by Encounter Books, a non-profit “dedicated to strengthening the marketplace of ideas and engaging in educational activities to help preserve democratic culture.”
After a beautifully written introduction, “Beginnings: Settlement and Unsettlement” starts with the first human settlers in the new world—twenty to thirty thousand years ago—and ends with Christopher Columbus’ four trips from Spain to the Americas starting in 1492.
McClay’s treatment of Columbus and his discoveries is illustrative of his even-handed approach:
Columbus had trouble seeing America for the new thing that it was, and could be, and eventually would become. He was not first, and he would not be the last. It is part of the human condition, and a recurrent feature of human history, that what we find is not always what we were looking for, and what we accomplish is not always what we set out to do.
Hence, too, the reality that Columbus’s journeys were also the beginning of a great collision of cultures, a process that nearly always entails tragic and bitter consequences. Hence the cruel irony, as we shall see, that the settlement of America by newcomers would also produce a profound unsettlement for those who were not newcomers. The fresh start for the world came at a heavy price for those who were already settled on the land, men and women for whom San Salvador was not a New World being discovered but an old and familiar world about to be transformed.
The book then catalogs American history from “The Shaping of British North America” to “The World Since the Cold War” over 22 chapters. The text ends with an epilogue on “The Shape of American Patriotism.” It also includes an excellent list of works for further reading.
McClay also focuses on America as a story—something that is more than the sum of its parts—with threads that run through the narrative and tie it together: individual liberty, self-reliance, and relentless optimism. Because of this focus, Land of Hope is more than just a list of dates, battles, and important people. It also contains poetry (including Robert Frost’s “And All We Call American”), excerpts from literature (a large section on the American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson, for example), and even music (including the lyrics of “WPA,” a satiric song by the Mills Brothers and jazz great Louis Armstrong).
Of course, it also includes all the obligatory history book stock features: maps of the country as it evolved from 13 colonies to 50 states, excerpts from famous speeches, and important political changes. They are woven into America’s story to provide the rich detail that makes history interesting.
Land of Hope is the kind of book I wish I’d had for my own Advanced Placement U.S. History course back in high school. I don’t remember now which book was used, but it was dull and uninspiring. It distilled the great American story into boring lists of facts and “concepts” to memorize. Land of Hope includes the same material, but in a much more engaging and naturally memorable way. Reading it is inspirational rather than merely a chore.
Unfortunately, it’s unlikely that Land of Hope will be widely adopted. With today’s politicized and “internationalized” AP U.S. History curriculum, Land of Hope would be a poor fit.
Instead, parents and grandparents who care about their children’s understanding of their own country and culture should purchase Land of Hope as a supplement to the history that students learn in school.
Professor Mark Bauerlein puts it better than I can in his panegyric to the book:
This book is THE antidote to abysmal levels of historical knowledge our high school graduates possess. History bores them; the textbooks are dreary; lessons play up guilt and identity politics. It turns them off. They want powerful tales and momentous events, genuine heroes and villains, too—an accurate but stirring rendition of the past. This is Bill McClay’s Land of Hope , a superb historian’s version of the American story, in lively prose spiced with keen analysis and compelling drama. Every school that assigns this book will see students’ eyes brighten when the Civil War comes up, the Progressive Era, the Depression, Civil Rights…The kids want an authentic, meaningful heritage, a usable past. McClay makes it real.
Every home should have a copy.

Commentary: Democracy Dies in the Darkness,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/commentary-democracy-dies-in-the-darkness/ ,"by State Representative Mike Sparks (R-Smyrna)
A few years ago, I decided to go back to Middle Tennessee State University and take the remaining few hours to complete my college degree. After attending a few semesters part-time, I needed one additional class, and I decided to complete a Maymester course.
I was searching the university’s online platform and came across a Free Expression course. The class, at first really didn’t interest me, until I met Dr. Larry Burriss. Given the name, I was expecting the class to be taught by someone in a tie-dye shirt and wearing sandals.
On the contrary, Dr. Burris was a tough, former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force who had served on active duty in various parts of the world — even at the Pentagon. He held a wealth of knowledge and was very experienced in the many facets of journalism, including his time serving as the former director of the School of Journalism and the dean of the College of Mass Communications.
The subject matter for this course was related to the expression of free speech and the First Amendment. I had often listened to his commentary on WGNS Radio and enjoyed his insight and opinions. Needless to say, his class and lectures about the importance of the First Amendment piqued my interest.
The subject of free expression encouraged me to take a few other courses. All the professors were thought-provoking and very helpful. I especially enjoyed former News Channel 5 Anchor Chris Clark’s broadcasting class. Just hearing the sound of his voice took me back to my younger years since he was a huge part of our evenings.
During Professor Clark’s first day of class, he handed each student a small card with the First Amendment written on it. As he handed it to me I Quote: d Voltaire, “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” I keep his First Amendment card with me each day.
Serving in and around politics for many years has resulted in an even greater appreciation for the First Amendment. However, I have personally witnessed false narratives used to attack those who a particular media outlet may disagree with or someone whose political beliefs didn’t align with theirs. Often, I have witnessed a headline that would appear to be used to shed a negative light on an elected official, and their words were twisted and taken out of context.
I have personally witnessed a reporter call me to ask for an interview, and when I asked what they were calling about, the reporter — whom I knew and thought very highly of — responded, “There was a prayer said at the opening ceremony of Stewarts Creek High School.” I asked the reporter who complained and why was this newsworthy? He stated that nobody complained, but he had to cover what his producers wanted him to cover. Needless to say, I was rather surprised. Ironically, the reporter couldn’t find anyone in our community who complained so he contacted a group in Washington D.C. to get a comment.
I have also seen heartbreaking stories about Ebenezer Primitive Baptist Church suffering vandalism. However, the kindness of Smyrna’s Parkway Baptist Church and others who donated to Ebenezer after this cowardly act was not reported. In my opinion, the media is more interested in generating headlines and advertising revenue than helping find solutions.
The times they are a-changin’ in the media, especially in our newspaper industry. Those particular newsrooms have been hit very hard with over 1,800 papers shutting down since 2004, and over 32,000 news personnel losing their jobs. In fact, many rural areas are becoming “news deserts” due to a lack of reporting.
This week, I was proud that my General Assembly colleagues passed House Bill 899, which I sponsored. It exempts taxes for monthly periodical newspapers. The effort may be a small one that benefits some of our smaller newspapers, but it is a step that could save them a few hundred dollars each month. That cost savings could pay the salaries of reporters to cover their local school board meetings, potential solutions to issues resulting from population growth, local sports, or other important issues facing our Tennessee communities.
The First Amendment should be a priority and a vital concern for all American citizens, both Republican and Democrat. However, we need our new era journalists to be fair and balanced and to report the news. It is what they signed up for when they chose their respective professions. Freedom of expression, no doubt, is the cornerstone of a free democratic society. Without it, we will suffer, and Democracy dies in the darkness.

Charlie Kirk Commentary: Socialists Fantasize About Becoming Mainstream,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/charlie-kirk-commentary-socialists-fantasize-about-becoming-mainstream/ ,"by Charlie Kirk
Neo-socialist radicals have had so much success at bending the Democratic Party to their will that they’re starting to forget just how deeply unpopular their policy agenda is with the rest of the country.
During a recent MSNBC profile of freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, her former senior campaign aide, Walid Shaheed, advanced the dubious theory that democratic socialism has become mainstream and that capitalism is now a “fringe” movement.
“I think Bernie Sanders really opened the window for the debate on democratic socialism in this country,” Shaheed said during the special. “It’s not as fringe as you might think. In fact, what’s becoming fringe is if you call yourself a capitalist openly.”
Clearly, Shaheed needs to get out of the office more often. His assessment might accurately reflect the majority sentiment inside AOC’s Capitol Hill echo chamber, but for the rest of America, capitalism retains its revered status as the most effective economic and political system humanity has ever devised for enhancing safety, affluence, and human happiness.
Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders is laboring under the same delusion as Shaheed. “Those ideas that we talked about here in Iowa four years ago that seemed so radical at that time … well, today, virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the American people,” Sanders insisted during a recent campaign rally.
In reality, though, Sanders’ ideas are still just as radical as they were last time voters rejected him.
Democratic socialists have seized on a recent poll to claim that their discredited philosophy is gaining popularity, but while that survey did find that a bare majority of young people hold a positive view of socialism, it also revealed that Americans overall still overwhelmingly prefer capitalism to socialism, by a margin of 56 percent to 37 percent.
It’s not difficult to understand why. After all, nothing has done more to lift humanity out of poverty than the market economy. In fact, the single greatest story of human achievement of the past 2,000 years is the dramatic rise in living standards we’ve experienced over the past two centuries thanks to the adoption of capitalism.
Capitalism is an unparalleled engine of prosperity that has enabled the world to sustain almost 7 billion people, compared to just 1 billion in 1800. One expert noted that if you multiply the gains in consumption by the gain in life expectancy worldwide, then multiply that result by 7 (for the population increase since 1800), humanity as a whole is 120 times better off than it was 200 years ago.
In the past three decades alone, progress has been so rapid that the number of people worldwide who live on less than two dollars per day is less than half of what it was in 1990.
Thanks to capitalism, even many of the world’s poorest citizens enjoy access to necessities such as food, clothing, and healthcare, while luxuries such as television, cell phones, and the internet have become virtually ubiquitous in developed countries.
Socialism, on the other hand, has consistently produced misery, poverty, and death wherever it has been tried.
In its mildest forms, socialism is an economic drag that impedes growth and innovation; when it’s taken to the extremes, socialism can turn even the most economically vibrant countries into desolate wastelands.
Hugo Chavez, for instance, was praised by democratic socialists such as Bernie Sanders for seizing the nation’s oil fields and promising to eliminate poverty and provide free health care and education for the people. Two decades after the start of Chavez’s “socialist revolution,” however, those promises have turned out to be empty, and the once prosperous Venezuelan people are now in need of the most basic staples of life — water, food, clothing, and electricity.
AOC, her staff, and other advocates of resistance and revolution can fantasize about socialism being mainstream all they want, but in reality, the American people overwhelmingly disagree — and for good reason.

“Education should aim at destroying free will so that pupils thus schooled, will be incapable throughout the rest of their lives of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished. . . . Influences of the home are obstructive; and in order to condition students, verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. . . . It is for a future scientist to make these maxims precise and to discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that SNOW is BLACK.

Minnesota House Votes in Favor of Driver's Licenses for Illegal Immigrants,tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/minnesota-house-votes-in-favor-of-drivers-licenses-for-illegal-immigrants/ ,"The Minnesota House voted in favor of a bill Friday afternoon that will allow illegal immigrants in the state to obtain valid driver’s licenses.
Under House File 1500 , an individual will not be “required to demonstrate United States citizenship or lawful presence in the United States in order to obtain a noncompliant driver’s license or identification card.”
DFL legislators and their allies first unveiled the bill at a February press conference , which Archbishop Bernard Hebda spoke at in favor of the legislation. Hebda has called the bill an “important human rights test,” and said the Catholic Church sees it as “closely related to the question of dignity of human life.”
Prior to Friday’s floor vote, supporters of the bill called one last press conference to discuss its importance. Fr. Joseph Williams, pastor of St. Stephen’s Catholic Church in Minneapolis, spoke at the press conference on behalf of the Minnesota Catholic Conference.
“Some of the people whom I pastor don’t have their papers, but all of them bear the image and likeness of God. And I’ve discovered over the years that they love this great country as much as I do, and they’re working hard, often in humble circumstances, to make it prosperous” Williams said Friday.
“The Catholic bishops of Minnesota feel this is a moral imperative and one that is long overdue. May God inspire our legislators to feel the same,” he added.
Several Democratic lawmakers delivered impassioned remarks in support of the bill on the House floor.
“This bill will enhance Minnesota’s public safety, it will improve our economy, and it will enhance human dignity for all of us in this state,” House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler (DFL-Golden Valley) said Friday.
“I want to remind the body that what we’re talking about is families. We’re not talking about people who are committing crimes. We’re not talking about rapists and serial killers. We’re talking about families. And we’re talking about the protection of children. That should be at the heart of every single one of us sitting in this body,” Assistant Majority Leader Hodan Hassan (DFL-Minneapolis) said.
The bill passed in a vote of 74-52, and will now head to the Republican-controlled Senate for consideration. Supporters of the bill, who were gathered in the Capitol rotunda, could be heard cheering from inside the House chambers when the bill passed.
Rotunda is packed with folks across race, religion, and countries of origin who are calling on our legislators to restore the #freedom2drive to all Minnesotans. Let’s do this! #mnleg #MinnesotaIsReady pic.twitter.com/4WIkfNrnGI
— ISAIAHMN (@ISAIAHMN) April 5, 2019
Rep. Jeremy Munson (R-Lake Crystal) said the bill is a corporate bailout and stops business leaders from needing to pressure Congress into passing meaningful immigration reform.
“This bill kicks the can down the road. People here without permission can’t easily lobby Congress to change the laws. We need the pressure from business owners and you’re removing that pressure today by bailing them out,” he said, claiming that the bill does nothing to make roads safer.
“This bill today allows corporations to continue to profit from hiring illegal immigrants and to pay them less than our legal workers,” Munson continued. “It does nothing to prevent the labor abuses of paying substandard wages and stealing wages from workers who cannot seek remedy from law enforcement due to their immigration status. It is shameful that Minnesota’s labor unions support this bill.”
