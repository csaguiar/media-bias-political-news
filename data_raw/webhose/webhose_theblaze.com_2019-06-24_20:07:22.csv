Pro-life 'Unplanned' movie wins K-LOVE fan award despite the Christian radio station's previous ban on ads for the film,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/pro-life-unplanned-movie-wins-k-love-fan-award-despite-the-christian-radio-stations-previous-ban-on-ads-for-the-film,"Pro-life hit movie ""Unplanned"" won K-LOVE's film impact award over the weekend, indicating its popularity among the Christian radio station's listeners despite the network controversially banning ads for the film earlier this year.
What are the details? ""Unplanned"" bested four other movies to take the prize during K-LOVE's 2019 Fan Awards at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, on Sunday. While accepting the honor, star actress Ashley Bratcher said, ""You know, as artists, our goal is to reach people, to really move them. And this movie — it may be called ""Unplanned"" — but nothing about it was unplanned.
""God ordained every step of the way,"" Bratcher continued to cheers from the audience. ""And what you are seeing today, is what happens when you say 'yes' to God. Every single one of us said 'yes' to God, and now people's lives are being changed, and babies are literally being saved."""
Casey Anthony could profit from film she’s making about daughter Caylee’s death — and she says it will include ‘erotic’ footage,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/casey-anthony-movie-caylee-death,"Casey Anthony is set to release a feature-length film about her life after the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee.
Anthony was accused of murdering the toddler in 2008 in an attempt to get out of parenting.
Despite a lengthy trial and an alleged cover-up, she was acquitted in 2011 in Orlando, Florida.
What are the details of this film? Anthony told the Daily Mail that the film will be called ""As I Was Told"" and will chronicle life post-Caylee.
Anthony, who received much flak after partying heavily following her daughter's death, explained that those moments will be featured in the film, as will moments from her murder trial.
The 33-year-old who lives West Palm Beach, Florida, also promised that the film would feature ""erotic"" content and sex scenes and could premiere in 2020.
""Yes, I drank and carried on like nothing happened,"" she said of the days following her daughter's death. ""The movie is called 'As I Was Told' because I'd done what I was told to do. I had to put on a fake persona throughout those 31 days [that Caylee's body was missing].""
Anthony also revealed that the man who discovered the remains of her child's body in a trash bag in a wooded area of Florida advised Anthony to carry on as if everything was normal and deny knowledge of her daughter's death. The man also reportedly told Anthony that he would ""take care of it.""
""I should have taken rein and done what I felt I should have done no matter who it hurt,"" she said. ""My life was in others' hands from the beginning to the end.""
Anthony said that she doesn't want to make money from the movie.
""I just feel my truth needs to be out of me,"" she told the outlet. ""I need to close the book.""
Was she involved in the child's death? During her discussion with the outlet, Anthony insisted that she had no part in the child's death ""as far as how she died.""
""Hopefully, one day people will find it in their hearts to believe that I could never do this,"" she said, promising the low-budget film will ""show the tears and the turmoil"" that she insists she endured, as well as ""the anxiety and hardship"" after she was released.
""Regardless of what the media has depicted of me, I am not a monster,"" she said. ""I just don't show my sadness. A thing that was taught to me as a young girl.""
Anthony insisted that she suffers ""on the inside,"" and has learned how to slap on a smile to cover her heartache.
""Through it all, I never once thought of suicide,"" she added. ""I am stronger than that ... that is a coward's way out, and it is a sign of guilt to me.""

Being a jerk in Spain can land you in the clink,www.theblaze.com,Chris Field,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/being-a-jerk-in-spain-can-land-you-in-the-clink,"Attention scuzzy pranksters with cameras: Do not pull your stunts in Spain if there's any chance you'll embarrass your victims.
Learn from the idiocy of YouTube prankster ReSet, who just got handed a 15-month prison sentence and $22,300 fine, the New York Times reported .
The court found ReSet (real name: Kanghua Ren) guilty of ""violating the moral integrity"" of a homeless man who was the victim of one of his pranks, the Times said.
Turns out that this classy YouTuber (all YouTubers are the just the best) filmed himself giving the homeless man an Oreo — but it wasn't just any Oreo. The Oreo filling was replaced with something else — something so horrible and nasty and cruel that 15 months seems like a mere slap on the wrist.
What did he put in the Oreo? Feces? Ejaculate? Malaria-carrying mosquito carcasses?
Nope. Worse.
ReSet filled the cookies with ... toothpaste.
Yes. Filling an Oreo with toothpaste and giving it to a homeless person while filming it and then posting the video to YouTube can get you actual jail time in an actual country in the world.
Of course, ReSet was shamed into deleting his video. He replaced it with a video of him giving the homeless man money. And cops say he later offered hundreds of dollars the daughter of the homeless man in an effort to get her not to file a lawsuit.
No word on what the court would have done if the YouTuber would have just given the homeless man one of the nasty mint Oreos instead."
Joe Biden suggests President Trump is responsible for violent deaths of black transgender women,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-president-trump-transgender-deaths,"Former Vice President Joe Biden suggested that President Donald Trump's administration is responsible for the violent deaths of black transgender women.
Biden — who holds a 19-point lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination — made his claim during a speech to the Human Rights Campaign on Saturday, CNN reported .
""We've already had five, just this year, five black transgender women killed violently in 2019,"" Biden said. ""It's outrageous. It must, it must, it must end.""
And as the crowd applauded, Biden broke in with a stern declaration: ""And the fastest way to end it is, end the Trump administration!"" Hoots and hollers and cheering followed.
The HRC — which bills itself as the largest LGBTQ advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States — listed seven black transgender women who died violent deaths so far this year .
What else did Biden say? ""This president, this White House has literally, literally a bully pulpit, is callously extending his power over the most vulnerable — implementing the most discriminatory policies like Muslim bans, turning away asylum seekers, putting children in cages,"" Biden added, according to CNN. ""And the current vice president uses religious freedom as an excuse to license discrimination. It's wrong and it is immoral what they're doing.""
What has Trump said about the LGBTQ community? Trump on Friday threw his support behind the LGBTQ community — the eve of Pride Month.
""As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation,"" he said in a pair of tweets . ""My Administration has launched a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality and invite all nations to join us in this effort!""
A number of Twitter users got angry last month over ""LGBTQ for Trump"" T-shirts for sale on the president's 2020 campaign site, warning others with messages such as ""if anyone dares put on that 'LGBTQ for Trump' shirt , you should combust.""

Man who threw boy over railing at Mall of America gets 19 years for attempted murder,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-who-threw-boy-over-mall-of-america-balcony-gets-19-years,"A man who confessed to trying to kill a 5-year-old boy by throwing him off a balcony at the Mall of America will spend 19 years in prison after being sentenced Monday.
Last month, 24-year-old Emanuel Aranda pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder when facing charges relating to the incident in Bloomfield, Minnesota.
On Monday, NBC reported that he received a 19-year prison sentence at a hearing in which he looked straight ahead or down and declined to address the court.
In April, the nation reacted in horror to the initial news that 5-year-old Landen Hoffmann of Woodbury, Minnesota, had fallen more than 40 feet after being thrown from a third-floor balcony at the world famous shopping center.
Shortly after the horrific attack, Aranda admitted to law enforcement that he had gone to the mall that day in search of someone to kill because of his repeated romantic failures with women. He said he wanted to kill an adult that day, but his initial plan didn't work out.
A witness at the scene recalled Hoffman's mother screaming, ""Everybody pray, everybody pray. Oh my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge."" A GoFundMe page was later started to support the parents.
Those prayers were answered days later when it was revealed that Landen had "" zero evidence of brain damage "" after the barbaric attack.
""No spinal cord injury, no nerve damage, no internal injuries that were life-threatening,"" the family's pastor told a cheering congregation at their church just over a week after the incident.
Days after the initial good news about the lack of brain or nerve damage, Landen was awake and alert again, his family reported.
""All praise, glory and honor to God! He saved our son's life and is healing him in the most miraculous ways,"" read an update on the family's GoFundMe page. ""We are so elated to let you know that our son is now alert and conscious and is no longer in critical condition!""
Landen's parents were not present at Monday's sentencing hearing, but instead provided victim impact statements that were read for the court by an attorney.
""I want you to know I forgive you,"" a statement from the victim's mother said. ""Not because what you did was okay, not because I want to; but [because] God wants me to.""
""You chose to listen to the Devil that day,"" the mother's statement concluded. ""I don't get to judge you or hate you. Instead I am full of God's love and I have overwhelming joy and peace in my body as I sit and watch my boy heal in miraculous ways right in from of my eyes."""
YouTube bans any livestreams from ‘younger minors’ unless they’re joined by adults in an effort to fight back against pedophilia,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/youtube-bans-any-livestreams-from-younger-minors-unless-theyre-joined-by-adults-in-an-effort-to-fight-back-against-pedophilia,"YouTube will ban ""younger minors"" from being able to livestream on the platform unless they are obviously joined by an adult, according to The New York Times .
The move is said to be in response to criticism that YouTube was enabling pedophiles.
What are the details? The Google-owned video platform was reportedly recommending videos of children after YouTube users executed a search for ""sexually themed content.""
In a blog post, a spokesperson for YouTube said , ""We updated enforcement of our live streaming policy to specifically disallow younger minors from live streaming unless they are clearly accompanied by an adult. Channels not in compliance with this policy may lose their ability to live stream.""
YouTube also added that ""responsibility is our number one priority, and chief among our areas of focus is protecting minors and families.""
One mother told the outlet that a video of her 10-year-old daughter playing in a backyard pool amassed more than 400,000 views.
""I saw the video ... and I got scared by the number of views,"" she said.
The company also noted that it intended to use algorithms to remove livestreams and related channels for violating the rule.
On Monday, the NYT reported that ""users do not need to look for videos of children to end up watching them.""
""The platform can lead them there through a progression of recommendations,"" the outlet revealed. ""So a user who watches erotic videos might be recommended videos of women who become conspicuously younger, and then women who pose provocatively in children's clothes. Eventually, some users might be presented with videos of girls as young as 5 or 6 [years old] wearing bathing suits, or getting dressed, or doing a split.""
What else? YouTube did not elaborate on the age group covered by the term ""younger minors.""
""YouTube is a company made up of parents and families, and we'll always do everything we can to prevent any use of our platform that attempts to exploit or endanger minors. Kids and families deserve the best protection we have to offer: We're committed to investing in the teams and technology to make sure they get it,"" the post concluded."
Nearly 12 million Quest Diagnostics patients' information may have been stolen in data breach,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nearly-12-million-quest-diagnostics-patients-information-may-have-been-stolen-in-data-breach,"Quest Diagnostics said Monday that nearly 12 million customers may have had their financial, personal, and medical information breached.
The breach incurred through the American Medical Collection Agency, a third-party vendor that provides billing collections services for the company. Quest Diagnostics said it has stopped using AMCA since learning of the incident.
""Quest is taking this matter very seriously and is committed to the privacy and security of our patients' personal information,"" the company said in a news release . ""Since learning of the AMCA data security incident, we have suspended sending collection requests to AMCA.""
Quest Diagnostics is one of the largest blood-testing providers in the country.
What are the details? AMCA first notified Quest Diagnostics of the data security breach on May 14.
According to a filing with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, an unauthorized person had access to Quest Diagnostics' customers' information between Aug. 1, 2018, and March 30, 2019.
The company said that actual lab results were not included on the affected system.
""AMCA believes this information includes personal information, including certain financial data, Social Security numbers, and medical information, but not laboratory test results,"" the release said.
On May 31, Quest said it learned that the breach affected 11.9 million Quest Diagnostics patients.
""Quest Diagnostics has not been able to verify the accuracy of the information received from AMCA,"" according to the SEC filing.
AMCA has not yet provided Quest Diagnostics with ""detailed or complete information"" about the security breach, the company said, which noted it would contact affected patients, once it has that information.
The company said it is working with law enforcement officials.
""We are committed to keeping our patients, health care providers, and all relevant parties informed as we learn more,"" the release said.
What else? It's the second time in three years that Quest Diagnostics customers' information has been compromised, according to TechCrunch . In 2016, the company said 34,000 patients had data stolen by hackers."
Search for missing 4-year-old girl reaches horrific end as discovered remains confirmed to be hers,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/search-for-missing-4-year-old-girl-reaches-horrific-end,"A monthlong search for a missing 4-year-old girl from Texas reached a tragic ending over the weekend after human remains found in Arkansas were confirmed to be hers.
Law enforcement officials said Friday they had found what they believed to be Maleah Davis' body in Arkansas, but that they would not be able to confirm the identity of the remains until an autopsy was conducted.
A work crew mowing the side of Interstate 30 more than 300 miles away from Houston spotted a bloody garbage bag on the side of the road earlier in the week, the Houston Chronicle reported , but decided to leave it alone, thinking it was a dead animal. Later, a mower tore the garbage bag open and scattered its contents along the roadside.
On Monday, officials with the Harris County Institute of Forensic Scientists confirmed that the remains indeed belonged to Maleah.
The little girl went missing on April 30. Her mother, Brittany Bowens, left town for a family funeral in Massachusetts and left the girl in the care ex-fiance Derion Vence, along with the younger son that the two share. Days later, on the night of May 4, Vince and his son arrived at Houston Methodist Hospital saying that he had been attacked on the way to pick up Bowens from the airport and that Maleah had been abducted.
That's when the search began.
Vence initially sent police on the search for ""three Hispanic males in their 30s, driving a 2010 blue Chevrolet crew cab pickup truck,"" according to a public information release .
A month of public worry and speculation about the girl's fate came to a close late last week, however, after Vence reportedly said that the girl had died accidentally on his watch and that he had left her remains across state lines in Arkansas, according to activist Quannell X, who had previously acted as a spokesman for Bowens.
""All I can say to you is that he told me it was an accident,"" X told reporters on Friday .
The cause and manner of Maleah's death still have not been confirmed or released to the public.
In an interview with HLN on Thursday, X described a tumultuous relationship between Bowens and Vence, in which Maleah was caught in the crossfire. He also said that Bowens admitted that Maleah had been physically abused by Vence and that she had helped cover it up on multiple occasions."
A worker with a humanitarian group is now on trial for allegedly harboring illegal immigrants as they tried to enter the US,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/humanitarian-worker-on-trial-for-harboring-illegal-immigrants,"Scott Warren, who volunteers with the humanitarian group No More Deaths, could face 20 years in prison for allegedly harboring illegal immigrants after they entered the United States.
What does his group do? No More Deaths leaves water and food in places where it will likely be found by illegal immigrants making the dangerous trek across the desert in southern Arizona. The group was founded in 2004.
There are no exact figures for the number of illegal immigrants who die in the desert each year, but according to PBS , officials in Pima County, Arizona, recovered the remains of 2,816 people between 2000 and 2017. Since that time period, the number of border crossings has increased.
What happened now? The case against Warren centers on two illegal immigrants who stopped at a shelter maintained by No More Deaths and a few other humanitarian groups about 40 miles from the Mexican border. The prosecution claimed that Warren coordinated the transportation of these two immigrants to the shelter, while Warren has insisted that he offered them only food and water after they arrived — and at the recommendation of a doctor and nurse.
The U.S. Border Patrol often allows aid groups to give illegal immigrants food and water, but not to transport them or to shield them from immigration authorities. Warren testified that the immigrants were only staying at the shelter temporarily and were about to continue their journey when they were arrested.
Warren has pleaded not guilty to the charges that led to his arrest on January 17, 2018, saying that he delivered aid only in accordance with the law. He faces one count of felony conspiracy and two counts of felony harboring.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Nate Walters, who is heading up the prosecution in this case, said Warren crossed the line from providing humanitarian aid and was actively trying ""to shield illegal aliens from law enforcement for several days.""
No More Deaths claims that Warren's arrest could be retaliation for a video that the group released showing Border Patrol agents dumping out water bottles left in the desert for illegal immigrants. Border Patrol had reportedly been notified of this video just hours before Warren was arrested.
According to CNN , this isn't the first time that volunteers with No More Deaths have been charged with violating laws dealing with illegal immigration. Warren's trial began on Monday."
‘The View’ co-host claims that kids are ‘safer’ at LGBTQ-related events than they are at church: ‘Jesus would be attending that Pride parade!’,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-view-co-hosts-squawks-that-kids-are-safer-at-lgbtq-related-events-than-they-are-at-church-jesus-would-attend-pride-parade,"Sunny Hostin, co-host on ""The View,"" insisted on Monday that children are much safer at LGBTQ-related functions than they are at church.
What are the details? During a Monday segment, co-host Whoopi Goldberg addressed gay pride flags in New York City that were purportedly tampered with.
Rainbow flags were reportedly set on fire at a Harlem gay bar ahead of the June month celebrating the LGBTQ community.
Goldberg went on to brush off the flag vandalism, and promised those in the LGBTQ community that God ""did not make mistakes,"" and encouraged those within the community to embrace their sexuality.
Hostin chimed in, and brought up Providence, Rhode Island's Bishop Thomas Tobin, who addressed the LGBTQ Pride Month events in a tweet.
""A reminder that Catholic should not support or attend LGBTQ 'Pride Month' events held in June,"" Tobin wrote. ""They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Catholic faith and morals.""
""They are especially harmful for children,"" his tweet added.
What did Hostin say? Apparently perturbed by the bishop's tweet, Hostin fired back, insisting that children were safer at such gatherings than they were at church.
""I tweeted out my Catholic children will be attending Pride events as this Catholic will,"" she said. ""My faith always taught me what would Jesus do? I know Jesus would be attending that Pride parade.""
Hostin added, ""I also know that God is love. Jesus is love. Love is love. For a Catholic bishop to come out and say something like that, given the history of pedophilia in the Catholic church, given what the Catholic church has hidden about the abuse of children, some would say that being at a Pride parade would be much safer for a child than it has been to be in a Catholic church for many years."""

Televangelist Kenneth Copeland gets visibly angry when questioned about his private jet and his remarks about planes filled with 'demons',www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/televangelist-kenneth-copeland-angry-about-private-plane-questions,"Televangelist Kevin Copeland got defensive when a reporter confronted him about his claim that flying commercial was like ""getting in a long tube with a bunch of demons."" He angrily brushed off criticisms about his opulent lifestyle, and dismissively referred to the female reporter as ""sweetheart"" and ""baby.""
What's the background? Copeland reportedly spent $3 million to buy a Gulfstream V jet that had previously been owned by actor, comedian, and producer Tyler Perry. The pastor has been frequently criticized for his extravagant lifestyle by people who don't believe this is an appropriate way for a preacher to live.
"" Inside Edition "" reporter Lisa Guerrero confronted Copeland about how he justified the expense of the private jet and why he compared flying commercial to ""getting in a long tube with a bunch of demons.""
Copeland angrily denied that he had ever made that comment . He also claimed that his private jet was a necessity. He said his ministry had ""brought 122 million people to the Lord Jesus Christ."" If those people were a country (according to the CIA World Factbook ), they would be the 12th most populous country in the world. He said that without the plane he would ""have to stop 65 percent of what"" he was doing.
He also claimed that Tyler Perry had made the private jet ""so cheap"" that he ""couldn't help but buy it.""
When Guerrero tried to bring up the comment about commercial flights being filled with ""demons"" again, he deflected saying ""give me a chance here, 'Inside Edition,'"" adding, ""I love your eyes,"" pointing at Guerrero's face and smiling.
Confronted a third time by Guerrero about whether he believed ""human beings are demons,"" Copeland got even more defensive. ""No I do not, and don't you ever say I did,"" he said, wagging his finger at her. ""We wrestle not with flesh and blood,"" he continued, quoting Ephesians 6 after an angry pause, "" but principalities and powers.""
When she interrupted him to again ask for clarification, Copeland shot back, ""If you give me a chance to talk, sweetheart, I'll explain this to you,"" clearly tired of being asked that question. He said that he didn't think a commercial airline was a good place for him to be when he was getting ready to preach, suggesting that it wasn't the people but their problems that he was avoiding.
He insisted that his luxurious lifestyle was not at odds with his ministry, adding that in addition to revenue from book and merchandise sales, he also had natural gas on his land. ""Didn't know that, did you, baby?"" he quipped to the reporter.
What else did they talk about? Copeland said that people who preached against the prosperity gospel (the belief that God will make Christians wealthy if they follow him) had a ""misunderstanding of the Bible."" He pointed to the Old Testament and asked, ""Do you think the Jewish people believe you should be broke?"" He also asserted that Jesus' disciples were wealthy men.

At least two NBA teams dropped the term 'owner' because it could be considered racially insensitive,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nba-teams-drop-word-owner,"At least two NBA teams have done away with the term ""owner"" reportedly because it could be considered racially insensitive, according to TMZ Sports .
Steve Ballmer is no longer called the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers. Instead, Ballmer is listed as the team's chairman on its website , a change that TMZ believes occurred in early 2018.
Similarly, the Philadelphia 76ers also dropped Joshua Harris' title as owner and changed it to managing partner. And the team now describes its co-owners as limited partners.
Other basketball teams have reportedly held high-level talks about getting rid of the term that some say ""feels racially insensitive"" in a league where the majority of the players are black.
What's the story? The issue has reportedly been talked about for some time, but last fall it gained some attention when Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green appeared on LeBron James' show, ""The Shop"" on HBO and argued against using the word.
""You shouldn't say 'owner,'"" said Green, whose Warriors are playing the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals this week.
""You should say, 'majority shareholder,' or something like that,"" he added.
Joe Lacob is listed as owner and CEO of the Golden State Warriors on its website .
""When your product is purely the labor of people, then 'owner' sounds like something that is of a feudal nature,"" Jon Stewart explained on the show.
What did the NBA say about the term? The NBA hasn't pressured teams to change the term owner, according to sources for TMZ Sports.
In a statement to TMZ, the NBA said it doesn't refer to team owners as such.
""We refer to the owners of our teams as Governors; each team is represented on our Board of Governors,"" an NBA spokesperson said.

Bullet key chains pulled from amusement park gift shop after complaint. But some call PC decision ridiculous: 'Lighten up!',www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/park-pulls-bullet-key-chains,"A Pennsylvania amusement park pulled personalized bullet key chains from its gift shop after someone filed a complaint on social media, LehighValleyLive reported .
What happened? Sarah Keller was with her children and their friends at Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in South Whitehall Township, the outlet said, and while in a shop her youngest child stopped, pointed out the display, and said, ""Whoa, that's crazy.""
The souvenir was titled ""Personalized Rifle Bullet"" that showed a cartridge in an embossed leather holder on a key chain, LehighValleyLive said, with the words ""The Right to Keep and Bear Arms"" on the paper holder along with an image of an eagle.
""This is not OK,"" Keller told the outlet in an email. ""We shouldn't normalize this.""
Keller shared a photo of the display with her friend, Lisa Boswell, who then shared the photo on Twitter, LehighValleyLive said.
""Offering kids a bullet with their name on it at an amusement park gift shop is already the most ill advised thing to happen this summer,"" Boswell tweeted, according to the outlet. ""Who greenlit this? Imagine a shooting survivor encountering this?""
The tweet has since been deleted.
""In today's climate — where our children are repeatedly asked to prepare for mass classroom homicide (lockdown drills) and can't play outside safely — it was inexplicable to me,"" Boswell said in an email, LehighValleyLive said. ""Further, it showed a lack of sensitivity toward gun violence survivors.""
How did Dorney Park respond? Dorney Park followed up Boswell's tweet with a tweet indicating the key chains would be removed, the outlet said.
""We ceased offering the merchandise because we believe we can offer our guests products that are more suitable for our family friendly environment,"" the amusement park said in a prepared statement, LehighValleyLive said.
Then another kind of backlash hits But once word hit that the bullet key chains were pulled, some Twitter users were none too pleased:
""Lots and lots of Pennsylvanians participate in shooting sports, especially in the 'flyover' sections of the state where hunting is king. I doubt it's as offensive as you think it is."" ""The First and Second Amendments are key pieces of the Constitution. It doesn't matter who greenlit it; if you don't like it [don't] buy it. Pennsylvania played a key role in your freedom. Read a history book."" ""A bullet with a kid's name on it sparked all these back and forth battles? First, they are not real bullets; just the cases. I understand the shooting victims thing. Yes it's sad to lose a love[d] one. Yet, we allow our kids to play shooting games, and that's OK? Guns don't kill, people do."" ""Guess you should pull all of the blinky light items for the epileptic and all of the sugar items for the [diabetics], too."" ""It's a freaking key chain. Lighten up! Holy crap."""

The event was organized by a restaurant called The Populist , which saw customers lining up — with some waiting over an hour — to make donations even after the baked goods were all sold out. 303 Magazine promoted the ""star-studded"" affair, emphasizing that ""one hundred percent of the proceeds"" would benefit Planned Parenthood ""due to the recent struggle for women's rights across the nation.""
Executive chef and organizer Theo Adley boasted to the Denver Post , ""It was a moment of tremendous empowerment for all who were there. This was a demonstration of solidarity from the Colorado hospitality industry's support of women's rights, reproductive rights and fundamental human rights.""
Despite the fundraiser's success, not everyone was impressed. Denver Post columnist Krista Kafer noted on Twitter , ""Denver's top chefs are holding a bake sale for an organization that kills more than 300,000 children each year.""
Another Denver Post follower on social media called the roster of 16 participating restaurants a ""super helpful alphabetical list of where not to eat in the Denver area.""
Anything else? The Populist isn't the first to organize a bake sale for the nation's premier abortion provider. In May, New York pastry chef Natasha Pickowicz raised nearly $100,000 for Planned Parenthood in her third annual event, Grub Street reported.
Not that Planned Parenthood is short on cash. According to the National Review, the organization held more than $1.6 billion in net assets at the end of the 2016-17 fiscal year."
"2020 Dem ripped by AOC, booed at California convention for saying Medicare for All is 'not good policy'",www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2020-dem-ripped-by-aoc-booed-at-california-convention-for-saying-medicare-for-all-is-not-good-policy,"A Democratic presidential candidate who dared question the wisdom of Medicare for All was soundly rejected by California Democrats and condemned by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) for his stance, according to The Hill .
Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) told attendees at the California Democratic Convention that, even though he supports universal health care, he doesn't believe Medicare for All is the way to get there. His comments were met with long and loud boos.
""We as Democrats need to build an economy that works,"" Delaney said. The audience was still with him at this point, until he said, ""Medicare for All may sound good, but it's actually not good policy nor is it good politics. I'm telling you.""
The boos from the gathered Democrats were so persistent that Delaney had to pause his remarks for a time, repeatedly attempting to temper the disapproval by asserting that ""we should have universal health care"" as he tried to cut through the noise.
His next comment didn't make them any happier.
""We should have universal health care, but it shouldn't be the kind of health care that kicks 150 million Americans off their health care,"" Delaney continued. ""That's not smart policy. I want everyone to have health care, but it's got to be a plan that works for every American.""
Ocasio-Cortez, who stands to have significant influence in the 2020 primary, suggested that Delaney should be eliminated from contention for the nomination.
""Since there's so many people running for President (& not enough for Senate), instead of obsessing over who's a 'frontrunner,' maybe we can start w some general eliminations,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. ""This awful, untrue line got boo'ed for a full minute. John Delaney, thank you but please sashay away."""
Breaking: House Democrats taking action against AG Barr and Sec. Ross — here's what they're doing,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-will-hold-barr-and-ross-in-contempt,"House Democrats are moving towards holding figures in the Trump administration in contempt for rejecting to answer to subpoenas from Congress.
House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a letter Monday that U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross could be held in contempt for not complying with subpoenas having to do with a citizenship question added to the census.
""Unfortunately, your actions are part of a pattern,"" said Cummings in the letter.
""The Trump administration has been engaged in one of the most unprecedented cover-ups since Watergate,"" he claimed, ""extending from the White House to multiple federal agencies and departments of the government and across numerous investigations.""
However, the votes for contempt would be avoided if Ross and Barr answered the subpoenas by Thursday.
Cummings accused Republicans of adding the citizenship question to the census in order to ""gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan, and unconstitutional ways.""
Barr has already been voted in contempt by the House Judiciary Committee, and that will be put before a vote of the entire House of Representatives later in June.

Graham Allen calls out Bernie Sanders for 'blatantly dishonest' tweet on gun deaths,www.theblaze.com,TheBlaze Staff,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/graham-allen/graham-allen-destroys-bernie-sanders-tweet-on-gun-deaths-its-blatantly-dishonest,"On Monday's episode of "" Dear America ,"" host Graham Allen called out Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) after the 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful posted an intentionally misleading statistic about gun-related deaths on Twitter Sunday.
""That is blatantly dishonest, and I want to explain that to you,"" Graham said. ""Because the left wants you to think that there were 40,000 people who died due to mass shootings ... because they want to push their agenda on gun control.""
Graham highlighted the statistic's glaring omission.
""What they blatantly leave out, on purpose, is that two-thirds of those deaths were due to suicide,"" he said, emphasizing that it was not his intention to downplay the tragedy of suicide but to demonstrate the way the information had been presented to be misleading.
He compared the much-touted gun-death statistics to the rarely talked about statistics on abortion.
""The same people who want you to get rid of guns because of 40,000 gun-related deaths in 2018 ... are pushing abortion rights, when over 70,000 babies were murdered in Florida alone last year,"" said Graham. ""So, you wanna come at me with some blatantly B.S. statistic that you lie about and try to tell me that you care about people when all you really care about is disarming America?""

Nikki Haley dismantles the idea that being pro-life is anti-women: 'that is not real feminism',www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nikki-haley-dismantles-the-idea-that-being-pro-life-is-anti-women-that-is-not-real-feminism,"A common tactic used by abortion advocates is to frame the pro-life cause as an attack on women's rights. Pro-life men are often accused of pretending to care about unborn lives only as a way to control women.
When mostly-male state legislatures pass pro-life laws, memes highlighting these alleged male oppressors are used to undermine the morality behind the legislation, even if the bill was authored and signed by women .
Former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley plans to fight back against that narrative during remarks she will give at a Susan B. Anthony List gala Monday night, according to Axios .
""Unfortunately, many on the left use the abortion debate to divide women and demand conformity,"" Haley's speech reads. ""They do this in the name of feminism. But that is not real feminism.""
In the speech, Haley will also attack the demand by pro-abortion advocates that all women fall in line with the same set of beliefs.
""The idea that women must adhere to a particular set of values is one of the most anti-women ideas in today's culture,"" Haley will say. ""It is a rejection of the ideas of equality and tolerance that the women's movement is supposed to be about.""
Additionally, Haley will remind the audience that the pro-life movement isn't primarily about women, it's primarily about acknowledging the right to life for the unborn.
""As a pro-life, female governor, I was blessed with a unique platform, and I made every effort to use it appropriately,"" the speech reads. ""Not to lob attacks at people who disagreed with me, not to diminish the other side, but to reframe the debate. To explain that being pro-life is not about being for or against women. It is about being for a baby's right to live — the most basic right there is."" "
"LAPD cops are so angry over filthy conditions at downtown station, some are planning to revolt",www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/lapd-cops-plan-to-revolt-over-filth,"Los Angeles police officers are so angry at the filthy and unhealthy conditions at the downtown station that serves skid row that they are considering transferring away to another station.
The report from the Los Angeles Times documents the frustration and anger from officers who believe their health is being threatened by working under the horrible conditions.
According to that report, the LAPD Central Division station was found to be operating with unsanitary conditions, including rat infestations, by a state officials.
A report from Cal/OSHA also found ""the presence of rats/rodents, fleas, roaches, flies, gnats, mosquitoes and grasshoppers was detected at the LAPD Central Community Police Station,.""
This comes on the heels of a report that showed mountains of rat-infested rotting garbage were being neglected by Los Angeles city officials. Many worried that the unsanitary conditions could lead to an outbreak of disease like typhus or even the plague.
A statement from the Los Angeles Police Protective League demanded that the station be immediately cleaned up to alleviate the dangers to officers.
""Officers worry enough about being shot or injured policing the streets of Los Angeles, they shouldn't also have to worry about being infected by diseases that they can take home to their families, simply by showing up to work,"" their statement read.
""Our demand is simple; clean it up and provide preventive measures before there is a massive outbreak,"" they added.

"Pastor who prayed for Trump onstage defends his decision to critics, says it wasn't an endorsement",www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pastor-who-prayed-for-trump-onstage-defends-his-decision-to-critics,"David Platt, the pastor of McLean Bible Church in Virginia, unintentionally made headlines over the weekend when President Donald Trump showed up at his church to receive prayer.
As a pastor who intentionally avoids political associations and rhetoric, Platt was somewhat uncomfortable with the situation, and aware of the potential criticisms that can result from a perceived association with a figure as polarizing as Pres. Trump. Having been called upon to pray for the president on just a few moments' notice, Platt prayed a nonpartisan, biblically-grounded prayer for Pres. Trump.
""We stand right now on behalf of our president and we pray for your grace and your mercy and your wisdom upon him,"" Platt began. ""And God we pray that he would know how much you love him — so much that you sent Jesus to die for his sins, our sins. So we pray that he would look to you and that he would trust in you, that he would lean on you, that he would govern and make decisions in ways that are good for justice and good for righteousness and good for equity, every good path.""
Still, Platt knew that some in his large and diverse congregation would take issue with him having Pres. Trump on stage for prayer, especially given that the prayer was followed by loud applause. So, Platt issued a statement to his church explaining his decision and the thoughts behind it.
Platt wrote in the statement that, near the end of his service, he was notified that Pres. Trump would be there in minutes for prayer. He said once the president arrived and before going on stage, he had a brief conversation during which he shared the gospel. But he made no apologies for the decision to pray for the nation's leader:
That's why, as soon as I heard this request backstage, the passage from God's Word that came to my mind was 1 Timothy 2:1-6:""
First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. 3 This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.""
Based on this text, I know that it is good, and pleasing in the sight of God, to pray for the president. So in that moment, I decided to take this unique opportunity for us as a church to pray over him together. My aim was in no way to endorse the president, his policies, or his party, but to obey God's command to pray for our president and other leaders to govern in the way this passage portrays. Platt, concerned with unity within the body of his church, acknowledged those who might be upset that he prayed publicly for Pres. Trump on stage:
I wanted to share all of this with you in part because I know that some within our church, for a variety of valid reasons, are hurt that I made this decision. This weighs heavy on my heart. I love every member of this church, and I only want to lead us with God's Word in a way that transcends political party and position, heals the hurts of racial division and injustice, and honors every man and woman made in the image of God. So while I am thankful that we had an opportunity to obey 1 Timothy 2 in a unique way today, I don't want to purposely ever do anything that undermines the unity we have in Christ.

Steven Crowder offers a surprising apology video after organized outrage over comments about Vox writer,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/steven-crowder-apologizes-long-video,"Conservative comedian Steven Crowder published a video Monday apologizing for the many insults he had issued against various pop culture and political figures after a campaign of organized outrage over ""homophobic"" jabs at a left-wing journalist.
The BlazeTV host, and YouTube star came under fire when Vox reporter Carlos Maza compiled a video of remarks Crowder had made against him, highlighting ""repeated, overt attacks"" on Maza's ""sexual orientation and ethnicity.""
On Friday, the Twitter account for YouTube indicated that they were investigating the claims from Maza that Crowder had violated their ""anti-harassment"" policy.
Crowder responded with a humorous video, also published on YouTube, with a long list of insults he had made in the past.
""I apologize to the Palestinian people for stating that they were a backwards people from an imaginary country that never really existed because none of the Muslims wanted you,"" Crowder said in the video. ""Palestine, I'm sorry.""
The list included Joe Biden, Planned Parenthood, Bruce Lee and his fans, Marvel Comics and DC Comics, Bernie Sanders, Fox News anchor Bret Baier, among many, many others.
""I apologize to the Drag Queen Storytime, for trampling on what was solely intended to be an educational and family-friendly experience at the Houston Public Library, with sex offenders,"" Crowder says at one point.
""Also apologies to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,"" he says, ""for implying that she couldn't stand up on her own two feet, that she coughed up a lung on more than one occasion, for stating that she covered up her husband's rapes, and for circulating both mean-spirited and unconfirmed rumors that she was both Huma [Abedin]'s lover and a practicing witch.""
Crowder apologized to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) for a sketch that ""equates AOC with a bug-eyed cartoon too stupid to form cogent thoughts, and may perhaps suffer from early onset dementia, which I now know is no laughing matter ever.""
Maza responded to the video from his Twitter account, saying that Crowder was snubbing his nose at YouTube's policies.
""Steven Crowder just published a 20-minute fake apology video, where he gratuitously repeats every gross thing he's done on his show, making a joke out of it,"" Maza tweeted .
""He's daring @YouTube to do something about it,"" he concluded, ""knowing full well they won't actually enforce their policies.""

Federal judge hands down defeat for Democrats trying to stop funding for the border wall,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/judge-sides-with-trump-over-democrats-on-wall,"A federal judge handed down a decision that was a defeat for Democrats attempting to block the funding re-direction towards construction of President Donald Trump's border wall.
Democrats were upset that the president called a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border and then ordered funds to come from the military in order to work around the will of Congress.
The Trump administration argued that the Congress had no standing to litigate the claim against the Executive branch.
Judge Trevor McFadden disagreed with the Democrats and sided with the Trump administration.
""This is a case about whether one chamber of Congress has the 'constitutional means' to conscript the Judiciary in a political turf war with the President over the implementation of legislation,"" said McFadden in the judgement. ""[W]hile the Constitution bestows upon Members of the House many powers, it does not grant them standing to hale the Executive Branch into court claiming a dilution of Congress's legislative authority.
""The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear the House's claims and will deny its motion,"" he concluded.
On Friday the president tweeted that the U.S. would be slapping Mexico with a tariff that would grow every month until they took steps to diminish the onslaught of migrants arriving at the border.

House passes $19 billion disaster spending bill in spite of conservative objections,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-passes-19-billion-disaster-spending-bill-following-conservative-objections,"The House of Representatives passed a $19 billion disaster bill by a vote of 354-58 on Monday after procedural objections from House conservatives prevented the chamber from passing the measure while Congress was out of town.
The spending measure originally sailed through the Senate by a vote of 85-8 on May 23, but was held up the next day in the House when Republican Representatives Chip Roy (Texas), Thomas Massie (Ky.), and John Rose (Tenn.) objected to passing the bill without a regular vote or structured debate time on the floor while Congress was out of town.
""The people, particularly in Texas, but people generally, are tired of the swamp and this is a very swampy thing to do — have a vote on a Friday heading into Memorial Day weekend and after we recess, when we could have done our job yesterday when we had 435 members of Congress who should be here and should vote,"" Roy told reporters of his objection.
""Some people think that we're objecting to a vote,"" but ""what we're objecting to is not having a vote at all,"" Massie explained in an interview with Blaze Media last week.
""I get the criticism that this is disaster relief and this is not the time to have this fight,"" Massie added later, but ""when is the right time to start talking about our debt and our deficit and the broken system we use to pass bills here in Congress? This is the right time. If you do this over a post office renaming, nobody cares.""
In addition to disaster relief money, the bill also contains money tucked away for other non-emergency programs, Conservative Partnership Institute's Rachel Bovard explains :
""The bill also contains $55 million for the Head Start program, $1 million for worker training programs, extends the insolvent National Flood Insurance Program without making any reforms for the 11th time, and modifies the federally subsidized crop insurance program to cover the production of industrial hemp. About $900 million is provided for Puerto Rico, even though the territory is already on track to receive up to $91 billion once the 2017 hurricane response cycle is through.""
President Trump tweeted his support of the bill just after its Senate passage and is expected to sign it."
Rand Paul's plan to balance the budget gets only 22 Republican votes in Senate,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-pauls-pennies-plan-balanced-budget-fails-in-senate,"A balanced budget plan put forward by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. failed in the Senate by a vote of 22-69 Monday evening after only 22 Republicans voted in favor of the national debt-addressing measure.
(For reference, Republicans are the ones who tend to campaign on fiscal responsibility and there are currently 53 of them in the Senate.)
""We teach our children that money doesn't grow on trees, and then they grow up watching politicians pretend otherwise,"" Paul tweeted about the plan on Monday. ""Meanwhile, our debt soars past $22 trillion, endangers our country. Today, the U.S. Senate can vote to put a stop to it and change course.""
""If we keep piling on the debt we're going to come to a day of reckoning. We have a great country and we shouldn't let it get away from us,"" Paul added in a later tweet just before the vote.
Introduced in April, the "" Pennies Plan, "" would have required the government to cut two pennies of every dollar in on-budget federal spending — or just two percent — for the next five years. Overall, Paul's office estimated that the plan would have spent $11.3 trillion fewer than current baseline levels over the next decade. It also contained instructions for the Senate Finance Committee to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent and created a ""reserve fund"" to allow for the expansion of Health Savings Accounts.
""A balanced federal budget isn't a pie-in-the-sky dream or empty rhetoric,"" Paul said in a statement accompanying the budget plan's introduction in April. ""Once again, I am introducing a concrete plan that is achievable and allows Congress maximum flexibility to prioritize spending.""
Fiscally conservative activist groups also supported Paul's plan. FreedomWorks put out a statement in support of the bill before the vote on Monday, while Club for Growth similarly voiced their support.
""The National Debt exceeds $22 trillion and the federal government is incurring over $1 trillion in annual deficits,"" Club for Growth Vice President of Government Affairs Scott Parkinson said in a statement. ""Congress needs to operate its budget like American families operate their budget. That means cutting up the credit card and ending excessive annual deficits that balloon the national debt."""
"Special education teacher gives autistic boy 'Most Annoying' trophy in front of parents, students, principal",www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/special-education-teacher-gives-autistic-boy-most-annoying-trophy-in-front-of-parents-students,"A special education teacher gave an 11-year-old autistic student the ""Most Annoying Male"" award at a luncheon in front of students, the school's principal — and most notably, the boy's father, the Northwest Indiana Times reported .
A hush fell over the end-of-year awards ceremony last month at Bailly Preparatory Academy in Gary, Indiana, when the teacher presented the trophy to the fifth grader, his dad told the paper.
""We were blindsided. We just weren't expecting it,"" Rick Castejon added to the paper. ""As a principal or teacher, you should never let this happen to any student.""
The trophy is inscribed ""BAILEY PREPARATORY ACADEMY 2018-2019 MOST ANNOYING MALE,"" the paper said.
That isn't all Castejon said he didn't want to make a scene and tried to leave the trophy on a table at the Merrillville Golden Corral when the luncheon was over — but the teacher who gave the award to his son actually approached him and reminded him to not forget the trophy, behaving as if it was a big joke, the paper said.
The boy's father added to the Times that it wasn't until he arrived home and shared what happened with his wife that the reality of what transpired fully hit him.
More from the paper:
He said throughout the school year, his son's teachers routinely called home with concerns about how to handle the fifth-grader's behavior, but it wasn't until his son was presented the ""Most Annoying Male"" award that Castejon said he felt real concern. Now, Castejon is left wondering if these calls home were contributing factors in the trophy his son was presented last month.
Castejon described some of his son's mannerisms as a student with autism. The 11-year-old is nonverbal, occasionally rocks back and forth and can become easily emotional, his father said. ""They called me all the time if he didn't want to work, would cry or would have a breakdown,"" Castejon told the Times. ""A special needs education teacher should know how to handle these things.""
How did the school district respond? The boy's parents brought up the incident with district officials, and Gary Community School Corp. emergency manager Peter Morikis told the paper he met with the family and that disciplinary action was taken against the personnel involved.
""The Gary Community School Corporation does not condone this type of behavior and will continue to put the safety and well-being of our students first,"" Morikis said in a statement to the Times. ""We extend our deepest apologies to the impacted student, the family and anyone else who take offense to this unfortunate occurrence.""
He added that district officials ""acknowledge the potential impact that an experience like this could have on a child's mental well-being, self-esteem and overall level of comfortability in a learning environment going forward,"" the paper said.
What else? Castejon told the Times that Morikis discussed putting the teacher on a two-week suspension and would possibly fire the teacher, adding that his son's teacher was absent from fifth-grade graduation last week.
But Morikis declined to comment to the paper on the employment status of any school personnel involved in the matter, the paper said, adding that he also wouldn't identify the teacher involved.
Castejon added to the Times that his family already planned a move to Valparaiso, so his son won't be attending Gary schools‚ but he wanted to make his voice heard so that other special-needs students don't go through a similar experience.
""Just because they have special needs doesn't mean they don't have feelings,"" he told the paper."
"White House told Hope Hicks, Annie Donaldson to refuse to comply with congressional subpoena",www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-hope-hicks-annie-donaldson-refuse-to-comply,"The White House advised two former members of the Trump administration — former communications director Hope Hicks and former White House counsel Annie Donaldson — not to turn over documents as ordered by a congressional subpoena.
Here's what we know ""As part of President Trump's continued obstruction of Congress, the White House has instructed both Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to turn over records in response to subpoenas issued by our committee last month,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in a statement to the Washington Post . ""I note that Ms. Hicks has agreed to turn over some documents to the committee related to her time working for the Trump campaign, and I thank her for that show of good faith.""
Nadler's committee issued the subpoenas last month to the two women for documents related to their time in the administration. The deadline for handing the documents over is Tuesday.
The White House argued that Hicks and Donaldson could not legally turn over the documents the Judiciary Committee requested since those documents were the property of the White House. Nadler said that Hicks and Donaldson could no longer be protected by executive privilege from complying with a congressional subpoena, since they had not been part of the administration for months — and added that they might never have been covered by privilege to begin with.
According to CNN , Nadler has indicated that he would likely hold Hicks and Donaldson in contempt of Congress if they ignored the subpoena.
What else? This would not be the first time that Trump has advised a former member of his administration to refuse to comply with a congressional subpoena. In May , he advised Don McGahn, his former attorney, to ignore another subpoena and refuse to testify before Congress. When Donaldson was part of the administration, she worked for McGahn."

Steven Becky, 19, was arrested Friday for attempted criminal homicide and driving under the influence after the late Friday morning incident in Draper, the station said.
Becky waived his Miranda rights and agreed to speak with detectives when he admitted to hitting the girl because of her race, KUTV said.
What happened? Surveillance video obtained from the scene showed a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta driving north on the wrong side of the road, the station said, citing the probable cause statement released Saturday.
The vehicle then took a ""sharp right"" turn toward an 11-year-old girl who was walking her electric scooter up the hill on the east side of the road, KUTV said. The vehicle struck the girl and then overturned, the station added.
Image source: KSTU-TV video screenshot
A witness told police that after exiting the vehicle, Becky walked toward the injured girl and stated, ""We have to die sometime,"" KUTV reported, citing the probable cause statement.
Image source: KSTU-TV video screenshot
The witness added to officers that Becky ""charged"" at the victim in an aggressive manner and that the witness restrained Becky — who was trying to leave the scene of the crash — until authorities arrived, the station said.
Officers identified Becky as the driver and said he was ""engaging in erratic behavior,"" uncooperative, aggressive, and unsympathetic toward the victim, KUTV reported.
While being held down, Becky admitted using Xanax and marijuana, the station said, citing the probable cause statement. At a hospital Becky admitted to a doctor that he used LSD and mushrooms, KUTV reported. After his release from the hospital, Becky was taken into custody and booked into Utah County Jail, the station said.
What happened to the girl?
The girl was transported to a hospital with serious injuries, including a fractured hip and head injury, KUTV said. Police told KSTU-TV a helmet likely prevented the girl from suffering more serious injuries and that she's expected to recover.

Trump supporter harassed by angry British mob amid president's state visit — and becomes latest 'milkshake' attack victim,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-supporter-in-london-harassed-attacked-with-milkshake,"A supporter of President Donald Trump was seen on video being harassed by an angry mob in London's Trafalgar Square on Tuesday amid the president's state visit — and as the confrontation became more physical, the man also became the latest ""milkshake"" attack victim.
Video recorded by a reporter from Leading Britain's Conversation showed the man at first arguing with protesters while wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat — the symbol of Trump's 2016 campaign that's become a lightning rod for a growing number of those on the left who say the MAGA hat is synonymous with racism, bigotry, and hatred .

'Off our streets! Nazi scum!' But soon the clip showed the man without his hat as surrounding protesters appear to push him around.
At one point the mob — led by a livid light-haired female who stood just inches from the man's face — chanted ""Off our streets! Nazi scum!""

Finally, to the protesters' delight, what appeared to be a milkshake landed on the man's head.

The victim tossed it at someone else and began tangling with others before things cooled off.

Anything else? There have been a series of similar incidents in the United Kingdom recently in which protesters toss milkshakes at individuals they don't like — pro-Brexit leader Nigel Farage got the milkshake treatment last month. Leftists have said such physical attacks are effective and "" absolutely hilarious .""
Trump arrived in England on Monday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day — and, as expected, has been greeted by throngs of protesters .

Substitute teacher says she was fired for criticizing high school students' absolutely awful grammar,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-substitute-teacher-i-was-fired-after-criticizing-high-school-students-absolutely-awful-grammar,"A few weeks after working at an Iowa high school one day last fall, substitute teacher S. Keyron McDermott said she got a letter from the principal saying she was out of a job.
The principal said he ""visited with the class"" and concluded that the ""interactions between yourself and the students were not such as meet our expectations for substitutes,"" McDermott wrote in an op-ed for the Des Moines Register.
What happened? Seems a parent reported that a student had videotaped McDermott on his cellphone — which she said would quickly disclose any unethical actions on her part — such as ""singling a child out for ridicule, touching anyone, or making unreasonable demands"" — but alas, nothing like that came up.
So what was the problem?
'This is your native language, people!' McDermott said students apparently got ticked off at her criticisms of their papers — particularly language errors.
""I told them unapologetically, 'This is your native language, people! Second grade mistakes — not distinguishing between 'your' and 'you're,' misspelling ex(c)ercise, leaving off caps and periods — from freshmen and sophomores are unacceptable…'"" she wrote.
More from McDermott's op-ed:
So I wouldn't be accused of making unreasonable demands, I wrote corrections on the board. All they had to do was copy them.
Most of the older students in school know I don't accept ""textlish,"" and they know why — I am panic-stricken for American kids. So, if I made a mistake that day, it was not giving students I'd never taught before a thumbnail bio they could act on. What happened next? McDermott said she went to the next school board meeting and requested reinstatement but got no response. Then she said she met with district superintendent who indicated he was concerned — and did nothing.
So McDermott said she paired up with another substitute teacher fired for similar reasons, and they filed a complaint with the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners.
But alas, no dice there, either.
She said Executive Director Dr. Ann Lebo refused to investigate or hear the teachers' case because ""the magnitude of the alleged violation must be sufficient to warrant a hearing by the board.""
'I am not just whistling in the wind'
McDermott shared that she knows a thing or two about students in other parts of the word — and it gives credence to her previous statement that she was ""panic-stricken"" for American students.
More from her op-ed:
In the early ‛90s, I taught English-as-a-Second-Language in Masan, South Korea. Koreans amazed me, especially their boundless vocabularies. Over the millennium (1999-2003), I taught ESL in Berlin, Germany, to an international assortment of Germans, Turks, Kurds, Russians, etc. My very first class was Realschuler, non-college-bound German kids in an evening English class. Among others, I tutored an Iranian boy who spoke Persian at home, German in school, and English in his literature class (studying ""The Great Gatsby"").
I am not just whistling in the wind about the globalized world — I have taught in it. Ask yourself how prepared our kids are to compete in that world. Is it any wonder American businesses beg for more H1B visas? ""Without standards, the whole system is a sham,"" McDermott concluded in her piece. ""A very expensive waste of money, cheating both kids and taxpayers.""
And she added in a Facebook post on the matter that ""my generation and the generation behind us have destroyed an education system that was the envy of the world."""
Catholic priest stands by Christian teachings after being condemned for rejecting Pride Month,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bishop-stands-strong-outrage-pride-month,"Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, triggered an avalanche of outrage over the weekend after he advised Christians against participating in events related to Pride Month because they promote a culture antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.
Now, Tobin has responded to outrage — and he is not backing down.
What triggered the outrage? ""A reminder that Catholics should not support or attend LGBTQ 'Pride Month' events held in June. They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Catholic faith and morals. They are especially harmful for children,"" Tobin wrote on Twitter.
The seemingly innocuous tweet that echoes traditional Christian values immediately generated outrage online, amassing nearly 100,000 responses by Tuesday.
What was the response? The internet, along with Hollywood celebrities and politicians, rallied together to rebuke Tobin. Many voiced frustration over Tobin's claim that LGBT culture is ""harmful for children.""
""You know what's proven to be actually harmful to children..? The Catholic Church,"" one person said .
""A reminder of why religion is dangerous, sad & divisive. Doesn't your 'God' love everyone? And the track record of children being safe in the company of priests is hardly solid,"" another person said .
""Annnnd we wonder why there's a crisis in the Catholic Church. The countless accounts of sexual abuse by your priests is HARMFUL TO CHILDREN,"" another person wrote .
Actress Mia Farrow wrote:
Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Hawaii) even chided Tobin:
While the vast majority of responses were of outrage toward Tobin, not all were negative.
""The Apostles were not silenced by the sin of Judas. All but one gave their lives for the sake of the Truth of Jesus Christ. His Excellency, Bishop Thomas Tobin has the courageous heart of the first Bishops. I stand with you, Your Excellency!"" one supporter wrote .
What is Tobin saying now? In a statement, Tobin expressed regret that his tweet sowed division and became a national controversy. But he explained that his duty as priest is before God — not to abandon Christian teachings in order to capitulate to the whims of popular western culture.
Tobin wrote :
I regret that my comments yesterday about Pride Month have turned out to be so controversial in our community, and offensive to some, especially the gay community. That certainly was not my intention, but I understand why a good number of individuals have taken offense. I also acknowledge and appreciate the widespread support I have received on this matter.
The Catholic Church has respect and love for members of the gay community, as do I. Individuals with same-sex attraction are beloved children of God and our brothers and sisters.
As a Catholic Bishop, however, my obligation before God is to lead the faithful entrusted to my care and to teach the faith, clearly and compassionately, even on very difficult and sensitive issues. That is what I have always tried to do — on a variety of issues — and I will continue doing so as contemporary issues arise.
As the gay community gathers for a rally this evening, I hope that the event will be a safe, positive and productive experience for all. As they gather I will be praying for a rebirth of mutual understanding and respect in our very diverse community."
Dutch teen granted assisted suicide wish due to PTSD from repeated sexual abuse,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dutch-teen-granted-assisted-suicide-wish,"Update: Due to allegations from a Politico Europe reporter, TheBlaze is conducting further research on this story to determine its veracity.
A 17-year-old from the Netherlands was legally euthanized over the weekend after successfully arguing that her past sexual abuse and subsequent battles with mental health were reason enough to end her life through assisted suicide.
What are the details? Noa Pothoven died Sunday in her living room after being granted permission from the state to cut her life short. Pothoven, who penned an award-winning autobiography about her struggles ahead of her passing, titled, ""Winning or Learning,"" defended her decision on Instagram leading up to her death.
The teenager told her followers, ""After years of battling and fighting, I am drained. I have quit eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it was decided to let me go because my suffering is unbearable,"" according to a translation provided by the Daily Mail .
She then asked her audience not to try to talk her out of killing herself with the help of modern medicine, adding ""Love is letting go, in this case."" Her Instagram account was made private during the writing of this article.
According to the Sun , Pothoven was molested at two separate children's parties when she was 11 and 12, and then raped by two men when she was 14. She reported the attacks to police last year. Pothoven said her mother had ""always been there for her,"" but put in her request for euthanasia in 2018 without her parents' knowledge, Sky News reported.
Under Dutch law, Pothoven's parents had no say in the 17-year-old's decision. Her mother, Lisette, told De Gelderlander last year that she and the girl's father hoped their daughter's symptoms could be treated, telling the outlet, ""We, her parents, want her to choose the path of life. Noa really doesn't want to die at all. She only longs for peace.""
In the Netherlands, children as young as 12 may be euthanized at their request if a physician deems their suffering to be ""unbearable with no clear resolution in sight,"" according to the Sun.
Anything else?
Pothoven's case isn't the first euthanasia death from Holland to make the headlines. In 2016, alcoholic Mark Landedijk had his doctor end his life after trying 21 stints in rehab to remedy his condition. Leading up to his euthanasia, he sat at his parents' home and ""laughed, drank, smoked, ate ham and cheese sandwiches and soup with meatballs"" until the physician arrived to administer his lethal injection, according to the Independent .
"" Inside Edition "" reported that more than 6,500 people died through legal euthanasia in the Netherlands in 2017. The controversial practice is also allowed under certain circumstance in Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, the U.K., and several states in the U.S .
According to a recent column in the Calgary Herald , the rules restricting assisted suicide have loosened over the four years since Canada has legalized the procedure. Calling the trend a ""slippery slope,"" akin to a ""vertical skating rink,"" Licia Corbella wrote last month that proponents in that country are ""urging that physicians should be allowed to kill depressed or lonely patients, including mature minors and sick children."""
Disturbing PBS documentary shows woman killing her unborn twins like it's nothing at all,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/disturbing-pbs-documentary-shows-woman-killing-her-unborn-twins-like-its-nothing-at-all,"A PBS documentary is going viral on the internet Tuesday for its chilling depiction of a pregnant woman nonchalantly taking the abortion pill to terminate her twin pregnancies.
What are the details?
Pro-life activist Obianuju Ekeocha shared a snippet of the documentary on Twitter Monday, captioning it, ""This PBS documentary airbrushes abortion to make it look like some healthy new age practice.""
""The woman in blue is pregnant with twins and she is filmed here taking the abortion pill to kill them,"" she explained. ""You witness their killing.
""And,"" Ekeocha added, ""her statement at the end is chilling.""
The video features footage of an abortion clinic call center, chock-full of women answering phone calls about abortion advice.
Throughout the short video, a smiling woman, wearing a blue dress and a full face of makeup, can be seen taking her first pill in the abortion pill series. The second pill will be taken 24 hours after the first, according to a health care practitioner who is seeing her in the office.
At the end of the video, the woman — who is apparently pregnant with twins — smiles into the camera and sends a message to her unborn children, as well as voices her hopes for the abortion.
""What I hope I feel is a sense of peace, not only with myself and the decision that I have made, but also a sense of peace with these two beings that I have chosen not to bring into the world,"" she explains.
It gets worse, if you can believe it.
""Thank you for choosing me and I'm honored to be given this gift of life and also I can't do it right now,"" the woman says. ""I can't accept that mantle in terms of the other lives I'm taking care of and responsible for."""
Biden promises that his climate policies would 'go well beyond' anything Obama did,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-climate-polices-beyond-what-obama-did,"Former Vice President and current presidential candidate Joe Biden has unveiled the environmental policy he would try to enact if he were elected president, and he promised that it will ""go well beyond"" former President Barack Obama's own environmental policy.
This release is an apparent attempt by Biden to refute arguments by other Democratic presidential hopefuls like Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) who have claimed that Biden is too moderate on environmental policy.
Here's what we know. In his announcement on his website , Biden said that he believed the Green New Deal proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) ""is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.""
Although he did not mention some of the plan's more extreme measures such as ""upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy efficiency,"" Biden argued that the Green New Deal ""powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of"" his own plan. These, he said were that ""the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge"" and that ""our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.""
He promised that as soon as he was elected he would ""sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track"" to make sure that the United States has ""a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050"" — a goal of the Green New Deal.
He also said he would ""demand that Congress enacts legislation"" to add to these executive orders. For perspective, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , roughly 11 percent of U.S. energy consumption and 17 percent of U.S. electrical generation came from renewable sources in 2017.
An initial FAQ sheet of the Green New Deal released by Ocasio-Cortez's office but later dismissed by her as a draft released by a ""staffer that had a very bad day at work"" admitted that ""[e]ven if every billionaire and company came together and were willing to pour all the resources at their disposal into this investment, the aggregate value of the investments they could make would not be sufficient"" to fund the proposals of the Green New Deal. Biden did not volunteer how his Green New Deal proposal would be funded, apart from ""reducing incentive for tax havens"" and removing ""loopholes"" and ""tax cuts for corporations.""
Predictably, Biden promised to rejoin the Paris climate accord, a signature achievement of the Obama administration that President Donald Trump pulled out of soon after he was inaugurated. He also promised to ""[m]ake future bilateral U.S.-China agreements on carbon mitigation."" China has more than twice the amount of carbon emissions as the United States.
What else? In addition to promising to enacting executive orders to push his climate agenda once in office, Biden said that climate change was a ""national security priority.""
When Trump failed to get the funding he requested from Congress for border security, he declared a national emergency in February to divert resources from existing projects. At the time, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) urged Trump not to do this, warning that ""a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose the Green New Deal."" "
"READ IT YOURSELF: NRA exposes Kirsten Gillibrand as hypocrite with letter she wrote praising NRA, guns",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kirsten-gillibrand-nra-letter-2008,"Democratic presidential contender Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) called the National Rifle Association the ""worst organization in this country"" during a Fox News town hall on Sunday in which she repeatedly lied about the gun-rights group.
In response, the NRA released a letter Gillibrand wrote a top NRA executive more than a decade ago that exposes Gillibrand as a Second Amendment hypocrite.
What did the letter say? Despite now clamoring for gun control, Gillibrand wrote to Chris Cox, the director of the NRA's lobbying arm, in 2008 expressing a ""full description"" of her position on the Second Amendment that mirrors conservatives — not liberals.
""I want to be very clear that I always have and always will believe that the correct interpretation of the 2nd amendment is that it applies to an individual's right to carry guns,"" Gillibrand wrote.
Addressing the heart of modern progressive gun control proposals — which seek to limit the circulation of certain firearms based mostly on arbitrary details like cosmetic features — Gillibrand expressed opposition to such laws.
""On the question of outright banning certain firearms for cosmetic features, bullets of a certain size, or banning magazines holding an arbitrary number of cartridges, I am adamantly opposed and do not believe that laws should be based on random limits just for the sake of limiting gun ownership or usage,"" she wrote.
Gillibrand, who at the time was a member of the House, even warned that certain gun control laws ""could contribute to the slippery slope of government confiscation of people's firearms based on the arbitrary whims of politics and public opinion"" and boasted about writing an amicus brief for D.C. v. Heller, the most important Supreme Court case in American history for protecting Second Amendment rights.
Gillibrand also:
Admonished attempts to prevent those in public housing from owning firearms Expressed concerns over the development of ""smart guns"" Boasted about supporting legislation that protects Second Amendment rights Said she supports hunting on federally owned land Praised the NRA's work to ""protect gun owners rights"" What has driven Gillibrand's change? While her campaign claimed Gillibrand experienced a change-of-heart, there is a more practical reason to explain the change in position.
When Gillibrand wrote the letter in September 2008, she represented one of the most conservative, rural congressional districts in New York. Although New York has since undergone district remapping, many of the counties that Gillibrand represented have lax gun laws compared to most other regions in the northeast.
At the time, it would have been politically expeditous for Gillibrand to support the NRA and the Second Amendment.
That all would change in just a few months when Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate in order to fill the seat left vacant by Hillary Clinton, who had been appointed as secretary of state.
Since 2009, Gillibrand has represented, overall, a very liberal constituency and her views on the Second Amendment, the NRA, and gun control now magically align with the majority of those who keep her in office.
What did Gillibrand's campaign say? ""Senator Gillibrand has directly addressed her changed position on guns on countless occasions, in detail, and even if the NRA can't, it's time for the media to move on from this tired and well-worn narrative,"" campaign national spokesman Evan Lukaske said in a statement, according to Politico .
""The fact is that Senator Gillibrand has earned an 'F' from the NRA for the past decade because she is leading the fight for common sense gun violence prevention,"" he said.

What are the details? In a friendly exchange, ""Hardball"" host Chris Matthews warned the candidate before asking him to answer a ""tough"" question: ""Name some of your public figures — Republicans — who you respect.""
Matthews clarified to Buttigieg that he must name someone ""living,"" and offered him a few moments to consider his answer.
The audience laughed as Buttigieg slumped and replied, ""Awe, I had such a great answer if it wasn't living.""
""I know!"" Matthews quipped, ""Abraham Lincoln ... Teddy Roosevelt—""
""No, I've got a better one for ya, even better,"" Buttigieg interjected before answering: ""Wendell Willkie.""
He explained that Willkie, the 1940 GOP presidential nominee who lost to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was from Indiana and ""put country before party.""
Matthews then obligingly stepped in to explain that Willkie ""united the country going into World War II. He was Roosevelt's diplomat going to Britain to unite the world there.""
The ""Hardball"" host didn't press further, abruptly moving on to other topics without asking the mayor to actually answer his question.

Buttigieg has emerged as a formidable candidate for the Democratic presidential primary, despite having virtually no name recognition prior to launching his White House bid.

CBS News crew arrested in China for showing people pictures of Tiananmen Square - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbs-news-crew-arrested-in-china-for-showing-people-pictures-of-tiananmen-square,"While journalists gripe about how the Trump administration is making their jobs more difficult, the Chinese government demonstrated this week that they were willing to arrest journalists for bringing up a censored topic to its citizens. A CBS News crew was arrested for showing Chinese citizens pictures of the Tiananmen Square massacre on its 30th anniversary.
What's the background? In 1989, the Chinese military entered Tiananmen Square and opened fire on civilian protesters who had gathered there to speak out against the oppressive communist government. At least several hundred people were killed , thousands more were arrested, and dozens were executed for their participation.
Since then, the Chinese government has worked to silence any attempt to commemorate or remember the massacre. Mentions of what happened that day are kept out of textbooks, and all pictures of it are banned.
What happened now? In a segment that was broadcast on Monday evening, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer can be seen asking people on the streets of China.
""Have you ever heard of these events?"" Palmer asked, holding up the infamous photo of a lone protester in Tiananmen Square standing in front of a Chinese tank.
""I think not,"" responded the young man she was interviewing.
""No idea? What country?"" she asked another man.
""I have no idea,"" he said. Two other interviewees also seemed confused by her questions.
Her questions quickly drew the attention of local authorities.
""Minutes later,"" Palmer said, ""the police showed up. And we ended up in custody for six hours.""
The BBC tried a similar experiment on Monday, and likewise found that the overwhelming majority of Chinese citizens were unfamiliar with images from the massacre. It does not appear that the BBC correspondent was arrested, although the last man he interviewed snapped, ""How dare you show this image around here?"""
"After spending millions to relieve homelessness, Los Angeles officials are 'stunned' by these new stats",www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/los-angeles-sees-stunning-rise-in-homeless,"Los Angeles officials are ""stunned"" by a report that shows homelessness has increased by a large percentage even after the beleaguered city spent millions to try to alleviate the epidemic.
""Last year's count, we felt we were trimming in a way that would suggest we were getting our arms around this,"" said Los Angeles Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas said to the Los Angeles Times.
""And yet this year we are pretty well stunned by this data,"" he added.
The new count of homeless people puts the number at 59,000 in Los Angeles County, and 36,000 in the city of Los Angeles — that represents an increase year-over-year of a whopping 16 percent.
Officials were encouraged by the report last year which showed a small decrease in the population of homeless people. That hope has been dashed to the rocks by the current year's statistics.
""At this point of unprecedented wealth in the county of Los Angeles, we are equally confronted with unprecedented poverty manifesting itself in the form of homelessness,"" said Ridley-Thomas.""
Los Angeles Mayor Gil Garcetti, a Democrat, called the situation ""heartbreaking.""
""This work has never been for the faint of heart, and we cannot let a set of difficult numbers discourage us, or weaken our resolve,"" Garcetti said to the Times.
The city has been beset by reports of mountains of rotting garbage infested with disease-ridden rodents, and an overwhelming presence of homeless people stretching the social safety net to its limits.
Another report documented how some police officers were so disgusted with the filthy conditions of the LAPD downtown station that they were planning to revolt.
Ridley-Thomes rejected criticism that new homeless programs had failed, and said that they simply needed to ""stay the course.""

Times reporter Matt Flegenheimer started his piece with a damning anecdote about how Biden, a notoriously unpredictable and free-wheeling speaker, blatantly misrepresented his civil rights participation:
Joe Biden was riffing again — an R.F.K. anecdote, a word about ""civil wrongs,"" a meandering joke about the baseball commissioner — and aides knew enough to worry a little.
""When I marched in the civil rights movement, I did not march with a 12-point program,"" Mr. Biden thundered, testing his presidential message in February 1987 before a New Hampshire audience. ""I marched with tens of thousands of others to change attitudes. And we changed attitudes.""
More than once, advisers had gently reminded Mr. Biden of the problem with this formulation: He had not actually marched during the civil rights movement. And more than once, Mr. Biden assured them he understood — and kept telling the story anyway. Panelists on CNN's ""The Lead"" with Jake Tapper discussed the article, and senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny relayed a baffling explanation for Biden's lies which he was told by the former senator and VP's aides:
""When he gets very comfortable out on the stump, speaking and other things, he has tended to embellish. He has tended to make things sound slightly rosier than they are,"" Zeleny said. ""Now his aides went back and said look, he was in office marching for the idea of civil rights, but was not actually marching in the streets.""
""Huh?"" Tapper interrupted, as he and other panelists laughed. ""That's not what the word 'marching' means.""

The attempted assassination of the blimp happened among the protest crowd behind the House of Commons.
A woman stabbed the baby in the back and she was immediately escorted away by police, according to ""babysitters,"" protesters who volunteered to guide and guard the blimp.
""A woman … punctured the mini Trump baby replica with a sharp object,"" said a spokesman for the Trump Baby group.

The woman was arrested for being in possession of a pointed or bladed article.
According to Mashable, the woman exclaimed , ""The president of the United States is the best president ever, shame on you!"" after stabbing the baby blimp.
""I think Donald Trump's balloon is not very well,"" she added later. ""I think it's going down rapidly for a reason.""
In scene reminiscent of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, the woman showed spectators her bloodied hands after the impudent act. She had nicked herself in the process of attacking the blimp.
Elsewhere during the protest a supporter of the president was hit with a milkshake as he argued and debated with anti-Trump protesters.

Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president, blamed racism for the fact that one of his potential rivals lost her 2018 election during a CNN town hall.
A member of the audience asked Moulton what he would do to dismantle systemic racism if he was elected president. The questioner specifically asked him to go beyond criminal justice reform in his answer.
""We have a problem with racism in America today,"" Moulton answered. ""If this country wasn't racist, Stacey Abrams would be governor. Because people of color are being systemically denied the most basic right in a democracy, which is the right to vote. That's why we need a new Voting Rights Act in America.""
Abrams' November 2018 election loss has remained a conversation months after the fact mostly because she has repeatedly claimed that she won , and that Gov. Brian Kemp only earned more votes due to voter suppression by way of purging voters, rejecting ballots with minor errors, or forcing voters to use provisional ballots.
Kemp, who was Georgia's secretary of state before becoming governor, has denied any wrongdoing. He earned 54,723 more votes than Abrams , according to the official tally.
Karl Rove, in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal , points out that while Abrams was in the state Legislature, she did not attempt to repeal the voting laws that Kemp eventually used to clean up voter rolls, such as the state's ""use-it-or-lose-it"" law or the law requiring exact matches of voter information.
The attention to her 2018 loss, and the sustaining of the narrative that the election was stolen from Abrams has helped maintain her national profile as she continues to consider running for Senate in 2020 (Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wants that) or even president.
As Hot Air's Allahpundit wrote Monday , it would be interesting to see how Democratic primary opponents would attack Abrams if she entered the race, given the delicacy of her status as a high-profile victim of racism within the party."
Boston promotes porn literacy program aimed at educating teens about healthy relationships,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/boston-pron-literacy-program-for-teens,"The Boston Public Health Commission is promoting its Porn Literacy program aimed at educating teens on how to interpret easily-accessible X-rated content in order to teach what's real — and what's not — when it comes to adult relationships.
What are the details? WBZ-TV hosted a segment Monday hailing the program, noting that some studies say up to 80 percent of kids see pornographic material by the time they reach the age of majority. The answer, they claim, is parent-approved classes that can teach adolescents about how to decipher such role-plays with a realistic lens.
The course is taught through BPHC's Start Strong program. Director Jess Alder explained to WBZ that the Porn Literacy program was the brainchild of a Boston University professor who first saw the need for such classes, and the curriculum has now been pared down to be ""palatable for our younger audience.""
Porn Literacy Program Educates Teens About Healthy Relationships www.youtube.com
Earlier this year, the New York Times Magazine covered the course and teens' thoughts on pornographic footage with great detail. Student participants shared their anxiety over measuring up to the adult performances played out on a screen, and discussed their feelings with peer participants along with a reporter.
The program isn't limited just to porn studies, however, the outlet clarified. It teaches students about ""healthy relationships, dating violence, and LGBT issues, often through group discussions, role-playing and other exercises.""
Anything else? Part of the discussion surrounding pornography and kids is the fact that graphic content can crop up amid even the most innocent of internet searches. Acknowledging that reality, sites like Wired have oh-so-delicately declared: ""Your kids will see internet porn. Deal with it.""
Despite how crass that statement may be, it also might carry some truth and wisdom. In 2016, the Huffington Post reported that in one survey ""70 percent of 15- to 17-year-old boys said they watched porn."" Accurate or not, kids' access to infinite knowledge from the worldwide web leaves youths vulnerable to seeing material neither they nor their parents might have bargained for."
Joe Biden caught plagiarizing — again. His campaign says they just forgot the citations on his climate plan.,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-caught-plagiarizing-again,"Democratic presidential front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday found himself once again in the middle of a plagiarism controversy. He and his campaign faced accusations of several instances of plagiarism just hours after releasing his ""new"" proposal to combat climate change.
What are the details? Biden rolled out a purportedly fresh environment plan on Tuesday, while claiming that if he became a resident of the White House he would "" go well beyond "" what former President Barack Obama achieved during his tenure.
After the framework was released, however, eagle-eyed Americans found that the candidate's proposals weren't so fresh after all.
Liberal activist Josh Nelson was the first to throw a flag, Business Insider reported , pointing out on Twitter that Biden's ""climate plan about carbon capture and sequestration includes language that is remarkably similar to items published previously by the Blue Green Alliance and the Carbon Capture Coalition.""
Business Insider then picked up the baton and found another two lines in Biden's plan that were lifted from other authors' original work.
For example, Biden's proposal claims, ""The average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years."" Business Insider pointed out that clean water advocacy group American Rivers states on its website that ""the average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 years or even 100 years,"" using the exact same language in the former vice president's script.
The Biden campaign explained to Business Insider that ""several citations were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document,"" and, ""as soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.""
Isn't there a history, though? During Biden's 1988 presidential bid, it was discovered that he copied a speech from a British politician and falsely claimed that he was the first of his family to graduate from college. The former senator from Delaware also admitted to copying lines from a law journal while he was a student at Syracuse University, Business Insider noted."

11 hilarious times the Left cannibalized itself,www.theblaze.com,Samantha Sullivan,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/the-left-has-become-their-own-victim-of-intersectionality,"Despite the diverse group of Democratic candidates vying to unseat President Donald Trump in 2020, the Leftist base still isn't happy. The famished ""woke"" class has begun cannibalizing itself and it's become the Jersey Shore of politics.
Leftist academics thought the notion of ""intersectionality"" would be good for society, but it's now their Achilles heel. When you're already a social justice progressive and even your wokeness falls short of the ideas the radicals fancy then you're in for a bad day at the beach.
That's because the guarantee of equal outcomes doesn't exist and it never will. There is no such thing as an unsullied utopian commune where everyone is equal all the time. George Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" is the blueprint for their delusional fantasy yet they refuse to accept the fact that guaranteeing equal outcomes ends the same way every time: with death, destruction, starvation, suspicion, and tyranny.
Remember: ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.""
It's all unfolding right before them. Forums that are targeted toward people who agree and support the Democrats have now become a new heckling ground:
1. BOASTFUL BERNIE: Bernie Sanders gets booed by ""Women of Color"" for name-dropping Martin Luther King Jr.
2. SILICONE SYMONE: Symone Sanders said in 2016 that Democratic leadership does not need a white man...but she's now Bernie's press secretary.

DOJ says Democrats were willing to narrow the unredacted Mueller report subpoena. AG Barr will consider it only if contempt proceedings stop.,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/doj-nadler-narrow-mueller-suboena,"As the inter-branch subpoena standoff continues, the Department of Justice said that it is willing to resume negotiations with House Democrats, but only if the contempt proceedings against the attorney general are halted and reversed.
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) in a letter Tuesday that a recent message from the committee ""appears to recognize"" that the subpoena demanding the release of the unredacted Mueller report ""is unworkably overbroad and offers — for the first time — to narrow the Subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents.""
For weeks, the DOJ has been in locked in a standoff with the House majority over Democrats' demands for the release of a completely unredacted Mueller report, along with the underlying evidence. The Justice Department has responded to these demands by saying that the initial subpoena would have required the attorney general to release secret grand jury information protected by federal legal rules.
Weeks ago, the DOJ offered to allow committee members to come view a less-redacted version of the report — sans approximately ""six lines"" of protected information, according to one Republican — in a secure location at the department. To date, no congressional Democrats have accepted that offer.
Attempts to reach a compromise came to an abrupt stop early last month when committee Democrats voted to move forward with contempt proceedings against Barr. The administration responded to the contempt move — which it called ""Chairman Nadler's blatant abuse of power"" — by invoking executive privilege over the subpoenaed materials.
However, the DOJ added that it's willing to resume those accommodation talks ""provided that the Committee takes reasonable steps to restore the status quo ante by mooting its May 8 vote and removing any threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the Attorney General in contempt.""
Democratic House leadership set a full House contempt vote against Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn for June 11. Boyd's letter says ""the Department is disappointed by news"" but that such a vote wouldn't even make much sense, given the current situation.
""Indeed, given the Committee's offer to narrow the scope of its Subpoena,"" Boyd concludes, ""it would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the Committee's prior recommendation to hold the Attorney General in contempt for not complying with a Subpoena that even the Committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad."""
John Cleese isn't racist. He's just old.,www.theblaze.com,Andrew Heaton,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/john-cleese-isnt-racist-hes-just-old,"If you hang out with comedians a lot you'll hear calls to ""punch up"" rather than ""punch down."" If you're unfamiliar with jokemonger parlance, ""punching up"" means sticking it to people in positions of power, authority, and privilege. Punching down means going after the little guy, or minority groups.
That duality of options has always made me uncomfortable. A standup friend of mine, Joe DeVito, hit the nail on the head during a conversation with me once. The ""punching up"" metaphor makes sense— if you think comedy is all about punching.
I don't tend to view comedy as punching. I hail from the Dick Van Dyke ""tap dance and make people smile"" camp more than the George Carlin prophet-cum-comic school of thought. Nothing against George Carlin, it's just not my core motivation. Ironic, I know, given that I make a good living as a political satirist and podcast host. ( Recently I advocated legalizing hallucinogenic mushrooms, questioned basic assumptions about nuclear weapons, and made fun of Woke cultural appropriation hysteria. )
When the issue of punching up arises in inter-comic squabbling, I'll often point to Monty Python as a non-pugilistic brand of humor. What were those guys punching, exactly? Class stratification? German punctiliousness? The ossified cultural consensus on how and when to properly use a fish? Nope. Monty Python was a bunch of comedic geniuses cranking out industrial-strength absurdism. Obviously they hit upon all manner of issues, ranging from class to sexuality to the etiquette of returning dead parrots to pet stores. But if you had asked the cast if they were ""punching up or punching down?"" I suspect they would have rolled their eyes and offered you a lager.
For that reason I felt defensive about Monty Python alumnus John Cleese this week when the aged comedian found his way into the daily Two Minutes of Hate, which is Twitter. (Interesting John Cleese fact — he once turned down a peerage in the House of Lords because it would require him to stay in England during the winter.) Here's what Cleese said :
Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city any more. Since then, virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation. So there must be some truth in it. ... I note also that London was the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU. This turned into a Twitter avalanche indicting John Cleese as a dog-whistling racist . I'm going to climb out on a limb here and say ... maybe he's not?
First, ""Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city anymore."" Well, he's right. London is geographically English, but other than its physical proximity to Surrey, it's not English — it's global. Its last census reported that 36.7 percent of its denizens are foreign-born. About 45 percent of the people who live there are White British (Welsh, Irish, English, Scottish). Which is to say, less than half of London is English. The rest are a mélange of Europeans, non-Europeans, first- and second-generation immigrants, Klingons, Vulcans, Wookies, and folks from elsewhere in the Commonwealth and/or Narnia.
It's a global city, like New York. It is richly diverse and cosmopolitan, which is a strength and draw to millions of people who live there. However, I will argue that it's difficult to be ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan while simultaneously being homogeneously English. Mutually exclusive, in fact.
Although to be fair, people aren't mad at Cleese for observing that London isn't English, they're mad because he wishes it were. Cleese appears to prefer Englishness over multiculturalism. (Note the distinction between ""culture"" and ""race."") Following the media storm, he tweeted , ""I prefer cultures that do not tolerate female genital mutilation. Will this will be considered racist by all those who hover, eagerly hoping that someone will offend them — on someone else's behalf, naturally.""
My read on the situation is that Cleese is not racist, he's old. What I mean by that is: Life is always in flux, cities are by nature dynamic, society is fluid. People tend to want things to stay static, and they don't, and that's irksome for many, particularly as they grow elderly and nostalgic. I question when London was last really ""English,"" given that it was the imperial capital of half the globe well before he was born, and no doubt had several pockets of Indians and Jamaicans and Vulcans living there by the time he showed up.
All the same, is John Cleese allowed to prefer English over polyglot? Because I think that's the root heresy at work here: saying that English culture might be superior to some others, and preferring it to them.
New York City is far, far more diverse and multicultural than, say, Portland, Oregon. Portland is so overwhelmingly white that it's basically a giant bleach commercial with some craft breweries and street buskers thrown in. Ethnicity aside, can Portlanders prefer their cultural homogeneity over the vastly more polyglot city of Houston? So long as people agree that immigration is positive and we should be neighborly and welcoming to newcomers, I'm disinclined to hound people for their personal preferences.
I don't know whether or not John Cleese meets that threshold. We know that he favored Brexit. I suspect, based on scattershot Cleese musings, that he wants a Britain that is open and welcoming to foreigners, but that he would also like them to become polite, uptight, tea-drinking gardeners once they've moved there.
I could be wrong. I don't know the depths of John Cleese's heart, and whether or not his pro-Brexit stance comes from hatred of distant bureaucrats (good) or dislike of foreigners and immigrants (bad). I suspect most of the people shouting at him on Twitter have no idea either.
Which is my main and final point. Maybe a single isolated tweet isn't sufficient information to psychically intuit whether someone is a bigot or not? We're all on the same page here: Bigotry is bad. Don't be a racist. Don't be a homophobe. But if we're going to champion the idea that the worst non-criminal thing you can be in our culture is a bigot, then we should also be at least a tad reserved about passing out scarlet letters just because there's a slow news day and we spot a fun Twitter pile-on to get worked up about.
Were I British I would have voted ""Remain"" on Brexit. (I appreciate the philosophical argument to leave, but I don't think withdrawing from the common market will work out.) Which is to say, I disagree with John Cleese about Brexit. But there's a big difference between saying John Cleese is wrong , and saying John Cleese is evil .
And therein lies much of the problem with trying to solve the world's problems on Twitter."
Broward County Deputy Scot Peterson arrested for conduct during Parkland massacre,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/broward-county-deputy-scot-peterson-arrested-for-conduct-during-parkland-massacre,"Former Broward County Sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson has been arrested and charged in connection with his failure to try to stop the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
What's the background? On Feb. 14, 2018, 14 students and three adults were murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and 16 others were injured. While the attack was ongoing, Peterson, then a school resource officer, was on campus. He chose to take cover instead of trying to confront the attacker, a disgruntled former student. He also ordered other police officers to stay back away from the building.
Peterson would later defend his actions, telling NBC News in June 2018 that he was ""sorry"" about what happened but that he had been ""trying to do the best I could with no information or intel at the time...and it was just happening so fast.""
But evidence released later that same year, including audio from Peterson's police radio, and a video that tracked the relative positions of both Peterson and the shooter, painted a different story. At a Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission meeting in September , commission chairman and Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said that this proved that Peterson not only made no effort to help, but also slowed the response of other law enforcement units.
What happened now? The Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced in a news release on Tuesday that Peterson had been arrested and charged with seven counts of neglect of a child, three counts of culpable negligence, and one count of perjury. All counts were related to the Parkland massacre.
In a statement, FDLE commissioner Rick Swearingen said ""[t]he FDLE investigation shows former Deputy Peterson did absolutely nothing to mitigate the MSD shooting that killed 17 children, teachers and staff and injured 17 others."" He added ""[t]here can be no excuse for his complete inaction and no question that his inaction cost lives.""
The FDLE said that Peterson's case would be handled by Assistant State Attorney Tim Donnelly."

""This pastor who prayed for our president has come under fire because apparently Christians within the congregation were horrified that he would pray for the president,"" Graham said. ""What kind of Christians would get upset about praying for anyone ?

If you don't support the president and you don't want the president to succeed, that's like wanting the pilot of the plane you're on to crash the freakin' plane!""
Graham added that any Christian who would complain about a pastor praying for someone they don't like politically has ""no idea what being a Christian is actually about.""
""The next time somebody prays for you, I hope people don't ... [say] you're not worthy of being prayed for,"" he said. ""I guess that whole 'do unto others' thing and 'do not judge lest you be judged' thing must only apply to other people and not you, because you're perfect, and God forbid you pray for the president of the United States.""

WATCH: Jared Kushner gets asked questions about birtherism — and things get really awkward really fast,www.theblaze.com,Chris Field,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/jared-kushner-awkward-birtherism-interview-moments,"First son-in-law Jared Kushner sat down with Axios' Jonathan Swan for a rare interview, which posted Monday night. He appeared unprepared for — and extremely uncomfortable with — questions about his wife's father's birtherism and about bigotry against Muslims.
Swan began by citing New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's repeated — and unoriginal — claims that President Donald Trump is racist. He then asked if Kushner if he had ever seen or heard the president do or say anything racist or bigoted.
Kushner made it clear that his father-in-law has never been a racist and that the claims of Trump's racism didn't start until the real estate magnate ran for president in 2016: ""You can't not be a racist for 69 years then run for president and be a racist.""
After that things got awkward — like, ""The Office""-level awkward.
Swan next asked, ""Was birtherism racist?"" — referring to claims that former President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S. and, therefore, should not have been eligible to be president. Though Trump did not start the birther movement — it was started by a group of Hillary Clinton supporters called the PUMAs (Party Unity My Ass) who refused to get behind Obama after the nasty 2008 Democratic primaries — he was one birtherism's chief proponents.
Kushner answered, ""Um. Look, I wasn't really involved in that.""
Swan replied, ""I know you weren't. Was it racist?""
Kushner repeated, ""Like I said, I wasn't involved in that.""
Undeterred, Swan asked again, ""I know you weren't. Was it racist?""
Kushner then shot a quick look to the camera, ala Michael Scott:
Image source: Axios/YouTube screenshot
He answered again, ""Look, I know who the president is, and I've not seen anything in him that is racist. So, again, I was not involved in that.""
Swan then asked, ""Did you wish he didn't do that?""
Repeating his lack of involvement, Kushner merely stated, ""That was a long time ago.""
Swan then shifted to the president's call for a ""Muslim ban"" during the 2016 campaign.
The president issued a statement Dec. 7, 2015, during a campaign rally in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina: ""Donald J. Trump is calling for a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice.""
Was Trump's call for a ""ban"" during the campaign ""religiously bigoted,"" Swan wanted to know.
After Kushner tried to play it off with a version of ""well, that's just Trump being Trump,"" Swan asked if he wished the president hadn't made that 2015 speech.
Kushner again awkwardly avoided the question and just lauded the ""great things"" Trump is doing for the country.
What was never explained in this clip — or the full interview — was why Kushner, who is almost never interviewed, would agree to sit down with Swan for this one (though Allahpundit over at HotAir has a couple ideas if you're interested).

President Trump calls Bette Midler a 'sick scammer' for peddling fake quote on Twitter,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-hits-bette-midler-over-fake-quote,"President Donald Trump used his formidable Twitter presence to fire back at entertainer Bette Midler after she deleted a tweet that propagated a false Quote: attributed to the president.
""Washed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make ""your great president"" look really bad,"" the president tweeted on Tuesday.
""She got caught, just like the Fake News Media gets caught,"" he added. ""A sick scammer!""
The president was referring to a tweet that Midler had posted with a Quote: attributed to Trump mocking the gullibility of Republicans.
""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican,"" the false Quote: read. ""They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They love anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""
Midler later tweeted that the Quote: d ""sounded"" like the president, but admitted it was false.
""I apologize; this Quote: turns out to be a fake from way back in '15-16,"" the singer tweeted. ""Don't know how I missed it, but it sounds SO much like him that I believed it was true!""
""Yes, one must always check the Quote: s,"" she added in a second tweet. ""That should take up, oh, maybe 23 of the 24 hours in the day?

Pres. Trump's Mexico tariffs face stiff opposition within Republican Party,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pres-trumps-mexico-tariffs-spark-bitter-division-within-republican-party,"Senate Republicans left a closed-door lunch with White House officials Tuesday expressing stern opposition to President Trump's announced plan to impose tariffs on Mexican imports as a way to force the country to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from traveling through to get to the U.S. border, according to Politico .
What's this about? Last week, Pres. Trump announced his intention to impose a 5 percent tariff on Mexican imports beginning June 10, to put pressure on the Mexican government to reduce the number of Central American migrants traveling through to enter the United States. The president intends to either use the existing border national emergency declaration or a second emergency in order to impose the tariffs.
What do Senate Republicans think? The reception among some Republicans was not positive. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said ""there is not much support in my conference for tariffs, that's for sure.""
Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said ""The administration ought to be concerned about another vote of disapproval on another national emergency act, this time trying to implement tariffs. Tariffs are not real popular in the Republican Conference.""
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said Pres. Trump ""is trying to use tariffs to solve every problem but HIV and climate change.""
Others, like Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) decried the fact that with only days left until the president's deadline, senators are not able to sit down with the president himself to discuss this issue.
""The problem is we didn't have the decision makers there,"" Cornyn told Politico. ""The president and half his Cabinet [are] over in Europe, and obviously the clock is ticking. Time's wasting. What we need to do is get in front of the president and have that conversation.""
How will this play out? Pres. Trump threatened that it would be ""foolish"" for Senate Republicans to oppose his tariffs. Even if the tariffs are voted down, it's likely Pres. Trump would veto that decision, leaving the situation up to whether two-thirds of the House and Senate would agree to overturn the veto. From Politico:
There may not be 20 Republicans in the Senate who are willing to defy Trump, particularly as the GOP seeks to defend its majority and avoid primary challengers from the right. And getting more than 50 House Republicans to join them could prove even harder given the stronger support Trump's hardball tactics have among the House minority."
"7-year-old boy raises $22,000 for the border wall — and then sets an even higher goal - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/7-year-old-raises-20k-for-border-wall,"A 7-year-old boy is being praised by many for raising $22,000 through a hot chocolate stand for the privately funded border wall, and he has set an even higher goal for his fundraising efforts.
Benton Stevens says that he will sell lemonade for the summer, and he hopes to raise $50,000 for the private border wall construction.
He was in attendance at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the first part of the private border wall.
The official Facebook site of the private border wall organizers praised Stevens in a post on Friday.
""We were honored to have him at our ribbon cutting ceremony yesterday for the wall he helped pay for along with all of you who donated,"" the post read.
""This is only the beginning and we're excited to keep building more to protect our nation and the legal citizens who proudly call American their home!"" they concluded.
Stevens made headlines in February when a man pointed at him and his fundraising stand from his car and said that he was a ""little Hitler.""
""A guy pointed at him,"" his mother said to KXAN-TV , ""and then he said that we didn't like brown people. I don't understand that at all.""
The private border wall effort stalled after city officials said the organizers didn't have the proper permits, but construction has commenced again after a brief interlude.

The teacher who tweeted Pres. Trump about illegal immigrants at her school has been fired - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-teacher-who-tweeted-pres-trump-about-illegal-immigrants-at-her-school-has-been-fired,"The Texas teacher who was suspended for tweets to President Donald Trump about removing illegal immigrants from her school was fired Tuesday night, according to The Dallas Morning News .
The Fort Worth Independent School District board voted unanimously to terminate Carter-Riverside High School English teacher Georgia Clark ""for good cause"" during Tuesday night's special meeting.
Last week, old tweets written by Clark under the now-deleted username @Rebecca1939 called for the president to help do something about the fact that Fort Worth ISD is allegedly ""loaded with illegal students from Mexico.""
""Anything you can do to remove the illegals from Fort Worth would be greatly appreciated,"" Clark wrote to President Trump in one tweet.
Clark's termination comes not only after the Twitter incident, but after a series of disciplinary issues over the years, some of which were also related to anti-immigrant rhetoric.
In 2007, she was disciplined for inappropriate physical contact, having been accused of kicking a student. In 2008, she was disciplined for unspecified inappropriate behavior. In 2013, Clark was suspended for allegedly calling one group of students ""Little Mexico"" and calling another student ""white bread."" She was under investigation for telling a student to ""show me your papers saying you are illegal"" when the student asked to go to the restroom. She has previously been suspended and reassigned, and the district recommended firing her on a previous occasion. However, the superintendent made a deal with a teacher's association to keep her employed, according to KTVT-TV .
Some teachers spoke at the meeting in support of firing Clark.
""It's time for the school board to decide, which side are you on?"" asked teacher Erin Moran. ""The school board needs to act immediately to make sure this woman never teaches in Texas again.""
""The remarks created a threat that will directly result in children missing the education to which they're legally entitled, because their parents will keep them home out of fear,"" said Mindia Whittier.
Fort Worth ISD's student population is about 63 percent Hispanic. Clark will have a chance to appeal the district's decision."
"YouTube responds to Vox writer's campaign to 'punish' Steven Crowder, and he is not happy about it - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/youtube-shut-downs-campaign-against-crowder,"The organized campaign to ban Steven Crowder from YouTube has failed after the social media platform tweeted Tuesday that the conservative comedian had not violated its community standards.
Vox writer Carlos Maza demanded that YouTube take action against the BlazeTV host, and asked his followers to flag his videos as abusive in order to get him banned. Crowder had targeted Maza and his videos for ridicule and mockery over their liberal bias.
On Monday, Crowder posted a humorous video where he offered an apology to a lengthy list of political and pop culture figures that he had insulted in the past. Maza did not find it as humorous.
On Tuesday, YouTube responded from its Twitter account.
""Our teams spent the last few days conducting an in-depth review of the videos flagged to us, and while we found language that was clearly hurtful, the videos as posted don't violate our policies. We've included more info below to explain this decision,"" the online video company tweeted .
""As an open platform, it's crucial for us to allow everyone–from creators to journalists to late-night TV hosts–to express their opinions w/in the scope of our policies. Opinions can be deeply offensive, but if they don't violate our policies, they'll remain on our site,"" the statement continued.
""Even if a video remains on our site, it doesn't mean we endorse/support that viewpoint,"" the statement concluded. ""There are other aspects of the channel that we're still evaluating– we'll be in touch with any further updates.""
Maza responded angrily at YouTube's decision.
""I don't know what to say,"" he tweeted. ""@YouTube has decided not to punish Crowder, after he spent two years harassing me for being gay and Latino. I don't know what to say.""
"" That's an absolutely batsh*t policy that gives bigots free license,"" he added in another tweet.
Maza called out to LGBT creators to leave YouTube, and demanded that LGBT employees who worked for YouTube quit their jobs.
""They're trotting you out to convince advertisers that their platform hasn't become a breeding ground for hate speech and bigotry,"" Maza said . ""They're hoping you'll distract advertisers away from the monsters they're creating.""
He noted that it was Pride Month, and called for action against YouTube.
""It's a platform for monsters masquerading as an ally to the LGBT people they target,"" he tweeted .
""It's going to get so much worse now,"" Maza concluded . ""@YouTube has publicly stated that racist and homophobic abuse doesn't violate their anti-bullying policies. Crowder and his allies are going to be emboldened. I genuinely can't imagine what LGBT employees at YouTube are doing right now.""
Crowder had an uncharacteristically brief response:

Russia intercepts US military plane multiple times over international waters,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-intercepts-us-military-plane-over-international-waters,"A Russian military plane intercepted a U.S. military aircraft multiple times Tuesday over international waters.
Here's what we know In a statement , the U.S. 6th Fleet said:
On June 4, 2019, a U.S. P-8A Poseidon aircraft flying in international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea was intercepted by a Russian Su-35 three times over the course of 175 minutes. The P-8A Poseidon is the military's version of the Boeing 737.
While the 6th Fleet said that ""the first and third interaction were determined to be safe,"" it said that the ""second interaction was determined to be unsafe due to the Su-35 conducting a high speed pass directly in front of the mission aircraft, which put our pilots and crew at risk.""
This interception was not in violation of international treaties, but was considered to be ""irresponsible."" Interactions like these ""‎increase the risk of miscalculation and potential for midair collisions."" The 6th Fleet said that the U.S. aircraft ""did not provoke this Russian activity.""
Haven't we heard this story before? This type of reckless aerial interaction between U.S. and Russian fighter jets is becoming all too common.
In May 2018 , a Russian Su-37 jet flew within 20 feet of a U.S. Navy plane over the Baltic sea. Then, in November , a Russian Su-27 intercepted another U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance plane. Both of these interceptions were also over international airspace and were criticized by the Navy as being ""unprofessional"" and ""irresponsible.""
And just two weeks ago , the U.S. intercepted six Russian planes (four Tupolev Tu-95 bombers and two Su-35 fighters) that had left international airspace and entered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone. In September 2018 , there were two additional incidents with Russian military planes flying close to Alaska."
House responds to border crisis by passing a mass amnesty bill with zero border security funding,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-amnesty-bill-no-border-security,"America is currently facing a massive border crisis, and House Democrats along with seven Republicans responded to it Tuesday evening by passing an amnesty bill with absolutely no border security money or asylum system reforms. The final vote was 237-187.
House Resolution 6, or the "" American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 ,"" would extend amnesty to at least 2.5 million illegal immigrants who were either brought to the U.S. as minors or have been on "" Temporary Protected Status ."" That number is well beyond the estimated 700,000 to 800,000 total DACA recipients. This would take the form of green card status with a path to citizenship.
""The Dream, and now Dream and Promise Act, is urgent for our country,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said at the bill's introduction in March, before trying to sell the legislation under a few lines from a Ronald Reagan speech.
However, critics point out that the legislation would do absolutely nothing to address the border enforcement problems and legal loopholes that created the current crisis in the first place.
Conservative Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) took to social media Tuesday to say the bill would cost the American taxpayer $34.6 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while providing ""$0 (ZERO) dollars for border security"" and no asylum reforms.
""What is it?"" Roy asked rhetorically. ""A complete dereliction of our constitutional duty to #SecureTheBorder and address the ongoing humanitarian crisis at our southern border.""
Indeed, according to a summary sheet from House Judiciary Committee Republicans, the total cost of the bill comes from the combined estimated costs of the two bills that make up the legislation in its current form.
But that's not all. The summary also explains that ""time constraints"" kept the CBO from being able to calculate the potential public cost of aliens who could seek citizenship by violating the terms of their visas and then become eligible for green cards: ""That cost is unknown.""
Other critics say that the bill's barriers against applicants with criminal histories are too low.
Briefing materials about the bill from the office of Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) say that ""applicants with several misdemeanor convictions can obtain a green card, even if the misdemeanors were violent and resulted in death or bodily injury.""
The bill's language bars illegal immigrants who have been convicted of felonies or three separate misdemeanors involving total jail time over 90 days from getting green cards. It also disqualifies those who have been convicted of a "" crime of moral turpitude "" and those convicted of domestic violence.
However, the bill bars DHS from using state and federal gang databases as the determining factor in disqualifying potential beneficiaries.
""The Democrats are making us consider a bill that will worsen — give a green light — to the border crisis, incentivizing more people to cross our borders illegally in hopes of getting a piece of the amnesty pie,"" House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins (R-Ga.) said on the House floor Tuesday. ""No doubt at this very minute, the smuggling cartels are getting the word out ... Congress is going to legalize millions, just get there.""
Meanwhile, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security says that the current level of migrants in custody is "" beyond sustainable capacity "" while this year has seen record levels of border apprehensions ."
Catholic priest blasted for asking 'ladies' to dress modestly to 'protect the purity of the men at holy Mass',www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/catholic-priest-ripped-for-asking-ladies-to-dress-modestly-to-protect-the-purity-of-the-men-at-holy-mass,"A Catholic priest was blasted on Twitter for asking ""ladies"" to dress modestly to ""protect the purity of men at holy Mass."" And while Father Kevin M. Cusick later tweeted that he isn't backing down from his request, it appears his Twitter account has since been deleted.
What happened? Cusick — who's from the Washington, D.C., area — on Monday posted the following tweet: ""Ladies, a priest I know was forced on Sunday to ask a woman at Mass to cover her shoulders. Please help the priest to protect the purity of the men at holy Mass by choosing to dress modestly. The alternative is awkward for all involved. Thank you.""
Image source: Twitter screenshot
Backlash
As you might imagine, Cusick's tweet ruffled a few feathers:
""A woman's shoulders are not provocative,"" Australian novelist Jane Caro shot back . ""Women's bodies are not grenades, liable to explode at any moment. Men's sexual/emotional/paranoid reactions to other people are entirely their own responsibility."" Caro also said ""this is why I despise organised religion."" Feminist author Kimberley Johnson asked , ""Why? Is the alternative that men will think about sex? Why blame the women for what men think? 'Purity of men'? What a crock. Why don't you preach that men should be respectful of women and not treat them as sex objects? Go pray on that."" She added , ""Men who are not able to control themselves around women's bare shoulders/arms/legs/abdomens — and the men who defend them — should not be permitted to be in public spaces with women."" The editor in chief of BitchMedia replied , ""Something is really wrong in any religion that is more concerned with women wearing their shoulders out than priests sexually assaulting children. Make it make sense."" ""In honor of this tweet, I will now be taking up the hobby of attending church in only tube tops,"" another Twitter user declared . ""I will show my shoulders to every man in the establishment, I won't stop until my collarbone has caused countless erections, and it will all be your fault."" But not everyone was against Cusick's plea.
""I am honestly very saddened by how many women take a 'not my problem' stance when it comes to how men feel when exposed to the way most women dress today,"" Catholic writer Stephanie Nicholas noted . ""Have you considered speaking to good, godly men and seeing what they think?""
Cusick responds
Later on Monday Cuscik said he wasn't about to bow down to the outcry against his tweet.
""By the way: I'm not backing down from this,"" he tweeted. ""I've thought about it, I've prayed about it, and I'm not to going to engage in the endless Vatican II style debate that goes back-and-forth constantly and ends up nowhere.""
Image source: Twitter
But as of Wednesday morning, it appeared his entire Twitter page had been deleted .
However, Cusick did tell Yahoo Lifestyle that ""Twitter does not lend itself well to some sensitive subjects"" and that ""even though we may have a very valid point to make sometimes it just happens that we don't express it in a way that takes into account certain sensitivities and so because of that somebody becomes offended when that wasn't intended at all.""

'Washed up psycho' Bette Midler jokes that someone should stab President Trump,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bette-midler-joke-stab-trump,"Actress Bette Midler joked that someone in President Donald Trump's posse should ""shiv"" him — a term typically interpreted to mean ""stab.""
What the heck? It all began when Midler took aim at Trump in a tweet that attributed a fake Quote: to the president. Social media trashed Midler after sharing the post, which featured a debunked anti-Trump meme.
""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican,"" the fake Quote: said. ""They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They love anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""
While on a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump tweeted about Midler's faux pas, which had circulated widely on the internet and drew criticism from all corners of the web.
In a fiery tweet, Trump snapped, ""Washed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make 'your great president' look really bad.
""She got caught,"" he continued, ""just like the Fake News Media gets caught.""
""A sick scammer!"" the president concluded.
Naturally, Midler's supporters rallied around her after the president's dig, which may have emboldened her to offer her latest Twitter rebuttal that got her a lot of negative response.
What did she say? On Tuesday night, Midler shared a photo of Trump pictured at a church service that took place in the wake of the mass killing in Virginia Beach, Virginia .
The 73-year-old actress wrote, ""He actually looks better here! Maybe someone in his camp can gently give him a shiv. I mean, shove.""
Despite the obligatory social media backlash, the tweet remains live on Midler's page at the time of this writing."
Bill to legalize assisted suicide in Maine heads to governor's desk,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/maine-passes-assisted-suicide-bill,"A bill that would legalize doctor-assisted suicide has passed the Maine state House and Senate and is now headed to the desk of Gov. Janet Mills (D).
Here's what we know The bill narrowly passed Maine's House on Monday by a vote of 73-72 and the state Senate on Tuesday, 19-16.
Mills has not said whether she will sign the bill. Under Maine law, if the governor does not take any action with the bill, either to sign or veto, it will automatically become law after 10 days.
If this bill becomes law, Maine would become the eighth state, along with the District of Columbia, to legalize assisted suicide.
What does the bill say? According to the text of the bill , a patient seeking to end his own life would have to sign a written request with two witnesses who can both verify that ""to the best of their knowledge and belief the patient is competent, is acting voluntarily and is not being coerced to sign the request.""
One of the two witnesses has to be someone who isn't related to the patient, is not giving the patient medical care, and won't inherit anything after his death.
The new law would only apply to patients over 18 years old who have been determined by a doctor to have a ""terminal disease"" that is both ""incurable"" and would ""within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within 6 months.""
After signing this statement, the patient has to be examined by a doctor and have the doctor sign off on the suicide. There is also a waiting period of 15 days between the first request and when the written request can be submitted, and of 48 hours between the written request and when a doctor can write a prescription of a lethal dose of medication."

Alabama legislature passes bill requiring chemical castration of child sex offenders as condition of parole,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/alabama-chemical-castration-for-child-sex-offenders,"The Alabama Legislature passed a bill Tuesday that will make the chemical castration of some child sex offenders a mandatory condition of parole, and now it is up the governor sign it into law.
What are the details? House Bill 379 requires that ""as a condition of parole, a court shall order a person convicted of a sex offense involving a person under the age of 13 years to undergo chemical castration treatment, in addition to any other punishment prescribed for that offense or any other provision of law.""
The bill was sponsored by state Rep. Steve Hurst (R), who told WIAT-TV that child sex offenders ""have marked this child for life and the punishment should fit the crime.""
Hurst had introduced the bill before, but now it is set to become law if Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signs it.
The lawmaker told WIAT, ""I had people call me in the past when I introduced it and said don't you think this is inhumane? I asked them what's more inhumane than when you take a little infant child, and you sexually molest that infant child when the child cannot defend themselves or get away, and they have to go through all the things they have to go through.""
""If you want to talk about inhumane — that's inhumane,"" he added.
Chemical castration involves taking drugs to reduce sexual urges, according to the Daily Mail .
If HB 379 becomes law, parolees would be administered an initial dose prior to release from prison and required to receive follow-up treatments from the health department thereafter. Sex offenders would also be required to pay for their mandatory treatments, but indigent convicts could have their fees waived.
USA Today reported that ""anyone who stops receiving treatment without the court's approval would be taken back into custody.""
Anything else? If Gov. Ivey does sign the legislation, Alabama can expect it to be fought in court by lawyers representing offenders, according to attorney Raymond Johnson.
Johnson told WIAT, ""They're going to challenge it under the 8th Amendment of the United States Constitution, because they're going to claim that it is cruel and unusual punishment for someone who has served their time and for the rest of their life have to be castrated.""

New York — which passed one of the most liberal abortion laws ever — now wants to protect cats from a 'horrific' procedure,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-declawing-cats,"New York passed one of the most liberal abortion laws in American history in January, permitting abortions after 24 weeks even if the mere health of the mother could be compromised by the pregnancy.
Now, New York lawmakers are shifting their focus to prioritize the well-being and comfort of the state's cats.
What is going on? New York lawmakers passed a bill Tuesday that would ban cat declawing, sending the resolution to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) for approval.
The bill prohibits several types of cat declawing surgeries except when necessary ""for a therapeutic purpose,"" which the law defines as addressing the ""physical medical condition"" of the cat.
""Therapeutic purpose does not include cosmetic or aesthetic 11 reasons or reasons of convenience in keeping or handling the cat,"" the law states.
Violators of the law would face civil punishment, including a fine of up to $1,000.
If Cuomo signs the bill, the Empire State would become the first in the nation to outlaw the procedure. His office told the New York Times that it is reviewing the bill.
Several major U.S. cities — including Los Angeles, Denver, and San Francisco — already outlaw cat declawing.
What is cat declawing? The process, which is known as onychectomy, is actually more complicated than removing a feline's claw nail. In fact, the process involves the amputation of the end bone to which each nail is attached.
""Cat declawing is a horrific, yet often practiced surgery that leads to a lifetime of pain and discomfort for thousands of cats,"" Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal (D) told NPR.
However, as NPR noted , the New York State Veterinary Medical Society is the most outspoken opponent of New York's potential declawing ban. The veterinarian group argues there are several legitimate purposes for declawing cats, including for the health of cat owners with weakened immune systems."
11-month-old Missouri baby dead after spending 15 hours locked in a hot car.

Temperatures in Calverton Park, Missouri, surged into the high 70s on Sunday.
What are the details? Calverton Park Police said that first responders arrived on the scene after receiving a 911 call, but it was too late to save the child.
Calverton Park Public Information Officer Chris Robertson told KTVI-TV that the temperature inside the vehicle was likely much higher than outside the car.
""Temperatures reached about 79 degrees that afternoon which inside of a hot vehicle can get much hotter,"" Robertson said.
The PIO also noted that the department is working together with the St. Louis County Prosecutor's Office.
""It's heartbreaking when there's any life lost, especially when you're dealing with a child and of an age that young,"" he added.
So what's the story behind it?
The child's grandmother said that she discovered the child inside the vehicle, which was parked in her driveway. She and other members of the family reportedly said that the child's parents inadvertently left the child inside the car. Each of the parents apparently believed that the other had brought the child out of the car.
Neither had done so.
What was the reaction to the child's death? Lilly Belfield, a family cousin, told the station, ""Nobody would intentionally do that. If you saw her smile, laugh, giggle, you would think the same thing. Nobody would ever hurt this baby.""
The child's grandmother reportedly told the station that the parents ""made an innocent mistake.""
One neighbor doesn't seem to be as forgiving.
Velvet Warren, who lives nearby, said that this incident occurred because of neglect.
""This is ridiculous,"" Warren said. ""The baby did not deserve to die.""
Warren hopes that the parents are charged in connection with the child's death."
Transgender teacher accused of showing 'coming out' video to elementary school students,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-teacher-accused-of-showing-coming-out-video-to-elementary-school-students,"A transgender teacher is accused of showing a ""coming out"" video to every classroom at a Wisconsin elementary school — kindergartners through fifth graders — last month.
In response, Liberty Counsel — a law firm dealing in religious freedom issues — said it sent a records request to the Madison Metropolitan School District in late May to ""begin uncovering the full extent of this teacher's inappropriate activism in the classroom.""
The teacher in question is Mark Vincent Busenbark, the firm said — a ""male"" who teaches science at Allis Elementary School.
Liberty Counsel provided a copy of the video in which Busenbark explained that there's ""one truth that I've hidden from you ... I am transgender.""
Busenbark added, presumably to students, that ""maybe you've only heard"" the word ""transgender"" through the ""filter of those who hate and fear.""
With that, Busenbark read from a transgender-themed children's book, titled, ""They Call Me Mix,"" explaining that the character ""starts as a girl, and they grow into who they're going to become."" Busenbark added that, ""I started as a boy, and I hope to grow into who I am going to become.""
Image source: Dropbox video screenshot
'BOY or GIRL?' Busenbark in the clip read the following passages:
""'BOY or GIRL?' Are you a boy or a girl? How can you be both? Some days I am both. Some days I am neither. Most days I am everything in between."" ""As a kid, I never felt like just a girl. I never felt right knowing everyone was deciding and agreeing that I was a girl."" The video presumably shown to students also included images from the book depicting people who don't support transgenderism as scary, ghostlike figures , Liberty Counsel said.
After the book reading concluded, Busenbark said, ""I hope you understand me a little better,"" and then announced a new name.
""And now, let me introduce myself, anew. ... I am going to take my wife Stella Steel's last name, and I am going to use, not mister, and not miss, but 'mix,'"" Busenbark said. ""So you can call me, 'Mix Steel.' ... And for my pronouns, I'm using 'they,' 'them,' and 'their.'""
What else did Busenbark allegedly say? Liberty Counsel also provided a screenshot of a Facebook post from what the firm said is Busenbark's alter ego, Vica Steel. The post was from the day before Busenbark's ""coming out.""
It reads, in part:
All of my students will know my truth. And they are the last to hear. This is terrifying. And powerful. I teach in a school where some of our students have been taught by society that being transgender is wrong. That being gay is wrong. But I am still coming out ... And I hope to reach that kid, sitting it the corner with their hood pulled over their face that despite the taunts and the hate, their truth is real and their truth is beautiful. Amen. What did Liberty Counsel have to say? ""It is outrageous that school administrators would allow a male science teacher to expose children to propaganda that promotes confusion about basic biology, and to instruct students to address him by a false name, title and pronouns,"" Liberty Counsel's founder and Chairman Mat Staver said. ""These impressionable students do not exist to validate Busenbark's sexual identity. Parents send their children to school trusting that they will be taught academic curriculum, not become participants in a teacher's play acting.""
The firm added that ""one teacher emailed [Busenbark] that a kindergartner said , 'I feel the same way at times' as 'Mx. Steel.' Another teacher said that because of the video, other children 'just accepted' a girl's claim that 'she is a boy now.'""
Fox News said neither the school or the teacher responded to requests for comment."

"" The two conservative powerhouses spoke about their own journey in the radio, talk, and TV industry, the importance of storytelling, and the one thing in life that having money does change.
In this video, Chad explained his mindset back when he first started creating videos of him sitting in the truck running his mouth. His idea was to see how fast he could say what needed to be said in 60 seconds because in his mind, he did not think people would want to watch a ""talking head"" for longer than that.
""It's fascinating to me that people let me waste their time because I don't want to see me, I don't want to hear me,"" Chad said.
""When you understand how valuable your time is and your time is no more valuable than their time, it actually weighs on you,"" Glenn replied. ""You are just like: Man, I am going to waste your time today and now I have guilt.""
Chad explained that what's always set Glenn apart was the way in which Glenn spoke with conviction in everything he communicated to his audience.
Glenn described his start in Top 40 radio when he learned and studied his craft at age 13 but he later realized that being a ""morning radio guy"" was often nonsense that simply helped people get up in the morning and just ""not him.""
""I was a different guy,"" Glenn said.
Glenn described a battle with alcoholism that led to losing his family, fortune, and reputation, and that all he wanted back was his credibility.
""I wanted to be able to look a man in the eye and say I was telling the truth without question,"" Glenn said.
According to Glenn, because he was honestly soul-searching during the tough times he had experienced in life, he would not change a thing about his journey. He went on to say that his journey was the path to conviction.
Chad expressed his appreciation for Glenn and his transparency in speaking with conviction and still admitting his flaws as a man.
Can money destroy you? Chad inquired about the ways in which celebrities are viewed by the public when they reach rock bottom, adding that the public does not get that people all experience the same struggles no matter whether they have ""made it"" in life.
Glenn explained that money only complicated life and highlighted the same problems in life.
""The only thing in life that money changes ... private air travel,"" Glenn said with a smile.
The two discussed the hurdles that came with having the kind of money that afforded them the opportunity to help others, and the importance of allowing others the opportunity to learn the principles to be successful in life.
The art of storytelling Chad asked Glenn to describe the elements of storytelling and what needed to be done to recapture the art of storytelling.
""I would say the conviction of the storyteller. The fact the storyteller can see it and feel it. A good storyteller is someone who is a good observer,"" Glenn replied. ""A good storyteller is someone who can internalize the story first and be able to connect and surf that emotion...if you can put that into words you have it""

NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio insists anti-Semitism is strictly 'from the right',www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/nyc-mayor-bill-de-blasio-insists-anti-semitism-is-strictly-from-the-right,"New York City mayor and presidential candidate Bill de Blasio claimed this week that the spike in anti-Semitic attacks in his city and beyond can be entirely attributed to the ""right-wing movement,"" drawing ire even from his fellow Democrats.
What are the details? According to the New York Post , hate crimes are up 64 percent in The Big Apple from this time last year, and anti-Semitic attacks have risen by 90 percent.
Speaking at a news conference in Brooklyn on Tuesday to address the issue, de Blasio said, ""I think the ideological movement that is anti-Semitic is the right-wing movement,"" The Post reported.
When a reporter reminded the mayor that anti-Semitism is also rising ""on the left in the BDS movement and around the world,"" de Blasio dismissed that claim, saying, ""I want to be very, very clear, the violent threat, the threat that is ideological is very much from the right.""
BDS calls for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel, and is fueled by Palestinian groups and supported by far-left extremists. The initiative has been endorsed by congressional progressives such as Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), according to CNN .
New York City Council members on both sides of the political aisle quickly rebuked de Blasio over his comments.
""I don't agree with the mayor,"" Brooklyn Democrat Chaim Deutsch told The Post. ""I have not seen any white supremacists coming in here committing these hate crimes.""
Staten Island Republican Joseph Borelli agreed, telling the outlet, ""A simple look at where anti-Semitic hate crimes have occurred just disproves this — unless you count central Brooklyn as the home of a vast right-wing conspiracy.""
Borelli added, ""Bill de Blasio regularly says stupid things, but this is literally the stupidest effing thing he's ever said.""
Anything else? In January, the New York City Council voted to establish The Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, in order to combat the rising problem, The Hill reported. The mayor announced Tuesday that the new office will open this summer, months ahead of its originally planned November effective date."
Virginia's Democratic governor wastes no time pursing aggressive gun control after Virginia Beach tragedy,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-gun-control-push-northam,"Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) is wasting no time pushing an aggressive gun control agenda in the wake of last week's Virginia Beach massacre that left 12 people dead.
""I will summon the members of the Senate and the House of Delegates to meet in Special Session for the purpose of passing common sense public safety laws,"" Northam announced at a news conference Tuesday.
Alex Edelman/Getty Images
Included among Northam's proposed changes are:
Universal background checks on every firearm transaction A ban on ""assault weapons"" A ban on suppressors and bump stocks A ""red flag"" law A law permitting just one handgun purchase per month. Allow local law enforcement to enact further Second Amendment restrictions When Northam mentions a ban on ""assault weapons"" what he really means is outlawing semi-automatic rifles, including the AR-15, which are often upgraded with certain cosmetic features such as a folding stock, forward pistol grip, and muzzle flash suppressor.
Further, the Trump administration has already outlawed bump stocks , following through on a promise following the Las Vegas massacre in October 2017.
At the news conference, the Democratic governor, who seemingly once endorsed infanticide and opposes most abortion restrictions, said gun control is ""worth it"" if ""we can save one life because we acted now.""
""I will be asking for votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers,"" Northam said mockingly.
Would the proposed changes have prevented last week's tragedy? No.
According to law enforcement, the perpetrator used two legally purchased handguns — along with a legally purchased suppressor — to carry out the massacre.
Republican Kirk Cox, speaker of the Virginia House, called Northam's proposals ""hasty and suspect,"" according to the New York Times , referring to the series of scandals Northam and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax have faced this year. Pushing for gun control could aid their re-election efforts.
Instead, Cox said Republicans intend to propose stiffer penalties for criminals who use firearms to carry out a crime.
""We believe addressing gun violence starts with holding criminals accountable for their actions, not infringing on the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,"" he said, the Associated Press reported .
Meanwhile, the National Rifle Association accused Northam of ""exploiting a tragedy to push his failed political agenda.""

Ted Cruz breaks with President Trump on Mexico tariffs while Marco Rubio gets behind the president's plan,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/cruz-breaks-with-trump-on-mexico-tariffs,"There's growing consternation on the right about President Donald Trump's plan to pressure the Mexican government into cooperating more on illegal immigration by instituting tariffs, and it's made for some interesting splits in the Senate.
Notably, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — a consistent ally of the president's immigration agenda in the upper chamber — has come out vocally against the idea of pressuring Mexico through tariffs, citing the effect that it could have on his home state's economy.
""There is no doubt we have an emergency at the border, which is exacerbated and perpetuated by congressional Democrats who refuse to close loopholes in our law that are resulting in a massive influx of illegal immigration,"" a Cruz spokesperson told Blaze Media in a statement. ""The answer, however, is not imposing tariffs against Mexico.""
The statement explained that a ""25 percent tariff on Mexico would impose nearly $30 billion of new taxes on Texans. That doesn't make any sense.""
Rather, Cruz's office said, ""It's time for congressional Democrats to work with Republicans and President Trump to do something about the serious humanitarian crisis we're seeing in Texas and other border states because of unchecked illegal immigration.""
Following a closed-door meeting of GOP senators Tuesday, Cruz told a White House representative that ""I want you to take a message back ... you didn't hear a single yes"" from the conference in favor of the plan, the New York Times reported .
""I will yield to nobody in passion and seriousness and commitment for securing the border,"" Cruz told reporters later. ""But there's no reason for Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses to pay the price of massive new taxes.""
In contrast, Marco Rubio, whose 2016 presidential primary bid was weighed down by his previous support of the 2013 ""Gang of 8"" immigration bill, spoke out in support of the president Wednesday morning, albeit with caveats about tariffs in general.
""I don't generally like tariffs either,"" the Florida senior senator tweeted. ""But what alternative do my GOP colleagues have to get #Mexico to secure its southern border, use the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to screen northbound rail cars & vehicles & act on intel we provide on human traffickers?""
Should the proposed tariffs go into effect next week, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) predicted that there would be a bipartisan Senate vote against them via a resolution of disapproval.
However, the tariffs might not ever have to go into effect, depending on Mexico's level of cooperation, according to a key Trump trade adviser.
""We believe that these tariffs may not have to go into effect precisely because we have the Mexicans' attention,"" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNN Wednesday, pointing to upcoming meetings with between Mexican and American officials. ""I think let's stay calm and look at the chess board here."""
Breaking: YouTube makes a stunning decision against Steven Crowder after saying he did not violate its terms - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/youtube-demonetizes-steven-crowder-channel,"After admitting on Tuesday that conservative comedian Steven Crowder had not violated its community standards, YouTube announced Wednesday it would strip his videos of monetization, which keeps him from earning income from ads on his content.
The stunning decision was announced on the company's social media account.
""Update on our continued review–we have suspended this channel's monetization,"" YouTube tweeted.
Update on our continued review–we have suspended this channel's monetization. We came to this decision because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies. More here: https://t.co/VmOce5nbGy
— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) June 5, 2019 ""We came to this decision because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies,"" the online video company added.
This is in contradiction to its previous statement that said Crowder's comments were ""hurtful"" but did not violate its policies.
""As an open platform, it's crucial for us to allow everyone–from creators to journalists to late-night TV hosts–to express their opinions w/in the scope of our policies,"" read the previous statement from YouTube. ""Opinions can be deeply offensive, but if they don't violate our policies, they'll remain on our site.""
The online video platform had been under pressure by a campaign organized by Vox writer Carlos Maza demanding Crowder, a BlazeTV host and a popular YouTube creator, be punished for what he saw as ""homophobic"" attacks.
Maza responded angrily to the announcement and demanded more action be taken against Crowder.
""So the f**k what,"" he tweeted at YouTube.
""Basically all political content gets 'demonetized.' Crowder's revenue stream isn't from YouTube ads,"" Maza added. ""It's from selling merch and 'Socialism Is For F*gs' shirts to millions of loyal customers, that @YouTube continues to drive to his channel. For free.""
YouTube clarified that Crowder could retain monetization of his videos as long as he simply deleted a link to T-shirts with objectionable messages.
To clarify, in order to reinstate monetization on this channel, he will need to remove the link to his T-shirts.
— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) June 5, 2019 ""To clarify, in order to reinstate monetization on this channel, he will need to remove the link to his T-shirts,"" the online video platform explained.
""Oh my f**king g*d,"" said Maza in response to the clarification.
After Maza's angry reaction, YouTube offered a second clarification to explain its first clarification.
""Again, this channel is demonetized due to continued egregious actions that have harmed the broader community,"" the tweet read.
Sorry for the confusion, we were responding to your tweets about the T-shirts. Again, this channel is demonetized due to continued egregious actions that have harmed the broader community. To be reinstated, he will need to address all of the issues with his channel.

"Amid a sea of companies raising money for abortion, Wendy's stands up and promotes adoption - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/wendys-makes-push-for-adoption,"According to a Tuesday article published on Live Action , Wendy's clearly has adoption on its mind over abortion.
According to the Family Council , some of the companies that widely support Planned Parenthood include Aetna, Clorox, Deutsche Bank, Mondelez International, Nike, Starbucks, United Airlines, and more.
In May, Netflix employees donated at least $20,000 to Planned Parenthood. Netflix announced that it would be reconsidering filming in Georgia as a result of the state's new ""heartbeat"" law .
What are the details? Through Wendy's Wonderful Kids — a program belonging to The Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption — children who belong to a group considered ""more difficult-to-place"" are given a leg up in achieving adoption.
That group includes those children who are ""older, have special needs, or are part of a sibling group."" These kids are able to engage with the Wonderful Kids program to ""find loving homes using evidence-based, child-focused methods.""
Wendy's kicked off a new initiative in May called the Cause Cups , which will feature a Snapcode that allows consumers to donate $5 to the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption through a simple and efficient click of their smart device.
Live Action reported that the foundation hopes to bring the Wendy's Wonderful Kids program to all 50 states by 2028.
What else? Wendy's CEO Rita Soronen told Columbus Monthly that the key to being able to place the children in stable forever homes is to know the children.
""At the core is knowing that child,"" she said. ""When you give a caseworker time to really work a case, you will find an adoptive family for these children.""
Catholic Connect shared a post on Instagram promoting Wendy's initiative, which featured one of the Cause Cups.
Catholic Connection's Instagram account captioned the photo, ""INSTEAD of supporting the sick for-profit abortion industry of Planned Parenthood THIS is what big corporations should be doing for America. Bravo @wendys."""
WTF MSM!? YouTube demonetizes Crowder's channel as the NY Times casually compares him to neo-Nazis,www.theblaze.com,Rob Eno,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/wtf-msm-youtube-demonetizes-crowders-channel-as-the-ny-times-casually-compares-him-to-neo-nazis,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here .
This is by design …
On Wednesday morning, YouTube announced, according to the New York Times , that it will ""remove thousands of videos and channels that advocate for neo-Nazism, white supremacy and other bigoted ideologies."" Rather than sticking to the straight news of the announcement, the NY Times went and lumped BlazeTV host Steven Crowder in with the neo-Nazi promoters of hate.
On Wednesday afternoon, YouTube went ahead and demonetized Crowder's entire channel , saying a ""pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community."" This is a reference to a February 2018 blog post on YouTube's creator blog. The ""harm"" Crowder seems to have done is having a different opinion than people like Vox writer Carlos Maza, who asked YouTube to investigate him.
This is what the New York Times and Vox wanted: To sideline Crowder and to destroy his life and livelihood. This is what the media is.
Here's the Times' take and background on Maza's activism.
The tension was evident on Tuesday, when YouTube said that a prominent right-wing creator who used racial language and homophobic slurs to harass a journalist in videos on YouTube did not violate its policies. The decision set off a firestorm online, including accusations that YouTube was giving a free pass to some of its popular creators.
In the videos, that creator, Steven Crowder, a conservative commentator with nearly four million YouTube subscribers, repeatedly insulted Carlos Maza, a journalist from Vox. Mr. Crowder used slurs about Mr. Maza's Cuban-American ethnicity and sexual orientation. Mr. Crowder said that his comments were harmless, and YouTube determined they did not break its rules. The Times, Vox, and other leftists actually think that Crowder's comedy content is the equivalent to rhetoric spewed by violent, repugnant neo-Nazis, and they unashamedly make the false equivalency. In August 2017, Crowder talked about people, like those at the Times, who equate people they don't like with Nazis. Here's his video, "" The Little Boy Who Cried 'Nazi' !"" Now Crowder is warning that while his channel may be the first to lose monetization , it won't be the last.
The Times, Vox, and other leftists wade into dangerous waters with comparisons like this. When you paint your opponents as repugnant people, some guy may be reading, watching, or listening, and he might just drive to a baseball field to exact revenge .
Steven Crowder hosts ""Louder with Crowder"" on BlazeTV, which is owned by Blaze Media.
The truth is …
On Tuesday, Florida officials announced the arrest of Scot Peterson , the deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who failed to confront the gunman at the school in February 2018. He faces 11 criminal charges stemming from his inaction. New York Magazine writer Yashar Ali noticed an old tweet from CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza that ""didn't age well.""
The tweet was a share of Cillizza's story titled , ""Here's definitive proof that a good guy with a gun doesn't always stop a bad guy with a gun."" Cillizza used the article to argue that because Peterson did not act that day, that disproves that more good people with guns won't stop tragedy. His original version of the story erroneously claimed that Peterson was inside the school when shots were fired and ran outside. That was not the case.
Ali is correct in noting that after the arrest, Cillizza's tweet looks even worse. Someone who neglected to do his duty is not a ""good guy"" with a gun. He's someone who, according to Florida prosecutors, acted criminally.
But it's not just old tweets from CNN staffers that should be in question. On Tuesday night, CNN's Chris Cuomo, in his nightly segment with Don Lemon, said ""only in America do you respond to something like this this way."" He added that it ""messes with my head from a policy perspective"" that Peterson is facing charges.
As Twitchy notes, the other way we dealt with the shooting is that the shooter has been apprehended and arrested by other law enforcement officers who did not neglect their duties .
CNN has been pushing its agenda since the shooting. Its town hall prominently featured disgraced Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, who has subsequently been removed from office for his actions surrounding the shooting.
To CNN it's all about pushing a leftist narrative, never simply reporting on the news.

Drag troupe for people with Down syndrome is picking up steam. It calls itself 'Drag Syndrome.',www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-troupe-for-people-with-down-syndrome-is-picking-up-steam-it-calls-itself-drag-syndrome,"You've no doubt noticed how popular Drag Queen Story Time for kids in public libraries has become over the last few years.
And now for an encore, a brand new group of people is getting a taste drag performance — those with Down syndrome, the Mighty reported .
Image source: Facebook video screenshot
That's right. A U.K.-based troupe that calls itself ""Drag Syndrome"" started in March 2018 because choreographer Daniel Vais wanted to give people with intellectual disabilities a platform to perform, the outlet said.
Image source: Facebook video screenshot
The troupe consists of queens Lady Francesca (Francis), Horrora Shebang (Otto), and Gaia Callas (Danny) — as well as a drag ""king"" Justin Bond (Ruby), the Mighty said.
Image source: Facebook video screenshot
""When people see us perform, they recognize the immense talent in front of them and the sheer quality entertainment of the artists,"" Vais told the outlet, adding that ""people with Down syndrome have the extra chromosome to excel in the arts, culture, and anywhere else.""

Backlash
The Mighty noted that Drag Syndrome also has been criticized. The outlet said the group noted in a recent BBC video that members have received hate mail and have heard that having those with Down syndrome participate in the drag scene is exploitative.
Image source: Facebook video screenshot
But Drag Syndrome's performers apparently don't see it that way.
""Gaia is not a character, but she is a part of me,"" Gaia Callas said, the Mighty noted, while Justin Bond added, ""If you have a problem with that, mate, you shouldn't be here.""
Vais added to the outlet that Drag Syndrome hopes it can show that those with Down syndrome are creative, dedicated, and professional — and also inspire young people with Down syndrome to pursue their passions fearlessly, the outlet said.
""Live your dream, you can do anything you want, you can be anyone,"" Horrora Shebang told the Mighty. ""Just get out there.""

Watch: 97-year-old WWII paratrooper commemorates D-Day with 75th anniversary jump,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/watch-97-year-old-wwii-paratrooper-commemorates-d-day-with-75th-anniversary-jump,"In June 1944, Tom Rice jumped out of an airplane over hostile, Nazi-occupied territory in Normandy, France, as boats filled with his fellow Americans and other allies made their way for the planned amphibious landing on the region's beaches as part of Operation Neptune.
Now, 75 years later in June 2019, at the age of 97, Rice jumped out of a plane into Normandy again, but nobody was shooting at him this time and it wasn't dark outside.
""It went perfect, perfect jump,"" Rice said after his most recent jump, according to The Associated Press . ""I feel great. I'd go up and do it all again.""
The landing zone for Wednesday's jump was just outside Carentan, France, which was one of the objectives of the paratroopers dropped over the occupied country during Operation Neptune. The AP report said that Rice ended up jumping into ""roughly the same area he landed in on D-Day.""
However, he also said that it was dark when he landed in 1944, so he can't be exactly sure of where that was.
The 1944 mission with the Army's 101st Airborne Division was ""the worst jump I ever had,"" Rice said. He landed safely despite some problems exiting the plane and a bullet going through his parachute.
""I got my left armpit caught in the lower left hand corner of the door so I swung out, came back and hit the side of the aircraft, swung out again and came back,"" he told the Associated Press, ""and I just tried to straighten my arm out and I got free.""
There's even video available of Rice's 75th anniversary jump, which he makes in tandem with another parachutist, a large American flag fluttering beneath the two of them.
ABC News reported that Rice trained for six months to prepare for the jump."
Trump administration to end funding for stem cell research that uses fetal tissue from abortions,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-administration-no-funding-for-stem-cell-research-fetal-tissue-from-abortions,"The Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday that it will stop funding any stem cell research that uses human fetal tissue from elective abortions. The department said, ""Promoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump's administration.""
What's the background? This decision comes more than nine months after HHS began a review of all the research it funded ""involving human fetal tissue from elective abortions ... in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved.""
While fetal tissue samples used in research cannot be from babies specifically aborted for the purposes of providing those samples, undercover videos taken at Planned Parenthood in 2015 that showed Planned Parenthood workers planning to sell aborted babies for profit caused outcry from the pro-life community.
HHS did not end funding for stem cell research The change in policy does not pull funding from studies that use stem cells from other sources such as umbilical cords. It also does not appear to affect any studies that use fetal tissue not harvested from an elective abortion.
Any projects conducted by universities using tissue from aborted babies that have already been approved will not have their funding cut. This new ruling will also not prevent privately funded research from using tissue samples harvested from abortions.
There could be exceptions There's also still a chance that some of these research projects could still receive partial government funding. HHS said that any ""new extramural research grant applications or current research projects in the competitive renewal process"" that planned to use ""fetal tissue from elective abortions"" would have to appeal their case to an ethics advisory board.
It is not clear from the HHS announcement what criteria would have to be met for a research project using aborted fetal tissue in order to get approval from this ethics advisory board.
HHS will help researchers try to find alternatives In a statement announcing the move , HHS said that it was ""continuing to review whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue from elective abortions in HHS-funded research and will ensure that efforts to develop such alternatives are funded and accelerated.""
As an example of this, the department noted that it had devoted $20 million in December to finding acceptable alternatives to human fetal tissue for research.."
"GOP Sen. Sasse mocks Democrats' fears, defends yet another judicial nominee questioned about being a Knight of Columbus",www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/sasse-mocks-democrats-asks-nominee-about-knights-of-columbus,"""Are you now, or have you ever been, involved in the organization of a fish fry?"" Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) began his line of questioning Wednesday for Peter Joseph Phipps, a nominee to be a federal judge on the United States Third Circuit.
The question might seem like an odd one for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on judicial nominees. Given that Phipps later revealed in questioning that he had been formally questioned about his involvement in a Catholic organization known for organizing fish fries, Sasse's question mocking committee Democrats made perfect sense.
Indeed, Phipps is just the latest judicial nominee to face formal scrutiny over his involvement in the Knights of Columbus, he revealed during the testimony, having received questions for public record about his membership in the group.
Last December, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) faced backlash after they publicly questioned whether another knight, Brian C. Beuscher of Nebraska, could fairly serve as a judge due to his membership in the organization. Hirono even said that the Knights of Columbus ""has taken a number of extreme positions"" because of their public stances on matters relating to their Catholic faith. The two Democrats were later invited to a D.C.-area Knights of Columbus event to raise money for Special Olympics but they never showed up.
In dealing with the questions posed to Phipps, Sasse dismissed fears about the organization, saying, ""This is a new tradition around here evidently — trying to figure out if people are members of religious organizations.""
Sasse then had Phipps explain what the Knights of Columbus is.
The senator followed up by mockingly asking, ""It's more of the stuff of community service, love of neighbor, fish fries and pool parties than any of this, than some sort of 'Da Vinci Code' stuff?"" adding, ""I just want to be clear that I understand this 'scary' organization that you're a member of.""
""That's exactly right,"" Phipps responded.

'The reality is not like that at all': Lara Logan blows the lid off leftist lies about the border crisis,www.theblaze.com,TheBlaze Staff,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/glenn-radio/lara-logan-border,"Former CBS News foreign correspondent Lara Logan has taken on a special 90-day assignment with Sinclair Broadcast Group's ""Full Measure"" to give a first-hand account of the immigration crisis along the U.S.- Mexico border.
She joined Glenn Beck on Wednesday's radio show to report on what's really going on at our southern border and to debunk the liberal narrative that U.S. Border Patrol agents are a bunch of ""evil white men who are trying to stop people coming into this country.""
""What are the important stories that we're not hearing?"" Glenn asked Lara.
""What people leave out of the narrative is that this is almost like a theater. It's a performance, not for the people who are living it, because they are pawns, but it's a theater for the cartel. Yes, they make an enormous amount of money out of all the people that cross,"" Logan said.
""They have professional human smuggling operations , human trafficking organizations that are global who do the smuggling for them,"" she continued. ""The Mexican cartel decides who crosses, where they cross, and when they cross.""
Logan explained that there are three main Mexican cartels: Sinaloa Cartel, Gulf Cartel, and del Noreste (formerly Los Zetas,) and described how they use multiple large groups of immigrants and numerous crossing points to split the Border Patrol's resources and overwhelm facilities.
""In one tiny little town on the border in Texas, on the Rio Grande Valley, they have Border Patrol facilities that are built to house a maximum of 115 people. Last weekend, they had over 1,100 ... and that's just one weekend. This has been going on for months and months and months,"" she said.
Logan debunked the liberal media's narrative that conservatives, particularly those in Texas, are ""racist rednecks"" who don't care about immigrant people. She said the reality is the very opposite, that most people are doing everything they can to help these immigrants, but that Border Patrol facilities, churches and local shelters have run out of capacity and resources.
""There's another really important thing that gets left out of the narrative,"" Lara added. ""Which is that a large majority of Border Control agents are Hispanic-Americans.... It's not just these evil white men who are trying to stop people coming into this country. It's not that at all. In fact it's much more complex. And in some of these towns the vast majority of the people who live there are Hispanic-Americans.
""It's very different to what people say it is from a distance,"" she noted. ""The reality is not like that at all, and I have yet to meet anyone who wants these people to suffer or who is deliberately cruel to people.""

"US citizen killed by border patrol after rushing across border from Mexico, shooting at agents",www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-citizen-killed-by-border-patrol-after-rushing-across-border-from-mexico-shooting-at-agents,"A U.S. citizen has been killed by Border Patrol agents after he tried to force his truck through a border checkpoint and reportedly opened fire at agents.
What happened? The unidentified suspect was a 23-year-old white male who attempted to cross the U.S. border from Tijuana, Mexico, into San Diego near the San Ysidro Port of Entry around 7:30 p.m. Monday. Border Patrol attempted to stop him at a secondary vehicle inspection site but he refused to comply.
According to a news release from the San Diego Police Department:
[T]he suspect was driving through the Port of Entry from Mexico into the United States. He refused to stop for the CBP Officers and attempted to drive through the inspection area. Several CBP Officers attempted to stop the suspect, whose vehicle was eventually blocked by another vehicle. The suspect began firing a gun out of his vehicle towards the officers, then exited his vehicle and continued firing at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. Rapid fire gunshots can be heard in a video obtained by KNSD-TV (San Diego's local NBC affiliate) that appears to show the incident.
While the suspect's name has not yet been released, police confirmed that he was a U.S. citizen.
What else? No members of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol were injured during the confrontation. Rescue crews tried unsuccessfully to save the suspect after the shooting.
The San Diego Police are currently conducting an investigation into the shooting. It is not clear if the shooter had a motive.
Customs and Border Patrol told ABC News that the shooting held up border crossings for about 30 minutes."

Ocasio-Cortez admits how much her 'Green New Deal' will cost — the number is startling,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-says-green-new-deal-will-be-pricey,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) admitted how much it would cost to get started on her audacious ""Green New Deal"" to combat global warming, and the number is startlingly high.
""I think we really need to get to $10 trillion to have a shot,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in response to the question from The Hill on Wednesday.
The socialist democrat has touted her plan despite the Democratic leadership ignoring it and even openly mocking it. Democrats have drawn up their own plan to tackle global warming.
""I know it's a ton,"" she added in her statement . ""I don't think anyone wants to spend that amount of money, it's not a fun number to say, I'm not excited to say we need to spend $10 trillion on climate, but... it's just the fact of the scenario.""
Ocasio-Cortez also faced ridicule and mockery after she released a FAQ document on her website that included many outrageous policies that she was proposing under the Green New Deal. The document was later deleted from her website.
""It's not popular,"" said Ocasio-Cortez of the cost of fighting climate change, ""it's not politically popular. People are going to call it unrealistic, and I just don't think people understand how bad the problem is.""
The upstart freshman member of Congress was previously mocked for trying to explain how to easily pay for Medicare-For-All, and employing very bad arithmetic to do it.

"Joe Biden opposes federal funding for abortion services, provoking outrage from activist organizations",www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-opposes-federal-funding-for-abortion-services-provoking-outrage-from-activist-organizations,"Joe Biden separated notably from the Democratic Party on the issue of abortion Tuesday when his campaign told NBC News that Biden opposed the use of federal funds for abortion services in most cases, according to the Daily Beast .
What's this about? At issue here is the Hyde Amendment, a 1976 law that bars the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.
Several notable 2020 Democrats, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, have opposed the law and said they would repeal it, and thanks to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party platform calls for the Hyde Amendment to be repealed.
Is this a surprise? Biden is a professing Roman Catholic who says he is personally opposed to abortion but has been more lenient about the issue as a matter of public policy. He now supports Roe v. Wade, and has criticized recent pro-life state laws passed in the south.
Biden's Senate voting record reflects his support for the Hyde Amendment, but an ACLU video seemed to show Biden saying he would repeal the law. Biden's team says he misheard the volunteer who asked him the question.
How have pro-abortion advocates reacted?
Emily's List President Stephanie Shamrock : ""At a time when reproductive rights are under consistent attack, it's unacceptable that a major Democratic nominee supports the Hyde Amendment. We hope that Vice President Joe Biden will reconsider this position and what it means to millions of women."" NARAL President Ilyse Hogue : ""There's no political or ideological excuse for Joe Biden's support for the Hyde Amendment, which translates into discrimination against poor women and women of color plain and simple."" Planned Parenthood Action Fund executive director Kelly Robinson . ""The unfair Hyde Amendment makes it so that those who have the least end up having to pay the most to access abortion, and those who are service members or live on reservations are often left with no coverage for abortion care."""
Stacey Abrams visiting Hollywood to convince studio execs not to leave Georgia over pro-life law - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-visiting-hollywood-to-convince-studio-execs-not-to-leave-georgia-over-pro-life-law,"Well before Georgia passed a pro-life law banning abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, Hollywood actors and studios threatened to pull business from the state if the law took effect.
Now that the Hollywood exodus from Georgia is starting to become a reality, Democrats and pro-abortion advocates are trying to get Hollywood to change its mind, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution .
Turns out, as much as they may feel the inability to get an abortion hurts women, so does losing the tens of thousands of jobs created by television and movie productions.
What does Gov. Brian Kemp think about this? Kemp has not shown much worry about Hollywood's threats to boycott the state, saying he prioritizes pro-life values over the ""squawks"" of ""C-list celebrities.""
Kemp also believes that if some Hollywood studios decide they no longer wants to take advantage of Georgia's tax incentives, others will take their place. Additionally, Kemp said there are plenty of Georgians who don't think the entertainment industry should be getting the incentives anyway.
Earlier this month, Kemp postponed a planned trip to Los Angeles to promote Georgia's film industry. The governor now plans to make that trip in the fall.
What will Abrams be doing? When Abrams heads to Los Angeles for her June11 meeting with Hollywood representatives, she will be joined by NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue.
According to an event invitation obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the meeting will focus on ""the reality that employees in the state may not have full access to healthcare or the freedom to make decisions about their futures and their families.""
Abrams, using a social media campaign called #StayAndFight, wants to encourage Hollywood leaders to support candidates and organizations that will challenge the pro-life law, instead of boycotting Georgia altogether.
Abrams said this is a chance for pro-abortion advocates to ""fight back—not only against the legislation here but the legislation around the country—and to fund the defeat of these politicians and their horrible behavior.""

CNN panel hammers Joe Biden for 'lazy or arrogant' campaign screw-up in scathing segment,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-panel-hammers-joe-biden-for-lazy-or-arrogant-campaign-screw-up-in-scathing-segment,"A CNN panel of political analysts criticized former Vice President Joe Biden over a hefty mistake made by his campaign that reminded many of a previous campaign-ending blunder.
""This is a pretty amateur mistake for the front-runner's campaign to make, on a substantial policy roll-out, when they had to know, when team Biden got together planning to announce his campaign, the one thing they cannot do is plagiarize,"" said John King in the introduction to the segment.
Biden was facing criticism from his left for reports that he was seeking a compromise in climate change debate, but when he tried to put out his policy to placate his critics, he lifted passages from other plans without attribution.
Biden's first presidential campaign in 1988 imploded after various instances of plagiarism surfaced.
""Supposed to be a campaign a-team, this was not an A performance,"" commented King, who pointed out that the Biden campaign used the exact same excuse for the current charges as he did 31 years ago.
""It shows a bit of a lack of forethought, I suppose is the polite way of saying it,"" commented Washington Post reporter Karoun Demirjian. ""I guess the worst case scenario, is potentially a little bit too much arrogance that you can just do this and not have anyone look at you.""
""It's lazy, or arrogant,"" added King.
""I'll call this a style issue, although this is a leadership issue, this is a competence issue, he wants to be president of the United States, this is a leadership and competence issue,"" King continued.
""You can't do this stuff, you just can't,"" he concluded. ""You do it in our business, you get fired.""

GOP rep asks pro-abortion actress if an abortion survivor has a right to life—and she refuses to answer - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-rep-asks-pro-abortion-actress-if-an-abortion-survivor-has-a-right-to-life-and-she-refuses-to-answer,"Actress and pro-abortion advocate Busy Philipps testified before Congress about abortion during a Tuesday hearing, including a notable exchange during which Philipps refused to answer definitively whether an abortion survivor has the right to life.
The question came from Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert and was based on the testimony of Melissa Ohden, the founder of the Abortion Survivors Network who is ""the survivor of a failed saline infusion abortion in 1977.""
""Would you agree that somebody who has survived an abortion, like Melissa Ohden, has a right, once she's born, to life, to control over her body where someone else doesn't take her life?"" Gohmert asked.
Philipps deflected the question with a joke: ""Although I played a doctor on television, sir, I am actually not a physician.""
Gohmert was not distracted by the deflection.
""No, but you've given very compelling testimony and I appreciate that you've obviously given these issues a lot of thought, that's why I'm asking you,"" Gohmert said.
""I think that it's something that is very important,"" Philipps replied. ""I don't believe that a politician's place is to decide what's best for a woman—it's a choice between a woman and her doctor.""
""What about a baby and the doctor?"" Gohmert countered. ""That's my question.""
Philipps then said she could not speak to Ohden's experience because she wasn't there, and eventually clarified that she was there to speak about abortion, not birth.
Philipps, in not answering the direct question, relied on standard pro-abortion talking points about abortion only being between a woman and her doctor, while avoiding the crucial questions of personhood that truly define the abortion debate. The question of whether and when abortion should be permitted fundamentally boils down to when and if one believes the baby's right to life supersedes a woman's wishes to not have the baby.
One might hope or expect that a question about an abortion survivor's right to receive medical treatment to survive would be unnecessary, but numerous attempts in recent months by Congress and some states to pass born-alive abortion survivor protections have been rebuffed by pro-abortion advocates.

A new poll shows how many Americans think officials should ignore subpoenas from Democrats,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-says-trump-officials-should-testify,"A new poll shows that very few Americans believe that former senior members of the Trump administration should ignore subpoenas from Congress, while many more want them to testify.
The new Hill-HarrisX poll found that 74 percent of registered voters, nearly three-quarters, opined that senior Trump administration members should be made to testify before Congress in accordance to subpoenas that have been issued.
Only 26 percent said that executive privilege or immunity would allow members to ignore subpoenas.
Although the results showed a divide between opinions of registered voters from different parties, a surprisingly high number of self-identified Republicans agreed that the officials should testify: 61 percent. Among self-identified Democrats, 87 percent thought the officials should testify.
Subpoenas have been a contentious issue between the Trump administration and Democrats controlling the House of Representatives. The president's critics have used their congressional powers to investigate various accusations of wrongdoing by the president and his allies, and they have no shied away from using the subpoena power.
The Trump administration told the president's former lawyer Don McGahn to ignore a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee in May.
House Judiciary Committee Democrats have already voted to hold U.S. Attorney General William Barr in contempt, and they have threatened to do the same against Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
Democratic Sen. Dick Blumenthal (Conn.) threatened Donald Trump Jr. with imprisonment if he didn't comply with a subpoena to testify.

Pelosi erupts during meeting with top Dems about impeaching 'I want to see him in prison',www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-erupts-during-meeting-with-top-dems-about-impeaching-trump-i-want-to-see-him-in-prison,"Democratic leadership remains deeply divided over whether or not to impeach President Donald Trump, with tensions escalating during a Tuesday night meeting during which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi exclaimed that she wanted to see the president ""in prison"" even though she isn't ready to impeach, according to Politico .
What's this about? Ever since special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report became public, Democrats have been faced with the reality that it's either time to impeach quickly or drop the issue and hope a Democrat wins the 2020 election.
Opponents of impeachment, like Pelosi, fear the political backlash of an impeachment effort that will almost certainly be squashed by the Republican-held Senate.
""I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,"" Pelosi reportedly said at the meeting.
Impeachment advocates like Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the House Judiciary Committee chairman, are ready to get moving on impeachment now believing that the public hearings and investigations associated with the effort will be beneficial regardless of what the Senate does with it.
Why this is dividing the party: Some Democrats in the House have been extremely vocal about impeaching the president. Their enthusiasm to go after President Trump creates pressure for Democrats in neighboring districts who have to explain why they don't support impeachment.
Fake public unity? Despite the reported rift within the party over impeachment, both Pelosi and Nadler claim they are on the same page on the issue.
""Make no mistake, we know exactly what path we're on,"" Pelosi said Wednesday. ""We know exactly what actions we need to take.""
""When that decision has to be made, it will be made not by any one individual, it will be made probably by the caucus as a whole,"" Nadler said. ""Certainly Nancy will have the largest single voice in it."""
Mother of special-needs girl hides recorder on daughter. What's caught on tape at school is sickening.,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-of-special-needs-girl-hides-recorder-on-daughter-whats-caught-on-tape-at-school-is-sickening,"Editor's note: This story originally posted on February 11, 2019. We have updated the date on the post in order to put it back on our front page because Facebook has blocked our ability to share new posts because, according to them, this story is clickbait. You be the judge.
Amber Pack got concerned when her 8-year-old special-needs girl didn't want to go back to school, so Mom hid a recording device in her daughter's hair in the hopes of getting to the bottom of the issue, WJLA-TV reported .
And that same day after school, Pack heard the sickening results for herself.
""I oughta backhand you right in your teeth,"" one instructor at Berkeley Heights Elementary was caught on audio saying. ""How's that for anxiety?""
The same instructor (instructor #1) at the Martinsburg, West Virginia, school also was heard saying, ""I'll punch you in your face.""
A different instructor in the same class (instructor #2) was heard asking, ""You gotta go pee pee? Pee pee? Or do you not have to go pee pee, and you just want to go j*** o** in a chair?""
Image source: WJLA-TV video screenshot
There's more that includes yet another instructor, according to audio WJLA shared:
Instructor #2: ""I'm gonna pull your hair until you start crying."" Instructor #3: ""Don't throw it. Don't throw. You animal you."" Instructor #2: ""Yep. You wench."" Instructor #2: ""You're like a pygmy. You're like a pygmy thing."" What happened next? The next day Pack told the school district and Martinsburg police, the station said.
A WJLA reporter asked Pack if she believes this sort of thing had been going on for a while at the school.
""Yes,"" she replied. ""That was the first day I put the recorder in her hair.""
Amber Pack Image source: WJLA-TV video screenshot
""One day you recorded all of this?"" the reporter asked.
""One day. Eight hours,"" Pack answered.
What else was heard on the secret audio? WJLA reported that instructors also were heard singing songs and reading stories to students, but what stood out more were words such as:
Instructor #2: ""How your tears dried so quickly, crocodile."" Instructor #3: ""And then she wants to destroy everything in sight."" Instructor #2: ""I'm a knock you out."" ""I couldn't eat for three days ... my stomach ... I was just so upset,"" Pack told the station. ""And every time I looked at her I would start crying.""
Another mother finds out
Kasey Murphy's 6-year old son Owen was in the same class and told WJLA she wasn't alerted about the audio at a parent-teacher conference last October even though Pack already had handed the tape to the school district.
""I've never heard from the principal,"" Murphy told the station. ""Never heard from the superintendent. I've never heard from any of them.""
Image source: WJLA-TV video screenshot
And actually it wasn't until November that Murphy found out — after Pack posted a clip of the recording on Facebook, WJLA said.
Instructor #2 was heard saying, ""I'm gonna beat your butt for sure, and Owen — you're gonna get one just, just cause,"" the station said.
""It's sickening,"" Murphy told WJLA. ""Like, people don't even talk to animals like that, and they're talking to nonverbal children who don't understand why they're talking to them like that. They're not doing anything wrong.""
Image source: WJLA-TV video screenshot
On another part of the recording, instructors were heard teasing and refusing to give food to Owen.
""Growl at me. I dare ya, and you won't get one. Go 'head,"" instructor #1 was heard saying. ""There's nothin' says I have to give you a snack. Nothing.""
Image source: WJLA-TV video screenshot
Instructor #2 added, ""It looks like you get nothing, Owen. Ha ha. Sorry, buddy.""
What did the county prosecutor have to say? The Berkeley County Prosecutor's Office found no criminal wrongdoing, WJLA reported, but County Prosecutor Catie Wilkes Delligatti told both mothers in a letter, ""I am not in any way condoning the verbal treatment of your children by the individuals in the classroom.""
Under West Virginia law, verbal abuse of children is not a criminal act, the Journal reported , citing a release from the prosecutor's office.
What happened to the instructors?
Berkeley County Schools released a statement about the recording, the paper added: ""Berkeley County Schools will not tolerate any action or inaction that impacts the health, welfare, and safety of our students. The employees involved in the Berkeley Heights incident were placed on administrative leave since the allegations surfaced and the teacher has since resigned.""
WJLA said the administrative leave was paid and that only one of the three instructors got back to the station and had no comment.
The Civil Rights Office of the U.S. Department of Education just opened its own investigation, the station added.
What's happening with the two children highlighted in the story?
Both students are now in different schools, the station said, adding that Owen transferred to a new school district. The parents of both students told WJLA their children are very happy in their new classrooms.
As you might guess, Pack still has questions for the instructors.
""I don't understand why you treated her the way you treated her,"" she told the station. ""She does not deserve that. No kid does.""

Jewelry store turns away sheriff's deputy picking up engagement ring — because he's carrying service weapon,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/jewelry-store-turns-away-armed-police-officer,"A North Carolina sheriff's deputy got the news he wanted to hear from Kay Jewelers in Statesville: The engagement ring he purchased had been sized and was ready to be picked up — and now he could propose.
Even better was that the Iredell County deputy was notified about the ring while he was on his meal break Tuesday, so he headed right over to the store to pick it up.
But the deputy never got inside.
What happened? The Iredell County Sheriff's Office revealed on Facebook that the store manager met the deputy at the door saying he couldn't enter while armed with his service weapon.
""The deputy informed the manager he was in uniform and his marked patrol car was in the parking lot, and it would be a violation of policy for him to remove his service weapon while in uniform,"" the post added.
The sheriff's office post explained that the policy requiring deputies to remain armed ""is in place for not only the safety of the deputy, but the general public as well.""
The store manager's reply? The store manager told the deputy he could return to the store at a different time when he was not armed, according to the Facebook post, and that the deputy left the store without the ring.
What else did the sheriff's office say? ""The reaction our deputy encountered is very difficult for us to comprehend,"" the sheriff's office added, ""and we earnestly hope situations such as these are few and are diminishing.""
The post also said that Sheriff Darren Campbell tried contacting Kay Jewelers' corporate office numerous times but hadn't received a response.
Kay Jewelers replies
But Kay Jewelers did reply to a request for comment from WSOC-TV .
""Kay Jewelers is reaching out to the customer and the Iredell County Sheriff's Office to sincerely apologize for the mishandling of this matter,"" the company told the station. ""We have tremendous respect for law enforcement, and we thank the Office for bringing this to our attention. We will be sure to reinforce store training regarding our firearm policy with specific regard to uniformed law enforcement."""
'Hell freezes over': CNN's Jim Acosta heaps praise on President Trump for D-Day speech - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/jim-acosta-heaps-praise-on-trump-for-d-day-speech,"CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta — a frequent critic of President Donald Trump who just wrote a book about ""the dangers he faces reporting on the current White House"" — delivered high praise for the commander in chief's D-Day speech in Normandy on Thursday.
Acosta's comments were so stunning it caused Fox News to declare hell had frozen over.
What did he say? President Trump delivered an address overlooking the beaches of Normandy on the 75th anniversary of the World War II allied invasion, with dozens of D-Day veterans seated directly behind him on stage, the Washington Examiner reported.
When the president finished speaking, CNN cut to Acosta, who was reporting on-site from the American cemetery in France, and asked for his assessment of President Trump's remarks.
""I think this is perhaps the most on-message moment of Donald Trump's presidency, today,"" Acosta began. ""We were all wondering whether he would veer from his remarks, go off his script there, but he stayed on script, stayed on message, and I think, rose to the moment, and as he was talking about the men gathered behind him, he described them as being among the greatest Americans who have ever lived. I mean, that could not be any more of a fact check true if we could have found one.""
The reporter and pundit went on to say, ""It really was one of those moments that I think Donald Trump needed to rise to in order to — I think — walk away from the cemetery, walk away from this hallowed ground, and have people back at home saying 'You know what, no matter what I think about the current president of the United States, he said the right thing at Normandy, he did the right thing at Normandy,' he really hit all of the right, I think, moments in that speech when he was paying respect to these heroes who are still with us.""
Acosta also complimented French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke at the ceremony as well, saying he and President Trump both ""were just hitting all the right notes throughout their remarks"" despite the fact that the two ""lately have not been getting along very well with one another.""
What else? The White House correspondent did feel the need to mention that President Trump was delayed in arriving because he was giving an interview to Fox News ahead of the ceremony, but added, ""Honestly, you have to put all of that to the side and recognize that this was just a really captivating, stirring, remarkable moment for the entire world to witness as politics was just put aside, washed aside, as we remember the bravery and the courage of these men today.""
A Fox News report detailing Acosta's comments bore the headline , ""Hell freezes over as Jim Acosta, Joe Scarborough praise Trump's D-Day speech.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot
Tuesday's incident was caught on video and made big headlines .
At one point in the clip, the light-haired, completely livid female stood just inches from the man's face as she screamed ""Nazi scum!"" before someone in the surrounding mob lobbed a milkshake upon his head.
Image source: Twitter video screenshot
She seemed to enjoy his plight.

Here's the clip. ( Content warning: Language ):
A longer video of the incident shows the Trump supporter debating with protesters while wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat — the symbol of Trump's 2016 campaign that's become a lightning rod for a growing number of those on the left who say the MAGA hat is synonymous with racism, bigotry, and hatred .
Image source: LBC video screenshot
That same video includes a brief interview with the woman in question who said she yelled at the Trump supporter because he's a ""f***ing Nazi"" and then refused further questioning because ""I don't need to hear from other white men, thank you very much.""
Content warning: Language
What else has been reported about the woman? The Daily Mail identified the woman as 34-year-old Siobhan Prigent and said she apologized for her actions before deleting all her social media accounts.
""I am very sorry for my behavior today. I should have protested peacefully and I didn't, and I regret that,"" she posted on Twitter, the outlet said. ""I've let myself down and I do understand that fully. There are two sides to every story, but my actions were my own, and that's on me. Please leave my family and friends out of it.""
But the Daily Mail also reported that her apology came just hours after she tweeted an expletive-filled message about Trump supporters: ""The MAGA c**** get a police escort #NoThanksNazis #TogetherAgainstTrump #DumpTrump.""
The outlet said she couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday night but noted that she had described herself online as an ""intersectional feminist"" and a ""crazy cat lady"" with an interest in mental health.
The Daily Mail added that Prigent had a taxpayer-funded job providing clinical trial coordination at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust through her for-profit company VLEK Ltd.
But on Thursday, according to the outlet, a UCLH spokesman said Prigent ""has today informed us that she will no longer be working at UCLH because she does not want us or the NHS to suffer any more negative attention. She had been at UCLH for a week. As an NHS trust, we pride ourselves on treating our patients and colleagues with kindness and compassion in all that we do.""
A pair of petitions against Prigent attracted nearly 3,000 total signatures within a day, the Daily Mail said.
Anything else? The outlet said the Trump supporter was led away by police for his own protection after the incident — but he later told the Daily Mail he was peacefully debating with ""moderate lefties"" and ""having a laugh with the majority of them"" before things got physical.
""We have to put forward how aggressive the left can be,"" the man, who didn't want to be identified, told the outlet in a video . ""It's not us. If they want to call me right wing because I'm supporting Trump, then I must be right wing, but I'm not a racist.""
He added that some of his family members and friends are people of color.
The Trump supporter also told the Daily Mail that protesters kicked him in the legs, attacked him with a banner, and went after his MAGA hat. The video description indicated he said things turned violent because protesters ""couldn't answer"" questions he was asking them.

""On ultrasounds, the baby tries to run away from the disturbing instruments that try to kill the baby,"" she added.
""The baby's mouth opens wide in a scream when being killed. These babies are alive,"" the 13-year-old continued. ""They feel being killed. It hurts them and there is nothing they can do about it. There is no way around it. Abortion is murder.""
Woosley even invoked the name of God to hammer home her point.
""Another good reason abortion is wrong is that God says it's wrong,"" she added. ""It's only by His grace that your mother didn't abort you, because if she did you wouldn't be sitting here today.""
How did people react? During her remarks, adults in the room took her to task over her remarks.
One person sarcastically said, ""Oh, please. Getting a child to do this is wrong!""
Another added, ""You're a baby!"" and shouted at Woosley after the young teen described what an actual abortion looks like.
David Buboltz, who was the last pro-life speaker to deliver remarks at the meeting, also took a beating.
Steff Mendell, one of the city council members, turned around and showed Buboltz her back during his remarks, refusing him the respect of even listening.
Buboltz, outfitted in a shirt that read, ""I am going to be murdered tomorrow!"" and featured a graphic of an unborn baby, fired back.
""First I would like to say that, Stef Mendell, it is disgusting that you would turn your back on us and on these babies,"" he said. ""It is. It isn't disrespectful to me. It is disrespectful to my God. And my God is all powerful. The Almighty God, the one who created the universe. You will stand accountable.""
Buboltz added, ""Instead of passing unnecessary legislation for political purposes, we need to move on from divisive social issues and focus on the needs of North Carolina families: education, health care and good-paying jobs."""
DHS inspector general reported 'egregious' conditions at ICE facilities,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/egregious-conditions-at-ice-facilities,"A report from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General outlined ""egregious"" failures at facilities run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which DHS oversees. At one facility, the kitchen manager was fired immediately over what the inspectors found.
What does the report say? The 28-page report details a number of issues plaguing four ICE detention facilities in California, Colorado, Louisiana, and New Jersey. The Office of Inspector General selected these four after ""concerns raised by immigrant rights groups and complaints ... about conditions for detainees held in ICE custody.""
The report found that all the facilities had ""issues with expired food,"" three violated ICE policies on how to treat prisoners who need to be segregated from the general population, two never let detainees have recreation time outside (as per DHS policy), and one did not even have enough hygiene and clothing items to ""ensure that [detainees] could properly care for themselves.""
At the facility in Essex County, New Jersey, which got the worst review out of the four, inspectors found ""open packages of raw chicken"" leaking blood ""all over refrigeration units,"" spoiled lunch meat, and moldy bread. The situation in the kitchen there was so bad that the kitchen manager was fired during the inspection.
Inspectors also found spoiled and expired food at the facility in Adelanto, California, and expired food at the LaSalle, Louisiana facility.
What else? In addition to the abysmal kitchen conditions, the Essex County facility also had mold throughout the bathrooms. Detainees were also strip searched at this location without ""reasonable suspicion to do so,"" which went against ICE policy.
While ICE requires its facilities to provide detainees with a basic uniform and toiletries, inspectors found that the Essex County facility only had two sizes and had not been giving detainees shampoo. Staff there also told the inspector that detainees had to purchase shampoo on their own ""which is in direct violation of the ICE standards.""
The inspector general noted in his report that illegal immigrants in ICE facilities ""are held in civil, not criminal custody, which is not supposed to be punitive."""
