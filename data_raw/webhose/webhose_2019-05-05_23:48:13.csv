Trump-hating Sztrok said as much in writing.
It follows, Herr Bob surely knew a president cannot obstruct investigation of a crime that did not occur. And that you cannot prosecute a president for exercising his Article 2 powers...even if you chase the absurdity (as Herr Bob tried to do) that you can prosecute presidential thoughts in the exercise of those powers. W T F.
So one big fat nothing from the very start. From BEFORE the start actually.
So what was the last two years of national tail-chasing all about?
Coup attempt. Remember, Herr Bob's Witch Hunt with the 17 Angry Dims was hatched shortly after Lying McCabe and Deep State careerist Rodney Rosenstein contemplated MIS -using the 25th amendment to take out the duly elected president, or even wearing a wire to entrap him.

Can Brexit Bring Parliament Together?,www.commonwealmagazine.org,Felix Robertson,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/can-brexit-bring-parliament-together,"Can Brexit Bring Parliament Together? History Suggests that It Might Print Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, talks during a no-confidence debate Jan. 16, a day after Parliament rejected British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal in London. (CNS photo/Jessica Taylor, UK Parliament via Reuters)
The New York Times described it as tantamount to ‘the laws of physics’ being “suspended.” Ministers resigned in protest. The British government, Conservatives declared, had done a deal with one who had “never once in his political life put British interests first.” To the uninitiated observer, it might appear that some awful, awesome abdication of power had occurred—as if the United Kingdom had decided to ask North Korea to have the casting vote on Brexit policy. The reality was rather more mundane. Having continually failed to get her deal passed by Parliament, Theresa May last Wednesday proposed a series of cross-party talks with the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn. She sought to secure a further extension and possibly devise a new deal that, with cross-party backing, might have more success, and avoid a catastrophic ‘No-Deal’ Brexit. It seemed like a sensible policy. But not everyone agreed. Boris Johnson tweeted that such talks would hand over “British trade policy and key law making powers…to Brussels,” Caroline Johnson proposed that a no-deal Brexit would be preferable, and arch-Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg lambasted Corbyn as a “known Marxist” and warned solemnly that “history doesn’t bode well” for such talks. But despite the fact that Rees-Mogg is frequently presented as a by-gone product of the twentieth, if not the twelfth, century, his sense of history is lacking. He is completely forgetting that less than a hundred years ago the sitting British government, in the face of a terrible national crisis, decided to put aside party differences and work with the opposition for the good of the nation. And it actually worked rather well. Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Conservative allies would do well to tone down their dudgeon. share
The year was 1929. Angered by the Conservatives’ heavy-handed response to the 1926 General Strike and the intractable issue of unemployment, the British public rejected Conservative Stanley Baldwin in the 1929 General Election, and elected a minority Labour government, with bold plans for housing and public works. However, the impact of the Wall Street Crash, barely three months later, precipitated massive economic hardship that crippled Britain’s already struggling staple industries. In 1931, a £120 million deficit was predicted (equivalent to nearly $10.5 billion today) and the fledgling Labour government faced a stark choice—slash unemployment benefits or face economic ruin. The Labour cabinet met in August 1931, and a majority voted against the cuts, arguing that they were incompatible with Labour’s most fundamental values. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, himself in favour of cuts, went to the King and tendered his resignation. But George V wouldn’t accept it, and instead invited MacDonald to form a radical new cross-party government that would consist of Labour, Conservative, and Liberal politicians, all working together for the common good.
The National Government, as it became known, dominated the 1931 election and would last for another ten years. And while it didn’t solve Britain’s issues overnight, in light of the punishing international economic and political situation, its achievements were profoundly impressive. A prudent economic policy, combined with a forward-thinking move away from the restrictive Gold Standard and a shrewd foreign policy ultimately led to some remarkable results. Unemployment was reduced by nearly 1 million from 2.6 million in 1931 to 1.6 million in 1939, and by 1937 industrial output was actually higher than in pre-crash 1929. British rearmament played a part in this revival, but the National Government deserves credit for keeping the British economy afloat, especially during the crucial early 1930s. Nor was this the only area of the National Government’s success. Political extremism was consistently rebuffed, with both the Communist Party of Great Britain and Oswald Mosely’s fascists firmly limited in prominence, even while countries such as Germany and Spain were racked by political strife.
So MPs such as Jacob Rees-Mogg really need to brush up on Our Island Story. While the outcome of Brexit is far from certain, the looming spectre of a No-Deal Brexit presents us with a massive potential crisis, which threatens colossal political and economic ramifications if we don’t make the right decisions. The Conservatives, like Labour in 1929, are a minority party racked with internal disputes and partisanship. But the situation today, as in 1929, calls for a calm, measured, and balanced response— an understanding that our problems won’t be solved overnight and a repudiation of political extremism on both sides. So Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Conservative allies would do well to tone down their dudgeon. Reports from preliminary meetings have called the cross-party Brexit talks “constructive.” It is still too early, of course, to say what that actually means. And it would be a long stretch indeed to compare either May or Corbyn to Baldwin or MacDonald. But cross-party efforts have saved Britain before. With any luck, they could do it again. Tags"
The race to write global rules for self-driving cars - Axios,www.axios.com,Joann Muller,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.axios.com/the-road-to-agreeing-on-global-av-safety-062d3f7e-a5a9-4875-8666-c250715a2674.html,"Go deeper 446 Words What's happening: Next month in San Francisco, the World Economic Forum will convene about 40 global experts on AVs and urban mobility to start hammering out guidelines that could lead to global standards and regulations for AV safety. Experts on the Global Autonomous and Urban Mobility Council will share research findings and different approaches to validating AV safety. The group will include industry executives, technology experts, regulators, community groups and academics. ""What we realized is there is no place internationally to deal with governing issues associated with these technologies,"" says Michelle Avary, head of autonomous and urban mobility at WEF. A UN committee is also working towards global policies and regulations for automated vehicles. Members of a UN working group from 40 countries met during this week's MobilityTalks International conference at the Washington, D.C. Auto Show. With AV technology still in its infancy, it's an opportunity for governments to harmonize policies around the world, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said during a panel with some of his global counterparts. ""If we don't, we'll end up like we are with today's vehicles, where we can't trade as freely around the world as we want."" Between the lines: There are many aspects to defining safety in an AV environment, from the technology itself, to the security of passengers and pedestrians who interact with them, to the insurance risks associated with their operation. Then multiply those challenges by the dozens of countries that are trying to deploy AVs in the next two decades. Even licensing and permitting AVs is a challenge. ""We know how to license and permit a human driver. How do you license technology that is evolving?"" says Avary. ""There is no good answer."" The World Economic Forum is hoping companies and governments will share insights — not just raw data — as the technology is developing so they can be more agile in their regulatory stances. ""What Shanghai is developing could be very applicable to Austin, Texas,"" says Avary. ""They need to have a place to talk about this stuff and grow together."" Yes, but: Regulators around the world can't even agree on common standards for vehicle headlamps and sideview mirrors. That's the legacy of a pre-global industry, argues Bill Gouse, director of government programs for SAE International. Regulations used to be written to create trade barriers. Today's automakers have research and development centers all over the world and want to share knowledge across countries. But the scale of the job is massive and will take years, notes Gouse. ""It's pioneering. It's exciting, at a glacier pace."" Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Matt Blunt's name. "

Tuberville For Senate?,www.occidentaldissent.com,Hunter Wallace,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2019/04/06/tuberville-for-senate/,"What?
“Former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville is running for Senate in Alabama as a Republican, he announced Saturday.
“After more than a year of listening to Alabama’s citizens, I have heard your concerns and hopes for a better tomorrow,” Tuberville wrote in a tweet and a statement on a campaign website. “I am humbled to announce the next step — I will be a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate.”…”
I will have to think about this.
Tommy Tuberville was the head coach at Auburn for the entire time that I was there. I suppose you could say that I still feel a residual sense of loyalty to him based on identity politics and fond memories of games from my youth. The Bama fans will never stand for it though!
Growing up in the South, I was raised on football like everyone else here. Alabama is a football crazy state. When Richard Spencer gave his speech at Auburn University in 2017, I used the example of Florida State quarterback Jameis Winson, who won the Heisman Trophy in spite of being credibly accused of sexual assault , beating Auburn in the 2014 BCS National Championship game to illustrate the absurdity of basing your entire sense of identity on college football. Much of the crowd disagreed.
So, I will have to give this Tuberville thing some more thought, and separate my memories and feelings of “cheering on the team” from what he is proposing to do now in politics. Share this:"

Nevertheless, there are those who choose to act in ways that are not only beyond reason and decency, they are unthinkable. …”
I never chose to become a “hate group.”
The SPLC has labeled this blog as a “hate group” on their website. The “hate group” consists of me sitting here on my laptop writing on this blog, offering takes on politics and history, and laughing at these people and the scam they are running across town in Montgomery .
What have these people ever done to solve Southern poverty? Nothing, as far as I can tell, they are just cashing in on gullible people like you like the other casinos and bingo halls in the Alabama Black Belt. Everyone in this area would be immensely better off if the SPLC was turned into an ATM and the residents of Central Alabama were allowed to withdraw exactly $1,000 a month from Morris Dees’s piggy bank. The partying would last for years when that money is finally put to better use.
“After the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 150,000 instantly, Robert Oppenheimer stated to President Truman: “Mr. President I feel I have blood on my hands.” He was taking moral responsibility for the consequences of his creation. Oppenheimer was a man of conscience, an example of human decency and integrity.”
That’s horrific.
Around 2008, I became interested in a movement known as the Alternative Right. I’m a populist voter who believes in social conservatism and economic fairness. I was also disgusted and alienated from the “conservative movement” by its celebration of the Iraq War. I couldn’t in good conscience vote for a neocon like John McCain who shed the blood of millions in the Middle East.
You’ve probably heard of the “alt-right,” but you have been misinformed about it by the mainstream media. We strongly believe in international peace and prosperity. In this country, no one is more opposed to stupid destructive regime change wars like the ones in Syria or Libya or the one that John Bolton is currently trying to incite in Venezuela right now than people like us.
I don’t want to live through World War III. It is the people in power in Washington, not “hate groups,” who see themselves as embroiled in a renewed Cold War with Russia and China which makes no sense at all to people like us. We didn’t believe any of the mainstream media’s nonsense about how Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump because of a vast Russian conspiracy.
We voted for Donald Trump because he promised to invest in our country and end those destructive conflicts. We came of age during Iraq and that left quite an impression on us.
“Hitler’s hands were drenched in the blood of six million Jews. The Holocaust was the result of his internalized hatred of Jews and his anti-Semitic national policies. Hitler died at the end of the war, an unrepentant mass murderer.”
I would say it is a bit more complicated.
There is a book called The Jewish Century written by a smart person named Yuri Slezkine. When future historians write about the 20th century and its tragedies, a central part of their narrative will be about how people of Jewish ancestry suddenly became immensely wealthy, powerful and influential in both Russia and the nations of the West. Suddenly, Jews had become a market dominant minority .
We both know how it ended in Germany and Europe in 1945. I won’t dwell on the point other than to observe that the same forces which gave rise to Hitler with Jews becoming a market dominant minority and culturally antagonizing the White population over the Holocaust in a neverending culture war that has consumed all of our lives explains much about American politics .
Now, I am a both a good Lutheran and a good Southerner, not a Nazi. We Southerners and Lutherans have a stormy temperament. We’re not accustomed to holding our tongues. Personally, I would rather have another Reformation than another Holocaust. How about you?
“The slaughter of two million people during the India-Pakistan partition, and of nearly a million in the ethnic slaughter in Rwanda, shows mass hatred can engulf people like a highly infectious disease.”
Well, I fully agree with you there.
It was a terrible tragedy. I’ve written at length about the absurdity of post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa from Zamunda to Wakanda . Sub-Saharan Africa was one of the more peaceful parts of the world in the early 20th century. It was making rapid economic progress. Europe and Asia were devastated by war. You know the story of what happened in Idi Amin’s Uganda with the Asian minority, right?
“Like a mutation, mass hatred has returned in a deadly form. Blood is being spilled in God’s house, places of worships — churches, synagogues, mosques — and innocent men, women and children are being killed by individuals driven by hatred and violent extremism peddled by hate groups all over the world.”
I have a different perspective.
I think Andrew Yang is right and the SPLC is wrong. This bloodshed is being caused by a combination of political correctness, multiculturalism and mass immigration. Specifically, it is a product of the “accelerationist” way of thinking, which is to say, White Nationalists who have come to believe that they are so socially and economically marginalized in their societies and have so little hope of reforming their cultures that their only way out is Pittsburgh and New Zealand.
Now, do I want that to happen? Obviously, I don’t want that to happen because there is no inherent contradiction at all between being a White Southerner, a Christian and a human being. When people like me are told they are UNIQUELY supposed to hate and revile their own European ancestors and be disinterested in the welfare of their descendants, it ANGERS them.
Here’s a better solution: let’s just get rid of political correctness and the toxicity it has unleashed in our culture, return to the moral values of Antiquity, Christianity and the Enlightenment and talk like reasonable men are supposed to about our differences.
“Hate will kill us all. Let me give you an example of how hate is being fanned.”
It’s a vicious cycle of hate and the root cause of it is political correctness and mass immigration. I’m not a hateful person. I’m a Happy Warrior. I’m a kind, reasonable person, not a violent extremist. I don’t want to kill anyone and would much rather our political establishment listen to these people and solve the problem and make it go away, but obviously it has no interest in doing so for a variety of reasons. For one, organizations like the SPLC and the ADL are profiting off the violence.
Doubling down on political correctness and censorship is about the worst possible idea imaginable. It is like throwing gasoline on a raging fire until it becomes a bonfire. It would be much easier just to talk to these people and try to understand where they are coming from.
Prohibition was a failed progressive experiment. Political correctness is an even more colossal mistake. If the “progressives” keep this up, Blompf is going to be reelected in 2020!
HINT: These three things are strongly connected:
“A friend of mine brought to my attention an alt-right ad with a bunch of provocative questions to enlist new members. As I read through it I said to myself ‘hmm’ and nodded in agreement with some of the points they raise but not in ways you might think. Here are my answers.”
I haven’t seen this ad.
It is probable, however, that I understand the mindset of whoever created it better than you do.
“Your ad is addressed to ‘white persons’. I am not a white person by race but in my country of birth I would be considered a ‘white person’ by the colour of my skin as well as by being a member of the upper caste with its perks and privileges.”
YES, now we are getting somewhere.
In British colonial societies like the American South, we had a similar racial caste system. Race has traditionally been closely tied to our historical sense of ethnic and cultural identity. Can you just realistically do away with those traditions and endlessly guilt trip and browbeat all the people whose ancestors believed in them? Can you do that without generating resentment?
“No, I am not ‘tired of political correctness.’ Freedom of speech is a laudable goal but it presumes equality of opportunity for all participants. Political correctness is not the permanent solution but it promotes laudable goals for groups that are marginalized on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
Of course not.
You’re not a European. Thus, you can’t understand why people of European ancestry who are uniquely taught that they can’t have a positive sense of racial, cultural and ethnic identity … because, reasons which no longer even exist … grow resentful over living under a false morality which was concocted in the 20th century and spread through television. You’re right that it isn’t a permanent solution.
Political correctness is going to go one way or the other. It can go peacefully through some kind of cultural reformation that detoxifies these issues, OR, it can go violently like we saw in New Zealand. I’m just saying this because I can look at the trends and see the writing on the wall. The easiest way to stop more New Zealands would be to put us in charge of the SPLC.
“No, diversity and multiculturalism are not ‘limited to only white countries.’ India has been effectively multicultural for millennia and people of different faiths and colour lived together.”
I think you are confusing some issues here.
The reason that political correctness and multiculturalism are so resented is because of what we call THE STANDARD. Let me explain THE STANDARD: everything that is European is BAD, and everything that is non-European is GOOD and is worthy of public celebration.
Now, I don’t even dislike India. There are many “White Nationalists” who are very interested in Asian cultures. I don’t see any reason why we can’t peacefully coexist on this planet. I’ve recently been doing a low-carb Keto diet and this smart person in India has lots of great recipes:
Subscribe to his YouTube channel.
“Multiculturalism is the wave of the future.”
IF there were room in our culture for White people to have a positive sense of European identity and to take pride in their own heritage and culture, and to be social conservatives and argue on the basis of their own interests like other groups, THEN perhaps you would be right. As things stand today, however, the whole issue has been made toxic by THE STANDARD.
Once again, if we could only stop our Jewish elites from relitigating World War 2 with Middle America and the rest of Europe, it would solve so many of our problems. It would be Okay To Be White. It would be Okay To Be Southern. It would be Okay To Be Chinese.
I’ve got a lot of hope for Andrew Yang because he is Taiwanese and likely remembers the ordeal that China went through under Mao’s Cultural Revolution before the Chinese realized how retarded that whole episode of their history had been and decided to go get rich.
“You are wrong: diversity does not mean ‘less white people.’ Diversity is natural and accepting diversity means creating room for immigrants, much like your grandparents and great-grandparents, regardless of their creed, colour or ethnicity.”
Do you see how a White person might call bullshit on this? I’m told that I am supposed to celebrate transsexuals in my culture, but my own heritage is shameful.
Now, as a populist with social conservative and authoritarian tendencies, how do I respond to this? Well, I responded to it by voting for Donald Trump, which I now believe was a mistake. How on earth is it that innocuous phrases like “It’s Okay to Be White” or “All Lives Matter” have become toxic? Do the lives of White people in Europe and America have any value at all under political correctness?
“No, white people are not ‘being blamed for all the world’s problems.’ But it would be absurd to deny that nations have exploited nations on the basis of race, religion and ethnicity.”
Have you read The New York Times lately? I can assure you this is how it comes across. In fact, they recently hired a woman who hates White people named Sarah Jeong and refused to see why people like us are so tired of being lectured about “racism” by hypocrites.
“Nobody can say ‘you’re racist for celebrating your heritage.’ But I will say you are racist if you do not allow others to celebrate theirs.”
I went to Charlottesville in August 2017 because some people there wanted to tear down statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. When I was growing up, I was taught these men were two of the South’s greatest heroes. Now, I am just labeled a “racist” and an “extremist” for believing those statues should be left alone like the majority of Virginia voters!
I don’t care if you celebrate your heritage. As a social conservative, I wish people were more in tune with their ethnic and cultural roots like they are in Asia and weren’t so deracinated like they are under late capitalism in the United States and other European countries.
“Yes, I am disgusted by the ‘garbage’ on television as well as on — you forgot — social media. Abuse of social media is fanning hate and I am told there are over 100 hate groups in Canada alone.”
It’s true there is a lot of hate on social media.
Do you want it to go away? If you simply dump political correctness, much of that toxicity will be drained out of our culture. Unfortunately, we have lots of unreasonable people in our elites who are aligned with the Far Left who believe in standing like Custer at Little Big Horn over the issue.
“Unlike you, I do see a future for myself and my family. But I would be lying if I did not say that I am really worried about climate change, about the rising hate and violent extremism, and the spreading of anti-immigrant fear.”
Do you see how rapidly changing demographics in Europe and North America and other traditionally White countries MIGHT BE CAUSING the rising hate and violent extremism especially when it is coupled with political correctness? There is another book called Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities by another smart person named Eric Kaufmann who will spell it all out for you and which arrives at the same solution which is to dismantle political correctness.
“To answer ‘When will immigration stop?’: it will stop when powerful countries stop manufacturing phoney wars and forced migration. It will stop when people are allowed to develop their own means of subsistence and do not rely on handouts.”
I OPPOSE THE WARS TOO!
BELIEVE ME, we have learned our lesson from the 20th century. The last thing we want is more wars. We also think Yang needs to get in there in 2020 and explain to the Democrats that the robots are taking over and all their stupid nonsense is unnecessary and counterproductive.
“So as you can see we have some common ground. The difference is that while we both are angry about what’s going on in the world, you have chosen to spread hate and violence and I have chosen to channel my anger in constructive ways.”
I’m not a hateful person, sir. I also dislike war and violence.
It’s true that I believe in the existence of racial differences. Virtually every educated person in the world knows the truth about race and how the cat is going to have to be let out of the bag at some point . Some people like myself just have no time for political correctness. No good serious Lutheran has any time for that nonsense. We’re supposed to stand up for what we believe.
Anyway, I just saw this on the internet and thought I would write back. Someone other than our friend Andrew Anglin who comes across as a bit extreme has to do so!

Voters continue to view illegal immigration as a serious problem but don’t think Democrats want to stop it. Cutting foreign aid is one tool voters are willing to consider.
A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 67% of all Likely U.S. Voters think illegal immigration is a serious problem in America today, with 47% who say it’s a Very Serious one. Thirty-two percent (32%) say it’s not a serious problem, but that includes only eight percent (8%) who rate it as Not At All Serious. (To see survey question wording, click here .)

President Trump ended the week with a tour of a small segment of newly upgraded border wall in Calexico, California.
“Some of it is 30 feet, some of it is 15 feet, some of it is 12 feet, depending on the area. And very, very hard to climb. If you wanna climb that, it’s pretty sharp up on top. If you wanna climb that, you deserve whatever you can get,” Trump said. “It’s called anti-climb. It’s very see-through so you can see the other side, that’s a very important element.”

President Donald Trump spoke today at a border security roundtable in Calexico, California where he explained his “new statement” to illegal immigrants.
“The system is full,” Trump said. “We can’t take you anymore. Whether it’s asylum, whether it’s anything you want, it’s illegal migration, we can’t take you anymore. Our country is full, our area’s full, the sector is full. We can’t take you anymore, I’m sorry, can’t happen. So turn around, that’s the way it is.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I say, and this is our new statement, the system is full. We can’t take you anymore. Whether it is asylum or anything you want, illegal immigration, we can’t take you anymore. Our country is full. Our area is full. The sector is full. We can’t take you anymore. Sorry, can’t happen. So turn around, that’s the way it is. If you look at our southern border, the number of people and the amount of drugs and human trafficking. Human trafficking is something that nobody used to talk about. it’s a terrible thing. It is ancient and it is never been bigger than it is modern. Human trafficking, a terrible thing. They come into these areas where you don’t have the wall. They come into areas where you don’t have the wall. Then they make a left or they make a right nd they come right into the country. Loaded up with people in many cases, and it is pretty sad…
You were mentioning before about people coming in and coming in and they come in. You don’t have to take them in. When your system is packed. When you can not get another person in. When every one of your detention areas is teeming and you have to let people go into a country, they can’t take ’em. You can’t take ’em. We don’t have room. We don’t have room. That means you can’t take them. You understand that? I don’t think anyone has ever expressed it like that, but I’m expressing it like that.
When it’s full, it’s full. You can’t take them.
They go back to Mexico and Mexico will bring them back to their country. Or if they’re Mexican, it’s a step easier, frankly. Over the last four days, Mexico has been very nice. You made a point that was very interesting. If you can’t take them, you can’t take them. There’s nothing you can do, okay?

Conservatives Call for Tech Giants to Split Ties With SPLC,trulyrightview.com,trulymain1,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://trulyrightview.com/2019/04/conservatives-call-for-tech-giants-to-split-ties-with-splc/,"April 6th, 2019 | Add a Comment
Silicon Valley has enormous power over the flow of information that reaches people around the globe.
That’s why it’s vital for Americans to understand how tech giants can manipulate information, either intentionally or unwittingly, to advance a political agenda.
Now, 34 conservative leaders are banding together to call for tech giants Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and Google to “cut ties” with the Southern Poverty Law Center.
The letter states in part, “It is now clear that the SPLC has proven to be a hate-filled, anti-Christian, anti-conservative organization and nothing more than a weapon of the radical Left, whose goal is to bully people into compliance with their ideology.”
As we’ve discussed on previous episodes of “Media Misses,” the SPLC is a far-left civil rights organization that has made wild claims about conservative organizations over the years, lumping them in with hate groups like neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.
It has come under scrutiny after its founder, Morris Dees, resigned over accusations of discrimination and improper behavior.
The issue has garnered the attention of those in Congress as well.
Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called on the IRS to look at the SPLC’s tax exempt status. He wrote in a letter to the agency:
Recent news reports have confirmed the long-established fact that the SPLC regularly engaged in defamation of its political opponents. In fact, the SPLC’s defining characteristic is to fundraise off of defamation.
The question also turns to media outlets as well.
Will they stop using this organization as an authoritative source?
Perhaps a turnaround is coming.
The New Yorker , for instance, recently ran a piece called “The Reckoning of Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center,” and acknowledged that the SPLC has shifted its focus from shedding light on actual, serious extremist groups to exaggerations for the purpose of money making.
And perhaps the media should be more skeptical of other similar groups and flawed studies about rising hate crime that simply fit a narrative they want to push.
As Robby Soave wrote in Reason:
When it comes to misleading hate crime data, the SPLC is far from the only offender. Many in the media have exaggerated a finding by the Anti-Defamation League that anti-Semitic hate has increased 57 percent under Trump. (Bomb threats made by an Israeli teenager were largely responsible for the perceived increase: anti-Semitic assaults actually decreased substantially.) The FBI’s hate crime data has also been widely mischaracterized .
Hopefully, tech giants and media outlets learn a lesson from the SPLC mess and stop using it to malign Americans as a whole.

"Trump, Newsom Clash Over Illegal Immigration as President Visits California Wall Construction",trulyrightview.com,trulymain1,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://trulyrightview.com/2019/04/trump-newsom-clash-over-illegal-immigration-as-president-visits-california-wall-construction/,"April 6th, 2019 | Add a Comment
President Donald Trump was greeted Friday by a friendly crowd of border security officials in California, the state where he has the most political opposition and which has declared itself a “sanctuary state.”
He also toured the site of some border wall construction there.
Trump was briefed by officials from the U.S. Border Patrol in the Calexico, California, station near the border with Mexico.
“We expect to have close to 400 miles [of wall] done within two years from now. That’s a lot,” Trump said. “We love California. But those people wanted us to build a wall, and we got it built, including wall in San Diego, which is pretty much completed. It’s had a tremendous impact. The wall has had a tremendous impact.”
Trump said the country is “full” and insisted the immigration asylum laws must be changed.
“We have a system that is full. It’s just full. … There’s nothing we can do about it,” the president said. “ … The system is full. When it’s full, there’s nothing you can do. You have to say, ‘I’m sorry. We can’t take you.’”
California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized Trump’s call for changing the laws on asylum.
“Since our founding, this country has been a place of refuge—a safe haven for people fleeing tyranny, oppression, and violence,” Newsom said in a statement . “His words show a total disregard of the Constitution, our justice system, and what it means to be an American.”
Trump said the governor is out of touch with the security situation at the border.
“Gov. Newsom is honestly living in a different world, and that’s a very dangerous world he’s living in, and if he keeps living there, it’s lots of problems for the people of California. They don’t want that,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question.
“They want to be secure. They want to be safe, and not only asylum, but many other things. … When you have an asylum situation where rough, tough people with criminal records are asking for asylum, it doesn’t work that way.”
Trump declared a national emergency after Congress failed to provide full funding for the border wall. California is among 20 states suing to block the emergency declaration.
While later speaking in front of the wall, the president described it as an “anti-climb” wall. The newly constructed wall is see-through, and some portions are 30 feet tall.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection engaged in more than 100,000 border enforcement actions in March, the most actions in a single month in more than a decade, according to a White House statement.
That represented a 516% increase from enforcement actions in March 2017. Of the actions in March, 64% involved unaccompanied illegal immigrant children and family units. In February, 75,000 migrants were apprehended or deemed inadmissible at the border.
Trump said he doesn’t want to shut down the border, but said it only “would take a day” to do so.
“We’re going to shut it down if we have to,” he said.

The Brexit Shambles Stumbles On,trulyrightview.com,trulymain1,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://trulyrightview.com/2019/04/the-brexit-shambles-stumbles-on/,"April 6th, 2019 | Add a Comment
On Wednesday, the House of Commons finally reached a majority on a Brexit issue, but only by one vote.
This wasn’t a government proposal; it was a parliamentary rebellion to prevent a “no deal exit” and to require an extension to the planned leave date.
The Conservative leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, later wrote, “If these people had guns, we would be describing it as a military coup.”
The private member’s bill was introduced by former Labour minister Yvette Cooper and Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, and was rushed through at warp speed.
While laws normally take weeks, even months, to pass, this one took just six hours.
A brave minority in the House of Lords then succeeded in delaying its next stage, but it is still likely to get royal assent early next week.
This was a panic move designed to prevent Britain “falling off a cliff edge,” “facing the abyss,” or “crashing out,” as leaving on World Trade Organization terms is pejoratively referred to.
Yet this outcome only exists because Parliament planned it that way in its EU Withdrawal Bill passed in 2017. So, these MPs were legislating to save the nation from one of their own decisions.
The threat of leaving without a deal was intended as a bargaining chip to get the best terms from the EU—“no deal is better than a bad deal.” But the people who were most scared by it turned out to be British MPs and hence their rush to block it, not that their new bill means much as the EU can override U.K. law.
Indeed, as we reach the Brexit end game, there has been a complete role reversal with the EU now using the “no deal exit” date to threaten the U.K. Parliament into accepting Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal.
If a no-deal exit does happen, it will be by accident, as neither side wants it—although they may not be able to avoid it if they cannot arrange an alternative in time.
A group called the English Democrats claims that Britain has in fact already left the EU, as it says there was no legal basis in U.K. law for changing the original March 29 default exit date. It has taken it to the High Court and is waiting for the case to be heard.
Imagine the shock and utter chaos if it wins? Unlikely, but in order to change the April 12 leave date, MPs rushed to change the law, and this didn’t happen before the original March 29 date was moved. Instead, it was decided in Brussels by May and the EU.
The prime minister has likely never read U.S. President Donald Trump’s “The Art of the Deal,” for she is not a negotiator, but an administrator who seeks an orderly exit above all else. So orderly that it doesn’t appear to be much of an exit to most leavers. But that may have been “Remainer” May’s intention all along.
The prime minister is now looking to Labour support to get her expensive withdrawal agreement passed on a fourth attempt, but faces mass resignations if she concedes too much to extreme left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
And, even then, can her deal pass? Although the margin of defeat has reduced in each previous vote, from 230 to 149 to 58, it is still a very large gap to close.
The clamour now from many MPs is for a “confirmatory vote,” or a second referendum, as it used to be called. While EU Council President Donald Tusk is touting a flexible extension of a year’s delay to Brexit, or until a deal is passed.
The referendum was supposed to take sovereignty back from unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and return it to Parliament. Not an unreasonable request, and just imagine the reaction in the U.S. if NAFTA had been set up with law-making supremacy over Capitol Hill?
Yet, ever since the Brexit decision was declared nearly three years ago, most of this current crop of legislators have not wanted to take on that extra burden of responsibility.
The U.K. is facing a bizarre situation where the public votes to bring back powers to Parliament and its elected officials then vote to try to stop it from happening.

Chicago to Sue Smollett After He Refuses to Pay Investigation Costs,trulyrightview.com,trulymain1,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://trulyrightview.com/2019/04/chicago-to-sue-smollett-after-he-refuses-to-pay-investigation-costs/,"April 6th, 2019 | Add a Comment
The Chicago Department of Law said Thursday it will sue Jussie Smollett after it said the actor “refused to reimburse” the city for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his allegedly staged hate crime in January.
“The Law Department will file the suit in the near future. As part of this legal action, the Law Department will pursue the full measure of damages allowed under the ordinance,” Chicago Department of Law spokesperson Bill McCaffrey said in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation.
Chicago threatened to prosecute Smollett, 36, for making a false statement in a letter on March 28 to his attorneys if he didn’t pay the city $130,000 within seven days.
“[Y]ou made a police report in which you falsely claimed that two men had attacked you while yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The Chicago Police Department conducted an extensive investigation into this report,” the letter stated. “Over two dozen detectives and police officers participated in the investigation, ultimately spending weeks investigating the false claims, including a substantial number of overtime hours.” Smollett case takes another twist. City of Chicago sends letter demanding $130K in reimbursement for police overtime:
“Please submit a money order or certified cashier’s check payable to ‘City of Chicago’ … within seven days of the date of this letter.” pic.twitter.com/qQd1Iz0hJw
— Andrea Berry (@andreacberry) March 28, 2019
Chicago is following through on its threat. The Law Department said it will file its civil complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
Smollett had faced 16 charges for allegedly filing a false police report claiming that two individuals attacked him on the street with a chemical substance and a noose.
Prosecutors abruptly dropped the “Empire” actor’s charges in late March, citing the actor’s prior community service and his agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bail to the city of Chicago.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the actor’s $10,000 bond “doesn’t even come close to what the city spent in resources” investigating Smollett’s alleged hoax.
Smollett’s community service consisted primarily of two days worth of volunteer service in March with the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a nonprofit group Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. founded.

40 Facts That Prove That America’s Moral Collapse Is Spinning Wildly Out Of Control,trulyrightview.com,trulymain1,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://trulyrightview.com/2019/04/40-facts-that-prove-that-americas-moral-collapse-is-spinning-wildly-out-of-control/,"April 6th, 2019 | Add a Comment
According to a brand new survey that was just conducted by the Pew Research Center , 77 percent of all Americans are either “very worried” or “fairly worried” about America’s moral health. Of course the truth is that we should all be deeply concerned, because we can see evidence of the cancerous moral decay that is eating away at the foundations of our society all around us. In life, each one of us gets to make choices, and some of those choices can lead to very bad outcomes. We all have old friends that “got on the wrong path”, and their lives ended up becoming cautionary tales. Well, the same principle applies to nations as a whole. America has been given very clear choices between good and evil, life and death, blessings and curses over and over again, and we have consistently made the wrong choices. If we stay on this road, there is only one result that will be possible.
As long as we are drawing breath, there is always an opportunity to turn things around . That is true for individuals, and it is also true for our entire nation. But if we continue running toward evil, it is only a matter of time before exceedingly painful consequences overtake us.
The following are 40 facts that prove that America’s moral collapse is spinning wildly out of control…
#1 America has killed more than 60 million children since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. The federal government endorses this activity by heavily funding the country’s leading abortion provider, and after that abortion provider harvests the organs of the dead children, the federal government also heavily funds the research that is conducted on those harvested organs.
#2 According to a Quinnipiac University poll from last year, 63 percent of all Americans want to keep Roe v. Wade in place.
#3 America is a global leader in sexual depravity. If you doubt this, just check out what is going on in Cleveland at the end of this month.
#4 Americans are now more likely to die from an opioid overdose than they are from a car accident.
#5 In the city of Baltimore, approximately one out of every four babies is born as an opioid addict.
#6 Overdosing on drugs has now become the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.
#7 McDonalds feeds approximately 70 million people a day globally. Pornhub gets more than 78 million visits a day.
#8 The teen birth rate in the United States is higher “than in any other industrialized country in the world” .
#9 According to the CDC , approximately 110 million Americans have a sexually-transmitted disease right now.
#10 The CDC also tells us that there are approximately 20 million new sexually transmitted disease cases in the U.S. every single year.
#11 The number of married couples with children in the U.S. just reached a 56 year low .
#12 According to the United Nations Population Fund, 40 percent of all births in the U.S. now happen outside of marriage. But if you go back to 1970, that figure was sitting at just 10 percent.
#13 At this point, approximately one out of every three children in the United States lives in a home without a father.
#14 Approximately one-fourth of the entire global prison population is in the United States.
#15 By the time an American child reaches the age of 18, that child will have seen approximately 40,000 murders on television.
#16 According to a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic, nearly 70 percent of all Americans are on at least one prescription drug. An astounding 20 percent of all Americans are on at least five prescription drugs.
#17 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, doctors in the United States write more than 250 million prescriptions for antidepressants each year.
#18 Over half a million people are homeless in the United States right now, but more cities than ever are passing laws making it illegal to feed them .
#19 One recent study found that the average American spends 86 hours a month on a cell phone.
#20 A different study found that one-third of all American teenagers haven’t read a single book in the past year .
#21 Americans are obsessed with material things and are willing to go deep into debt to get what they want. At this point, 480 million credit cards are in circulation in this country. That number has risen by nearly 13 percent since 2015.
#22 37 million credit card accounts in the U.S. are “seriously delinquent” at this moment.
#23 According to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately two-thirds of all Americans in the 15 to 24-year-old age bracket have engaged in oral sex.
#24 It has been reported that one out of every four teen girls in the U.S. has at least one sexually transmitted disease.
#25 It has been estimated that 30 percent of all Internet traffic now goes to adult websites.
#26 According to the Pentagon, 71 percent of our young adults are ineligible to serve in the U.S. military because they are either too dumb, too fat or have a criminal background.
#27 The city of San Francisco handed out a total of 5.8 million free syringes to drug addicts in 2018.
#28 During one seven day stretch last summer, a total of 16,000 official complaints were submitted to the city of San Francisco about piles of human feces littering the streets.
#29 When you include unfunded liabilities, the true size of our national debt is 222 trillion dollars . What we are doing to future generations of Americans is beyond criminal.
#30 The suicide rate in the United States is up 34 percent since the year 2000.
#31 Suicide is now the second leading cause of death for Americans from age 15 to age 24.
#32 We are literally destroying the planet that we have been given. It is being projected that the total amount of plastic in the oceans of the world will exceed the total weight of all fish by the year 2050 .
#33 There are more than 850,000 registered sex offenders in the United States today.
#34 The number of American babies killed by abortion each year is roughly equal to the number of U.S. military deaths that have occurred in all of the wars that the United States has ever been involved in combined.
#35 About one-third of all American women will have had an abortion by the age of 45.
#36 Approximately 3,000 Americans lost their lives as a result of the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on 9/11 . Every single day, more than 3,000 American babies are killed by abortion when you include all forms of abortion.
#37 One very shocking study found that 86 percent of all abortions are done for the sake of convenience.
#38 An average of more than 100 churches are dying in the United States every single week .
#39 Only about 27 percent of all U.S. Millennials currently attend church on a regular basis.
#40 The number of Americans with “no religion” has increased by 266 percent over the last three decades.

Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. 4/5/19 The Trump administration's plans to add a hotly contested citizenship question to the 2020 census have suffered another major blow in the courts. The question asks, ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"" A third federal judge has found the decision to include it on forms for the national head count to be unlawful. ""The unreasonableness of Defendants' addition of a citizenship question to the Census is underscored by the lack of any genuine need for the citizenship question, the woefully deficient process that led to it, the mysterious and potentially improper political considerations that motivated the decision and the clear pretext offered to the public,"" wrote U.S. District Judge George Hazel of Maryland in a 119-page opinion released Friday. Hazel concluded that the decision by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, to add the question violated administrative law. Federal judges in New York and California previously came to the same conclusion. Similar to the earlier ruling in California, the judge also found that including the question would be unconstitutional because, at a time of increased immigration enforcement and anti-immigrant rhetoric, it hinders the government's ability to count every person living in the U.S. once a decade as the Constitution requires. The Trump administration has insisted that the Justice Department wants responses to the question to better enforce a part of the Voting Rights Act that protects racial and language minorities against discrimination. In his opinion, however, Hazel found that the administration ""manufactured"" that reasoning. A Supreme Court hearing about whether including the question is constitutional and about the New York ruling, which has already blocked the citizenship question, is scheduled to be held on April 23, and the justices are expected to rule by June on whether the 2020 census will ultimately include the question. Three different courts have ruled that the underlying intent of the Commerce Dept. citizenship question is to intimidate/undercount Hispanic persons that may be in the US either legally or illegally. The US Constitution instructs the government to count ""persons"" in the US every decade rather than US citizens."

Pavone: New Films Underscore Similarities in Abortion Conversions Unplanned/Facebook FR. FRANK PAVONE 6 Apr 2019 A new series of films and documentaries highlight the remarkable similarities in the dynamics at work in the conversion of abortion practitioners to the pro-life cause. Abby Johnson ( Unplanned ) and Dr. Bernard Nathanson ( Roe v. Wade ) , the principal characters in those movies, as well as Norma McCorvey, the “Jane Roe” of Roe v. Wade , experienced this conversion, and I worked with all three of them personally on their journeys, as well as with many others over the years.
A primary dynamic in all these journeys is that when we see what abortion is , we are more inclined to reject it. Where abortion continues to receive support, it does so in so far as it remains hidden.
The tagline for Unplanned says, “What she saw changed everything.” And the same can be said for Dr. Nathanson and for Norma McCorvey.
“For all the millions spent on public relations, the abortion movement has yet to invent rhetoric powerful enough to blind abortion clinic workers from the truth,” McCorvey wrote . “You see the body parts, you hear the women’s cries, and you can’t keep lying to yourself.”
Yet another dynamic worth noting in these conversions is an increasingly clear dissonance between what they thought about their mission and what they saw in both the pro-abortion and pro-life movements, and specifically in the activists on both sides with whom they rubbed shoulders.
When Abby was a volunteer escort-in-training at the clinic she eventually ran, she was being trained on how to keep the clients, who were just arriving for their scheduled abortions, away from the pro-life sidewalk counselors who were trying to dissuade them from going into the clinic.
Abby noticed her trainer take a client away from the pro-life counselors after that client had accepted the literature the pro-life counselors had given her.
“She didn’t look like she felt harassed to me,” Abby wrote . “Clearly, she’d chosen to talk to the pro-lifer… I felt confused. That client had looked truly interested in the information from the pro-lifer. If we are pro-choice, I thought, then we believe in women making their own choices, right?”
The dissonance began. And it led to a curiosity about the pro-life activists.
“Who are these people?,” Abby asked about the pro-lifers. “Why are they here so early on a Tuesday morning, and what do they think they are going to accomplish?”
Dr. Bernard Nathanson wrote about a similar dynamic in his journey. Seeing the pro-life people decades earlier in the same setting outside an abortion clinic, he wrote , “I wondered: how can these people give of themselves for a constituency that is (and always will be) mute, invisible, and unable to thank them? … I began seriously to question what indescribable Force generated them to this activity.”
He, like Abby, was intrigued. He was beginning to process the evidence that maybe the pro-life people weren’t the uncaring monsters that the pro-abortion movement painted them to be.
Dr. Nathanson explained later that the love with which pro-life people treated him was what broke the shell of his atheism.
Norma McCorvey, as she explains in her book Won by Love, experienced the surprising love of the pro-life people — even of those who protested her — in a similar way. Rev. Flip Benham who, like Norma, has been a great friend and colleague of mine in this movement, headed up Operation Rescue and moved into the office right next to “A Choice for Women,” the Dallas abortion mill where Norma was working.
He protested there as he had protested at events in the past where Norma appeared when she was representing the pro-abortion side.
But he also approached her personally, one-on-one, and even apologized one day for some harsh words he had publicly directed at her on a previous occasion.
That got her attention. And he began telling her of his own shortcomings.
Norma wrote that she began asking herself, “Why is this man being so nice to me and telling me his innermost secrets?” The kindness and respect that Flip and the rest of the Operation Rescue team showed her helped her to understand what we mean by the sanctity of every human life.
Flip eventually had the joy of baptizing Norma in 1995, and I had the joy of receiving her into the Catholic Church three years later.
The journeys of these three individuals, recounted in these three books and now on film as well, give us a simple lesson: When we show abortion supporters who we really are, as individuals and as a movement, it is attractive. It breaks the negative stereotypes, and it conveys that we who reject abortion do not reject those who support abortion.
They are not the enemy; they are captive to the enemy.
And we want to free them.

The fossil fuel industry has benefited from market-distorting incentives for decades by 0 Comments

Last month’s vote in the Senate on a Green New Deal resolution was a waste of time, an attempt by the Republican leadership to jockey Democrats into a supposedly embarrassing vote that nearly all of them in the end sidestepped by voting “present.” But the exercise did show how some politicians intend to signal support for addressing climate change without embracing the systemic changes the Green New Deal demands.
Welcome to the world of realistic solutions.
They were touted during Senate debate on the Green New Deal by people like Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who usually caucuses with the Democrats. He voted no on the resolution, sponsored by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), because, he said, the policy focus should be to “increase investments in green energy—including research and development—to create price parity with carbon.” Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona issued a statement after the vote saying we should “address a changing climate with realistic, achievable solutions.” Republicans who wanted to rhetorically distance themselves from the climate-change deniers to their right made similar statements.
If Senate Democrats that day weren’t preoccupied with denouncing Republican political gamesmanship, you would have likely heard even more evidence of a strong Democratic “realistic solutions” caucus. It would sound like the New Democrat Coalition call for “market-driven climate initiatives that carry political weight,” such as a cap-and-trade system that allows corporations to buy the right to pollute, or the viral confrontation Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) had with a group of children from the Sunrise Movement, during which she indicated support for “real, meaningful climate change legislation” but declared the Green New Deal “will not pass the Senate, and you can take that back to whoever sent you here and tell them.”
The world of “realistic solutions” to climate change revolves around the sun of the free market. Their success depends on getting the cost of renewable energy resources below that of fossil fuels, in part through incentives and investment in renewables and technological innovation.
The problem is that the energy market is not a free market.
The fossil fuel industry has benefited from market-distorting incentives for decades. That starts with the familiar breaks and subsidies in the tax code, which alone are estimated to have enabled almost half of the U.S. discovered oil fields to be economically viable . There are also numerous “hidden” incentives, such as the below-market-value royalties and lease contracts (which for the coal industry have cost taxpayers an estimated $30 billion over 30 years ) and the research and development investments on such projects as carbon capture and sequestration, (designed to enable fossil fuel companies to keep extracting oil but which critics have said would not become feasible in time to meet generally accepted global warming targets). Add to those the well-known “externalities”—costs related to fossil fuel activities that aren’t paid by companies but rather by individuals and governments in the form of hospital bills, contamination sites, and extreme weather events, just to name a few.
The industry also benefits from the very fact that American power infrastructure, such as transmission and distribution grids, is built around centralized fossil fuel sources, not decentralized sources such as solar and wind. The same is true for existing fossil fuel generation facilities, for which investments are often made based on a three-decade return expectation. Early retirement of these facilities would be seen as a missed earning opportunity (even if that means ignoring sunk costs just to cover the marginal cost of production). Finally, we cannot ignore how CEO compensation at the energy majors is structured to promote increased fossil fuel production and does not generally incentivize the expansion of renewables.
When the supply and demand curve seems to start working in favor of renewables, the Trump administration has intervened in the market to protect the fossil-fuel industry’s profit potential. In just the past year, the administration sought to allow power plants to pass onto consumers the full operating costs of their plants if they have at least a 90-day supply of fuel available (a standard that can only be met by coal and nuclear plants and would keep inefficient plants from shutting down), use a Cold War statute to offer loans or purchase commitments to help failing generation facilities (again supporting coal), and is proposing to offer leases for new offshore oil drilling sites “ under favorable terms that will be difficult for future presidents to revoke or rewrite ”—or future markets to correct.
Even setting aside the slanting of the market in favor of fossil fuels, there is no historical evidence that the free market can solve the climate crisis on its own—and certainly not within the 11-year timeframe called for by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 2017, the U.S. invested around $40.5 billion in renewables but it was still the world’s top oil and gas producer, surpassing traditional oil countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. And this is not unique to the United States. As the International Energy Agency explained in its 2017 Global Energy & CO2 report , even with renewables enjoying the “highest growth rate of any sources,” fossil fuel remains for more than three decades a flat 81 percent of the global energy mix.
The general public might not know these details, but it is hard to imagine that members of Congress aren’t aware of the not-free market in energy; many of the free market flaws were enabled through congressional legislation in the first place. So instead of “realistic solutions” based on a free-market fantasy, how about grappling with what’s really real: the need, for the sake of the planet, to dismantle the system that encourages profiting from fossil fuel extraction. That means ending fossil fuels incentives, leases, licenses, and financing, but it also means rethinking the way we own, control, and structure our society and institutions so we are no longer reinforcing an extractive political economy.

Clyburn responded, “There’s no question in my mind about that. I think that is what is feared by the people who are now beginning to speak out in some form or another.”
Reid then asked, “Do you suspect that he’s withholding damaging information that’s in the Mueller report in order to protect Donald Trump?”
Clyburn answered, “That’s my suspicion.”
