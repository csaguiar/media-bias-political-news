Omar al-Bashir: Sudanese President Must Face Justice for Genocides | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Nina Shea,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/sudans-bashir-must-face-justice-for-his-genocides/,"April 12, 2019 2:35 PM Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir delivers a speech inside Parliament in Khartoum, Sudan, April 1, 2019. (Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/Reuters) One of the world’s most brutal dictators has just fallen. What comes next is key.
S udan’s long-time president, Omar al Bashir — among the world’s most ruthless rulers — was arrested yesterday in a military coup that followed four months of popular protests in Khartoum, the country’s capital. Whatever other charges he will face for terror and corruption, he should be promptly tried for his worst offense: genocide.
In 70 years since the adoption of the U.N.’s Genocide Convention, only two genocides have been officially recognized by the U.S. government while they were still occurring. The first was the Bashir regime’s genocide in the western Darfur region. In mid 2004, a few months after the Darfur conflict began and a few months before the Bush administration recognized the genocide, the State Department dispatched a team to refugee camps across the border in Chad. The team interviewed survivors from the Muslim Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribes, which were targeted for extermination.
A preeminent expert in the field, Gregory Stanton, summarized the “shocking” survey results:
Over 60 percent of the people interviewed had witnessed the killing of a family member. Two-thirds had witnessed the killing of a non-family member. Over 80 percent had witnessed destruction of a village. Two-thirds had witnessed aerial bombing of villages by the Sudanese government. And perhaps most chillingly, one-third had heard racial epithets used while they or their relatives were being murdered or raped. Assailants often shouted, “Kill the slaves” and “We have orders to kill all the blacks.”
The survey’s findings convinced the administration to declare the Bashir regime’s campaign in Darfur a racially motivated genocide. All told, the State Department estimates that over 300,000 tribesmen have died in in the region, and hundreds of thousands remain displaced today.
Despite an arrest warrant for genocide issued against him by the International Criminal Court in 2010, Bashir remained president and protected from prosecution. He continued to receive crucial diplomatic and financial support from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, Russia, South Africa, China, and the Arab League, among others.
As I wrote 15 years ago in these pages, Darfur should be counted as Bashir’s second genocide. He waged the first from the early 1990s to 2002, against the Christians and animists of southern Sudan and the people of the Nuba Mountains. That bloody campaign was undertaken in response to a rebellion against the forcible imposition of sharia law, which violated guarantees of southern autonomy included in the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement. Though the Nuba are mostly Muslim, they resisted Bashir’s call to jihad against the south and were consequently declared “apostates,” marked for death along with non-Muslims, in a 1993 government fatwa.

Over 2 million eventually perished and 5 million were displaced as a result. Bashir used, as he would again in Darfur, a combination of military and militia tactics, inflicting deliberate mass starvation and sanctioning widespread rape, enslavement, and bombing and strafing of hospitals, schools, and other civilian structures. It ended in 2005 with the Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement (SCPA). Its traumatic legacy lives on in the unending conflict and political dysfunction of South Sudan, which became an independent country under the terms of the SCPA.
For 30 years, Bashir led a military dictatorship bent on forcibly Islamicizing and Arabizing Sudan’s disparate tribes and religious groups. His regime carried out amputations, stonings, and other harsh punishments for such offenses as women wearing pants instead of skirts, the consumption of alcohol, adultery, homosexuality, and apostasy and blasphemy against Islam.

The proposal was reportedly considered by the White House twice before, first in November as a caravan traveled north toward the border, and again in February as Democrats butted heads with Trump over funding for his long-promised border wall. It was said to have ultimately been rejected by DHS lawyers, who argued that it would violate the law. But after a purge of DHS leadership this week that Trump said was designed to make the department “tougher” on immigration, he abruptly changed course Friday, reviving the idea. "

I used to laugh every time I heard someone like Elon Musk say that we are living in a Matrix -like simulation. These days, not so much.
Don’t call the funny farm just yet. On the major question of the nature of sense experience, I remain with Aristotle and against Bishop Berkeley. Matter is real. But there is also the question of how we perceive “the news”; how established media institutions present and frame information; how we are supposed to respond to the “takes” purportedly expert and knowledgeable voices serve up to us by the second on social media. And here, I’m skeptical. Advertisement Advertisement
It’s hard not to be. Think of the headlines we’ve encountered since the beginning of this year. We were told the Covington Catholic boys were smug racist Trump supporters on the basis of a snippet of video. A young man, a private citizen, whose only offense was traveling to Washington, D.C., to march for life, was transformed at light speed into a symbol of hate and systemic oppression. However, just as Nick Sandmann’s reputation as a villain was about to set in stone, additional videos revealed that the students’ encounter with a far-left American Indian activist and the Black Hebrew Israelites was far more complicated than initially reported. The Covington Catholic boys had been smeared. People who cast themselves as agents of professional knowledge, expertise, and moral authority had circulated and amplified a lie in the service of a political agenda. Not for the first nor last time.
We were told Jussie Smollett, a rising gay African-American actor and singer, had been the victim of a hate crime committed by MAGA-hat-wearing Trump supporters in the dead cold of a Chicago night. Journalists and bloggers who asked questions about Smollett’s story were decried as bigots, even as key details went missing and the shifting timeline became more and more curious. Then the city’s African-American police commissioner announced Smollett had been arrested for orchestrating a bizarre hoax. The state’s attorney filed charges — charges subsequently dropped after behind-the-scenes lobbying by Michelle Obama’s former chief of staff. Advertisement
We were told that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin were in cahoots to hack the emails of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign; that Trump might have been a Russian agent since the late 1980s; that the key to the conspiracy might be a server in Trump Tower relaying information to a Russian bank; that the indictment of Donald Trump Jr. was imminent; that Trump Sr., according to the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, had committed “treason”; that Michael Cohen had met with Russian intelligence operatives in Prague; that Trump had directed Michael Flynn to speak to the Russians prior to Election Day 2016; that Trump had instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress; that Paul Manafort had met with Julian Assange in the Ecuadoran embassy in London during the campaign; that secret indictments in an Alexandria courthouse would be unsealed on the day Robert Mueller filed his report on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. None of it happened. Advertisement
We were told that Michael Avenatti, a trial attorney who appeared seemingly out of nowhere to represent Stephanie Cliffords, a.k.a “Stormy Daniels,” in her (tossed-out) defamation suit against Donald Trump, was a defender of the rule of law and election integrity who posed, in the words of Stephen Colbert, an “existential threat” to the Trump presidency. Avenatti appeared incessantly on cable news, earning the equivalent of $175 million in media exposure between March and May 2018. Last September, an article in Politico Magazine carried the headline, “Michael Avenatti Is Winning the 2020 Democratic Primary.” When Avenatti said he represented a client who had been a victim of gang rapes and druggings at parties attended by Brett Kavanaugh during high school, NBC News interviewed the client despite being unable to verify her (ludicrous) accusation. By last November, when he was arrested for domestic assault in Los Angeles, Avenatti had appeared on television more than 200 times in the space of eight months. Advertisement
On the morning I wrote this column, a federal grand jury indicted Avenatti on 36 counts, including fraud. “Defendant AVENATTI would embezzle and misappropriate settlement proceeds to which he was not entitled,” reads just one sentence of the mind-boggling 61-page indictment. What media authorities had presented as true — that Avenatti was a serious attorney whose evidence would destroy the Trump presidency — has been revealed, once again, as utterly fallacious, a con. It’s up to the jury to decide if Michael Avenatti is a criminal. What’s beyond dispute, has been for a while, is that he is an unserious person, out for attention, celebrity, the notoriety and status fame brings. In the months of his ascendance, however, cable anchors and journalists did their best to avoid or downplay the truth of Avenatti’s character, lest it distract from their attack on the president’s.

National Gallery’s Tintoretto Show Falls Short | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Brian T. Allen,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/tintoretto-art-show-national-gallery/,"April 13, 2019 4:30 AM The Abduction of Helen , c. 1576/1577, by Jacopo Tintoretto. Oil on canvas. (Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid © Museo Nacional del Prado) There are a few great works on offer, but most of his masterpieces didn’t make the trip.
I thought very carefully about how to review the National Gallery’s messy new Tintoretto show. I respect everyone involved and wrote two pieces about the show’s majestic incarnation in Venice earlier this year, mounted in honor of his 500th birthday. The show in Washington is the first Tintoretto retrospective in America. It’s really not a retrospective, though, unless we’ve invented a new genre of show called “retrospective lite.” Now, the Venice version? That was a real retrospective. The problem with the Washington? It doesn’t do justice to Tintoretto. Advertisement
What is a retrospective? Traditionally, it’s a big, lumbering thing assembling an artist’s best work over his entire career. It captures the artist’s spirit, depth, and genius and has almost all the seminal things and his best work. It is usually accompanied by new scholarship, but it’s also historiographical. How has the artist’s reputation evolved, and why are we fascinated by him now?
In one of my pieces on the Venice show, I questioned whether a truly satisfying Tintoretto retrospective could occur outside Venice and speculated that this might not be possible, though the National Gallery was the one to try. It has borrowing power and tons of money. After seeing the show in Washington, the answer is not only “they couldn’t” but also to note that what they might have been able to do, they didn’t. Advertisement
There are some core questions before a retrospective is undertaken. Is the art available? There are some artists — Michelangelo and Pinturicchio immediately spring to mind — whose iconic, seminal works are stationary. They might be tombs, and some of Michelangelo’s best work is funerary. You don’t discommode the dead willy-nilly. And don’t think about the Sistine Ceiling. It’s fresco, as are Pinturicchio’s cinematic library paintings in the Duomo in Siena. Architects, too, get the short end of the stick. Buildings don’t travel. The great park designer Frederic Law Olmsted’s 200th birthday is next year. He’s a great artist, but how do you do a show when the work is land, views, water, and flowers?
You can do shows on aspects of these artists, like the Met’s splendid show on Michelangelo’s drawings. You call this show a “drawings retrospective.” That’s fine. It was a great retrospective, with close to 300 drawings and covering all bases. Most very fine artists don’t deserve any kind of retrospective. They’ve had good decades or even only a few good years and then run out of gas or become hacks doing only what the art market wants. Andy Warhol, as we saw in the recent Whitney retrospective, was truly transformative only in the 1960s. The curator spilled gallons of ink and exposed us to some dreadful art in an effort to establish that the junk he did from his Chairman Mao in 1972 until he died in 1987 wasn’t junk. Curators doing retrospectives often get that giddy, that blinkered. Advertisement Advertisement
Retrospectives don’t need to be huge, but they need to be comprehensive, which is different from representative. I did a Mark Tobey retrospective with 90 objects. That was enough. I was involved in an Alfred Maurer retrospective, to my regret. The show was too big, and it merely established what a very spotty artist he was.
What do you do under any of these circumstances? You don’t do the retrospective. Or you focus on a narrower topic. Or you work on another artist. Advertisement
I don’t think a retrospective on Tintoretto could be done without work from the Scuola San Rocco, the Doge’s Palace, and his parish church (the church of the Madonna dell’Orto) — all in Venice. For many reasons, this work doesn’t travel, not that it physically can’t, but it’s not practical. San Rocco was his anchor commission, his Sistine Chapel, with dozens of paintings and an encyclopedic array of his quirks, tricks, and talents at their finest. I assume the masters at San Rocco look at each of the great ones as part of an indivisible whole.
To its credit, the National Gallery got two minor pictures from this cycle only because they’d just been cleaned and had been in conservation, thus gone, for a while. Their brushy, billboard quality merely makes us want to see more, and want to see the highlights of what is one of the great monuments of Western art.
The Doge’s Palace reception rooms have his big, late work. It’s not his best, and there were often hands other than his involved. At that point, Tintoretto had, through his grit and vision, built Tintoretto, Inc., both a workshop and a reputation as Venice’s high-end artist. This would not have been predicted given his disputatious persona, lone-wolf mentality, Titian’s subversion of his career, and competition from Veronese. These late things are the final fruits of his labor. They’re noisy, even frantic, and important. They’re also huge. They’d need a cargo plane to move and giant spaces for display. Madonna dell’Orto contains Tintoretto’s three massive paintings of Moses, the Crucifixion, and the Presentation at the Temple. They cemented his fame. These, too, are enormous. Two are 50 feet tall.

The retrospective in Venice worked for reasons distinct to Venice and Italy. First, it was marketed as a Tintoretto extravaganza. It was assumed that serious people — and this is not merely a tiny fraction of people traveling to Venice — would also get to one, two, or all three of these outlying places. The staterooms of the Doge’s Palace with their in situ Tintorettos were just steps away from the show. Many of the visitors who saw the show were Italians and from Venice or the Veneto. Yes, there are still Italians who live in Venice, and Venice has suburbs on the mainland. The extravaganza was for them, too, and it’s easy for them to cover the spots over time.
Tintoretto’s birthday extravaganza, at least the traveling-loan part of it, was actually at two separate museums. The early work was displayed at the Accademia across town. It was a big, serious show that I thought was more coherent, satisfying, and beautifully displayed than the show of work from the 1550s onward at the Doge’s Palace. The Accademia show concluded with the big picture that made Tintoretto famous, The Miracle of the Slave , from 1548. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The Miracle of the Slave is a showstopper and shows the young Tintoretto as a master designer and choreographer. If there was any way to get it to Washington, it would have, maybe, redeemed this iffy enterprise. The director of the Accademia just retired, but she is a worldly person and so might have allowed it. If it couldn’t get out of the Accademia building, and this is a possibility, then that is a serious reason not to do the show, unless you could have pried things from San Rocco, the Orto church, or the Doge’s Palace.
Second, the extravaganza worked in Venice because it’s Italy. I have seen few important museum shows in Italy that are installed with the same standards as in American or British museums. There’s always some incongruous, even bizarre feature. We expect that and edit it out. Sometimes it’s bad lightening, sometimes it’s weird spaces, sometimes surly or snoring guards, and often it’s haphazard interpretation. Advertisement
You expect, as in the case of Tintoretto, to see a retrospective in two separate museums. You expect to wander to three other places in Venice to see lots of major Tintorettos and a dozen other churches if you’re really committed to see individual altarpieces. The Venice retrospective succeeded because, in terms of marketing and how the curators arranged the shows there, visitors were almost commanded to go the extra mile, literally. Italians expect you to absorb things by osmosis, slowly, in bits and pieces. In Washington, you don’t, can’t, and shouldn’t. You have to do it in one place, with the best work, or don’t do it at all.
There is a self-inflicted, design problem, too. Elsewhere in the National Gallery, tucked away as if by stealth, is a version of the lovely Tintoretto drawings show that I saw at the Morgan Library last year. I found it totally by accident. This drawings show is not well publicized in the main Tintoretto galleries. Why was this show not simply integrated into the Tintoretto show? The only reason I can think for this is that the drawings show, done by another curator at another museum, undercuts one of the big Tintoretto show’s central themes. The big show makes much of Tintoretto’s spontaneity. The Morgan Library’s drawings show tells a story of an exacting, painstaking planner who thought long and hard about design and composition and didn’t simply paint whatever came into his head at a given moment.
Could the shows have been combined? Possibly. Should they have been separated, with one show in the proverbial “undisclosed location?” Of course not. If space was the big issue, my suggestion would have been either to find bigger space, do only the drawings show, or to do nothing but call FTD and send Tintoretto a birthday bouquet.
Some of the borrowed splendors in the Venice shows weren’t in Washington. Susanna and the Elders , surely one of the most gorgeous nudes ever painted, wasn’t there. We know it could travel because it made it to Venice from Vienna. The selection of portraits in the show — Tintoretto’s portraits are almost all owned by public collections — is good. Where was Christ Among the Doctors ? It’s big, early, splendid, from the Duomo’s museum in Milan, and was cleaned just before the Accademia show. It made it to Venice. It has the whiff of juvenilia, but it’s still brilliant, with the very young Tintoretto experimenting with ideas he would soon perfect. Why is St. Martial in Glory from 1549 displayed separately, in a room a football field’s distance from the show, in a separate space? It’s a fine, very big picture, and there are things in the Tintoretto show that are bigger, so it wasn’t a question of low ceilings.
There are great things in the Washington show, to be sure. The portraits are strong, but, for Tintoretto, portraiture was a sideline. The Abduction of Helen from the Prado is there, and it’s fabulous. The Origin of the Milky Way , The Nine Muses , and Tarquin and Lucretia are three great nudes, and while they’re luscious, they make points that have recently been made for American audiences in the MFA Boston’s 2009 show on Tintoretto, Veronese, and Titian.

(© RMN-Grand Palais / Art Resource, NY, Jean Gilles-Berizzi)
The Tintoretto show’s interpretation, graphics, lighting, and wall colors are perfect. The catalogue by Frederick Ilchman and Robert Echols is fine. It covers lots of old ground beautifully, with a new twist or two. It’s an important book. The separate catalogue for the Tintoretto show held at the Accademia was published only in Italian. The National Gallery could have done something meaningful and produced an English-language version of this very good book.
I think the justification of “well, there are some nice Tintorettos in the show” goes only so far. The Prado did a big Tintoretto show ten years ago, with a fine catalogue. I’m not sure the catalogue by Ilchman and Echols adds much to the Tintoretto scholarship there or in the fantastic Boston show on Tintoretto, Titian, and Veronese, which was, after all, an Ilchman and Echols show, too.

Studying Classical Literature in Our Age of Technology | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Howard Butcher,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/classical-literature-study-homer-the-iliad-modern-technology/,"April 13, 2019 4:30 AM Achilles Removing Patroclus’ Body From the Battle , c. 1547, by Léon Davent. (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Is technology killing students’ ability to read classical literature?
C aprock Academy, an academically accelerated charter school in Grand Junction, Colo., has the generous policy of giving every student in literature classes new copies of every text studied. (In neighboring public schools, the books are typically loaned to students and must be returned unmarked.) The intent is that Caprock students, many of whom could not otherwise afford to buy the books, begin to build their own personal libraries of great literature and become lifelong readers. The policy also enables students to annotate the texts. Advertisement Advertisement
Many students cherish the books and take good care of them, but some do not. In the spring, on the last day of school, one can walk down the hall and find discarded texts on the floor by the lockers and crammed in the big trash cans at the end of the hallways. The books are tossed amongst the flotsam and jetsam students have emptied out of their lockers in preparation for summer break. Some have broken spines and torn pages. Other copies are almost in pristine condition. The high-school English teachers call these books “orphans,” and we rescue them from the trash. What is interesting, however, is which books get thrown out.
Caprock Academy offers a classical education, and students are given approximately six books a year in core literature classes. For example, freshmen read The Epic of Gilgamesh , Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey , Sophocles’ Three Theban Plays , Hesiod’s Theogony and Works and Days , and Aeschylus’ Oresteia . They also study Virgil’s Aeneid in Latin I. Advertisement
Although the evidence is anecdotal and fluctuates a bit year to year, certain books appear in the trash with greater regularity than others. Emerson’s Essays and Poems , Hesiod’s Theogony and Works and Days, Virgil’s Aeneid, Milton’s Paradise Lost, and Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin seem to get orphaned more than most — four to seven copies of each out of roughly 40 students per grade level. To be sure, Homer’s epic poems are thrown out as well, but not in the numbers one might expect. Many students like and keep their copies of The Iliad . This begets the questions how — and why — does Homer’s 3,000-year-old epic poem speak to Generation Z?
Today’s teenagers live in a technology-driven world that consumes many of them. Virtually every student has a smartphone, and many of them have Facebook pages, Snapchat or Instagram accounts, and a selfie obsession. Some students spend incredible hours playing on their XBox or PlayStation 4. I’ve overheard students bragging about how much time they devote to video games — one 17-year-old proudly calculated that he’d spent two years of his life playing one single game. Unsurprisingly, this student barely graduated from high school, despite being a conspicuously bright young man. How his parents couldn’t see that he was addicted to video games and intervene, I’ll never know. Advertisement Advertisement
My students and my children tell me horror stories about sexting, catfishing, and predators in chat rooms. When teenagers want to take a break from social media or video games, they can binge-watch Neflix, Amazon Prime, or YouTube or stream free porn 24/7. This kind of extraordinary distraction and endless, irresistible entertainment presents problems that are new in the history of human development. Technology has delivered a true kind of soma and many kids seem to be drowning in it.
The unfettered use of technology and social media by young children is a direct threat to a student’s ability to read and study in a sustained and thoughtful way. They are incredibly distracted by the ceaseless buzz of their phones. Even if they read well, technology has harmed many of them: shortened attention spans, a compulsion to overshare every trivial detail of their lives, an expectation that they be entertained at all times, and an exaggerated focus on themselves. All these problems become evident in the classroom and become obstacles teachers must overcome. Advertisement
The problem is best addressed and solved by responsible parents who are willing to take a hard line and limit or deny access to all the aforementioned starting at birth — until, at the very least, children have become proficient readers and enjoy books and physical activity. However, responsible parents are in short supply. One hears a lot about a crisis in education. An even bigger problem, based on my experience, is the crisis in parenting. Advertisement
In today’s environment, engaging students effectively often requires appealing to their self-interest. At the beginning of The Iliad , I ask the girls in the class: How would you feel if an army of men was fighting over you ? The girls’ responses differ quite a bit: Some like the idea, but most usually don’t want people to die fighting for them. Then, the next day, the boys are asked: Would you fight a war for a woman? The answers vary, but interestingly, there is often a bit more of a consensus: For the right woman, many would fight. The conversations usually initiate reasonably serious thought and students refine and amend their answers as the class discussion evolves. This approach allows them to imagine the conflict as if they were a character in the text and it becomes a little easier to draw them into the story. Advertisement Advertisement
There is no getting around the fact that to read and comprehend Homer, students must apply themselves for an extended period of time: The Iliad is 24 books long. They take quizzes and exams, do close readings of key passages, engage in Socratic discussions, and write a ten-page end-of-year paper on “The Role of the Hero in Society.” But there must be more than rigor in a teacher’s pedagogy if one wants to engage Generation Z and genuinely educate them.
Probably the most popular and in some ways effective way to engage students is to assign Iliad projects. The assignment generates enthusiasm for the text and deepens students’ understanding of the epic by allowing them to interpret it in a personal and hands-on way. They work as individuals or in groups and are free to choose the project — as long as it has legitimate academic merit. Some use their skill and talent with technology to make remarkably accurate movie adaptations of key scenes: to do this well, students must read and comprehend the text. Presentations have included dioramas of battle scenes, models of Greek ships, PowerPoint or Prezi presentations on the weapons of the Trojan War, the gods, diseases, and burial rites. One popular choice is making a replica of the famous shield Hephaestus, the god of fire, forges for Achilles.
One student, Brianne Pinson, made a stunning version of Achilles’ shield for my class and won first place in the local Altrusa Art Fair with her work. However, discussing Achilles’ shield and all it signifies usually takes a very sobering turn. When I recently asked my class: If you were to make the modern equivalent of Achilles’ shield, what images should be put on the front? It only took a few seconds before someone answered, “A smart phone right in the middle.” Then another student said, “Someone using a smart phone to film a person being beat up, not helping the victim, but making a video to post on YouTube.” The class grew uncharacteristically somber as students considered these remarks. Shield of Achilles by Brianne Pinson
What happens to Achilles while he’s withdrawn from the war is another moment that offers lessons that many students are open to learning. Away from the frenzy of battle, quietly in his tent, he has time for introspection. It is after this quiet time that he rejects the war and his culture, especially the pursuit of honor and glory (timê and kleos, in Greek). Achilles plans to sail home and live a longer but modest life of anonymity. For the students, this is an excellent moment for a Socratic discussion about the importance of unplugging from technology in order to be introspective, to follow the Greek admonition to know thyself, and also to discuss the value of questioning one’s culture — and rejecting it, if needed.
Every fall, Caprock Academy has a USO show to honor our armed forces. The names of every veteran or active-duty service member related to students, faculty, or the administration are projected onto the gym wall throughout the concert. Honoring the men and women who fight and protect the country enriches some students’ understanding of The Iliad. Many can recognize the poignancy of certain moments, like when Hector’s son bursts into tears when he sees his father, helmet on, about to return to war. The modern equivalent of this scene plays out locally at the Grand Junction regional airport when loved ones in uniform deploy and leave their families behind. Advertisement
This awareness makes it easier for students to appreciate the sacrifices military men and women make and also to understand what classical scholar Victor Davis Hanson calls “the tragic view of life.” It is a central premise in The Iliad . To wit , Zeus’s assessment of mankind in the Fagles translation: “There is nothing alive more agonized than man of all that breathe and crawl across the earth.” This leads to a discussion about whether Zeus is right about mankind and what is meant by the term “the human condition.” Students point to the cruelty of Internet trolls as evidence that Zeus is right. Advertisement
After Hector kills Patroclus, Achilles is so devastated by the loss that he does things that, as a Greek soldier, he would not normally do and that are outside the norms of the society: human sacrifices, defiling the corpse of Hector (which the gods preserve despite Achilles’ best efforts), and refusing to bury Patroclus until his ghost implores Achilles to do so. These events raise the question of whether extreme situations such as war have the ability to dehumanize and transform human beings — and then, if there is a need and a duty afterwards, for society to help heal and reassimilate warriors back into domestic life.
Next, we look to see if Homer addresses the idea of warriors rejoining civilian life and processing grief. King Priam risks his life and crosses enemy lines in the dead of night to beg Achilles for Hector’s body back. The vulnerable old man goes into the Greek camp and straight into the proverbial lion’s den — but is not eaten by the lion. I ask the class: Why not? What accounts for this moment of grace? Is there something about the old man that stirs Achilles’ heart? Perhaps King Priam’s courage and his overwhelming love for his son? Something about the bond between any father and his son? Or maybe it is the anguish and loss radiating off the great man.
Priam says, “I have endured what no man on earth has ever done before — I put to my lips the hands of the man who killed my son.” Achilles is shocked to see Priam and disarmed by his words. Homer describes his reaction: “Those words stirred within Achilles a deep desire to grieve for his own father. Taking the old man’s hand he gently moved him back. And overpowered by memory both men gave way to grief.” Achilles softens and weeps and breaks down. His enemy does the same. Both men have been devastated by what each side has done to the other.
After they share a meal, Achilles allows King Priam to leave with his son’s corpse so the proper burial rites can be observed. In the end, Achilles lets go of his rage. He shows decency and respect to the old king, and thus rejoins humanity.
By the end of the narrative, even Generation Z can sense some of the wisdom, terrible beauty, and sadness alive in Homer’s work, but I’d be lying if I didn’t write that many students find it anticlimactic. Where is the Trojan horse? When does Achilles get shot in the ankle? What about the sacking of Troy? Of course none of these events happen in The Iliad — just in Hollywood’s version. The true version ends beautifully and gracefully with Hector’s funeral and interment.
Very few high-school freshmen can grasp Homer’s depth or appreciate the scale and intricacy of his work. If the students are snorkelers looking at a beautiful reef in a tropical sea, their masks are fogged and the dazzling fish and ethereal world moves behind a curtain of mist. However, if one can bring them close enough to see a little bit of the reef clearly, then the hope is that one day they will return, older and wiser, with a clearer mask, and see the whole reef in its full majesty."

Bernie Sanders is newly vocal defender of making a lot of money , now that it has emerged that he himself is a millionaire:
“I didn’t know that it was a crime to write a good book which turns out to be a bestseller,” Sanders said at a community meeting in Gary, Indiana. Comments
Since Sanders described himself as a millionaire earlier this week, he and his campaign have stressed that his policy platform, which is fiercely critical of “billionaires” and wealthy corporate interests, like private insurers and pharmaceutical companies, is unchanged. His Medicare for All push has been colored by relentless attacks on those industries.
“My view has always been that we need a progressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start paying their fair share of taxes. If I make a lot of money, you make a lot of money, that is what I believe,” Sanders added, defiant and plainly frustrated by the line of questioning. “So again, I don’t apologize for writing a book that was number three on the New York Times best seller, translated into five or six languages, and that’s that.”"
College Degrees Certify Life Skills You Can Get Elsewhere | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,James Piereson,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/college-degrees-life-skills-apprenticeships/,"April 15, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) A bachelor’s degree certifies a set of life skills you don’t really need college for.
W hen customers visit an Enterprise Rent-a-Car establishment for the first time, they are often pleasantly surprised to be waited on by a staff of young managers, typically in their 20s, well dressed, polite, and efficient. The situation is much in contrast to many operations that employ middle-aged managers and hire young people to work their way up doing routine tasks. At Enterprise, the youngsters actually run the show, and they do it very well. And it is not an accident. Enterprise adopted a policy several years ago of hiring young college graduates to staff their local rental agencies. It is a policy that is paying off both for the company and for the young employees, who quickly learn the ins and outs of managing an office. Advertisement Advertisement
Enterprise offers more entry-level jobs for college graduates than almost any other employer in the United States. Last year they hired 8,500 for their management-training program, 40 percent more than the next highest employer. But according to a recent cover story in the Chronicle of Higher Education , Enterprise does not concern itself with questions such as where its trainees went to college, what they majored in, or even how well they did when they were there. “We recognize that great talent can come from all types of institutions, all types of majors and backgrounds,” Marie Artim, Enterprise’s vice president for talent acquisition, explained.
As the Chronicle notes, “to the company, a college degree matters mostly because it suggests that a candidate has acquired the right mix of skills to succeed in an entry-level job — and to move up the ladder from there.” Instead, the company simply takes a bachelor’s degree to signify that applicants can engage in some degree of critical thinking, problem solving, and juggling different responsibilities at the same time. Advertisement
This is what economists such as Ohio University’s Richard Vedder and George Mason’s Bryan Caplan have been arguing for years: College degrees are simply a signifier — an easy way of telling an employer that you have a basic grasp of the English language, some rudimentary math skills, and the ability to show up on time in clean clothes. On those measures, is a graduate of the University of Michigan any different from a graduate of Michigan State or Northern Michigan University? Not really. Does a 3.8 GPA predict that you will do better or worse at managing a car-rental office than someone with a 2.8 GPA? Probably not. Does majoring in business predict that you will do a better job than an English major or a sociology major or a physics major? It’s unlikely.
The management at Enterprise are saying aloud what many employers know to be true. Bosses who require a college degree are taking advantage of a system that does the sorting for them. They understand that a bachelor’s degree is not really necessary for doing an entry-level job, and that whatever your educational background, you will require significant training to do well in that particular position. Advertisement Advertisement
Surely there are plenty of high-school graduates who are qualified to run the front desk at a car-rental office. But finding out who those people are is more time-consuming than just looking at a résumé and seeing a bachelor’s degree. Too bad it costs most kids tens of thousands of dollars — not to mention the opportunity cost of several years out of the workforce — to get that piece of paper.
There are easier and cheaper ways to sort people. High schools could do more to teach the basic responsibility and functioning skills that they used to. In an age of helicopter parenting, though, many employers would wonder whether it was really parents who were responsible for high-functioning high-school students.
But surely a one- or two-year apprenticeship in any number of fields after high school could show the same evidence of critical thinking and responsibility. Unfortunately, the federal government does not subsidize those paths the same way we subsidize college education through financial aid. Such apprenticeship programs generally require the employer to take on the risk. When a potential employee drops out of such a program, the cost is borne by the employer. When someone drops out of college, the cost is borne only by the student and the taxpayer. Advertisement"
‘Abortion Restrictions Don’t Work’: A Dubious Claim | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Blanchette,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/abortion-restrictions-dont-work-dubious-claim/,"April 15, 2019 6:30 AM Signs outside the Supreme Court during the March for Life rally, January 27, 2017. (Aaron O. Bernstein/Reuters) A comforting thought for moderate pro-choicers is not supported by the available data.
S ome pro-choice advocates argue that having an abortion is perfectly morally acceptable, either because a fetus has little to no moral significance, or because a woman’s right to bodily autonomy always prevails over whatever rights a fetus might have. Some even go so far as to celebrate the act of having an abortion as a manifestation of female empowerment — the ultimate middle finger to the patriarchy. They hold that any and all abortion restrictions would amount to a violation of female bodily autonomy. Advertisement Advertisement
But many pro-choice advocates, especially among the rank-and-file, have a more moderate view. They concede that abortion is (at least usually) morally wrong or bad, perhaps even seriously so — even if women are often not blameworthy for having them. And yet they still believe that abortion should be legal. I would venture to say that this is the most common pro-choice position.
Pro-lifers are often baffled by this combination of beliefs, but some moderate pro-choicers have an explanation at the ready: Abortion restrictions don’t work . Instead of lowering the rate of abortion, they simply replace safe abortions with roughly the same number of unsafe “back alley” abortions. If a law does not reduce the incidence of the problematic behavior that it targets, and it also has costs attached to it — such as creating unsafe conditions for women seeking the procedure, or imposing unfair burdens on women in a society that often treats them unjustly — then that law is unjustified, even if abortion is morally wrong or bad.
The logic of this argument is above reproach. But the factual assertion at its heart — that abortion restrictions don’t work — does not stand up to scrutiny. Advertisement
In order to shore up this causal claim, pro-choice advocates typically rely on large-scale studies, such as a widely reported 2016 piece of research published in the Lancet , that report no correlation — and sometimes even an inverse correlation — between abortion restrictions and the rate of abortion across regions with stricter and looser abortion laws. For a concrete example of such an argument, we need go no further than the Guttmacher Institute, whose research scientist was the lead author of the Lancet study. An oft-referenced infographic on their website summarizes the relevant findings of the study as follows: “Highly restrictive laws do not eliminate abortion. Rather, they make the abortions that do occur more likely to be unsafe.” The graphic shows that the average rate of abortion in countries with strict abortion laws is comparable to the average rate of abortion in countries in which abortion is broadly legal. Advertisement
The key problem with using these estimates as evidence that abortion restrictions don’t affect abortion rates is that they do not account for confounding factors — i.e., they ignore the fact that countries with stricter abortion laws are also different in other ways that may affect abortion rates, a problem that the published study explicitly notes. While the report indeed finds that “abortion rates are not substantially different across groups of countries classified according to the grounds under which abortion is legally allowed,” it goes on to state that “the level of unmet need for contraception is higher in countries with the most restrictive abortion laws than in countries with the most liberal laws, and this contributes to the incidence of abortion in countries with restrictive laws.” Moreover, the vast majority of countries with more restrictive abortion laws are in developing regions, and poverty likely also has an impact on the abortion rates in these countries. Advertisement
It is not at all implausible that the abortion restrictions in these countries do, in fact, prevent many abortions from occurring, and that these countervailing factors act to bring their abortion rates in line with those of wealthier countries that have more liberal abortion laws. Indeed, when studies use rigorous methods to limit the problem of confounding factors, the evidence points in the opposite direction. Advertisement"
Holy Week Transcends Selfie Culture | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/holy-week-transcends-selfie-culture/,"Follow Kathryn Jean Lopez on Twitter April 15, 2019 6:30 AM Pope Francis holds palm branches as he leads the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter’s Square, April 14, 2019. (Remo Casilli/Reuters) Martyrdom has its attractions.
Rome — On the way to Mass on the Friday before Good Friday, I passed the Roman Colosseum. It’s hard to have things put in better perspective. Christians were once fed to the lions there, and now it’s the background to many a tourist selfie. Mass that morning was at the Basilica of Santo Stefano Rotondo al Monte Celi. TripAdvisor’s top “review” on it that same morning offered this description: “Slightly off the beaten track, Santo Stefano is a lovely, quiet church full of horror.” The “horror” no doubt refers to the frescoes of Christian martyrdom that line the ancient circular basilica. Does it become less horrific when you see the serene smiles if not outright joy on some of the faces as these people approach their end? It depends on whether you believe that the martyr is in for a new beginning.
Santo Stefano is a Station Church for the Fifth Week of Lent, part of a tradition that dates back to the fourth century for the penitential season. Though, I confess, when you don’t walk the whole path as the Millennial seminarians at the Pontifical North American College do, but take a taxi, it’s also a tremendous way to visit some of the churches of Rome — and before the tourists are awake. It’s a way to drink in the breadth and depth of the martyrs, remembering the import of faith — what that faith may call for, if one truly believes and truly is tested. If we are really paying attention, it is a reminder that testing takes many forms.
I’m in the Eternal City for friendship, fellowship, prayer, and what research and reporting that can be had. While I’m over here, the pope emeritus, Benedict XVI, has had some thoughts published on the origins of and solutions for the sex scandals in the Church. It makes a whole lot of sense that he would, given his lifetime of service and deep wells of wisdom. His comments are subject to all kinds of controversy and spin. But the most important line is this: “Only obedience and love for our Lord Jesus Christ can point the way.” That seemed the most appropriate line to highlight as we are set to mark the holiest season on the Christian calendar yet again. He also writes:
There are values which must never be abandoned for a greater value and even surpass the preservation of physical life. There is martyrdom. God is (about) more than mere physical survival. A life that would be bought by the denial of God, a life that is based on a final lie, is a non-life.
He notes that “martyrdom is a basic category of Christian existence.” So it would follow that “the very essence of Christianity is at stake here” if martyrdom is not a part of our lives. Of course, martyrs exist in the world today. A priest killed while celebrating Mass in France comes to mind. As do Coptic Christians and Iraqi Christians slaughtered by the so-called Islamic State.
He explains the importance of “the authority of the Church in matters of morality”: “Those who deny the Church a final teaching competence in this area force her to remain silent precisely where the boundary between truth and lies is at stake.”"

House speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the progressive faction of her caucus led by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “like five people.”
In a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday, Pelosi was asked whether she could unify the “self-described socialists” and the “moderates” among House Democrats.
“By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with, they know that we have to hold the center. That we have to go down the mainstream,” she responded.
“But it doesn’t look like that. It looks as if it’s fractured. You have these wings– AOC, and her group on one side,” interviewer Lesley Stahl continued.
“That’s like five people,” Pelosi replied.
“The progressive group is more than five,” Stahl said. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“I’m a progressive,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi, 79, and Ocasio-Cortez, 29, have not clashed openly but have occasionally thrown shade at each other since the latter’s ascension to Congress earlier this year. In February, the speaker dismissed Ocasio-Cortez’s signature proposal, the Green New Deal, as the “green dream, or whatever they call it.” She also referenced the freshman congresswoman’s huge social-media following earlier this month during a discussion about the importance of being unified and working with the other side of the aisle."

Making the click-through worthwhile: Rising star Pete Buttigieg formally announces his 2020 presidential campaign, Democrats spend the weekend insisting that criticism is the same thing as inciting violence, and another conservative speaker is assaulted on a college campus.
The Mayor Is Having More than a Moment
On Sunday afternoon in South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg formally announced his intention to run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Standing on a stage in front of thousands, packed inside a former Studebaker assembly plant, the mayor claimed that he’s the best alternative to what’s going on in the nation’s capital. Advertisement Advertisement
“The horror show in Washington is mesmerizing. It’s all-consuming,” Buttigieg said in remarks he wrote himself. “But starting today, we’re going to change the channel.”
The pundit class has been chattering for weeks about the 37-year-old South Bend mayor who is “having a moment.” But how long does a moment have to last before it becomes something more? The Buttigieg rise answers our question. Over the last few months, he’s been the subject of profiles in New York magazine , the Washington Post , and The Cut , among many others (along with some less favorable coverage such as this lengthy, scathing critique in Current Affairs , which arguably indicates he’s a real threat to those who would prefer to see the nomination go to Bernie Sanders). Advertisement
For now, he’s occupying the lane that supporters of Beto O’Rourke hoped the failed Senate candidate would have all to himself. The former Texas congressman outraised Buttigieg in the first quarter, but not by much: He’s raked in about $9.4 million, while the mayor boasted $7 million. Their average donation sizes were comparable, though Buttigieg’s was a bit lower at $36.35 compared to O’Rourke’s $43. Advertisement
The Buttigieg campaign’s choice of the former Studebaker plant for his announcement says a lot about their strategy. The plant has been closed for decades, and it stands as a symbol of the economic downturn from which South Bend has never recovered. But today the plant is also the site of new data and education initiatives that Buttigieg has pushed as mayor in an effort to revitalize the city.
Unfortunately for citizens of South Bend, his revitalization efforts haven’t really worked. But the mayor clearly intends to continue portraying himself as a young, competent technocrat who can appeal to many of the same working-class voters — devastated by the loss of Studebaker equivalents across the Midwest — who turned to Donald Trump for hope in 2016. Advertisement
Judging from his policy proposals, Buttigieg is just one more flavor of progressive among several already on offer from this election cycle’s Democratic party. But he seems to understand that Trump had real appeal to real people for reasons other than racism, and in this Democratic field, that makes him something of a stand-out. Advertisement
Ilhan Omar vs. Donald Trump Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The freshman Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota is once again under the microscope, this time after remarks she delivered at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month. Omar said that after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, she had faced anti-Muslim attacks and “lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen.”
“Frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,” Omar said. “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” Leaving aside the fact that CAIR was in fact founded in 1994, not in response to the 9/11 attacks, some have criticized Omar for her use of the flippant phrase “some people did something” to refer to an act of terrorism that took the lives of thousands of Americans.
This wasn’t the first time Omar has faced conservative ire; she has repeatedly trafficked in anti-Semitic slurs for which she has refused to apologize, and for which the Democratic party has yet to hold her accountable. Clearly sensing an opportunity to renew his rivalry with the young progressive congresswoman, President Trump tweeted a video featuring Omar’s remarks interspersed with footage of the burning World Trade Center towers and other images from 9/11.
Now, Omar claims the president’s tweet has put her in danger. “Since the president’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life—many directly referencing or replying to the president’s video,” she wrote in a statement late Sunday night. More from Omar:
Violent crimes and other acts of hate by right-wing extremists and white nationalists are on the rise in this country and around the world. We can no longer ignore that they are being encouraged by the occupant of the highest office in the land. Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226 percent increase in hate crimes in the months following the rally. And assaults increase when cities host Trump rallies. . . . This is endangering lives. It has to stop.
Many on the left, including several Democratic politicians and 2020 candidates spent the weekend insisting that right-wing criticism of Omar was directly putting her life in danger and “inciting violence” against her. “Inciting violence” is a highly specific legal category, and hardly any speech qualifies under that definition, so invoking it as a means of silencing Omar’s critics is nothing more than a hackneyed talking point.
These same commentators and elected officials had no qualms about Omar repeatedly spreading false accusations against the boys from Covington Catholic high school, and they rightly refrained from blaming Bernie Sanders for the Alexandria shooting in 2017, conducted by a former Sanders-campaign volunteer who targeted members of the congressional GOP citing his political beliefs.
The reaction to Omar’s comment at CAIR may have been a bit over the top, but the Democratic reaction to the criticism has been downright histrionic. Advertisement Advertisement
Violence on Campus
Unlike Congresswoman Omar, one conservative speaker has actually been subjected to assault in the last few days. Michael Knowles, a columnist for the Daily Wire , was assaulted late last week on the campus of the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Knowles was scheduled to give a talk entitled “Men Are Not Women,” hosted by the campus chapter of Young Americans for Freedom.
Protestors attended the talk and attempted to shout over Knowles’s remarks, holding signs that read “Trans rights are human rights,” “Respect my existence,” and “Trans men are men.” Finally, one protestor used a water gun to spray a “glitter-filled liquid” on Knowles, who tweeted immediately afterward that he initially thought it was bleach. Tests revealed it was “lavender oil and some other non-toxic household liquids.”
In response to the controversy, UMKC chancellor C. Mauli Agrawal released a statement affirming the First Amendment right to free speech, but not before he described Knowles as “a speaker whose professed opinions do not align with our commitment to diversity and inclusion and our goal of providing a welcoming environment to all people, particularly to our LGBT community.” Advertisement
I’m sure Democrats who spent the weekend accusing the president of bringing down violence on Omar’s head will be offering Knowles their support any day now . . . "

Warning. SPOILERS are ahead. If you don’t want to know anything about episode one of the final season of Game of Thrones , stop reading. Now.
Still reading? Good. Let’s get started in an unlikely place — church. A few weeks ago my pastor said during his sermon, “No one can control the consequences of sin.” One of the great deceptions of the enemy is the idea that you can get away with evil deeds, that you can manage your own compromises. You cannot. Advertisement Advertisement
The opening flashback scenes of the show took us back to a moment last season that I thought mainly stood on its own as a symbol of the war within Daenerys Targaryen’s soul — is she the ruthless daughter of the Mad King or is she the noble liberator who is going to “ break the wheel ” of oppression in Westeros? That moment was the brutal execution by dragon fire of Randyll and Dickon Tarly when they refused to bend the knee after their defeat in battle. Rather than imprison them, she give in to her worst instincts and roasted them.
Well those moral chickens came home to roost when she met Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow’s faithful friend and the man who helped discover Jon’s true lineage. She met him to thank him for saving Jorah Mormont, and she ended up disclosing one of her worst crimes. Samwell’s father was cruel to him, but he loved his brother. John Bradley plays Samwell, and he did an outstanding job conveying the change in emotions, from acceptance at his father’s death to true grief and anger at his brother’s execution. Advertisement
That moment meant that the disclosure of Snow’s true identity — as a Targaryen and the true heir to the Iron Throne — happened when Samwell was distraught, when he could plant seeds of doubt in Jon about Dany’s true character. Samwell put the question to Jon plainly. “You gave up the crown to save your people. Would she do the same?” Advertisement
And thus we saw the questions in Jon’s heart. He is the show’s honorable man — honorable sometimes to the point of foolishness. Daenerys is the show’s conflicted hero, torn between her quest for vengeance and her desire for justice. It was a masterful moment, and it illustrated that one moment in time — Daenerys’s impulsive decision to burn her honorable opponents rather than imprison them — could have consequences that turn the course of history. She did a terrible thing, and she can’t control what happens next.
The other key conflict in the first episode was between Sansa and Daenerys. Sansa’s character arc is one of the more fascinating of the series. She’s journeyed from starry-eyed young princess to perhaps one of the coldest and most shrewd characters on the show. She is every bit Daenerys’s intellectual and strategic equal, and despite Dany’s dragons, she is not intimidated in Dany’s presence. Advertisement
Finally, the first episode demonstrated the qualities that have made Game of Thrones a cultural sensation. It gets the big and the small things right. The opening scene capture the awesome might of Dany’s army, but it also captured the significant changes in her expression when her dragons shocked and awed the people of the north. Her slight smile when the people screamed in terror showed that Dany is perhaps just a bit too much in love with her own power. At the same time, the brief second between Sansa’s shock at the sight of the dragon and her obvious grim determination showed that she is and will be a match for Daenerys in the episodes to come.

Tax Cuts & Democrats -- Public Skepticism of Tax Cuts Is Normal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/public-skepticism-of-tax-cuts-is-normal/,"Follow Ramesh Ponnuru 12:44 PM
The Times article that Robert VerBruggen highlights below suggests that Democrats have been successful in misinforming the public about how many Americans have gotten a tax cut from the Republicans. But it’s probably not just political spin, or the design of that tax law, that caused people to underestimate the extent of the tax cut. Previous tax cuts have landed the same way. President George W. Bush, in his first term, passed two tax cuts that cut tax bills for everyone who paid income tax and raised taxes on nobody. In 2004, a New York Times /CBS News poll found that fewer than one in five Americans thought they had gotten a tax cut. Polls from the 1980s found that Americans were much more likely to think that the bipartisan tax reform of 1986, which in general reduced income taxes and raised corporate taxes, had raised their tax bills than lowered them.

I do this because I’m haunted by the story of the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009. The plane disappeared into the Atlantic. At first most people thought it was a bomb, an act of terrorism. But years later, when the bodies and the black box were retrieved, the real story came out. I remember reading five or six accounts about how it happened. The plane hit a column of ice crystals in the sky. The autopilot mode shut off and the alarms started going crazy. The air-speed sensors were malfunctioning. All the pilots had to do was hold the plane steady. In one minute or so, the problems caused by the ice column would have cleared themselves up and the alarms would have ceased.
But the pilots responded by pulling the nose up. Already at a high altitude, the plane, predictably, went into a stall. Pulling the nose up meant losing lift, and the plane began to fall like a rock. A rock pointed upward. The pilots needed to push the nose of the plane down, and dive, to achieve lift again. They kept pulling up and the harder they did, the faster they fell. Advertisement
Years later, when the tapes of the pilots were released, and the true cause of the crash became known, all the great world tabloids — the Daily Mail , the New York Post — ran headlines of the final words of the pilot, blanked out: “F***, We’re dead!” Advertisement
Back to that in a minute.
One hundred and thirteen years ago, Marcel Proust wrote an essay in Le Figaro titled “La Mort des cathédrals.” A couple of years ago, near the beginning of a year of terror attacks in France, a popular Catholic blo g translated it into English. Proust was responding to a piece of anti-clerical legislation. He asked readers to imagine a future, centuries hence, in which the Christian religion had vanished from France, but the Gothic cathedrals — monuments to French genius — were still standing and admired. He wrote:
Then suppose that one day scholars manage, on the basis of documentary evidence, to reconstitute the ceremonies that used to be celebrated in them, for which men had built them, which were their proper meaning and life, and without which they were now no more than a dead letter; and suppose that for one hour artists, beguiled by the dream of briefly giving back life to those great and now silent vessels, wished to restore the mysterious drama that once took place there amid chants and scents — in a word, that they were undertaking to do what the Félibres have done for ancient tragedies in the theatre of Orange.
He asked: “Is there any government with the slightest concern for France’s artistic past that would not liberally subsidize so magnificent an undertaking? “
Well, in 2017, the rites of the Catholic religion aren’t yet entirely unknown in France. But I recently discovered that, contrary to Proust, there are limits to state subsidy. The French state does own the Cathedral of Notre Dame, and knows it is a major draw for tourists to Paris. The government kicks in about 2 million euros a year for basic maintenance. But pieces of the cathedral have been falling off it for years. Major repairs haven’t been tried since Marcel Proust was a teenager. The archbishop of Paris is now seeking about 100 million euros to do the work that needs to be done. And this fund-raising campaign is aimed partly at American s . Advertisement
I giggled at the solicitation for funds. Maybe the archbishop read one of those misleading Pew surveys that tout how “religious” America is compared with Europe. Maybe Americans are suckers for this kind of pitch: By contributing to the campaign to save Notre Dame, they’ve put an imaginary down payment on that long-dreamed-of trip to Paris. Advertisement Advertisement
There is a lot of gloom about Europe lately. A large Islamist terror cell tried to blow up the cathedral in Barcelona a few weeks ago, an as yet uncompleted modern masterpiece. Douglas Murray’s haunting and elegiac book The Strange Death of Europe dwells on how Europe lost its faith in Christ, and then lost faith in all the substitutes for Christianity: Fascism, Communism, human rights next, probably. Murray is not quite a believer, but he writes, “I cannot help feeling that much of the future of Europe will be decided on what our attitude is towards the church buildings and other great cultural buildings of our heritage standing in our midst.”
So what is the attitude to Notre Dame? Though the French state is its owner, it will not spend the money for necessary repairs. The local archbishop does not believe that he can raise the funds to keep this astounding testament to French history and genius locally, from the descendants of those who built it. Advertisement"

(File photo: Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters)
Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld announced Monday that he will mount a Republican primary challenge against incumbent Donald Trump.
Weld, who served as governor of the Bay State from 1991 to 1997, announced earlier this year that he’d formed an exploratory committee for a possible presidential run but waited until Monday to make his candidacy official in a statement.
“Ours is a nation built on courage, resilience, and independence. In these times of great political strife, when both major parties are entrenched in their ‘win at all cost’ battles, the voices of the American people are being ignored and our nation is suffering,” Weld said in the statement. “It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag. It is time to return to the principles of Lincoln – equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. There is no greater cause on earth than to preserve what truly makes America great. I am ready to lead that fight.”
Prior to his two terms as the state’s governor, Weld was appointed to serve as the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Stay Updated with NR Daily

In a video posted to his campaign website, Weld claimed credit for helping to revitalize the Massachusetts economy by disrupting decades of unified Democratic control, cutting taxes and cracking down on crime. He juxtaposed his record as U.S. attorney and governor with that of President Trump, whose character he impugned through a montage of crass statements Trump made during and prior to the 2016 presidential campaign."

For 800 years the people of France gave the world a great gift. For 800 years countless millions experienced its transcendent beauty. Then, in an afternoon, it was gone — gutted by fire. We watched it burn, and across the whole of Christendom men and women were surprised by the extent of their grief. Advertisement Advertisement
In the days and weeks that follows, people will share their stories about Notre Dame. Here’s mine. On March 9, 1996, I walked into the great cathedral on the morning of my wedding day. The gravity of the moment was starting to sink in, and I wanted a place to pray. We Protestants are accustomed to thinking of the great cathedrals of Europe mainly as tourist attractions — as beautiful historical buildings and not as actual, living churches. That morning changed my heart.
It was too early for most tourists to arrive, so I walked past other worshipers, men and women on their knees before the Lord. I knelt also. I asked God’s blessing on my wedding, on my marriage, and on the children we hoped to have. In that moment, I felt the presence of God, but I also felt something else — for a moment I was staggered at the thought of the sheer number of people who’d knelt in this same spot and asked God for these same good things. I felt more connected to the larger body of Christ than I’d ever felt before. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The Notre Dame I visited wasn’t just a beautiful building. It wasn’t just a marvel of medieval architecture. And it wasn’t just the center of the French nation — the place where kings and emperors were crowned. It was a symbol of an enduring church and God’s enduring presence. France will feel its loss more than it now understands. We all will. Advertisement"
Ilhan Omar: Criticism an Attack on Muslims | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/ilhan-omar-comments-criticism/,"About Kevin D. Williamson April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Rep. Ilhan Omar speaks about Trump administration policies towards Muslim immigrants outside the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Jim Bourg/Reuters) When the ‘victim’ is the victimizer
‘I t has to stop,” says Representative Ilhan Omar.
No, it does not.
Representative Omar, the Jew-hating Minnesota Democrat, is engaged in one of her usual games of misdirection, a pattern of hers that by now is familiar enough to be predicted: She says something outrageously stupid, offensive, anti-Semitic — or all three at once — and then attempts to parry the thrust of inevitable criticism by characterizing it as an attack on Muslims, women, women of color, Muslim women of color, etc. Advertisement Advertisement
In this case, Representative Omar characterized the events of September 11, 2001, this way: “Some people did something.” Someone assembled a video intercutting her blasé account of mass murder with images of that day’s events, and Donald Trump, who serves simultaneously as president of the United States and the nation’s social-media intern, tweeted the video, along with some vintage all-caps emoting: “WE WILL NEVER FORGET!”
The New York Times stepped on Representative Omar’s cue and uttered her lines itself, insisting that the criticism of Representative Omar is necessarily part of an attack on Muslims categorically. Trump of course has on more than one occasion treated Muslims categorically, for instance in calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” which, like so many of President Trump’s blustery promises, never came to pass and never even was given serious consideration. (The actual policy consists of restrictions on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, along with North Koreans and officials of the Venezuelan government.) Representative Omar is not all Muslims, and she is not Muslims categorically: She’s a loopy left-wing identity-politics entrepreneur whom the Democratic party has carried to the U.S. House of Representatives. Criticism of elected officials is not only permissible but necessary. Advertisement
But Representative Omar believes she is above such criticism: “It has to stop,” she said, citing death threats she has received since the presidential tweet. That argument is pure horsepucky. It is an unfortunate fact of life in Anno Domini 2019 that practically everyone in public life receives death threats, often on social media or in online forums. Elected officials do. Journalists and commentators do. Entertainment figures do. I do, and my colleagues do. That’s our dumb world. And, currently, it’s part of the price for certain kinds of careers. There isn’t anything special about Representative Omar in this regard. She’d get death threats if she were a Fox News host, too. Advertisement
But such threats are a useful pretext for politicians who want to shut down criticism for their own narrow political ends. Senator Bernie Sanders, the socialist rape-fantasy entrepreneur from Brooklyn who represents Vermont in the Senate, insisted that criticism (he wrote “attacks”) simply “must end.” Senator Elizabeth Warren, the fake Indian from Oklahoma who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, accused the president of attempting to “incite violence.”
The Democrats are in a political pickle. They would very much prefer that the Jew-hating caucus shut up, and they are not crazy about the fact that the public face of the Democratic party is, at the moment, risible and demented amateurs such as Representative Omar and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, i.e., the people who are even crazier than Senator Sanders. But intersectionality is a jealous god, and they cannot simply tell Representative Omar et al. to sit down and clam up. All they can really do is to try to raise the price of criticizing the nut cutlets on the Democrats’ menu by insisting that criticism of Representative Omar is an attack on Muslims as such, that criticism of Representative Ocasio-Cortez is an attack on Latinas who don’t know how a bill becomes a law, that criticism of Robert Francis O’Rourke is an attack on . . . whatever it is that “Beto” is pretending to be this week. The New York Times et al. are reliable allies on that front. Advertisement Advertisement
This is, incidentally, what all those fake hate crimes are really about: Redefining criticism of Democratic politicians and constituencies as violence . When there isn’t enough violence to make that case in a sufficiently dramatic fashion, then violence can simply be invented — and, if the case of Jussie Smollett is anything to go by, the cost of doing so is pretty low. When’s the last time you heard of a prosecutor dropping a 16-felony indictment in exchange for a firm handshake? Advertisement
That’s a neat trick, really: to be the hostage and the hostage-taker at the same time. Advertisement"
Notre Dame Cathedral Fire: Good Friday Comes Early for the Cathedral This Year | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Nicholas Frankovich,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-good-friday-hope/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Smoke billows as fire engulfs the spire of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, April 15, 2019. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters) The loss is incalculable. So is the reason for hope that it will always point to.
April 15, 2019, the evening of Monday in Holy Week
N otre-Dame de Paris is burning. The cathedral’s spire has fallen. The roof has collapsed. Firefighters have been on the scene for hours. The fire won the fight. “There will be nothing left,” a spokesman for Notre Dame told the BBC. It’s almost that bad: The towers and façade will be spared, but much of the interior, including the famous carved woodwork that was the labor of generations, has gone up in the flames, like Elijah in his chariot, en route to heaven. Advertisement Advertisement
“The eldest daughter of the Church,” France’s title of endearment among Europe’s Catholics, has worn Notre Dame, the Cathedral of Our Lady, as its crown since the High Middle Ages. Over the centuries, its vaults, flying buttresses, gargoyles, and rose windows came to assume the status of ancient icons, symbols of Western Christian civilization. We sometimes forget what a breath of wild fresh air Gothic architecture must have been when it began to spring up here and there in northern Europe in the 12th century. The angular verticality pulled the eyes upward and the mind toward things of heaven, like a grove of towering oaks.
Ground for Notre Dame was broken in 1163. Twenty-six years later, the high altar was dedicated. The choir, the nave, and the main, western façade were completed by the middle of the following century. Chapels and various additions were gradually added, one by one. A great cathedral is never completed. After its first hundred, two hundred years, give or take a few, its frame has been established and its general demeanor has been settled, and succeeding generations of artists are afforded the luxury of homing in on delicate, carefully thought-out embellishments, icing on the wedding cake. Advertisement
Notre Dame has been the site of royal weddings and coronations, of papal Masses and of funeral Masses for heads of state. For the tourist, its beauty overshadows its function, which is to provide for the celebration of the Eucharist a house as worthy as mere mortals are capable of building. Immersed in its purpose, the pilgrim feels its magnificence all the more keenly. Theology and sacred history explained themselves through statues of saints and biblical figures: scripture for all who had eyes to see, including the unlettered. Much of that treasure was destroyed in the violence of Christian iconoclasm during the Protestant Reformation and then in the violence of the French Revolution, not to mention the intervening misguided renovations that included the removal of some medieval stained-glass windows. After a few subsequent restoration projects, one of which left the façade cleansed of longstanding grime so that the white stone underneath shone as it did in the cathedral’s youth, Notre Dame began to be itself again by the second half of the 20th century. Advertisement
No one knows what any one craftsman thought and felt as he chiseled, sculpted, laid stones, or otherwise contributed to this monument to God, by way of Mary, the mother of His Son, but from the result of their collective work we glimpse the size of the love that the people of Paris as a whole have had for their faith. They’ve poured a lot of human soul into that structure. Notre Dame echoes emotions etched deep into the marble of Saint Mary Major, that ancient jewel of a Roman basilica likewise dedicated to Our Lady — the same poem, sung in a different architectural language. Advertisement
Authorities say they haven’t determined the cause of the fire that broke out on the Île de la Cité at 6:30 this evening of Monday in Holy Week. Plots to destroy the cathedral have been foiled by law enforcement the past couple of years. Catholic churches across France have been hit by a spate of vandalism in recent months. In March, fire damaged the Church of Saint-Sulpice in the sixth arrondissement. Firefighters said it was arson; police are still investigating. We don’t know enough to say whether the fire at Notre Dame is the latest, most spectacular incident in some ongoing sinister plot against the Church in France, so we look for guidance to Our Lady of Prudence, charting a course between conspiracy-mindedness and naïveté. Advertisement Advertisement
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre — or of the Resurrection, as it’s known to the Eastern Orthodox — is by some accounts the holiest site for Christians of all persuasions and denominations. Erected on the site in Jerusalem where Jesus is reputed to have been crucified and buried and to have risen from the dead, Holy Sepulchre, almost twice as old as Notre Dame, has been destroyed by fire, rebuilt, destroyed by a caliph, and rebuilt again. Let French Catholics take courage from the precedent. The rest of us can figure out how to contribute to reconstruction efforts if we want to."
Elizabeth Warren's Corporate and Wealth Tax Proposals Misguided | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jon Hartley,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-corporate-wealth-tax-proposals-misguided/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in 2017. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) The Massachusetts senator proposes to use some of the most economically damaging forms of taxation in a misguided attempt to help the poor.
T his week, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign unveiled a radical proposal to levy a minimum 7 percent corporate tax on U.S. companies making more than $100 million annually, with the goal of raising around $1 trillion in new revenue. This comes on the heels of Warren’s proposal to institute a new 2 percent wealth tax on all individual fortunes above $50 million and an additional 1 percent tax on all fortunes above $1 billion with the objective of reducing wealth inequality. Advertisement
Unfortunately, the higher corporate taxes and wealth taxes Senator Warren advocates are among the most inefficient ways of raising tax revenue without harming the economy.
Corporate taxes have been shown to be significantly less efficient in raising tax revenue than individual income taxes or sales taxes. The ease with which corporations can establish offshore subsidiaries to avoid taxes or engage in tax inversions significantly contributed to the corporate-tax-revenue and capital-investment shortfalls seen in America in recent years. Indeed, many European countries had already recognized the inefficiency of corporate taxation and reduced their corporate-tax rates well before the U.S. did so as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
The significantly positive macroeconomic data reported for 2018, the first year that tax-reform package went into effect, includes 7 percent growth in non-residential fixed investment, 2 percent real-wage growth and 3 percent GDP growth. Academic research shows that this is no coincidence. Several studies of prior corporate-tax reforms have found that lower corporate-tax rates are associated with higher wage growth and higher rates of capital spending on buildings, property, and equipment. Advertisement
Senator Warren’s 7 percent minimum tax on corporate income would likely reverse these recent positive economic trends and lead to slower growth in investment and wages, in part because it would also disincentivize the automatic expensing of capital equipment. Lower wages, hiring, and investment means less government tax revenue. Advertisement
As for the new wealth taxes Warren proposes, the example of Europe is instructive there, too. Only three European countries (Norway, Spain, and Switzerland) still impose annual wealth taxes today, down from twelve in 1990. The change was fueled by a growing recognition that wealth taxes very often lead to capital flight as wealthy individuals re-domicile to lower-tax jurisdictions, taking their income-tax dollars with them. France’s now-abandoned wealth tax, for example, is estimated to have contributed to the departure of some 42,000 millionaires from the country between 2000 and 2012."
Notre Dame Cathedral Fire: An Omen for Europe | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Dennis Prager,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-omen-europe/,"Follow Dennis Prager on Twitter April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Sparks fill the air as Paris Fire brigade members spray water to extinguish flames as the Notre Dame Cathedral burns in Paris, France, April 15, 2019. (Philippe Wojazer/Reuters) Europe is burning, just as Notre Dame was.
T he symbolism of the burning of Notre-Dame Cathedral, the most renowned building in Western civilization, the iconic symbol of Western Christendom, is hard to miss.
It is as if God Himself wanted to warn us in the most unmistakable way that Western Christianity is burning — and with it, Western civilization. Advertisement Advertisement
Every major Western (and one major non-Western) social and intellectual force has conspired to rid Europe of Christianity and the civilization it produced.
Within the Western world, the French Enlightenment — the intellectual basis of the French Revolution and the modern West — sought to replace Christianity, and religion in general, with secularism rooted in reason. No God, Bible, or Ten Commandments are necessary for morality or meaning: Reason (and science) will replace them.
The two final deathblows to Christianity in Europe were the world wars. World War I ended most Westerners’ belief in the nation-state and the West. Christianity, already weakened by the Enlightenment, was further weakened by World War I. German Christians were killing millions of French and English Christians, and French and English Christians were killing millions of German Christians. So the argument and sentiment against Christianity went. Then World War II saw even more death on the Christian continent as well as the failure of Catholic and Protestant churches in Nazi Germany to offer even minimal noncompliance with the Nazis’ Jew-hatred. Advertisement
With the end of World War II, every internal Western intellectual doctrine was secular. God, the Bible, and religion were regarded at best as innocuous nonsense and at worst as noxious nonsense. Advertisement
Meanwhile, Europeans brought a non-European ideology into Europe, an ideology that, for more than a thousand years, sought to replace Christianity as the world’s dominant religion. The Europeans, believing in nothing distinctly Christian or Western, and believing in the moral and intellectual nonsense known as “multiculturalism”— a doctrine that asserts that all cultures are morally equivalent — saw nothing problematic in bringing millions of Muslims into Europe. In their ignorance and arrogance, they assumed that because they were secular multiculturalists, everybody else was, too — or would be, once they lived in Europe.
VIEW GALLERY: Fire at Notre Dame Cathedral Advertisement
They were wrong, of course. And as a result, the two dominant forces in Europe — secular leftism and Islamism — sought the end of Christianity and the West. (The Left believes that protecting Western civilization is equivalent to protecting white supremacy.)
This is not producing a pretty picture. Generally speaking, Islam has not been nearly as kind, tolerant, open, medically or scientifically innovative, or intellectually curious as Western civilization (and yes, Nazism and Communism were born in the West, but they were anti-Western).
Even without tens of millions of Muslims, post-Christian Europe has not produced a pretty picture. This was predicted in 1834, a hundred years before Hitler’s rise, by the great German poet Heinrich Heine, a secular Jew (who later converted to Protestantism, “the ticket of admission into European culture”):
Christianity — and that is its greatest merit — has somewhat mitigated that brutal German love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman (the cross) is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then . . . a play will be performed in Germany that will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll.
European Christians persecuted European Jews, often brutally. But it took a post-Christian ideology, secular Nazism, to produce Auschwitz — just as it took post-Christian Communism to produce the Gulag, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and the Ukrainian and Cambodian genocides.
Moreover, Nazism and Communism aside, the Left’s belief that secular reason can replace God and the Bible turns out to be completely wrong. The alleged citadels of secular reason — the universities — are the most irrational and morally confused institutions in the West."
The Progressive Revolution: From Democratic to Liberal to Progressive to Socialist - National Review,www.nationalreview.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/progressive-revolution-ends-in-socialism/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM President Barack Obama in 2016 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Obama kick-started a cycle that moves ever farther left — even he now seems passé.
A mericans voted for Barack Obama in 2008 despite, not because of, his most partisan voting record in the Senate. They were once willing to look past his earlier dubious associations with abject anti-Semites such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, former terrorists like Bill Ayers, and unhinged characters such as Father Pfleger. They also averted their eyes from Obama’s often quite offensive commentary, in his autobiography and during the 2008 campaign (e.g., “typical white person” and “ they cling to…” speech). Advertisement Advertisement
Instead, voters were tired of the Iraq War (which was over for all practical purposes by the time of the November 2008 election).
They were, of course, terrified by the September 2008 financial meltdown (which had been mostly stabilized four months later by the time of the inauguration) and irate at the kid-gloves treatment accorded often conniving banks and investors.
They were convinced that Obama might be healing and transformative as the first African-American president, supposedly only slightly to the left of a far steadier and more qualified Condoleezza Rice or Colin Powell. And half the Democrats were already becoming sick of Hillary Clinton once they became reacquainted with her on the 2008 primary-campaign trail.
As is typical of American politics, voters in 2008 also wanted to change the party in power after it had been in the lead for eight years, and the lame-duck president fell out of favor. Voters certainly were underwhelmed by an uninspiring, herky-jerky, mostly incompetent John McCain campaign, notable for his “that’s not who we are” comments and his willingness to “lose nobly.” Advertisement Advertisement
Such was the naïve dream.
The reality by 2013 was that voters got an increasing hard-core liberal-progressive revolution that, after Obama’s 2012 reelection, increasingly polarized America over the reach of the federal government, immigration, and race. Scandals at the DOJ and IRS were often political in nature. By summer 2016, the Obama administration had weaponized the intelligence agencies and his own justice department to such a degree that unleashed bureaucrats and appointees actively sought to intervene in a presidential campaign to undermine the opposition candidate and to lay the foundation for sabotaging the incoming president’s transition and administration.
An overregulated economy stagnated, requiring ever more federal intervention and borrowing. Students on campuses lost constitutional protections, especially under the First and Fifth Amendments, as universities finalized their long transformation into indoctrination centers. Obama recalibrated American foreign policy in neutralist fashion, and in a way that made Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia more suspect than Iran, Turkey, or Cuba. Advertisement
Culturally, diversity replaced affirmative action, on the principle that formerly documented grievances or class status no longer mattered, at least compared with skin color. The real divide was now between a non-white, far greater collective that harbored purported grievances against a reconstituted and much smaller white majority and its “privilege and “supremacy.” When feminists and gays were included in the diverse intersectional bloc of Asians, Latinos, blacks, and immigrants, a supposed new majority of “woke” Americans now would have electoral control over a culpable and soon to become irrelevant minority. The “content of our character” and all that became “inoperative.” Advertisement
All this was largely the legacy of an otherwise mostly unsuccessful Obama administration whose record was one of massive debt, an ossified economy, decreased sovereignty, increased ethnic and racial tensions, and a confused foreign policy perceived abroad as apologetic and contrite, and therefore useful to rivals and enemies. Advertisement
The Socialist-Progressive Takeover
Yet Obama had hit on something in his move to the hard left. After he left office, unapologetic leftists were less coy (the old smear of “socialist” was now a term of endearment) and began to extinguish what little was left of Bill Clinton’s old, occasionally moderate Democratic party.
The reelection of Obama had convinced progressives that he had discovered electoral magic: record voter registration, turnout, and block voting of “minorities” that could overcome the old Perot, Reagan Democrat, silent majority, and tea-party dinosaurs in the critical swing states. This chemistry, they thought, would be inherently transferrable even to multimillionaire white establishmentarians like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden ( but only if they were reeducated and thus made the necessary confessionals about their own white privilege and shared disdain for “deplorables” and “the dregs of society”).
Suddenly, everything seemed possible as woke activists, à la French Revolution, accelerated the possible into the already passé. Advertisement Advertisement
In just a few years, mere acceptance (rather than endorsement) of gay marriage was veritable homophobia. Assimilation and integration were seen as tantamount to cultural appropriation and imperialism. Conservation and market-based encouragement of alternative energy were the appeasement of “climate deniers” and showed a cowardly reluctance to go the full green mile and eventually ban the internal combustion engine. The Kavanaugh hearing, the Covington-kids fiasco, and the Jussie Smollett farce made clear that the Left was no longer liberal but hard-left and fact-free.
Secure borders and deportation of illegal aliens who had committed crimes were themselves humanitarian “crimes.” Building the wall went to stopping the wall to promoting the tearing down of the wall. The notions of affirmation action and disparate impact became Sixties’ relics, when “reparation” was the real goal. Prior street-theater groups such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter seemed timid anachronisms compared with Antifa and its masked hoodlums who torched and beat up anything in their path.
“Legal but rare” abortion became a sellout position, given that any woman had a right to partial-birth abortion and even infanticide if she so chose. A dream of a 50 percent income-tax rate on top incomes went to talk of 70 percent then to 90 percent and then to a wealth tax as just deserts. To enlarge the electorate, illegal aliens should vote first in local elections, but then why not everywhere? Sixteen-years olds could too, and so why not ex-felons as well? About a $1.5 trillion in student debt should be forgiven — but then tuition should be free for all (as should Medicare). Advertisement
The appearance and success of the polarizing Donald Trump supercharged the ongoing progressive revolution. The rallying cries of “collusion,” “treason,” and the new “Manchurian candidate” won over any holdout Democrat and seduced the emasculated Never Trump right into becoming useful colluding idiots. The 2018 Democratic midterm victory in the House was not seen in historical context: Trump in fact had fared much better in both the House and Senate in his first midterm than had either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama at that point in their presidencies, both of whom were easily reelected, while mostly centrist candidates had given the Democrats the new House majority.
By spring 2019, we were light years beyond the revolution’s beginning in summer 2008 — and heading into hard-socialist territory and beyond.
Indeed, the once edgy community-organizing Obama himself had become a tragicomical figure. He spent a bit of his post-presidency warning against a “circular firing squad” of Democratic cannibalism but otherwise was hell-bent on becoming worth $100 million in “I built that fashion”—and was never again heard uttering another “I do think at a certain point you’ve made enough money” sermon.
Socialism and Beyond
Conventional wisdom would warn Democrats that their surrender to pied pipers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Al Sharpton, Linda Sasour, and other assorted fakers, con artists, anti-Semites, and street actors would lead them all over the proverbial George McGovern and Walter Mondale cliff into the abyss. But such caution is unlikely for a variety of reasons.
One, Democratic candidates now sound a lot more like Bernie Sanders than he ever sounded like them. The new socialists believe that they have altered the nature of the electorate and the manner in which elections are conducted, and that they will continue to do so at an accelerating pace.
Preemptory charges of “voter suppression” have made required prior registration and voter IDs veritable racist crimes, as voter harvesting and fluid same-day registration and voting are the hallmarks of the future, even as open borders change the demography of the nation. Youth, not experience or tenure, is the requisite for progressive revolution, as brontosauruses like Diane Feinstein and Chuck Schumer struggle to sputter a few shrill socialist platitudes to maintain minimal relevance. Anti-Semitism is not called out by Democrats, because party leaders fear that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib are not aberrations but now represent 51 percent of the new Democratic party on both Israel and American Jewry.
Two, few leftist revolutionary cycles ever halt in mid course, whether in 1789 France, 1917 Russia, 1946 China, or 1960 Cuba. The philosophy is always that today’s radical is yesterday’s sell-out to be replaced by tomorrow’s genuine far harder leftist — until the limits of reality are reached and the movement either implodes or leads to an authoritarian Napoleon, Lenin, Mao, or Fidel.
The current socialist trajectory is divorced from reality, whether reality mean the critical role of fossil fuels in maintaining civilization, or the historical record of tribalism destroying nations from Rwanda to the Balkans, or the usual story of soft socialism inevitably turning hard and ending in the mass poverty of a North Korea, Venezuela, or Cuba.

The End Game
Socialists and hard progressives believe that they already have won about three-fifths of America, defined not by population, polls, or political office, but by cultural clout. They assume that such control will inevitably end in final victory in the Congress and presidency, the same way that that there’s no longer a Republican party to speak of in California and not a single statewide officeholder who is not a Democrat. Seven of 53 House seats are Republican in the California of Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson.
Entertainment and Hollywood are mostly all left-wing and missionary in their progressive zeal. The network news, PBS, NPR, CNN, and MSNBC outnumber talk radio and Fox News.
Most of the major newspapers are progressive. Silicon Valley is harder left still and more audacious in baking ideology into its products from Twitter and Facebook, which censor conservatives, to Google, with its progressive bias in formatting and searches.
The biggest foundations that most fund activists and academics are mostly left-wing. No one believes that the campuses are balanced or even disinterested. Most academics believe that they can be legitimately biased leftward to balance the supposed prejudices of the family, community, and church — noisome cargo that too many of their naïve students bring with them on arrival, which is why they need “cleansing” and “awakening.”
Sports events and reporting are liberal and increasingly avenues to peddle political messages. Corporate America tries to emulate popular culture and thus must adopt left-wing tropes, so it’s trigger-happy in its readiness to shoot down conservatives who are deemed hostile to our shared fated progressive future.
What we are seeing in the Democratic party’s movement to the hard left is not the beginning but the end of a long march. Socialists and progressives believe that control of the Congress, the presidency, and courts is the final missing tessera from their already expansive socialist mosaic."

Actively aiding someone to knowingly commit suicide, however, is explicitly outlawed in Germany: The Bundestag passed legislation in 2015 banning the sale or prescription of drugs meant to end a patient’s life.

(Carlos Barria/REUTERS)
Nation of Islam founder and notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan defended Representative Ilhan Omar’s glib description of the September 11 attacks Monday by dismissing the attacks as nothing more than a false-flag operation designed to draw the U.S. into Middle Eastern conflicts.
In a video posted to YouTube last year and tweeted out Monday by the Nation of Islam account, Farrakhan accuses the Bush administration of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks in order “to get the country into war at the expense of young patriotic men and women.”
“3,133 Scientists Back Ilhan Omar on 9/11 Deep skepticism exists about the gov’t version of 9/11. Many experts—architects & engineers—say the World Trade Center Towers were destroyed in a controlled demolition. Listen to @LouisFarrakhan # IStandWithIlhan,” reads the tweet, which includes a link to the video.
The tweet expresses Farrakhan’s support for Omar, who has received an onslaught of criticism from Republican lawmakers and conservative pundits for using the phrase “some people did something” to describe the World Trade Center attacks, which killed more than 3,000 Americans.
Farrakhan has previously blamed a cabal of highly placed Jewish government officials for helping to execute the attacks.
“There were many Israelis and Zionist Jews in key roles in the 9/11 attacks,” he said in 2015. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Omar referred to the attack as “something” during a speech before the the Council on American-Islamic Relations last week, in which she also falsely claimed that the group was founded to fight the anti-Muslim discrimination that followed the 9/11 attacks. The organization, which has ties to the Hamas terror, was actually founded in 1994.
The backlash against Omar escalated after the New York Post printed her words on the front cover along with an image of the twin towers at the moment of impact. President Trump then joined fray, tweeting out a video montage of the attacks accompanied by Omar’s words.
In a video that surfaced last week, Omar can be seen dismissing the threat posed by al-Qaeda and other Islamic terror groups as a laughing matter and mocking Americans who display discomfort when discussing the groups, who she implies are no different than the American or British governments."
Conservative and Labour Parties Are Both Unfit to Govern Britain | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Douglas Murray,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/british-conservative-and-labour-parties-are-both-unfit-to-govern/,"About Douglas Murray April 16, 2019 1:47 PM A street vendor selling Union Jack flags passes a pro-Brexit supporter outside the Houses of Parliament in London, England, March 28, 2019. (Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters)
A great question looms over British politics. Should we smash the major parties? By “major parties” I obviously mean the Conservative and Labour parties. And when I say “we” I mean, of course, the British voting public. Since the government delayed Brexit once again this month, it seems that Britons will soon be asked to vote in this year’s European Parliament election. That will be three years after we voted to leave the European Union. With the Conservative government showing a monumental incompetence in matters great and small it looks as though we might also face a general election before this parliament comes to its purported end in 2022. Suddenly it looks as though the two-party system which was meant to be uncrackable could finally crack. Advertisement Advertisement
A YouGov poll carried out last week showed Labour coming top of the forthcoming EU elections (24 percent) and the Conservatives down 8 percent to only 16 percent. Only just behind them are Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party (15 percent) and Nigel Farage’s old Brexit party, UKIP (14 percent). So in the EU Parliament elections the Conservatives could well be beaten by a party that didn’t exist until last week. Some Conservatives appear to think, “Well that’s just the European elections: the public were always badly behaved during those.” Except that the British public’s ill-discipline no longer appears to be limiting itself to European elections. A YouGov poll on voting intentions in a general (domestic) election shows the Conservatives four points behind Labour at just 28 percent. For such an election the Brexit party and UKIP poll 8 percent and 6 percent respectively. And so we see the possibility here not just of a Labour government but of the Conservative party being destroyed.
Like a lot of Conservative voters, I no longer abhor the prospect. Not because we relish a Corbyn government — very far from it. A Corbyn government would put Britain on a road to national decline that would make the 1970s look like our heydays. But the Corbyn Labour party has its own problems. It is fighting against its own parliamentary party and in the country as a whole there is now a clear divide between the pro-EU Labour party that dominates in metropolitan areas like Islington (Corbyn’s own constituency) and the vast swathes of the north of England who voted to leave the European Union and are the Labour party’s only remaining base. Advertisement
The obvious thing for Labour is also to split. Something that began to happen in February when half a dozen Labour MPs (lead by Chuka Ummuna, once a Blairite hopeful for the party) walked out to form the “Independent Group,” which has now also been joined by a gaggle of “Remain” Conservative-elected MPs. This group also plans to run at forthcoming elections. And so when the British people next go to the ballot we might at least have a party to vote for that really wants to leave the EU and a party that really wants to stay in, rather than two parties that pretend that they want to leave.

If Britain’s relationship with the EU is going to continue to dominate our politics then this all has its advantages. But there are two meaningful problems. The first comes if Britain actually manages to leave the EU. In such a situation both new parties would surely slump — the main order of the day having been at least temporarily addressed. Each may continue to campaign to take us in their favored direction some years down the line, but a broad majority of the public would most likely believe the question to have been addressed at that point, and wish other questions — education, health, the economy, the rest of the world — to be addressed at some stage.

(Mary Schwalm/Reuters)
Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg offered an explanation Tuesday for why socialism has caught on lately among some lawmakers and voters.
“I think the reason we’re having this argument over socialism and capitalism is that capitalism has let a lot of people down,” the South Bend, Ind. mayor said on CNN, before stressing that democratic norms must underpin the capitalist system. “At the end of the day, we prioritize democracy. And having that framework of a rule of law, of fairness, is actually what it takes for markets to work.”
Buttigieg told CNBC last week that the U.S. is at a moment where “concentrated wealth has begun to turn into concentrated power.”
“American capitalism is one of the most productive forces ever known to man, and there’s so much that this country has been able to unlock, especially in the last century, in terms of technology, in terms of prosperity,” he said . “Now where it goes wrong is when it’s only being experienced in certain parts of the country or by certain kinds of people, and I think it goes to show just how important it is for capitalism to work that it be backed by all of the other pieces that business alone can’t solve.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

(John Gress/Reuters) He has zero appeal to religious conservatives because he holds to the Democratic party line on the right to kill viable, living unborn babies.
W ith every passing day, it seems we see yet another piece about South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg’s progressive Christianity. His faith is going to shake the race. He’s going to challenge the GOP monopoly on “God talk.” Here, for example, is the opening paragraph of an NBC News analysis posted yesterday afternoon:
Religious conservatives who have long been a reliable voting bloc for Republicans are grappling with a new challenge in Pete Buttigieg: how to respond to a Democratic presidential candidate who is leaning into the discussion about faith and its role in political life.
I’ll agree that there are religious conservatives who are “grappling” with a challenge from Buttigieg, but that challenge is theological and cultural, not political. Buttigieg’s religious arguments have triggered important online debates about the differences between mainline and Evangelical Christianity, about when religious teachings should influence public policy, and about how to interpret the history of the gay-marriage debate.
But religious conservatives are not grappling with the key political question — whether any meaningful number of Evangelicals or conservative Catholics would cross the aisle to cast a ballot for Mayor Pete. The reason is simple. Buttigieg is a pro-choice extremist, and no pro-choice extremist will ever meaningfully compete for the conservative Christian vote.
In fact, in at least one key way, Buttigieg’s record on abortion is even worse than that of his Democratic peers. He is of course in lockstep agreement with them on support for late-term abortion, and he made that clear last month on Morning Joe : Advertisement . @PeteButtigieg explains his support for late-term abortion bills in New York and Virginia:

But he’s done what many of them have not — he’s actually blocked a crisis-pregnancy center from opening at its chosen location. He not only supports abortion rights, he’s taken action against law-abiding Americans who merely wanted to make the case for life. Advertisement Advertisement
Last April, Buttigieg vetoed a rezoning plan that would have permitted a crisis-pregnancy center to open next door to a proposed abortion clinic. In his statement justifying the veto, Buttigieg said, “I don’t think it would be responsible to situate two groups, literally right next to each other, in a neighborhood, that have diametrically opposed views on the most divisive social issue of our time.”
And so, given the conflict, he chose to privilege the abortion clinic’s location over the pregnancy center. Thankfully, the center found a new location across the street from the proposed clinic — a location that didn’t require a rezoning vote. But that does not excuse or justify Buttigieg’s veto. He favored abortion rights over pro-life speech, and he likely violated the Constitution in doing so.
While Buttigieg, to his credit, did not demonize his opponents in the South Bend dispute ( “Many people that I respect and admire and appreciate have very passionate and very opposite views on what is the right thing to do,” he said of the dispute), actions speak louder than words. And this action echoes a dangerous Democratic trend in pro-choice governance: the attack against pro-life pregnancy clinics. Advertisement
Across the United States, progressive legislatures have passed laws aimed at crisis-pregnancy centers, including a California law the Supreme Court struck down just last summer. Buttigieg hasn’t gone as far as California, which actually required pro-life pregnancy centers to promote state-funded free and low-cost abortions. But he had an opportunity to fully respect the constitutional rights of his pro-life opponents, and he chose not to do so. Advertisement
Many young Evangelicals, including young Evangelical activists, are divided over matters such as same-sex marriage. Some believe Obergefell v. Hodges was wrongly decided, others support legal recognition of same-sex marriage so long as the state doesn’t interfere with the church’s ability to define marriage according to the historic doctrines of the Christian faith. Others support same-sex marriage constitutionally and theologically.
These same young Christians are often appalled that their older brothers and sisters in the faith have so easily overlooked Donald Trump’s multitude of sins. But they will not support politicians who support legal protections for late-term abortions. They won’t. The will not support politicians who don’t go beyond “respecting” pro-life Americans to also protecting their rights to free speech with the same vigor that they protect the First Amendment rights of pro-choice Americans.

(Brendan McDermid/Reuters)
Failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams suggested in an interview on Monday that recent bills placing various restrictions on access to abortion should collectively be referred to as “forced-pregnancy bills.”
“There are a number of bills around the country that are limiting women’s rights and access to abortion, and I wanted to ask you how can Democrats push back against these bills,” asked Root host Terrell Starr in an interview published on Monday.
“I think Democrats have to first call these bills what they are, which are forced-pregnancy bills. But we also have to acknowledge that access to abortion is part of reproductive health and therefore it’s part of reproductive justice,” she continued. “Particularly for African-American women, our lack of access to a full range of reproductive choices limits our ability to not only determine our families but it also harms our ability to engage in the economy.”
In the U.S., black women are more than five times more likely than white women to have an abortion, according to the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, and though they comprise just 32.2 percent of Georgia’s population, black women obtain 62.4 percent of the abortions performed in the state. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Starr presumably was referring to a collection of recently passed “heartbeat bills,” which prohibit abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected (typically around six weeks into pregnancy).
Ohio governor Mike DeWine recently signed a version of such legislation into law and similar bills have been passed by Republican-held state legislatures in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Georgia this year. The bills are not expected to survive the legal challenges immediately filed against them by groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood.
Abrams, who was bested by Republican Brian Kemp last year, has refused to concede the gubernatorial race and has alternated between blaming racism, voter suppression and, most recently, the political media’s “immaturity” and “incompetence” for her loss.
“I would attribute it less to racism and more to a very narrow and immature ability to navigate the story of my campaign,” Abrams told Starr when asked whether race played a role in her defeat."

As National Review has editorialized, the Equality Act is about coercion . It would force all federally funded entities to consider a man as a woman if he identifies as such. The scope of the Equality Act (H.R.5) is overreaching and would harm women and children most.
Gender identity laws and policies are already in place across the U.S. And one badly impacted area is women’s sports. In the state of Connecticut, two male students finished first and second in the girls’ high-school track championship. The Boston Athletic Association allows runners to compete according to their gender identity, regardless of whether they’ve undergone physical changes. Advertisement Advertisement
What’s the problem? Well, as the lesbian tennis star Martina Navratilova wrote in The Sunday Times of London, allowing male athletes to compete with women is “cheating” and has already allowed hundreds of athletes to achieve “honours as women that were beyond their capabilities as men.” Paula Radcliffe, Britain’s most celebrated female distance runner, who holds the world record for the fastest women’s marathon, has raised similar concerns .

Democrats Worry Bernie Sanders Can’t Win in 2020 | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D.

Bernie Sanders at the “We the People Summit” in Washington, D.C., April 1, 2019. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) Clever Democrats worry that the gentleman from Vermont won’t be able to defeat Trump in 2020.
‘W here is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?” T. S. Eliot asked. “Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?”
And where is the intelligence we have lost in cleverness ?
Cleverness is the plague of our political classes, an influenza of the intellect. The consultants are always trying to outsmart their rivals in the pettiest of ways and generally end up outsmarting themselves. The Affordable Care Act was and is a legislative and administrative train wreck, but it sure sounded clever (to someone ) to be able to say it was a “Republican plan,” a “conservative proposal,” a creature of Mitt Romney or the American Enterprise Institute, etc. Never mind that that isn’t exactly true — it sure sounded clever! Advertisement Advertisement
(To someone .)
The clever people in the Democratic party have turned their attention to Senator Bernie Sanders, the creepy Brooklyn red who for some reason represents Vermont in the Senate, functionally as a member of the Democratic party, an equally creepy political organization to which he does not belong but whose presidential nomination he nonetheless is seeking a second time. Advertisement
Stop Sanders! is the cry of the moment from Cambridge, Mass., to Tiburon, Calif., and everywhere that clever Democrats gather. The worry is that Senator Sanders’s grumpy-Muppet shtick will not discreetly charm the bourgeoisie, that his disheveled populism and his unmade bed of a mind will not be a smash hit with well-heeled swing voters in the moneyed suburbs of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida — which, the clever people inform us, is where the real action is going to be in 2020. They aren’t out there screaming “A vote for Sanders is a vote for Trump!” just yet, but they are scheming behind the scenes, and the moneymen of the party already are so alarmed that they are making approximately the same sound that Donald Sutherland makes at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
Senator Sanders is a misunderstood figure, in part because he himself started listening to the clever people once he began to look like a genuine threat to Herself in 2016. In the earliest part of that primary campaign, Senator Sanders was a slightly different kind of political animal, and a more authentic one: He was one part apocalyptic Berkeley sandwich-board screamer and one part . . . Donald Trump, as a matter of curious fact, and not just because of the honking outer-borough accent. Advertisement
If you think “populist” means Donald Trump, then you might be forgiven for thinking that the enemy of populism is the Democratic party, its agenda, and its associates. If you think “populism” means Bernie Sanders, then you probably think that the enemy of populism is the Republican party, its agenda, and its associates. But “populism” encompasses both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, and its enemy is neither the Democratic party nor the Republican party but liberalism , here understood not in the illiterate contemporary political sense (nice NPR-listening people in sweaters with darling gay friends, also in sweaters) but in its proper sense, as the political order based on liberty in the form of individual rights to life, liberty, and property, secured against the state through the rule of law and procedural democracy.

Liberalism is associated with limited government, international accords based on certain necessarily universalist principles, and free enterprise, including free trade. Its principal rivals on the world stage are nationalism and socialism, which in the democratic theater present themselves as populism, a dynamic of opposition between the people as masses and loci of incumbent power, which are variously known, depending on the particular flavor of populism at play, as “elites,” “globalists,” “international bankers,” “Big Business,” “capitalism,” “the Jews,” “rootless cosmopolitans,” etc. Populism seeks to overrule liberalism, either categorically or in a piecemeal fashion as the whims of the people dictate.

Hence the substantial overlap between Sanders and Trump in 2016, on trade, on immigration, on military spending, on foreign policy, on Wall Street’s taxes, and much else. Sanders has evolved , as they say, most prominently in how he talks about immigration, a subject that occasionally put him on the wrong side of the intersectionality police. He remains much more of an immigration skeptic than is the median Democratic aspirant to the 2020 nomination, as his recent denunciation of “open borders” makes obvious enough. But gone is the strident and indeed nationalist tone of those 2016 union-hall meetings.
The Democrats are worried that even this kinder, gentler Bernie would not be able to defeat Trump in 2020. But they may have it backward: The 2016 union-hall Bernie’s frank embrace of both nationalism and socialism is probably a better representation of the actual ideals and aspirations of the majority of voters sympathetic to the Democratic party than is his new well-scrubbed and considerably more circumspect incarnation, which is more Ann Arbor than Flint, more UWS than UAW. Advertisement
But if you’re good at chess you tend to see the world as a chessboard, and the clever people do not seek a grand strategy in which Senator Sanders leads the Democrats to victory — and, more dear to them, to a national repudiation of Donald Trump — in 2020. As they build imaginary coalitions, collating battleground states and cross-referencing interest groups, they see in the loopy gentleman from Vermont an instrument too unwieldy for the subtlety of their purposes.

"Remembering Andy Marshall: Great Geo-Strategist, Great Man | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jerry Hendrix,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/remembering-andrew-marshall/,"April 17, 2019 6:30 AM Andrew Marshall at a retirement farewell ceremony at the Pentagon, January 5, 2015. (Master Sergeant Adrian Cadiz/US Army) Andrew Marshall, first director of the Office of Net Assessment, was a great man.
A ndrew W. Marshall, the eminent defense strategist, spoke sharply to me only once in the ten years I knew him. A remarkably kind and humble man, Andy Marshall was successful for over four decades in the Pentagon and, more broadly, in Washington, D.C. This success, and the legend that came to be attached to him in the final decades of his 97-year-long life, grew from Marshall’s qualities as an individual, the methodology of “net assessment” that he developed, and the way he ran the Office of Net Assessment. Advertisement
Andy Marshall died March 26.
Marshall was a standout as a young student. After a heart murmur medically disqualified him for military service during World War II, he attended both the University of Detroit and Wayne State College while working in factories. He took an interest in history, literature, math, and the sciences, but his formal education came to focus on economics and system modeling. After the war and without actually graduating from Wayne State, he applied to and was accepted by the University of Chicago to pursue a master’s in economics. While there, he became interested in understanding how the world actually worked as a macro-political-economic-security system. In his spare time, he worked in the university’s Institute for Nuclear Studies, where he leveraged his experience as a tool-maker in Detroit’s factories to upgrade the university’s cyclotron.
Marshall completed his degree requirements in 1949 and accepted a job offer from the relatively new RAND Corporation, a federally funded research and development center in Santa Monica, Calif. Years later, while working for him, I often fielded questions from senior officials, both foreign and domestic, as to how they should address him: “Do we call him Director Marshall or Dr. Marshall?” “No,” was my instructed reply, “it’s just Andy Marshall.” Advertisement
At RAND, Marshall worked with such luminaries as Herbert Goldhamer, Charles Hitch, Herman Kahn, and Albert Wohlstetter. Marshall spent 20 years with RAND and enjoyed its multi-disciplinary approach and collegial work environment. “Rank” had no place in those early RAND studies, as young minds were expected to contribute just as much as the more experienced researchers, although almost everyone at RAND was young then. During this era of his life, Marshall examined a wide array of issues but also quietly began to develop a broad multi-disciplinary practice of analysis that he called “net assessment.” Advertisement
Combining aspects of economics, history, organizational behavior, business management theory, and grand strategy with his strong respect for the sciences, Marshall sought a better way to measure the relative power of opposing nations. For instance, while examining how the Soviet Union was preparing to defend itself against outside bomber attacks, he discovered that the United States’ bomber force imposed a significant cost upon the Soviet Union by forcing it to deploy anti-air guns and missiles along its long borders. Marshall understood that money spent on defensive weapons could not be spent on offensive systems that would be arrayed against the United States. This idea of asymmetric cost imposition—of finding ways to exploit an enemy’s inherent weaknesses with your strength—began to define his research. In 1969 Henry Kissinger brought Marshall to Washington, D.C., to assess the intelligence products being provided to the White House. Marshall and his wife, Mary, moved into a temporary apartment with rented furniture, always intending to return to their home in Santa Monica. Advertisement
Andy Marshall ended up spending several years performing net assessments for Kissinger within the White House, but in 1973, when his former colleague at RAND, Dr. James Schlesinger, was named secretary of defense, Marshall was transferred to the Pentagon to establish an Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the Department of Defense. Marshall was appointed ONA’s first director by Richard Nixon and was subsequently reappointed by each successive president through Barack Obama, a 42-year epoch that overlapped with 13 secretaries of defense. Beyond Marshall’s long life and intellectual vitality, the reasons for his longevity lay in the type of people he picked to work with him, the quality of ONA’s products, and Marshall’s nearly unique professional humility. Advertisement
I was picked to work in ONA as part of a team of professionals who all shared a predilection to challenge established norms. We were intellectually curious and uniform in our belief that working in ONA was the best job we ever had. Those I’ve met who came before my time in the office, and those who came after me, nearly all share this opinion. Most of Marshall’s military assistants were not “hot runners” in our respective military services, and in my time with him he consistently rejected the “superstar” candidates who were sent to him by various service leaders in favor of more iconoclastic intellects. Advertisement
Not all of Marshall’s military assistants found success within their services. Some, such as General Lance Lord and General Paul Selva, the current vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, went all the way to four-star rank, but most left military service and found their greatest influence elsewhere, such as James Roche, who worked for Marshall as a Navy commander but went on to become secretary of the Air Force, or Andrew Krepinevich, who served as a lieutenant colonel under Marshall but went on to head an influential think tank. All of Marshall’s military assistants worked well together. He had a good instinct for group dynamics and led them by posing the big questions facing the Department of Defense. Marshall was in every sense the director of the office’s efforts, but he was also comfortable both asking and taking questions, and he continued to mentor and guide many of us after we left his office. He became our friend, and we became his family. Advertisement Advertisement
Marshall set no deadlines, but he expected his assistants to produce useful and original work. A person would join the office, spend a few days or weeks reading up on its history and ongoing projects, and only then sit down with Marshall to set out on a new project in collaboration with him or others. In meetings one often got the idea that he was asking a question that he had raised several times before but wanted to see if anyone would offer a new, surprising approach. Marshall was a voracious reader with an eclectic range of tastes. He would often drop books or articles on the desks of his military assistants and then stop by a few days later to see if they had read the materials. Always, always, he would ask, “what did that make you think of?” Marshall was never simply interested in what the written word said but rather was curious as to where it took the reader’s mind. To work with him (one never got the sense of working for Andy Marshall so much as working with him) was to be on a constant path of collaborative intellectual growth. The “work” never ended, and that was acceptable because the “work” was never the normal drudgery that one often endured in traditional military service. Advertisement
Of course, it was the power of ONA’s products that propelled it and its director to great influence. The initial set of net assessments of U.S. competition with the Soviet Union were delivered in the opening days of the Carter administration, and the power of their diagnoses was such that then–Secretary of Defense Harold Brown made the decision to keep ONA open and to retain the service of Andrew Marshall. Marshall’s net assessments identified offsetting technologies such as stealth, precision strike weapons, and space-based surveillance, positioning, and timing systems as key enablers of potential U.S. dominance. He also correctly ascertained that the Soviet economy was much smaller than suspected and that the United States would prevail in the long-term competition with the communist state.
Later he identified the importance of continuous innovation, strongly supporting what he termed “revolutions in military affairs.” He also identified China as a rising threat in the early 1990s, long before any other voice in the national-security establishment. He missed some developments as well, but his overall predictive abilities were better than any grand strategist of his generation, and the power of his trend analysis will continue to influence decision-makers for years to come.
Marshall also greatly influenced the broader strategic community. Many have written about the cadre of strategists that he trained and mentored, and this certainly was a big part of his growing influence. Those who had worked for him gained reputations for being able to identify the right strategic questions and mastered their national-security portfolios in government, academia, think tanks, and industry. Marshall also used his small studies budget to fund ongoing research on important topics through the think tanks, academic institutions, and private consultants who were willing to gore more than a few sacred cows. He created and sustained a vital intellectual “churn” of ideas in an era that was increasingly characterized by strategic calcification and hubris. A system of interlocking net assessments, sponsored studies, and exercises was the real source of Marshall’s influence.
It was this influence that created Marshall’s “aura” as the “Yoda” of the Pentagon, the wise seer and adviser to the powerful. It would be a lie to say that those of us who worked for him were unaware of his reputation. It was, in fact, hard at times to differentiate the humble man who became our mentor and friend from the legend that grew around him over decades of national service. Marshall himself remained largely oblivious to his reputation and comported himself with humility. He was naturally quiet. When he developed a new analytical product, he presented it to the secretary of defense instead of sharing his insights widely, even if such sharing would have brought him more fame and influence within the labyrinth of the Pentagon. He was a counselor with one client — the defense secretary — and he kept his focus on that relationship. His willingness to be the unseen adviser to the senior minister to the president on national security was his core strength, and he employed it well. Advertisement
Marshall conversed as easily with my father, a dignified and respected dairy and crop farmer from Indiana, at my last promotion ceremony as he did with secretaries of defense. Dad told me later, “I know he’s a great man. You told me, but he seems like a normal guy from Michigan to me.” He was never impressed with himself. He never bought into the “Yoda” appellation, and it was that humility that provoked the only sharp words he ever spoke to me."
Defend the American Experiment by Protecting the Constitution | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,James L. Buckley,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/protect-constitution-defend-american-experiment/,"About James L. Buckley April 17, 2019 6:30 AM Detail of Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States by Howard Chandler Christy, 1940 (Wikimedia) The Constitution’s safeguards will be protected only as long as the public continues to understand and respect them.
Editor’s Note: The following article is adapted from James L. Buckley’s speech at the National Review Institute Ideas Summit. Before the speech, Buckley announced that it would be his final public appearance.
I thank you for this opportunity to submit my own thoughts on safeguarding the American experiment. What I will propose is a simple reform that would restore a healthy federalism while saving state governments and the feds a pot of money. Advertisement Advertisement
But first, my credentials, such as they are: As I have served in each branch of our federal government, I have been engaged in writing, administering, and interpreting federal laws for much of my working life. Accordingly, I think it is fair to say that I have had more than the average citizen’s opportunity to observe their impact on our lives and the radical changes that have been brought about in how we are governed.
To illustrate the speed with which those changes have taken place, shortly after my election in 1970, I was handed a recent study of Congress that had concluded that the work of the average congressional office had doubled every five years since 1936. Given the fact that, in simpler times, Congress worked at a leisurely pace and was in session for only five or six months a year, its members could take the initial increases in stride simply by devoting more hours per day and more months per year to their work. Over time, however, the available hours and months had been exhausted, and the doubling could only be accommodated by squeezing deliberation out of the legislative process.
This pressure-cooker existence has been the consequence of Congress’s compulsion, beginning in the 1930s, to scratch every itch on the body politic whether it was its constitutional business or not. The result has been an explosion of federal laws and regulations. In 1934, the United States Code consisted of a single volume of federal statutes, the work product of our Congress’s first 137 years. But just 36 years later, when I was elected to the Senate, it had grown to eleven volumes. The current edition now contains thirty-four. But those are just the tip of the governmental iceberg because they are supplemented by an ever-expanding number of small-print regulations that have the force of law and now fill an additional 242 volumes. Those federal laws and regulations now reach into every corner of our lives, and those affected by them must turn to their representatives in Washington for help with matters that were once handled at the state or municipal levels. Advertisement Advertisement
All of these legislative and constitutional pressures have converted Congress from an institution that could once think problems through to responsible conclusions into one that largely substitutes political reflex for reflection. And to compound the injury, a harried Congress now finds it so hard to focus on the messy details of new legislation that it increasingly abdicates its constitutional responsibilities by delegating essentially legislative authority to executive agencies, thereby spawning a largely unaccountable administrative state; an administrative state that issues letters instructing schools on who may use which bathroom without bothering with the pesky procedures that require the scrutiny of new rules before they take effect.
In my view, the serious problems we face these days are in major part the result of our abandonment of the Constitution’s limits on federal authority. American independence was won and the Republic created by a remarkable generation of men who turned a rebellion against the British crown into a transforming moment in human history, one based on the revolutionary proposition that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with fundamental rights that no government has the moral authority to set aside. But with the gaining of independence, the Founders faced the formidable task of creating a government that could operate effectively while respecting and protecting the liberties for which the Revolution had been fought.
The architects of the American Republic had no illusions about human nature, which is the one constant in human affairs. From their study of the history of free societies reaching back to ancient Greece, they understood that the drive to accumulate power, whether by an individual despot or a parliamentary majority, was the historic enemy of individual freedom. They therefore incorporated two safeguards into the Constitution: its system of separation of powers with its checks and balances and the principle of federalism. In describing the latter, James Madison explained:
The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. … The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.
During the debates over the Constitution’s ratification, many expressed a concern that this allocation of responsibilities was not clear enough in the document itself. As a consequence, the first Congress made it explicit in the Tenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights, which provides that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
The Tenth Amendment’s allocation of powers mirrors those of the venerable Rule of Subsidiarity, which assigns responsibilities to the lowest levels capable of handling them. Its effect is to decentralize political power and ensure, wherever feasible, that the decisions that most directly affect people will be made by those who are the closest to them and most familiar with both their priorities and the relevant facts. Advertisement
This explicit division of governmental labors proved so effective that in a lecture on the American Constitution, with which he had some problems, the great British historian, Lord Acton, nevertheless concluded that “by the development of the principle of federalism, [the American Constitution] has produced a community more powerful, more prosperous, more intelligent, and more free than any other the world has seen.” Advertisement Advertisement
During our first 140 years, Washington largely observed those limits. With the advent of the New Deal, however, it began chipping away at the states’ authority largely through some rather imaginative constructions of the federal government’s power to regulate interstate commerce. But with the advent of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, Congress began a wholesale assumption of the states’ responsibilities. This was done through a proliferation of programs that offer states and their subdivisions regulation-ridden grants of money for purposes that are acknowledged to be the sole responsibility of the states.
Congress found its authority to create such programs in an unfortunate Supreme Court construction of the Constitution’s Spending Clause, which empowers it to spend money “to pay the debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” The mischief lies in the words “general Welfare.” During much of our history, the prevailing view was that that phrase did no more than place a limit on Congress’s authority to spend by requiring that federal expenditures serve national as opposed to state or local purposes. Beginning with the 1937 case of Steward Machine Co. v. Davis , however, the Supreme Court has held that in its pursuit of the general welfare, Congress is authorized to provide states with funds with which to implement programs that Congress itself has no power to write into law. The Court recently summarized that holding as enabling Congress to use federal tax revenues to “induce the States to adopt policies that the Federal Government itself could not impose.” But because grants programs deal with matters that are acknowledged to be beyond Congress’s constitutional authority, the Court has ruled that the states may not be coerced into accepting the grants and their attendant regulations. Experience, however, has demonstrated that the states find it enormously difficult to decline them whatever their conditions. Thus the practical effect of the Court’s decision has been to empower Congress to, yes, coerce the states into adopting Washington’s approach to matters that remain the states’ exclusive responsibility. Advertisement
These programs, which are laden with the most detailed instructions, now provide federal subsidies for virtually every activity in which states and their subdivisions are engaged and have made a major contribution to the federal government’s vast expansion. In the process, they distort state priorities, impose ponderous regulations on myriad state and local activities, and deprive their citizens of effective control over how their own taxes are to be used. In sum, they have converted the states in too many ways into mere administrators of programs created in Washington and overseen by bureaucrats who are the furthest removed from where the money is to be spent. As one former Democratic governor put it, “I honestly wondered if I was actually elected governor or just branch manager of Nebraska for the federal government.” Advertisement
Members of Congress have become addicted to grants programs (there are now well over a thousand of them) because they deal with matters that have the most immediate impacts on their constituents’ lives, such as housing, schooling, job training, potholes, you name it. Therefore, their creation and the securing of grants offer them the easiest way to rub elbows with voters and generate the favorable local headlines that will assure their reelection. As a consequence, whereas those programs distributed just $24 billion when I was elected, by 2015 that figure had reached almost $641 billion, or one-sixth of total federal spending, all for purposes that are none of Washington’s business. To that figure should be added another $60-odd billion representing the estimated cost to the federal government of administering the programs. And my understanding is that in the last fiscal year, they have now reached the mid-$700 billions. To compound the injury, instead of concentrating on the critical problems that only Congress can address, its members now devote major portions of their time on matters that are none of their constitutional business.
In short, these programs have effectively nullified the Tenth Amendment, and, in the process, helped undermine Congress’s ability to function effectively. But what can be done about it? Four years ago, I had the temerity to write a book with the title Saving Congress from Itself , in which I detailed the extraordinary systemic and financial costs of those programs on both state and federal levels and proposed a simple reform that would restore federalism; namely, their conversion into block grants free of federal directives telling the states how the money was to be spent. It is a reform that, at one stroke, would reduce federal spending by major amounts in administrative costs alone, rid Congress of a significant distraction from its essential national responsibilities, and restore the people’s ability to control their own state and local affairs. Needless to say, Congress has yet to act on my advice. Advertisement Advertisement
I recognize, however, that we now live in novel times. The power to move political mountains is passing from printed books to the social media, or so I’m told. So there may be another way to force congressional attention. What I dream of is a tweet in which the president advises Congress that he will veto any bill that tells the states how to run their own affairs. Such a tweet would stir up a vigorous debate of the merits of my proposal and encourage its adoption. It might even remind our countrymen that our Constitution indeed places limits on what the federal government may engage in and that the enforcement of those limits might well be in their interest.
If such a debate were to arise, I believe my reform would have a good chance of being adopted. Confidence in the federal government is at an all-time low, and our people still understand the virtues of the Constitution’s allocation of governmental responsibilities even if they are no longer aware of its existence. According to 2013 polling data, today’s Americans believe that state and local governments are best able to handle the following responsibilities by the indicated percentages: housing (by 82 percent of those polled), transportation (78 percent), education (75 percent), and welfare (69 percent). Those are precisely the kinds of responsibilities that the Constitution has reserved to the states, the kinds that federal agencies have taken over.
There is, of course, another way to restore a vigorous federalism, and that is to persuade the Supreme Court to abandon its 1937 interpretation of the Spending Clause. As I noted earlier, the Court has placed a single limit on Congress’s ability to transfer money to the states for purposes that are their exclusive business: namely, the states may not be coerced into accepting the funds and their accompanying baggage.
Eighty years of experience has demonstrated that what is perceived as free money from Washington is virtually impossible to resist whatever the conditions attached to it, and for politically significant reasons. If a state does not participate in a program, its share of the money — money derived in whole or in part from its own taxpayers — will go elsewhere. I say this despite the fact that 23 states declined to participate in Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid coverage. Their refusal to do so, however, was an exception that proved the rule. Having experienced the huge collateral costs of their existing Medicaid programs, those states merely declined to compound the injury.
In light of this experience, I believe there is a chance that the Supreme Court might reverse its 1937 ruling on the basis that those grants have proven to be inherently coercive. I base this on the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education , which declared that racial segregation is unconstitutional. In doing so, it overturned its own 57-year-old precedent, in Plessy v. Ferguson , that held that racially segregated facilities are permissible so long as they are equal. The Court reversed Plessy on the ground that experience had proven that segregated facilities are inherently unequal. Accordingly, I can envision the Court reversing Steward Machine Co. on a showing that the grants are indeed coercive. All that is needed to test this thesis is for a group of frustrated governors to challenge the constitutionality of a particularly aggravating category of grants, such as Medicaid. And if any of you have the intimate ear of governors around the country, please urge them to pay attention to what I’ve just said.
But whether or not the Court or Congress obliges me in this regard, we can never relax in our work to protect the Constitution, and its Framers understood this. They understood that preserving the liberties for which the Revolution had been fought would require more than what James Madison referred to as the Constitution’s parchment barriers. They recognized that, in the last analysis, the Constitution’s safeguards would be protected only as long as the public continued to understand and respect them. Advertisement
Unfortunately, over the past generation and more, our educators have abdicated their responsibility to ground their students in the fundamentals of the American experience. As a result, far too many people are suffering from a peculiar form of historical amnesia. They remember all our past sins, such as slavery and our treatment of the Indians. But too few have a sufficient awareness of the constitutional and economic principles that, on the historical record, had made ours the most productive, prosperous, innovative, generous, and free society the world had known; principles that are responsible for the freedoms and material well-being they take so much for granted. But note that I used the word “had” because thanks to the administrative state, we are no longer the world’s freest."
Eric Kaufmann’s ‘Whiteshift’: Immigration Debate and White Identity Politics | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/immigration-debate-white-identity-politics-whiteshift-book/,"April 17, 2019 6:30 AM Naturalization ceremony in Los Angeles, Calif., in 2013. (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters) Are white identity politics a solution to our racial woes?
E ric Kaufmann’s Whiteshift is in part a very long, very academic exploration of how immigration is playing out across the West — in particular, of how white majorities are responding to demographic change, including through political resistance, “white flight,” intermarriage, and broadening the definition of whiteness to include those of mixed heritage (a category that includes Kaufmann himself). Advertisement Advertisement
But it’s also, in part, a normative argument about how society should change in response to these trends if it wants to avoid a backlash and potentially even violence, and Kaufmann’s core suggestion is an eye-catcher. He says we need to be more open to anti-immigration arguments rooted in white “ethno-traditional nationalism” — i.e., in the desire of whites to maintain a given ethnic balance in their home countries. This would resolve the double standard in which minority groups are allowed to engage in identity politics but whites are not, a double standard that will become harder to maintain as whites themselves become a minority group. And it would let populists talk out loud about what’s really bothering them, demographic change, so that it can be addressed through policy.
Kaufmann may have a point in regards to Europe — that’s not my area, literally or figuratively — but his narrative doesn’t quite hold up here in the States. Mass immigration poses real difficulties, but at least here, there’s little sign that these problems are reaching any sort of white-backlash crisis point. We don’t need to give in to identity politics and jettison the ideal of colorblindness. To the contrary, maintaining and strengthening this ideal may be the key to winning over the country’s center when its Left is falling off the deep end — and meanwhile, there are concrete changes to the immigration system that can aggressively address the concerns of populists without alienating the middle. Advertisement
The U.S. Is Not Courting an Unmanageable Anti-Immigration Backlash
Let’s start with a Gallup chart that has profoundly influenced my own thinking on immigration and that is discussed for a few pages in Whiteshift as well. (Pew has a very similar chart, for a question specifically about legal immigration, here .) There’s a simple and straightforward way of interpreting it, as well as a far more convoluted way.
The straightforward interpretation is this: The worst of the backlash to the immigration changes passed in the late 1960s, and the illegal-immigration wave that crested in the late 1990s, is already behind us. The desire to reduce immigration is at all-time lows; the desire to increase it is at all-time highs; and the rock-solid median answer is to just leave immigration at its current level. (The shifts are also far too big to be just the result of immigrants themselves answering the poll.) Increasing immigration does not seem smart given that two-thirds of Americans oppose such a move, but cutting immigration looks no better, if we’re talking purely about public opinion.
A Pew question on whether immigrants strengthen or burden the country is also helpful, because the results are broken out by generation since 1994. It shows that generations of Americans have generally become more supportive of immigration as they’ve aged, and also that each generation starts off more pro-immigration than the last. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Kaufmann’s discussion of the chart included above is sensible. (His version ends earlier, presumably reflecting the most recent data available as he went to press.) He writes that increased immigration “took place against a backdrop of large-scale liberal attitude change,” with “egalitarian and humanitarian” attitudes on the upswing and an ethos of “universalist individualism” taking root while older, more closed-minded cohorts died off.
But it’s also worth checking his broader narrative of immigration, presented elsewhere in the book, against these data. Part of his case is that populists and extremists can cause problems even if they can’t win elections, which of course is true. But he also argues — in part using lab experiments in which researchers try to trick people into saying what they really think about touchy issues — that (A) political-correctness norms are so strong that whites may be underreporting their opposition to immigration (by as much as half in one study) and (B) populist movements succeed by shattering these norms, opening up space for whites who privately oppose immigration to oppose it publicly as well.
How much you buy this narrative will depend on your trust in Kaufmann’s psychology studies ( replication crisis anyone?) and how plausible you find it a priori . I don’t buy it much at all; in surveys such as the ones above, there may be some misreporting from Americans cowed by the PC haranguings they suffered in college, but “we should have less immigration” is not some beyond-the-pale sentiment that no one will admit to. In addition, open restrictionism has declined since Trump entered the scene, suggesting that if “woke” norms, rather than changing opinions, really are a big part of the story, even a successful presidential candidate who went on about Mexican rapists and Muslim bans did nothing to break them. Indeed, one theory for the recent uptick in support for immigration, which NRO’s Teddy Kupfer explored here , is that the public actually reacts against politicians who turn up the populist heat on issues the way Trump did (and is continuing to do). Advertisement Advertisement
Another consequence of immigration that Kaufmann explores is segregation — the tendency of people to live around others like them. This is, of course, a very real thing: Immigrants set up shop near other immigrants; whites often leave changing neighborhoods or avoid heavily minority ones. If you think human beings lost their natural instinct toward homophily the instant MLK said that thing about the content of your character, Kaufmann’s data will come as an enormous shock. But I was more surprised to see him spend rather little time on a question that might be more important: Are these tendencies getting better or worse ? Advertisement
In fact, one important study found that whites are avoiding diverse areas less than they used to. Another found that “white segregation from others declined significantly from 1980 to 2010, regardless of the measure of segregation or the [definition of the] white population used.” Looking at more specific forms of segregation, whites and blacks are becoming less separated , albeit more slowly than we should want to be the case. White/Hispanic segregation is harder to measure in an informative way — it’s a complicated mix of white flight and avoidance, new immigrants flowing into ethnic enclaves, and immigrants’ descendants integrating into the wider society (sometimes ceasing to identify as Hispanic at all) — but it generally appears to be steady or declining, and at any rate Hispanics have always been less separated from whites than blacks are.
Roughly a third of Americans say they want to reduce immigration — including a quarter who even want to reduce legal immigration — and these folks tend to place the most importance on the issue, so anti-immigration voters can certainly play a huge role in politics, especially with a little push from the math of the Electoral College. But most Americans seem just fine with the level of immigration we have currently, immigration is getting more popular with time, and while segregation will be with us for as long as we are a multiethnic society, it is generally headed in the right direction. Intermarriage is up as well, as Kaufmann documents. Advertisement
Are there changes we should make that the populists would like? Hell yes, as I’ll explain in a bit. Our current immigration system is a farce that does not serve the national interest. But I’m just not sold that these problems are reaching such a crisis point that American society needs to make a deliberate effort to welcome arguments based on “white identity,” voiding the implicit contract whites signed when they got on board with the civil-rights movement, rather than just fixing that system.
Wait, Then How Did Trump Win?
One might reasonably reply: Isn’t the 2016 election unambiguous evidence that immigration opposition is higher than polls would suggest? I don’t think so. Trump’s road to the White House was a fairly odd one, and he had numerous advantages besides his views on immigration, starting with high name recognition and an enviable knack for attracting media attention. The share of Americans who are enthusiastic Trump supporters is fairly small, easily reconcilable with the share who want less immigration.
In the earliest primaries , Trump won only about a third of the Republican vote. The number rose as other candidates dropped out and he gained momentum, but even if we count all of the primary votes — including in states where he faced no opposition at all — only 45 percent of Republicans voted for Trump. He won the nomination not by representing the party’s consensus, but by carving out a niche and benefiting from the fact that the rest of the party was severely fragmented. Then, in the general election, he won only 46 percent of the popular vote, not even a plurality (Clinton won 48 percent). He won the Electoral College thanks to a series of narrow victories in Rust Belt swing states where his message particularly resonated, and as Kaufmann notes, a lot of his voters were simply Republicans who’d have backed whomever the GOP nominated.
It’s also worth asking how much of the Trump phenomenon was even about race and immigration, as opposed to the famed standard explanation of “economic anxiety” (or more nuanced theories such as Tim Carney’s belief that Trump’s appeal was largely to whites in areas with low social capital). Trump made immigration a major part of his campaign, and to top it off he said such outrageous things about the topic that, in order to vote for him, one almost needed to have “ a certain indifference to minority concerns ,” as Ross Douthat has put it. Kaufmann goes much further, though, saying that Trump’s core of support (and that for Brexit as well) really just boils down to white anxiety about demographic change. This despite the fact that, in one of Kaufmann’s own surveys, only a quarter of people who rated Trump a perfect 10/10 saw immigration as their top issue. Advertisement
There are strong signs that economics mattered. An especially interesting and rigorous study — from the economist David Autor and several coauthors, employing a complicated statistical technique called “instrumental variables” — found that places with growing exposure to Chinese imports shifted to Trump, and in fact that Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania would have voted for Clinton had import growth been slowed by half.
How is this study addressed in Whiteshift , which for 500+ pages suffocates its poor readers under a constant avalanche of academic citations? It’s not , perhaps because Kaufmann categorically refuses to look at research that analyzes the geography of the Trump vote as opposed to the attitudes of individual Trump voters, writing, basically, that only idiot journalists draw conclusions based on looking at maps.
Certainly, there are limits to what we can learn from geography, and certainly some geographical patterns (such as the urban/rural split) are far less dramatic when you take individual-level factors (such as education) into account. But there are also limits to how much we can learn from analyzing survey data — i.e., building statistical models, based on questions people may not even have answered honestly, in the hopes of sussing out what truly motivates them deep down . There are even bigger limits to the numerous small-scale social-psychology experiments Kaufmann cites, as well as the opt-in surveys he runs himself. (Again: replication crisis!) You really do need to look at all the evidence available, and the Autor et al. study is strong evidence that economic factors played at least some role.
Trump won fair and square: He got the most delegates in the primary by far, and he won the Electoral College by an enormous margin as well. He might well repeat this performance next year. But his route to victory was quirky, to say the least, and does not force the conclusion that he tapped into a hidden wealth of white-identity-based anti-immigration sentiment lurking in American voters. Most general-election voters, and most Republican-primary voters as well, in fact marked their ballots for someone else — and even his core supporters were not solely motivated by worries about demographic change.
Open White-Identity Politics Are More Plausible Than You May Think . . . but Probably Not the Solution to Much of Anything
Until recently, the split in American politics on racial issues, as played out in the public square, has been between conservatives who insist on colorblindness and liberals who support race-based forms of atonement for this country’s numerous and severe sins against African Americans. But a lot has changed. It has become abundantly clear that growing minority groups, in particular Hispanics and Asians, will be included on both sides of the racial spoils system that liberals have established over the years, most notably including affirmative action — which is of course nonsensical if the purpose of such remedies is to make up for the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow. Also, as Kaufmann deftly explains, liberals, especially white liberals, have shifted drastically to the left on racial matters since about 2015.
The Right faces a decision: Do we double down on colorblindness, or do we insist that white people should get to have identity politics too? When Kaufmann says whites must be allowed to voice fears of demographic change — and that the anti-immigration arguments they’re using now are merely a cover for those fears — he doesn’t say it’s the Right that should shift its rhetoric. But given where the parties are today on race, it’s really not an open question which side this movement would begin on.
Let’s unpack some of the issues involved and the political consequences of going this route. And since everyone agrees that “racism” is bad, that word is a good place to start. Advertisement
As Kaufmann explains, the Left has taken the lead in warping the definition of the term in recent years. I have pushed back against many of these efforts myself; for instance, I think it is absurd to label good-faith empirical claims about racial differences as racist , or to insist that race-based antipathy for whites is somehow not racist . Like Kaufmann, I tend to think that “racism” has to involve, at minimum, some type of ill will against a racial group or a creepy desire for racial purity.
But I blanched at Kaufmann’s defense of “ethno-traditional nationalism,” the desire to preserve the ethnic mix of one’s country, which he insists is not racist. I don’t think it’s a problem at all to resist cultural change, to seek to preserve a way of life in the country or neighborhood around you. Indeed this type of argument is openly debated in public, at least on the right. (Just within the National Review family, see Ramesh Ponnuru and Dennis Prager ; liberals make basically the same case when they oppose gentrification.) I also don’t see how it would be racist to point out that, as a simple matter of fact, people of different ethnicities often don’t get along — and to assert that it’s a legitimate aim of immigration policy to control those tensions. (This played a role in my own thinking back in my more restrictionist days.)
But opposing immigration because you yourself don’t want more people of other races around? That . . . pretty much sounds racist to me.
Yet most of the public disagrees, at least if you phrase the question gingerly. Kaufmann details a survey that asked the following:
A White American who identifies with her group and its history supports a proposal to reduce immigration. Her motivation is to maintain her group’s share of America’s population. Is this person: 1) just acting in her racial self-interest, which is not racist; 2) being racist; 3) don’t know.
Only 11 percent of white Trump voters, 39 percent of the general public, and 73 percent of white Clinton voters thought this was racist. And Kaufmann further shows that even liberals don’t think race-based immigration preferences are racist if you mess with the question a little, to make it about a minority who wants to increase the size of his own group.
These are fascinating results. On a purely political level, the calculation here is more complicated than I might have thought: An argument that I would consider racist is perhaps not that big of a turn-off to the public, a realization many of us also had when Trump consolidated the support of nearly half the country. And Kaufmann has other data as well suggesting that plenty of whites (and even many conservative minorities) aren’t thrilled about the demographic changes that are taking root.
But wait a minute.
If about 60 percent of the country, including a not-insignificant fraction of Clinton voters, is already willing to say in a survey that this isn’t racist, why do only about half that number say they want lower levels of immigration without having to specify a reason at all? It’s important that the question is whether such an appeal is racist, and thus outside the bounds of legitimate debate, not whether such an appeal is, well, appealing — especially when compared with all the other arguments one might make against immigration, including ones involving general cultural change, which tap into somewhat related concerns; and especially when other surveys suggest that whites really like thinking of themselves as colorblind , a phenomenon that is mostly good for race relations even if it can be tone-deaf to minority-specific concerns. (“Not Black Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, dammit!”)
In addition, opposition to these appeals rises with education, which could cause issues when it comes to winning the suburbs, and explicitly racial arguments also pose obvious problems for minority outreach (though only 58 percent of minority Clinton voters agree the white person described above is racist). Further, the severe Trump-voter/Clinton-voter gap in Kaufmann’s poll shows that, at a bare minimum, this is a polarizing message rather than a unifying one for a politician to take up, and that it will alienate many voters in the center, too. The leftward drift of white liberals really ought to present an opportunity to seize that center instead.
Meanwhile, at the end of the day, this is a concern that we’re not actually going to address, no matter the norms we build up around those who raise it, as Kaufmann himself notes. Cutting immigration in half , and simultaneously allocating visas based on skills rather than family connections, would merely delay the onset of a nonwhite majority by a few years . Advertisement
I went into this book thinking Kaufmann’s idea was insane; he convinced me that it’s merely a dubious and unnecessary strategy — even setting aside whether the arguments he wants to see more of are, in fact, racist, and thus something we shouldn’t entertain even if it would work.
Addressing Populist Concerns without Alienating the Middle
One of the more striking patterns apparent throughout Whiteshift is the variation in white opinion across the U.K., America, and Canada — three countries whose whites have an obvious shared history. More than half of whites in the U.K. want to reduce immigration; in the U.S., as we have seen, opposition is far lower; in Canada, despite an immigrant inflow more than twice as big as the U.S.’s in per capita terms, opposition is lower still.
These three countries do have different cultures and different media environments, which Kaufmann emphasizes. But they also have different immigrants: Disproportionately low-skill and Muslim in the U.K., disproportionately low-skill and Hispanic in the U.S., and disproportionately high -skill in Canada. Might it be the case that different kinds of immigrants raise different types of concerns and — rightly or wrongly, but as a matter of fact — end up being welcomed more or less warmly as a result? And what if, instead of seeking lower overall immigration levels or deliberately injecting race into the discussion, America unapologetically took control of its immigration system and focused on getting the immigrants who would fit in the best and contribute the most?
Kaufmann dismisses the idea that white reactions are rooted in much besides race and to some extent culture. (For example, he writes that whites support immigration more after being told that immigrants intermarry frequently, so he suggests basing immigration decisions in part on whether applicants are in inter-ethnic marriages.) But there’s evidence that other characteristics, economic and social, matter a lot more than he lets on.
One recent study found that when an area is exposed to lots of low-skill immigration, it drifts toward the Republicans, the more restrictionist party. The opposite pattern appears with high-skill immigration. These effects stem mainly from the “votes of U.S. citizens,” not from the immigrants themselves, and they “seem independent” of immigrants’ country of origin. Obviously I don’t think driving voters to the Democrats is an end in itself, but this shows an outright positive reaction to the immigrants with the most ability to contribute to a local economy — and what if Republicans were the party of merit-based immigration instead of the party of less immigration?
There’s even a clever psychology experiment with consonant results, if you’re into that sort of thing, as Reihan Salam noted in 2016 :
Levy and Wright conducted an online poll of non-Hispanic whites in California in June 2015. All respondents were read a short vignette about a hypothetical program that would grant legal status to illegal immigrants, and then they were asked whether a hypothetical immigrant ought to be included in the program. One-third were asked about a Mexican immigrant (“Juan”), another third were asked about a Chinese immigrant (“Yuan”), and the final third were asked about a German immigrant (“Johan”). In every case, respondents were told that the immigrant in question had lived in the U.S. for two years. But in only half of them, they were also told that he spoke English and had held a steady job for the duration of his time in the U.S.
Levy and Wright posit that if anti-Hispanic bias were at work, respondents would discount the positive information in the case of Juan while taking account of it in the case of Yuan or Johan. The results were revealing. In the absence of information about English-language fluency or work history, respondents were seven to eight percentage points less likely to believe that Juan should be granted legal status. This clearly suggests some degree of bias. When the positive information was included, however, this gap disappeared. Essentially, Levy and Wright’s respondents were operating under the assumption that Mexican immigrants to the U.S. tend to be less educated than German and Chinese immigrants to the U.S., and so, lacking additional evidence, they assumed that Juan would be needier than Yuan or Johan. Once they knew that Juan spoke English and had been working steadily, they were as inclined to help him as to help his fictional counterparts.
In a more controversial piece of work using data from the U.K., Noah Carl pointed out that popular sentiment toward immigrant groups is correlated with the groups’ own arrest rates . This ties in to some other research suggesting that “stereotypes” are more accurate than we’d like to admit, though one rejoinder is that irrational prejudice could cause police to arrest some groups more than others even if they in fact have the same crime rates.
So there is plenty of reason to think that populist sentiment would be responsive to changes in immigration policy that don’t involve reducing numbers (which most Americans don’t want) or deliberately changing the racial composition of the immigrant inflow (with all the issues that entails). Instead we can aggressively tie the privilege of coming here to the skills and behavior of the potential immigrant in question. Advertisement
As I’ve spelled out before in numerous venues, the current immigration system is a complete disaster. We hand out a million green cards per year, primarily on the basis of family connections rather than skills. We have a “diversity visa lottery” that hands out green cards literally at random to people from certain areas who have at least a high-school degree — and the degree requirement makes it arguably an improvement over the rest of the system. The process for giving out temporary H-1B work visas also runs on a lottery rather than privileging the most skilled or most highly paid applicants. We have failed to police our borders and to find and deport individuals who overstay visas, and while illegal immigration has generally declined in recent years, Congress seems unwilling to fix the fresh crisis brewing as migrant caravans push upward through Mexico. We make a lot of welfare benefits available to immigrants rather than insist that everyone who comes here must support themselves or leave.
It would be possible to overhaul this system in a way that both addresses a lot of populist concerns and avoids alienating the middle. Award green cards through a point system that prioritizes factors like earning potential and English proficiency, limits family preferences to spouses and minor children, and keeps low-skill immigration to a minimum so that native-born low-skill workers experience as tight of a labor market as is possible. Auction H-1Bs. Tighten up border security and require employers to use E-Verify. Ban welfare use for future immigrants. In other words, make it so that immigrants pay lots in taxes and compete with the richest American workers rather than the poorest, and see if attitudes toward immigration don’t improve.
And if Kaufmann proves right and they don’t, some other measures could address cultural and assimilation concerns more directly without having a public debate involving explicitly racial appeals. I’m not averse to giving bonus points for intermarriage, or to requiring immigrants to settle in spread-out locations rather than concentrating in ethnic ghettos, as Lyman Stone has suggested. Other ideas include letting states and localities have some control over how many people can settle there. Adam Ozimek has proposed visas for high-skill workers that would be conditional on their settling in, and hopefully reviving, declining communities in the heartland (which themselves would voluntarily opt in to the program).
I would do all of this long before embarking on a project to normalize openly racial arguments for limiting immigration.
***
To end on a more personal note: Since we’re talking about cultural concerns, what about all of the white Americans who internalized the ideal of colorblindness, have tried to live up to it, and see it as a core aspect of the post–Jim Crow American creed — and a logical implication of the highest ideals this country has stood for from the start — even as we realize that ideals are not the same thing as reality? What about all the black Americans who share the goal of colorblindness even if they know it’s still far away? What about all the immigrants who were attracted to the idea of America as somewhere everyone is free to succeed, regardless of race?"
Incremental Health-Care Reforms Smarter than Obamacare Repeal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alex Muresianu,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/health-care-reform-incremental-obamacare-repeal/,"April 17, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) In the long run, Republicans will need to develop a health-care vision. In the meantime, baby-step efforts to fix flaws in the existing system are what’s needed.
W hen congressional Republicans rebuffed President Trump’s renewed push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on April 2, Trump suggested a plan to pursue another repeal vote after his reelection in 2020. Then, on April 9, the Department of Justice moved to accelerate the appeals process in a court case that it hopes will invalidate the whole ACA as unconstitutional. Advertisement Advertisement
This continued focus on repealing Obamacare is a huge mistake for the GOP.
Obamacare repeal was deeply unpopular among voters and hurt Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections. Making it a top reelection priority would only bring the losing issue back into the spotlight. Instead, the GOP would be wise to counter the progressive push for Medicare for All with small, incremental reforms.
To begin with, Medicare for All is only superficially popular. According to a Kaiser poll , 56 percent of the public supports and 42 percent are opposed. But when respondents learn about its downsides, support wanes rapidly: Only 37 percent support Medicare for All when told it would eliminate private insurance or raise their taxes, and only 26 percent support it when told it would lead to delays in medical treatment. (It would do all of these things and more.)
Americans deserve a better alternative. Advertisement Advertisement
Recent elections show that the party of the health-care status quo tends to have the political edge. Largely thanks to public opposition to the then-new ACA, Republicans trounced Democrats in the 2010 midterms. On the flip side, opposition to ACA repeal helped the Democrats win 40 House seats in the 2018 midterms. For the GOP, making 2020 about “undoing Obamacare,” instead of about Medicare for All’s radical overhaul of the health-care system, would be foolish. By the same token, Republicans can’t afford to defend the status quo, given that a vast majority of Americans view the existing system as seriously flawed.
Pursuing incremental reforms that improve care and make it affordable without throwing the health-care system into uncertainty and chaos is in the GOP’s best interest and the country’s. Luckily, Republicans have already taken some steps to do just that.
A lack of transparency in health-care pricing is one driver of high health-care costs in the U.S.: Patients rarely know the real price of even routine, non-emergency procedures, which allows hospitals to grossly overcharge them. Studies covering different procedures and geographical areas show that prices vary up to 1,000 percent for the same medical procedure in the same metropolitan area. A recent paper in the American Economic Journal found that easy access to price information would significantly reduce costs by helping patients find more affordable options.
Republicans have wisely started focusing on a push for price transparency. In January, the Trump administration imposed a rule requiring hospitals to post procedure prices online for patients to see. That’s a good start, but it isn’t enough. They should follow through on another administration proposal that would require insurers to disclose the prices they negotiate with providers. These secret contracts hide the real cost of care from consumers, as hospitals collude with insurers to push patients away from lower-cost providers. Making them public would give patients a more comprehensive view of real procedure costs, forcing providers to lower their prices by allowing patients to find less expensive care. Advertisement Advertisement
Another way hospitals help suppress competition in health care is through market consolidation. The number of hospitals has shrunk dramatically in recent years thanks to hospital mergers and acquisitions. When a health-care market includes only one provider, prices will rise. A New York Times analysis found that the price of hospital stays increased as much as 54 percent in areas that went from having multiple hospitals to having only one, as opposed to increases of roughly 10 percent in comparable areas with multiple hospitals.
One approach to this issue is to improve anti-trust enforcement. Anti-trust laws have seen a resurgence in support of late among both progressives and conservatives who see them as a way to rein in the power of Big Tech, but monopolies in the health-care industry are much more harmful to consumer welfare. Republicans can back a bill proposed by Representative Jim Banks (R., Ind.) that would strengthen the Federal Trade Commission’s enforcement of anti-consolidation law against hospital mergers and end the ban on the construction of new, physician-owned hospitals, among other pro-competition measures. Advertisement
Republicans could also roll back certificate-of-need (CON) laws, which restrict the entry of new providers into the market unless they can prove to state and local governments that the area they aim to serve “needs” a new provider. Existing hospitals lobby such governments to bar new, lower-cost providers from forming, and the ensuing lack of competition only increases prices for patients. The federal government incentivized states to adopt CON laws in the 1970s — now, it should incentivize states to repeal them. Advertisement"

The Washington Post's Ben Shapiro Smear | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/progressivism-as-failure-insurance/,"Follow Kyle Smith on Twitter April 17, 2019 9:50 AM Ben Shapiro speaking at the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Md., February 22, 2018. (Gage Skidmore)
After New Yorker staffer Talia Lavin executed one of the most spectacular face-plants in social-media hacktivist history — she essentially accused a Marine veteran of the Afghanistan war of being a Nazi because she confused a tattooed symbol of his platoon with the Third Reich’s Iron Cross — she quickly found herself no longer employed by The New Yorker . But, hey, here she is teaching at NYU and writing for the Washington Post ’s op-ed page! Where she just wrote what has to be one of the worst paragraphs ever to appear in that paper, issuing a nonsensical smear of Ben Shapiro for writing a few kind and thoughtful words about the inferno at Notre-Dame de Paris. Advertisement Advertisement
Thought-experiment time. What if Lavin had been a right-wing writer who had smeared, say, a disabled gay person of color as a Nazi? Would the Washington Post or any other respected news outlet be eager to publish her thoughts? Lavin would have had to seek another line of work. Being stridently of the Left seems to act as a magical shield against harm. Progressivism is a kind of failure-inoculation. No matter how badly you mess up, you’ll be fine. After waiting a bit, editors will bend over backwards to forgive you and even promote you to the next level. (Writing opinion for the Washington Post beats fact-checking at The New Yorker .)
Lavin’s behavior after smearing wheelchair-using Marine veteran Justin Gaertner (which came in the context of the Left’s broader war against ICE, Gaertner’s subsequent employer) was obnoxious. She issued the following exceptionally thin and unsatisfying apology: “To Justin Gaertner, I apologize, sincerely: all I saw in you was the photo ICE tweeted, and not the human being depicted inside it. It was uncharitable, and the hasty deletion doesn’t change that. I’m sorry and I have voluntarily resigned after three years at the New Yorker .” Advertisement
Uncharitable! Lavin’s post wasn’t “uncharitable,” it was completely wrong, in addition to being hateful and calculated to ruin a veteran’s career, if not his life, simply because he worked for a government agency Lavin doesn’t like. Calling someone a Nazi goes a good long way past “uncharitable.” Lavin then assumed the classic I’m-the-real-victim pose that has become a highly successful tactic on the left: She claimed she had been targeted by ICE: “I do not think it is acceptable for a federal agency to target a private citizen for a good faith, hastily rectified error.”
The word “targeted,” as used by the Left, today means, “I can say mean things about you, but you’re not allowed to say mean things about me. That would be harassment. If everyone on my side unloads on you, that’s your just deserts, you horrible person. If everyone on your side does the same to me, that’s a flagrant foul.” Advertisement Advertisement
Anyway, ICE didn’t target Lavin in the first place. It simply and properly pointed out that Lavin had issued a smear and demanded an appropriate apology. ICE’s statement read, in pertinent part, “Anyone attempting to advance their personal political opinions by baselessly slandering an American hero should be issuing public apologies to Mr. Gaertner and retractions. This includes Levin [sic] and the New Yorker .” Moreover, Lavin’s claim of an error made in “good faith” is risible. “Hey, bud, I only called you a Nazi, no hard feelings, mate!” Lavin worked at The New Yorker long enough to know that you should probably call someone for comment first before publicly accusing him of being a Hitlerite. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
No surprise that Lavin was soon hired by Media Matters for America, which is pretty much built on the kinds of attacks she had already proved capable of. But in her Washington Post column the paper didn’t mention that she is affiliated with MMFA. That would have been useful information since the group appears nakedly partisan, at least to anyone with eyes — and if there was any doubt on this matter, the group responded to Shapiro yesterday with the following tweet from its official account: “F**k you and the burro you rode in on.” The WaPo simply identified Lavin as “a writer and researcher based in Brooklyn.” Advertisement
As I write, the WaPo has still not corrected or apologized for Lavin’s outrageous smear of Shapiro: She said he was a “far-right pundit” who had “evoked the specter of a war between Islam and the West that is already part of numerous far-right narratives” when he called Notre-Dame “a monument to Western civilization” and “Judeo-Christian heritage.” The same Lavin paragraph went on to insinuate a connection between Shapiro’s thinking and that of Richard Spencer and the mass killer in Christchurch, New Zealand. Lavin’s column was at some point updated to included the following extremely uncharitable sentence: “(On Tuesday, Shapiro called this article ‘simply gross’ and said he called Notre Dame a monument to Western civilization ‘because it is,’ not because of ‘malicious intent.’)” Lavin completely ignored Shapiro’s main point, which is that he hadn’t blamed Muslims for the fire and objected to her insinuating otherwise. The kind of unfair undergraduate-level snark in the added sentence is par for the course at MMFA, but the Washington Post opinion page shouldn’t stoop to this. Advertisement"
Campus Free-Speech Crisis: University of Arizona Border Patrol Meltdown | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Stanley Kurtz,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/campus-free-speech-turning-point-university-of-arizona/,"April 17, 2019 10:32 AM The University of Arizona (Wikimedia)
Amid the weekly cavalcade of campus horrors , it’s easy to miss a story that will mark a major turning point in the campus free-speech crisis, whether for good or ill. The growing confrontation at the University of Arizona over students who disrupted a Career Day presentation by Border Patrol agents is not your run-of-the-mill campus outrage. Instead it’s that rare case where student disruptors are facing real consequences for their actions. This is in significant part because of a new Arizona law strengthening discipline for such disruptions. If the university holds fast and the disruptors pay a price for silencing others, the move will carry national implications. Yet if the growing rebellion by anti-free-speech students and faculty at UA gets its way, the university will back down, the border patrol will be permanently barred from campus, and the university president could lose his job. That would be a disaster for free speech, and would mark a new and dangerous turn in America’s campus crisis. Advertisement Advertisement
Before taking the measure of the stakes in this battle, we’ve got to review the precipitating incident. Advertisement
On March 19, a UA student named Denisse Moreno Melchor noticed a pair of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at the school. “I was like, ‘Get out,’ and started chanting and disrupting that space until they left,” she told the school paper the next day. The March 19 event that Melchor had — in her own words — disrupted, was a Career Day presentation being given by two border-patrol agents to the school’s Criminal Justice Association. You can see from videos originally taken by Melchor and reposted here that a she is hurling insults at the officers through a door, continuously calling them “murderers,” the “murder patrol,” and an “extension of the KKK.” As the officers are distracted by the chanting, some of the students in attendance move toward the door to help secure the scene.
At that point, a woman later identified as Luisa Pinto, a major in criminal-justice studies and president of the Criminal Justice Association, invites Melchor to sit inside [1:35]. Melchor replies, “Great, I can sit in, the entire time I’ll just be saying that they’re murderers, the entire f***ing time.” In other words, Melchor promises to continue disrupting, even if she’s allowed to sit inside.

At some point Melchor was joined by other students, and apparently by a UA employee as well. The latter part of the video records several protesters as they follow the agents to their cars while chanting “murder patrol.” At one point the students shout: “We won’t stop until you get off our campus.” So it’s evident from the words of the protesters themselves that right from the classroom disruption through the pursuit of the officers through the hallways, the intention of the chanting was to cut short any dialogue and drive the officers from campus.

An early assessment of this incident characterized it as a free speech close call . But while appropriate discipline for these offenders is up for debate, I don’t think there’s any doubt that this was a punishable disruption. The chanting was continuous, and was plainly intended to interfere with normal verbal exchange. This is not a case of a few spontaneous boos thrown at a speaker who has said something the audience disagrees with. Melchor wasn’t even listening to the presentation. She was just chanting “murder patrol,” as were the students who later joined her. Advertisement
We also now have comments from Luisa Pinto, president of the Criminal Justice Association, who clearly believes that Melchor interfered with the agents’ presentation. According to Pinto: “She [Melchor] has every right to scream and yell all she wants outside the building, but the moment she’s inside a building and interfering with our education…our rights were violated.” Pinto also says that after the incident she contacted club members and was told that, given the disruption, they had not been able to learn anything from the presentation. In other words, this was a shout-down.
Certainly it’s important to attend to any evidence that might emerge at future hearings with an open mind. As of now, however, it seems clear that this was a punishable disruption. Advertisement Advertisement
The story up to this point is all-too-familiar. Yet events now take a new turn. Instead of rolling over, UA campus police filed criminal misdemeanor charges of “interference with the peaceful conduct of an educational institution” against Melchor and two other students, while Melchor was also charged with “threats and intimidation.” UA President Robert Robbins then backed up the campus police. “Student protest is protected by our support for free speech,” said Robbins, “but disruption is not.” Some claim the university’s concern with the incident only followed public outrage at the viral video of the disruption. The university denies this, but what does it matter? If it took legitimate public outrage to push administrators to act, that’s fine. What’s important is that discipline is warranted.
There’s another factor here as well. About a year ago, Arizona passed a campus free speech law that includes robust protections against shout-downs. That law is based on a nationally influential model published by Arizona’s Goldwater Institute. (Along with Jim Manley and Jonathan Butcher, I am a co-author of that model.) Many states have passed more limited laws abolishing restrictive campus-speech codes and so-called free-speech zones. But in addition to abolishing codes, zones, barring speaker disinvitations, and other matters, Goldwater-based laws include provisions for the discipline of shout-downs. Goldwater-based laws also establish an oversight system to ensure that administrators actually enforce the law’s provisions. President Robbins surely had the new state law in mind when he refused to withdraw the charges filed by campus police. Advertisement Advertisement
That said, it is by no means the case that Arizona’s new campus free-speech law requires the filing of criminal misdemeanor charges in response to a shout-down. On the contrary, the law actually focuses on the need for administrative hearings within the university, hearings at which accused disruptors are granted robust due-process rights. And the main punishments contemplated by the law are levied by the university itself — more like suspension from school than jail time. While misdemeanor charges certainly aren’t forbidden by the new law and are within the range of appropriate punishment in this case, I must admit to a slight preference for handling this case within the university, with perhaps 30-day suspensions in play for the offenders.
Still, I doubt the judge will give the students the maximum six-month sentence. They’re more likely to draw a slap on the wrist instead. And as we’ll see, the complete lack of remorse on the part of Melchor should also be taken into account. Fortunately, the university has also initiated an administrative investigation of this incident. That means the accused might ultimately be charged with violations of the student code of conduct in addition to, or even in place of, charges in court. The important point is that the disruptors must face significant consequences for their actions, whether that comes through the courts or via internal university procedures. In either case, the new campus free-speech law is a big part of why real consequences are still in play in this case.
Don’t think for a minute that the matter rests here, however. Administrators regularly cave to shout-downs for a reason. They’re afraid that what’s happening now at UA will happen to them. Students have come out in force to protest discipline for the disruptors. They’ve also been joined by hundreds of faculty members, largely from UA’s highly politicized minority studies programs. Student and faculty demonstrators poured into a recent meeting of the University of Arizona’s Board of Regents, the body responsible for overseeing the administrative handling of the new campus free-speech law.
The protesters claimed that the accused disruptors are being silenced, yet it’s actually quite the opposite . It’s the disruptors who silenced the border patrol and played havoc with their fellow students’ right to listen and learn. And if you attend carefully to the protesting faculty’s letter , the implicit message seems to be “Ignore the disruption, whether it happened or not.”
The student and faculty defenders of the accused disruptors style themselves “The Coalition for the Arizona 3.” The group has three demands: 1) drop any charges against the accused disruptors, whether criminal or within the university; 2) agents of ICE and the Border Patrol must be permanently banned from campus; and 3) if the first two demands are not met, President Robbins must resign.
If you think this last demand is far-fetched, recall the 2015 conflict at the University of Missouri. That debacle helped kick off the latest phase of the campus free-speech crisis. No more than a few dozen protesters blocked President Tim Wolfe’s car during a homecoming parade, made some highly debatable accusations against the campus atmosphere, and managed to force Wolfe’s resignation. This sent Mizzou into a tail-spin from which it has yet to recover. The forces arrayed against President Robbins at the University of Arizona are already far more formidable than was the pressure on President Wolfe at Mizzou in 2015. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
And what of the other demands? Drop the misdemeanor charges and halt the investigation of student conduct code violations? Why? Is The Coalition for the Arizona 3 afraid of the facts in this case? The coalition does not marshal evidence to show that this was no disruption, yet they claim that the speech of the accused is being suppressed. That’s not what the video or the available testimony show. Why not let the rest of the facts come out in hearings at court or in school?
As for the demand that ICE and the Border Patrol be barred from campus, the Coalition for the Arizona 3 gives itself away here. This demand is entirely antithetical to freedom of speech and the rule of law. For one thing, the new Arizona campus free-speech law bars disinvitations by explicitly declaring the university, “open to any speaker whom a student, student group, or faculty member has invited.” Yet hundreds of students and faculty at UA want to permanently achieve precisely what the disruptors were aiming for on March 19. They want to kick the Border Patrol off campus forever, whether other students wish to invite them or not. That would be a gross violation of free speech, and of the new state law. More broadly, barring the Border Patrol would be an insult to the rule of law itself. Law enforcement cannot and must not be banned from the campus of a public university. Advertisement
Melchor reportedly delivered the coalition’s demands when she spoke at the recent Board of Regents meeting. She insisted that the charges against her be dropped, that the agents she shouted-down be barred from campus forever, and that President Robbins must resign should he refuses to obey. That doesn’t sound like remorse to me.
In a recent interview , Melchor also said she doesn’t believe that Border Patrol agents should be allowed to present their perspective on campus. Clearly, this is a person who does not believe in free speech. It seems reasonable to conclude that this viewpoint guided her actions on March 19.
The Mizzou fiasco of 2015 sparked a major escalation of the campus free-speech crisis. We are now at a moment that could easily be as consequential — although perhaps in the direction of improvement. President Robbins must not be fired or made to resign because he refuses to withdraw the charges. And whether by trial for a misdemeanor, or by administrative discipline for violation of the student-conduct code, or both, the accused disruptors must face significant consequences should hearings bear out what currently available evidence indicates.
I can’t think of a single case since 2015 in which a shout-down has been disciplined in a way likely to deter future incidents. In the few cases where discipline has been applied, other administrative actions have nullified the deterrent effect. But if the University of Arizona follows through and the disruptors face real consequences, we might someday reach the point where shout-downs will stop and discipline will seldom, if ever, be required. The point is not to punish but to prevent speech-suppression from happening in the first place. A few well-handled instances of discipline in the near term could be enough to establish deterrence and render punishments at UA unnecessary down the road. That would send out a signal nationally.
On the other hand, should the Coalition for the Arizona 3 carry the day, it would effectively green-light further shout-downs. And it would show for now that even in the face of a law to the contrary, campus administrators have been completely cowed by the anti-free speech left. I say “for now,” because Arizona’s new law provides for recourse in the event of such a drastic capitulation. The new law instructs the Arizona Board of Regents to create a committee to write an annual oversight report on the administrative handling of free speech. That report must comment on discipline for shout-downs, in particular. If President Robbins surrenders, and the disruptors face no consequences either in court or within the university, then it is the obligation of the oversight report to condemn this. It is also the obligation of the legislature to respond by cutting back funding for the university."
William Barr: Attorney General Blocks Some Asylum Seekers From Release on Bond | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/barr-blocks-some-asylum-seekers-from-release-on-bond/,"Follow Mairead McArdle on Twitter April 17, 2019 9:53 AM Central American migrants being held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in El Paso, Texas, March 27, 2019 (Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters)
Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday reversed a ruling that allowed migrants to be released on bond who had crossed the southern border illegally and then established they had “credible fear” of returning to their home countries.
“I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States,” Barr wrote in his opinion.
Barr’s move leaves the decision up to the Department of Homeland Security of whether individual immigrants who crossed the border illegally and later claimed asylum should be temporarily released. The change scraps a 2005 immigration court ruling allowing bond hearings for such migrants.
Immigration lawyers and immigrant rights advocates had pushed for the release on bond of immigrants who demonstrated credible fear, arguing that it is not in the interest of the U.S. to detain migrants who have shown they have a legitimate case for asylum. Stay Updated with NR Daily

The new policy does not apply to migrant children, either alone or with their families, or those applying to enter the country at a port of entry, and will take effect in 90 days.
“This is the Trump administration’s latest assault on people fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in the United States,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project in a statement. “Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process.

Southbend, Ind. mayor and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg suggested in a recent interview that the strain of populism harnessed by President Donald Trump represents a “white-guy identity politics.” Comments
“By far the political movement that is most based on identity politics is Trumpism. It’s based on white-guy identity politics. It uses race to divide the working and middle class,” Buttigieg told the Associated Press when asked whether Trump relied on racial animus to win the White House. “There are a lot of strategies to blame problems on people who look different or are of a different faith or even of a different sexuality or gender identity. . . . It’s a cynical political strategy that works in the short term but winds up weakening the whole country in the long term.”
Since rising over the past few months from relative obscurity to third in national polls of the race, Buttigieg has turned criticisms traditionally leveled by Republicans at Democrats around on the party of Trump. “First comes freedom, something that our conservative friends have come to think of as their own. . . . Let me tell you: Freedom doesn’t belong to one political party. Freedom has been a Democratic bedrock ever since the New Deal. Freedom from want, freedom from fear,” Buttigieg said when announcing his campaign Sunday. “Our conservative friends care about freedom, but only make it part of the journey. They only see ‘freedom from.’ But that’s not true,” he continued. “Your neighbor can make you unfree. Your cable company can make you unfree. There’s a lot more to your freedom than the size of your government.”
Buttigieg drew a crowd of 1,600 to a rally in Des Moines, Iowa Tuesday night and, according to a recent Emerson poll , he now trails only Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination."

A Florida woman said to be obsessed with the 1999 massacre at Colorado’s Columbine High School has reportedly died after a massive FBI manhunt.
Authorities said Sol Pais, 18, made disturbing remarks about Columbine as Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the shooting approached and was apparently “infatuated with the perpetrators.” She flew to Colorado on Monday, purchasing a pump-action shotgun after landing, and was considered armed and dangerous before she was found dead, Denver’s local CBS affiliate reported , citing a law enforcement source in Clear Creek County. The FBI’s Denver office later wrote on Twitter that the manhunt had ended.
Authorities had stressed that while Pais had made no specific threats on area schools, they considered her a threat to the community. Accordingly, many Colorado school districts canceled classes Wednesday, telling staff and students to stay home. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) questions Michael Cohen on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., February 27, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)
Representative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) hosted an extremist anti-Israel activist who has openly and explicitly endorsed terrorism at her congressional office in mid-April to celebrate the American Muslims for Palestine Advocacy Day.
The organization American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), which organized the meeting, posted a photo on its Facebook page of Tlaib standing next to Joe Catron, a veteran anti-Israel activist who has openly praised various Palestinian organizations for committing acts of terrorism.
“A tip of my hat to Rashida Tlaib, who really goes above and beyond the call of duty in welcoming every supporter of Palestine to her office, listening to what we have to say, answering our questions, and posing for endless pictures,” Catron wrote on Facebook in a post first noted by the Daily Caller .
Catron serves as U.S. coordinator of the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, an arm of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which the U.S., Australia, Japan, Canada, and the E.U. have all designated a terrorist organization.
In 2017, Catron used his personal Twitter account to praise a PFLP-organized terror attack in which an Israeli police officer was stabbed to death. Catron shared the PFLP’s official statement praising the members who perpetrated the murder and personally referred to the attack as “heroic.” Statement by the PFLP on the heroic “Promise of al-Buraq” operation https://t.co/JIwp38BZg6 pic.twitter.com/CEAF6t8rqb

Tlaib has faced significant criticism since her election over her ties to anti-Semitic Palestinian activists and her support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which seeks to put financial pressure on Israel. In January, she attended a dinner with Palestinian activist Abbas Hamideh, who has referred to Israel as a “terrorist identity” and likened the state’s underlying ideology to that of ISIS.
Additionally, one of Tlaib’s top fundraisers, Maher Abdel-qader, has repeatedly espoused anti-Semitic tropes online. Abdel-qader created the Facebook group “Palestinian American Congress,” which often hosts anti-Semitic discussions and which Tlaib is a member of. And, in 2006, Tlaib wrote a column for Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic publication Final Call."
Judi Dench & 'Red Joan' Review -- Movie Joins a Rogues’ Gallery of Resisters | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/red-joan-joins-a-rogues-gallery-of-resisters/,"April 17, 2019 2:42 PM Judi Dench stars in Red Joan . (Lionsgate Films) Judi Dench in a guess-the-genre political sob story
R ed Joan is a love story, a political thriller, a woman’s coming-of-age sexual memoir, and a history of British espionage just before and after World War II. It is also a crock. Based on real-life KGB spy Melita Norwood, Red Joan ’s sentimental exoneration of one woman’s treason and sedition fits with how today’s media pay tribute to the kaffeeklatsch of political resisters. Advertisement Advertisement
Judi Dench plays title character Joan Stanley as a kindly widow suddenly exposed by the British government for her activities, 60 years earlier, relaying wartime bomb secrets to Russia. Crone Joan’s mummified on-trial look (Dench’s facial wattles, a padded, thick rump, and flabby legs with an ankle monitor) dissolves into flashbacks played by pouty Sophie Cookson, who beams a girlish complexion and period hairdos as a student at Cambridge University. Cookson never locates her character’s sexual-political tension, which was the key to every characterization in the film version of Mary McCarthy’s The Group , because that complexity isn’t part of this film’s reverential concept.
Young Joan is seduced by a pair of sexy Jewish radicals, Sonya (Tereza Srbova), who teaches her espionage tricks, and firebrand Leo (Tom Hughes), who talks of religion when he has politics in mind. Their exoticism, flaunting past political persecution, is meant to excuse WASP Joan’s uncritical fascination. Advertisement
Asked, “Who politicized you then?” Old Joan’s response, “That’s a strange way to put it,” epitomizes the disingenuousness of red-diaper-baby filmmaking that dodges political intent and refuses to admit its Communist sympathies. This is where Red Joan stops being entertainment and becomes romanticized indoctrination. Leftist attitudes are dramatized as the norm.
Joan defends her romantic intrigues and professional deceptions that include blackmailing her Cambridge colleagues. She prevaricates: “I have also been accused of deceiving my country. I am not a spy. I’m not a traitor. I wanted everyone to share the same knowledge. Because only that way could the horror of another world war be averted and I think if you look back at history, you’ll see I was right.” Advertisement
Such self-justification characterizes today’s progressive self-righteousness. Joan’s specious concern for issues (she’s a prototype for Britain’s Ban the Bomb movement) derails her sense of nationalism and, in the long run, derails morality itself. Red Joan ’s plot resembles the 2010 Helen Mirren–Jessica Chastain film The Debt , which used sexy flashbacks to bolster modern-day historical revisionism about Cold War conflict. Advertisement
For readers who think a film review overpoliticizes entertainment, this is how overly melodramatic political filmmaking turns rancid. In a perfect parallel to contemporary deep-state crises of espionage and subterfuge, Joan’s arrogance corresponds to the Barack Obama–Bernie Sanders promise to “fundamentally transform” a nation by any means necessary."

I can’t be the only person who sighed upon learning this morning that Representative Seth Moulton (D., Mass.) was spotted recording a presidential announcement video . Another day, and another Democrat is preparing to run for president. What makes Moulton, a Marine elected to Congress in 2014, believe he can defeat Biden, Bernie, Beto, and Buttigieg? His first problem is he doesn’t have the letter “ B ” as an initial. That alone puts him in the second tier. Advertisement Advertisement
The Democratic field, which could boast more than 20 candidates by end of summer, is reaching absurd proportions. A tragedy of the commons looms. Too many Democrats grazing on the same limited resource — the non-Sanders primary vote — will help Bernie win the nomination. Why are Democrats willing to take such a risk?
Sanders provides a clue. His tax returns confirm that 2016 made America’s most famous democratic socialist a wealthy man. He might be a cause-oriented-politician — Moulton too — but for many officeholders a presidential campaign is above all an excellent business opportunity. Cable appearances build notoriety. Fundraising enhances professional networks. Losing candidate often emerge with television contracts or book deals. No one had heard of Andrew Yang before he launched his (long shot) bid.

Yemen's War & President Trump -- U.S War in Yemen Is Unconstitutional | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/americas-war-in-yemen-is-plainly-unconstitutional/,"Follow David French on Twitter April 17, 2019 2:56 PM President Donald Trump listens as he meets with Danny Burch, a former hostage in Yemen, Washington, D.C., March 6, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) The president’s veto of a bipartisan resolution demanding the end of American involvement in the conflict further degrades our constitutional architecture.
Y esterday, Donald Trump vetoed a bipartisan congressional resolution demanding an end to U.S. involvement in Yemen’s civil war. It’s now official: The president who ran for office pledging to reduce military entanglements abroad is involving American forces in a foreign war in direct defiance of the plain language of the Constitution. Advertisement Advertisement
First, some background. Beginning in 2015, the Obama administration recklessly inserted itself into Saudi Arabia’s proxy war with Iran, backing Saudi military action against Yemen’s Houthi rebels. America has long been an important source of arms for Saudi Arabia, but Obama’s support went well beyond merely providing planes and bombs. His administration also authorized other active, indispensable support, including aerial refueling and targeting assistance.
This direct involvement represented an act of war by any reasonable measure, and there is no meaningful argument that it was enabled by any existing congressional war authorization. The Authorization for the Use of Military Force enacted after the 9/11 attacks plainly doesn’t apply to Iran-backed Shiite rebels fighting in Yemen (though it does apply to al-Qaeda cells active in the country), nor does the subsequent Iraq War authorization.
Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution grants Congress the exclusive authority to declare war. Yes, Article II declares that the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, but reading the two clauses together, their meaning is plain: The president commands American forces when Congress declares war. Yes, the president has inherent authority to order immediate military actions in times of crisis, but he should also promptly seek congressional approval for such actions. Advertisement
No one should pretend that there aren’t constitutional gray areas in this structure, of course: How long can a president respond to an emergency before Congress must ratify or reject the conflict? Once Congress has authorized any given action, how far can a president extend or expand a conflict? Does the authorization of force against al-Qaeda extend to, say, al-Qaeda progeny such as ISIS? Does the authorization of war in Iraq extend to actions deemed militarily necessary to stabilize the country, like the use of force in Syria? Advertisement
These are all good constitutional questions, but they’re beside the point because none of them apply to the conflict in Yemen. President Obama wasn’t responding to a true national emergency in backing the Saudis against the Houthis, and President Trump isn’t responding to a true national emergency in continuing to back the Saudis. They were (and are) waging a new conflict against a new enemy. Advertisement
Late last year, in the resolution Trump just vetoed, Congress rejected military action in Yemen under the provisions of the War Powers Act, a controversial 1973 statue passed over Richard Nixon’s veto. The Act attempted to answer the thorny constitutional issues outlined above by requiring a president to consult with Congress within 48 hours of the introduction of American forces into foreign hostilities. Congress can then, by resolution, terminate American involvement. 50 U.S.C. Section 1544(c) states that “at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.” (Emphasis added.)
Presidents have opposed the War Powers Act ever since its passage, even as they’ve frequently complied with its terms. They have historically taken such a broad view of their commander-in-chief powers as to functionally write Congress’s war-making power out of the Constitution. If a president can fight when he wants, where he wants, and for as long as he wants, then Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 is meaningless. Advertisement Advertisement
Moreover, even Trump’s veto is an unconstitutional act. A declaration of war requires an affirmative act of Congress. A bipartisan majority’s rejection of American participation in the Yemeni conflict is anything but an affirmation. And when the Constitution requires congressional affirmation, then congressional rejection can’t be vetoed by the president."

“As somebody who is very familiar from my military training with weapons of war, somebody who carried a rifle and a pistol around a foreign land on order of the president, [I think] there are some weapons that just don’t belong in our neighborhoods in peace time in America,” he said during a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa. “We’ve already decided that this is within the Second Amendment because we’ve decided that somewhere in between a slingshot and a nuclear weapon, we can draw a line. And that’s not unconstitutional, it’s common sense.”
“And that’s why I think assault rifles need to be on the table too,” he concluded, referring to a potential assault-weapon ban.
The 37-year-old mayor has previously compared the popular semi-automatic rifles available to civilians with the rifle he carried overseas. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Buttigieg’s framing of the gun-control issue, which conflates the semi-automatic rifles available to civilians with the fully automatic rifles distributed to service-members, echoes Representative Eric Swalwell’s call for a federal ban on so-called “weapons of war,” which he believes is necessary to reduce mass shootings."
Nigel Farage's 'Brexit Party' Is Gaining Steam | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Madeleine Kearns,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/nigel-farages-brexit-party-is-gaining-steam/,"April 17, 2019 4:24 PM Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage attends a March to Leave demonstration in London, England, March 29, 2019.

That Britain, whose voters chose to leave the EU in 2016, will partake in the European Parliament elections next month is frankly absurd. Britain was supposed to have left the bloc already (Brexit day was scheduled for March 31, was extended to mid-April, and was extended again to October 31). And elected British MEPs — presuming that Brexit still happens — would have to vacate their seats almost immediately. Advertisement Advertisement
This is yet another source of voter frustration. And Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader, has seized it as an opportunity to gain support for his “Brexit party,” launched April 12. According to a YouGov poll, the Brexit party is leading with 27 percent of the vote. Labour is at 22 percent and the Conservatives are trailing behind at 15 percent.
This is bad news for the Conservative party who are — at least ostensibly — the Brexit party. Around 70 percent of Conservative constituencies voted Leave in the 2017 election, and it has been the task of the Conservative government for the past two years to deliver this result. But they haven’t. Failure after failure, broken promise after broken promise; an entirely self-inflicted crisis of trust is upon them, and the gulf between Parliament and ordinary voters is ever widening. The worry now is that the Tories might bleed Euro-skeptics to Farage’s single-issue party.
This is also a concern for the Labour party since 60 percent of its constituencies also voted Leave. So far, the Labour party has gotten away with a deliberately ambiguous line on Brexit. But in future elections, they’ll need to step up. Advertisement
Might a compromise between the two parties be possible? Might that help ease Brexit along? Well, cross-party talks are ongoing. However, party leaders are struggling to put their differences aside. For instance, Corbyn has expressed outrage that the Tories want “to turn this country into a deregulated, low-tax society which will do a deal with Trump.” Theresa May’s deal has already failed three times, yet with her authority hollowed out, she shows no signs of stepping down this side of Brexit.

“Now is the time to fight back,” Nigel Farage told Good Morning Britain the day the Brexit party launched ."

Sinema joined the Department of Homeland Security and the White House in calling attention to the failure of U.S. immigration law to address the record number of Central American asylum-seekers streaming across the border. Under current law, those migrants are legally entitled to remain in the U.S. while their cases are being adjudicated.
The problem is further exacerbated by the composition of the migrants; many of them are women and children who cannot be detained in facilities that were designed to house single men. The lack of adequate resources forced authorities to release 18,500 immigrants from federal detention into Arizona between December 21 and March 20. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“The sheer volume of family units crossing the border has overwhelmed ICE’s limited transportation resources; combined with a requirement to detain these individuals for no more than 20 days, the agency has no option but to expeditiously arrange for their release,” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement released last month.
President Trump, after ousting Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen earlier this month, has reportedly considered a number of legally risky executive actions to stem the flow of migrants in response to congressional inaction.
Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday announced one such measure, which will prohibit asylum seekers who have established a “credible fear” of returning to their home country from being released into the U.S. on bond. Under the new policy, which reverses a standing Department of Justice rule, asylum-seekers will be detained until their cases are adjudicated."

The Trump administration announced Wednesday that the U.S. will tighten restrictions on travel to Cuba, allowing only family visits to the island.
“The Department of the Treasury will implement further regulatory changes to restrict non-family travel to Cuba,” national-security adviser John Bolton said Wednesday in a speech to a group of Bay of Pigs veterans on the 58th anniversary of the failed, CIA-directed attempt to overthrow Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.
Bolton also announced that money sent to family members in Cuba would now be limited to $1,000 per person every three months, a change from the Obama administration policy that allowed unlimited remittances.
“In no uncertain terms, the Obama administration’s policies toward Cuba have enabled the Cuban colonization of Venezuela today,” Bolton said. “These new measures will help steer Americans dollars away from the Cuban regime.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

"Campus Police Chief Put on Leave After Liking Trump, NRA Tweets | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Katherine Timpf,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/campus-police-chief-trump-nra-tweets-mount-holyoke-college/,"April 17, 2019 6:24 PM (Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters) What we need is more communication, less cancellation — because the latter makes the former impossible. M ount Holyoke College announced on Wednesday that its newly selected campus police chief would be placed on administrative leave after he received backlash for liking some of Donald Trump’s and the National Rifle Association’s tweets. The Daily Wire’s Kassy Dillon reports that Daniel Hect had been appointed to be the head of Mount Holyoke and Smith College’s shared campus police departments, news which he joyfully shared on Twitter. “I am excited to announce I have accepted the position of Chief of Police at Mount Holyoke and Smith colleges, two of the most prestigious all women’s institutions in the nation,” he tweeted. That’s when the trouble started. Students combed through Hect’s Twitter account and found that he had previously liked tweets from both Trump’s and the NRA’s accounts — such as a tweet from the NRA wishing followers a Merry Christmas and tweets from Trump discussing the government shutdown and the need for the border wall. Seems like that wouldn’t be a big deal, right? Wrong. A MHC student shared screenshots, along with the message that it was “unacceptable for someone in charge of keeping any community safe, let alone a campus as diverse as MHC’s, to be publicly displaying his support for hateful regimes and organizations.” All hell broke loose. According to Dillon, both Hect and the college’s administrations joined forces to try and quell the controversy, even hosting multiple events to try and calm down the students who were upset. One of these events, a forum at Mount Holyoke where community members could ask Hect questions, was full of “tension and tears,” according to the student newspaper . Hect tried to explain that he simply liked the tweets that he thought represented times “[when] Trump did something I thought he did well … in hopes to lead to more good behavior,” but that he was not a Trump supporter overall. He also said he regretted liking any tweets that supported building the wall, calling that “a huge mistake.” After the forum, Hect took it even further, sending an email to the MHC community outlining what else he was going to do in order to try and rectify the situation — including going to “an immersive training program” about “challenging biases.” Apparently, though, none of these efforts were enough. On Wednesday, MHC President Sonya Stephens announced that Hect would be placed on administrative leave. “Over the past few weeks, members of our community have expressed concerns about the ability of Chief Daniel Hect to develop the level of trust required to engage in community policing,” Stephens said in a campus-wide email. Sorry, but this is completely and totally insane. I personally am not someone who supports the wall (I have explained my reasoning for this many times in other columns ), but I still cannot look at these students’ or MHC’s reactions as anything other than absolutely ridiculous and unfair. Why? Because although I myself may not support it, there are several people whom I care about who do, and I know for a fact that these people are not racists. Supporting the wall does not automatically make you a xenophobe or a bigot, it simply makes you someone who has a different opinion from that of other people (including myself) on the question of how to achieve border security. Seeing things like this always makes me sad . . . not just for the person who is under fire, but also for our country as a whole. After all, this doesn’t help anyone, and it does a lot of harm by worsening the already extreme division we’re seeing among different groups of Americans. By placing Hect on administrative leave, MHC validated the students’ fallacious claims that his support of, for example, the Second Amendment somehow made him a bad, hateful person. It doesn’t — it simply makes him a supporter of the Second Amendment, which, by the way, is a part of our Constitution, meaning that it’s pretty damn egregious to punish someone for supporting it. Personally, I am lucky enough to have friends and family who have a whole slew of different beliefs. I am close with religious people and atheists, conservatives and liberals, people who support everything Trump does and people who support none of it — and I know that all of them are great people. Unfortunately, not everyone has this kind of social circle, and the people who don’t could really be missing out on knowing some wonderful souls. It’s a really sad situation, and decisions like MHC’s only perpetuate it. What we need is more communication, less cancellation — because the latter makes the former impossible."
Eliminate Federal Student Loans | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/eliminate-federal-student-loans/,"April 18, 2019 6:30 AM (Unsplash) It’s time to shut down the Bank of Uncle Stupid.
H ere is a three-part plan for something practical the federal government could do to relieve college-loan debt. Step 1: The federal government should stop making college loans itself and cease guaranteeing any such loans. Step 2: It should prohibit educational lending by federally regulated financial institutions or, if that seems too heavy-handed, require the application of ordinary credit standards in any private educational lending, treating the student himself as the main credit risk in all cases, including those of secured or unsecured loans taken out by parents or other third parties for that student’s educational expenses. And 3: It should make student-loan debt dischargeable in ordinary bankruptcy procedures. Advertisement Advertisement
The most likely end result of this would be the effective abolition of government- and bank-based financing of college education in all but the most narrowly defined circumstances. Good riddance. That leaves about $1.5 trillion in existing debt on the table, a very large number from which the federal government derives very little income, about 0.1 percent a year, or $1.5 billion — a fact that should enter into our calculations about whether we attempt to collect every nickel of that money or, perhaps, slowly forgive some of that debt for students who keep up with their payments and are otherwise good citizens, maybe at a rate of 2 percent of the principal a year.
It is time to shut down the Bank of Uncle Stupid. Advertisement
Colleges will have two choices: Bring their tuitions down to a more reasonable rate or, if they are so inclined, work out financing arrangements of their own. This would not present too much trouble to splendidly endowed schools such as Harvard and Princeton, or to public schools with substantial resources at their disposal. A senior official of my alma mater, the University of Texas, once caused a stir by confessing — in public — that UT Austin doesn’t need to charge tuition at all but does so mainly as a population-control mechanism. The problem, he said, wasn’t money as such but the fact that the state would not let him raise admissions standards. Admittedly, UT has become a little more selective in recent years.
I have a theory about why there has been so much tuition inflation: inflation . Advertisement
When we talk about “inflation,” we generally mean to denote a general rise in consumer prices; but, properly understood, that is the result of inflation, not inflation itself. Inflation itself is an increase in the money supply, and its effects need not necessarily be general. You can inflate the money supply by printing money, but you can also do it by expanding credit. Our friends at the National Association of Realtors and other charter members of the Committee to Reinflate the Housing Bubble, for example, have a keen understanding of the relationship between loosey-goosey mortgage-lending standards and brisk sales in the face of rising housing prices (and rising commissions). Your local new- or used-car dealer knows that he can charge higher prices for vehicles that are to be financed by people who care more about their monthly payment than about the total cost. There are some critics of the federal response to the 2008–09 financial crisis who believe that the recent run-up in the stock markets and the prices of other assets is fundamentally the result of inflation through quantitative easing and other measures. (You don’t have to believe that that was a necessarily bad policy to believe that this is true, incidentally.) Easy credit contributes to higher prices.
If you make a few gazillion dollars available to finance tuition payments with underwriting standards a little bit lower than those of the average pawn shop, you create a lot of potential tuition inflation. Another way of saying this is that if Uncle Stupid puts a trillion bucks on the table, there are enough smart people at Harvard to figure out a way to pick it up. Advertisement
We managed to provide college educations to those wanting them for many generations without creating a body of debt larger than all of the credit-card bills in the nation combined. Our colleges have become faintly ridiculous places, in terms of their modest academic ambitions (lookin’ at you, journalism majors, women’s-studies departments, undergraduate programs in business administration), their top-heavy administrative structures (the number of administrators per student has exploded along with college debt, suggesting that colleges are being treated as full-employment programs for the politically connected classes), their resort-style amenities, etc. We accept more students but educate far fewer of them — at much greater expense. Advertisement
The best way to impose a little discipline on that mess is to make students, their families, and, most important, the institutions themselves carry their own water. The current system is exploitative: The students essentially function as a conveyor belt carrying government money into the universities, leaving borrowers instead of taxpayers on the hook because it looks better from an accounting point of view: If we just gave the universities money, that would show up on the books as an expenditure; lending it to students allows us to pretend that we have created an asset when all we have actually created is a great deal of debt and horses**t. Advertisement Advertisement
And, hard as it is to believe, it’s even worse in the so-called trade schools and “professional” programs advertised in subways and buses from coast to coast. If you want to know how much money has been transferred to the nation’s bartending academies, the Professional Golfers Career College, or the Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building under the guise of student lending, look here ."

(Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters) The present identity-politics divisiveness is not a sustainable model for a multiracial nation, and it will soon reach its natural limits one way or another.
E conomist Herbert Stein’s old adage – “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop” – still holds.
Take illegal immigration.
There are currently somewhere from eleven million to 15 million immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization. Last month, nearly 100,000 people were apprehended or turned away while trying to illegally cross the southern border. Some experts suggest that at least that number made it across without arrest. At that rate, the United States would be gaining a fairly large city of undocumented arrivals each month. Advertisement Advertisement
Most of the people who enter the United States illegally arrive without fluency in English, a high-school diploma, competitive job skills, or money. The majority will require support subsidies, and collectively they will require increased legal and law-enforcement investments.
At some point, American social services will be so taxed that the system will be rendered dysfunctional – as is already occurring in areas of the American Southwest. Or, some regions of America will so resemble the countries undocumented immigrants abandoned that there will be little point in heading north. Advertisement
Either way, the current border chaos will find its own self-correcting mechanisms, even if that means there will be no border at all – or northern Mexico and the southern United States will become indistinguishable. Advertisement
Currently, the national debt is $22 trillion and growing at a rate of nearly $1 trillion a year due to staggering annual budget deficits. The George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations roughly doubled the debt they inherited, and the Donald Trump administration may be on schedule to do the same.
More importantly, the national debt is now over 100 percent of the gross domestic product.
Presidents and Congress like to spend and to spread money to voters. They fear politically suicidal recessions if they cut back. But over the last 20 years, the government has mostly exhausted traditional economic stimuli such as larger budget deficits, near-zero real interest rates and expansion of the money supply. Advertisement
Common sense would dictate that in the present boom cycle, the president and Congress would get together to reduce discretionary spending and at least curb the growth of entitlements before we enter the next inevitable recession. Advertisement
Otherwise, history outlines a lot of near-automatic solutions to unsustainable government borrowing. Sometimes massive inflation ensues, as the government is forced to print currency to pay bondholders with play money, eroding the assets of those who are thrifty and put cash savings in the bank.
Sometimes more desperate governments simply renounce their obligations to bondholders, on the principle that such creditors are well off anyway and can afford the losses.
Another solution has been simply to slash defense spending and entitlements, and hope that neither a war abroad nor civil strife at home breaks out.
The common result of all these draconian solutions is a general distrust of government. The big fear is an ensuing Venezuela-like nightmare, with shortages, violence, black markets, mass flight, corruption, and hatred of elected officials.
For history’s rare multiracial and multiethnic republics, an “e pluribus unum” cohesion is essential. Each particular tribe must owe greater allegiance to the commonwealth than to those who superficially look or worship alike. Advertisement
Yet over the last 20 years, we have deprecated “unity” and championed “diversity.” Americans are being urged by popular culture, universities, schools, and government to emphasize their innate differences rather than their common similarities.
Sometimes the strained effort turns comical. Some hyphenate or add accents or foreign pronunciations to their names. Others fabricate phony ethnic pedigrees in hopes of gaining an edge in job-seeking or admissions.
The common theme is to be anything other than just normal Americans for whom race, gender, and ethnicity are incidental rather than essential to their character.
But unchecked tribalism historically leads to nihilism. Meritocracy is abandoned as bureaucrats select their own rather than the best qualified. A Tower of Babel chaos ensues as the common language is replaced by myriad local tongues, in the fashion of fifth-century imperial Rome. Class differences are subordinated to tribal animosities. Almost every contentious issue is distilled into racial or ethnic victims and victimizers.
History always offers guidance to the eventual end game when people are unwilling to give up their chauvinism. Vicious tribal war can break out as in contemporary Syria. The nation can fragment into ethnic enclaves as seen in the Balkans. Or factions can stake out regional no-go zones of power as we’ve seen in Iraq and Libya. Advertisement"
Electric-Vehicle Tax Credit Mainly Benefits Wealthy Owners | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/electric-vehicle-tax-credit-benefits-wealthy-owners/,"Follow George Will on Twitter April 18, 2019 6:30 AM A woman gets into her Tesla electric car at a supercharger station in Los Angeles, Calif., in 2018. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters) It efficiently illustrates how government can, with one act, diminish its already negligible prestige while subtracting from America’s fairness.
Washington — Some government foolishness has an educational value that compensates for its considerable cost. Consider the multibillion-dollar federal electric-vehicle tax credit, which efficiently illustrates how government can, with one act, diminish its already negligible prestige while subtracting from America’s fairness. Senator John Barrasso (R., Wyo.) and Representative Jason Smith (R., Mo.) hope to repeal the tax credit, which probably will survive because it does something that government enjoys doing: It transfers wealth upward by subsidizing affluent individuals and large economic entities. Advertisement
In 1992, Congress, with its itch to supplant the market in telling people what to build and buy, established a subsidy for buyers of electric vehicles, which then were a negligible fraction of the vehicle market. In 2009, however, as the nation reeled from the Great Recession, the Obama administration acted on an axiom of the president’s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” Using the crisis as an excuse to do what they wanted to do anyway, those who think government planning of the U.S. economy is a neat idea joined with environmentalists to persuade Congress — persuading it to dispense money is not difficult — to create a tax credit of up to $7,500 for consumers who buy battery-powered electric vehicles.
The tax credit was part of the administration’s “stimulus” package, which is most remembered for its promise of “shovel-ready” jobs. The president, too busy expanding the government to understand the consequences of prior expansions, discovered that such jobs are almost nonexistent, thanks to red tape that must be untangled before shovels can be wielded. Advertisement
The tax credit quickly became another example of the government’s solicitousness for those who are comfortable, and who are skillful in defense of their comforts. Today, demand for electric cars is still insufficient to produce manufacturing economies of scale (after a decade of production, moral exhortations, and subsidies, electric cars are a fraction of 1 percent of all vehicle sales), and batteries are expensive. So, the Wall Street Journal reports, the $42,000 average price for an electric car is $8,000 more than the average price of a new car, and $22,000 more than the average price of a new small gasoline-powered car.
The Pacific Research Institute has examined 2014 IRS data showing that 79 percent of the electric-vehicle tax credits were collected by households with adjusted gross incomes of more than $100,000, and 1 percent by households earning less than $50,000. A 2017 survey found that households earning $200,000 received the most from the tax credit. Advertisement Advertisement
Some states have augmented the federal credit: In California, where about half of electric vehicles are sold, consumers can gain up to $15,000; in insolvent Connecticut — blue states are incorrigible — $10,500. The credit is, however, capped: Manufacturers can only sell 200,000 vehicles eligible for the full credit. Now almost all manufacturers (including high-end companies Bentley, Aston Martin, and Maserati) are entering the electric-vehicle sector, and the cap is impinging on some of them (General Motors, Nissan). So, at long last, such vehicles can be allowed to sink or swim on their own, right?
Of course not. The Barrasso-Smith legislation is fiercely opposed by the manufacturers, who of course want to expand and entrench it by removing the cap, partly because they know what the Journal knows: “When Georgia ended its $5,000 state tax credit in 2015, sales of electric vehicles fell 89% in two months.”
Electric cars have cachet with advanced thinkers who want to be, or to be seen to be, environmentally nice. They do not think of such vehicles as 27.4 percent coal cars, that being the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by coal-fired power plants. According to a Manhattan Institute study:
[B]ecause of stringent emissions standards and low-sulfur gasoline, new ICVs [internal combustion vehicles] today emit very little pollution, and they will emit even less in the future. Compared with new ICVs, ZEVs [zero-emissions vehicles] charged with the forecast mix of electric generation will emit more criteria air pollutants.
And the reduction of carbon dioxide — “less than 1% of total forecast[ed] energy-related U.S. CO2 emissions through 2050” — “will have no measurable impact on climate."

(Carlos Barria/Reuters) Vox 's Ezra Klein would do better to examine his own party’s many phobias.
F ew techniques enrage more effectively than a single-word admonition to “relax.” Try it sometime when someone is upset; it’s lighter fluid on the fire, every time. Smug people know this, including the Sultan of Smug, Ezra Klein.
The founder of the young-adult site Vox is back with yet another essay saying, “Relax, conservatives.” This one repeats a favorite myth of the smug-progressive Left, which is that conservatism is powered by “fear.” Klein thinks that if only conservatives would relax about inevitable “change,” and vote accordingly, we could all march forward together into a shiny new era of tolerance, compassion, free-thinking, and love. It’ll be like Woodstock, only with better toilets. Advertisement Advertisement
When Klein talks about “change,” he is thinking of demography. He believes conservatives are getting driven off the rails by fears of black people and Muslims and documentation-challenged immigrants and maybe feminists and abstract art. Going back a bit, we had an “inordinate fear of Communism,” in Jimmy Carter’s famous words. Klein is chill about all of these things and urges us to be as fear-free as he is. As all the smugprogs are. As the Democratic party inherently is.
All Klein is actually doing here is proving his status as a bubble boy who never sets foot outside his comfortably furnished, intellectually climate-controlled living space. He is so intellectually dishonest that he is able to fool even himself. Advertisement
In fact, Klein and his party are all about fear. The Democratic party is defined by fear of climate change, of the police, of incipient theocracy, of white supremacists with tiki torches. It fears that the American Dream is dead, that the next generation will be far worse off, that abortions will have to be performed with coat hangers, and that capitalism is corrupt. It fears fascism, racism, Donald Trump, and the millionaires and billionaires who are hogging all the wealth. It fears GMOs and fast food and food deserts and that people are eating too much meat and that the planet will run out of food. It fears toxic masculinity, rape culture, and college fraternities. It fears gentrification and charter schools. It fears that fake news and Fox News and the Russians are going to steal the next election. It fears that the Koch Brothers and Ben Shapiro and Sinclair Broadcasting are warping millions of minds and that their reach is growing. It fears money spent by corporations in political campaigns and that millions of Americans are about to lose their health insurance. It fears voter suppression and voting machines. It fears the “change” that might be wrought by the Supreme Court and it fears the “change” that Amazon might have brought to Queens. It fears nuclear energy and school shootings and Chick-fil-A and anti-vaxxers. It fears that we are living on Page One of The Handmaid’s Tale . It fears having babies who will surely grow up in misery because of all of the above. Advertisement
I don’t have to go to the Left’s equivalent of Sean Hannity to find all this. It’s right there on Klein’s own site every day . Vox’s motto might as well be, “All the stuff that young adults fear.” Even the smugprogs whom Klein singles out as examples of fearless politicians are avatars of fear. Advertisement"
Bernie Sanders Is a One-Percenter | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mona Charen,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/bernie-sanders-wealth-taxes/,"April 18, 2019 6:30 AM Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks on Capitol Hill in 2018. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) If his wealth is tainted, it isn’t because he siphoned it from others. He earned it by peddling twaddle.
I n 2016 and 2017, Bernie Sanders raked in over a million bucks. Last year, his gross income was down to $561,293 — still not too shabby. The point is not to rib the senator about his membership in the top 1 percent, though that’s tempting. Nor is it to chide him for his relatively paltry charitable donations. His contributions to charity represented only 3.4 percent of his income, it’s true, but compared with some of his competitors in the Democratic field, that was generous. Beto O’Rourke reportedly contributed only one-third of one percent of his 2017 income ($370,412), and he may have underpaid his taxes by $4,000 by taking medical deductions in excess of the permitted amount. Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand all gave less than 2 percent of their incomes away. Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg have yet to release their tax returns, and of course President Trump is hiding behind a spectral audit (still not complete, three years on?) that in any case would present no legal obstacle to disclosure. Why he is hiding his “beautiful” tax returns is up to the imagination. Advertisement
The question for Bernie Sanders is: How can you sleep at night knowing that you became rich at the expense of the middle class and the poor?
“But I didn’t,” he would doubtless protest. “I made my money by selling thousands of copies of Our Revolution .” Speaking on Fox News, he was defiant: “If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I’m sorry, I’m not going to do it.”
But he should apologize, according to his own logic. How many times has Bernie Sanders alleged that “millionaires and billionaires” are siphoning off all of the nation’s wealth and hoarding it for themselves? Here’s a typical example from a 2015 interview with the Des Moines Register :
Is it right that the middle class continues to disappear while there has been a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the top one-tenth of 1 percent? Trillions of dollars in the last 30 years have flowed from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. And the American people say, ‘No, that’s not right.’
It’s also not true. Not remotely. Millionaires and billionaires acquire wealth by producing products and services that other people want to buy, from computers to Greek yogurt to bad books like Our Revolution . Sure, some millionaires and billionaires are born into wealth, but even they haven’t subtracted from the net worth of any other American. In fact, the rich tend to improve the lives of other Americans by 1) providing them with jobs, and 2) buying the products they manufacture, and 3) paying high taxes, and 4) contributing generously to charities (well, most rich people anyway, not presidential contenders).
As for Sanders’s notion that we have witnessed a “transfer of wealth from working families to the top one-tenth of 1 percent” — this is gibberish. How did that transfer happen? Were working families taxed heavily and the tippy-top one percenters excused? In that case, though it would be wrong to call it a transfer of wealth (the money wasn’t being deposited in Bill Gates’s account), it would amount to the rich being free riders when it comes to enjoying the goods of government including national defense, roads, food inspection, and so forth.

But, of course, that’s fantasy. As the Tax Foundation reports, in 2016 the top 1 percent earned 19.7 percent of total national income and paid 37.3 percent of income taxes. We have progressive tax rates, so the top 1 percent paid average taxes of 26.9 percent, which is seven times higher than taxpayers in the bottom half of the income distribution. Advertisement
As the for the “shrinking middle class” Senator Sanders is always lamenting, it is shrinking, but only because so many more Americans are joining the upper class. If “middle class” is defined as households between two-thirds and twice the median household income, then the percentage has declined from 61 percent in 1971 to 50 percent in 2015. As Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute notes, those people can go only one of two places: up or down. Most of those who are no longer in the middle class are in the upper class (though some fell below as well). In 1969, fewer than one out of twelve households earned $100,000 or more. By 2016, 27.7 percent were in that category. Politicians thrive on stories of decline and victimization, but the story of the past few decades — despite ups and downs — is one of increasing national wealth."

1990 —Dissenting in Osborne v. Ohio , Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens opine that possession of child pornography is protected by the First Amendment. Though unmoored from any plausible meaning of the First Amendment, their position is a logical extension of Justice Marshall’s activist ruling in Stanley v. Georgia (see This Day for April 7 , 1969). And faithless as they are to the actual Constitution and to precedents with which they disagree, liberal judicial activists vigorously apply activist precedents.
1990— At the same time that it unanimously holds that a federal district judge, in implementing a desegregation plan, lacked the authority to directly impose an increase in the property-tax levy in a school district, the Supreme Court decides, by a 5-to-4 vote (in Missouri v. Jenkins ), that the judge may direct the school district to increase the property tax and may enjoin the operation of any contrary state laws.
Writing in dissent (and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O’Connor and Scalia), Justice Anthony Kennedy disputes the “purported distinction between direct imposition of a tax by the federal court and an order commanding the school district to impose the tax,” and he condemns the majority holding:
“Today’s casual embrace of taxation imposed by the unelected, life-tenured Federal Judiciary disregards fundamental precepts for the democratic control of public institutions.”
2007 —Dissenting from the Supreme Court’s rejection (in Gonzales v. Carhart ) of a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg predicts that as-applied challenges to the law “will be mounted swiftly, to ward off serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women whose health would be endangered by the intact D&E prohibition.” In fact, years later, not a single such challenge will have been brought. Why not? Probably because (as I explored in “ The Mystery of the Missing Lawsuits ”) the abortion industry’s medical evidence that Ginsburg was so eager to credit has always been very feeble.

The Democratic leaders in the House and Senate called Thursday for Attorney General William Barr to testify publicly before Congress about what they called his “regrettably partisan handling” of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on the Russia investigation.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requested in a joint statement that attorney general testify to both chambers “as soon as possible.”
“Attorney General Barr’s regrettably partisan handling of the Mueller report, including his slanted March 24th summary letter, his irresponsible testimony before Congress last week, and his indefensible plan to spin the report in a press conference later this morning — hours before he allows the public or Congress to see it — have resulted in a crisis of confidence in his independence and impartiality,” Schumer and Pelosi said.
“We believe the only way to begin restoring public trust in the handling of the Special Counsel’s investigation is for Special Counsel Mueller himself to provide public testimony in the House and Senate as soon as possible. The American people deserve to hear the truth.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

The rise of Pete Buttigieg has been fairly astonishing to behold. It’s an entirely media-driven phenomenon, but then again the media can chauffeur a guy straight into the White House. As we’ve seen.
New polls have Mayor Pete in third place in both Iowa and New Hampshire. It’s a pretty distant third, but when you consider that Buttigieg was completely unknown until ten seconds ago, and recall the years of adoring media attention given Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, not to mention a ton of favorable coverage of Kamala Harris and nearly a year of nonstop propagandizing for Beto O’Rourke that would embarrass Kim Jong-un’s press chief, it’s astonishing that Buttigieg is even in the same group as these other candidates, much less ahead of them (by very small margins in some cases). (Oh, and Kirsten Gillibrand, your candidacy is already over. You’re at, or close to, zero. This is as good as it gets for you. Enjoy your lovely parting gifts.) Advertisement Advertisement
These last couple of weeks the media have been enacting the Distracted Boyfriend meme, swiveling their collective head from previous It Boy Beto to the new coolness, Buttigieg. Politico ’s acerbic media critic Jack Shafer ponders the question of what made the media dump Pete for Beto: “Think of Buttigieg as a newborn just delivered to his newsroom parents, his every grin and wink and grimace worthy of endless analysis and discussion, and you begin to fathom the press corps’ fascination with him.”"
S. Craig Zahler's Unapologetic Pulp Fiction,www.nationalreview.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/dragged-across-concrete-unapologetic-pulp-fiction/,"April 18, 2019 11:32 AM Mel Gibson in Dragged across Concrete (Unified Pictures)
I t is not necessarily praise to say of someone “he would have been more successful in the ’70s,” but I’m pretty sure S. Craig Zahler would take it as a compliment. Zahler is the writer and director of a series of extremely long, carefully composed, brutally violent movies, which have mostly had their life on video and on-demand. Each one has starred big names (Kurt Russell, Vince Vaughn) somewhat on the down side of their careers; the latest, Dragged across Concrete , stars Mel Gibson as a racist cop suspended for putting his foot on a suspect’s head, a casting move that naturally has created extra interest and controversy for the film. Advertisement Advertisement
Some of that attention has been dismissive, depicting Zahler as just a right-wing provocateur. But some has been more intriguing, and intrigued. “A singular, dangerous talent,” The Ringer ’s Scott Tobias called Zahler, while asking of his filmography: “How often are American viewers confronted by a movie that doesn’t need to be liked?”
The answer, in the age of blockbusters and algorithms and fan service, is not often. I had not watched any Zahler before his latest movie, so last week I watched Concrete back to back with Brawl in Cell Block 99 , his second effort, from 2017. (His first film, Bone Tomahawk , a pulp western in which Russell fights cannibals, I’m saving to watch on a completely empty stomach.) I can report that his films are not for the faint of heart, that they are politically incorrect without being politically didactic, that they have dialogue that wavers between pretension and perfection, and that they have an entirely distinctive and unapologetic style. Is that an endorsement? Yes, I think it is. Advertisement
Both movies are essentially pulp fiction, offered with Tarantino-esque enthusiasm for the grindhouse but without his irony or adolescent glee. Both are concerned with the conflict between bad men who have a code and bad men who are essentially satanic. In neither case do you get the Death Wish –style vigilante scenario in which a normal person is just pushed too far. Nobody has to push Zahler’s protagonists: They’re violent men who end up in dire situations because of their own mistakes and sins. Nor are their lives sentimentalized or their criminal chops admired. We are on their side only because they end up against something much worse than mere criminality and vice.
In Brawl , the protagonist, Bradley Thomas, is played by a looming, stoic, bald, and tattooed Vaughn: He’s a former boxer whom we first see destroying a car in rage over his wife’s infidelity, only to go inside and calmly decide that they should stay together and try to have another child. To support them, he becomes the muscle for a drug dealer, promising that it will be temporary, but by the time she gets pregnant it seems permanent. Then a deal goes wrong, and Vaughn’s character makes a moral but unwise choice, one that lands him in prison and in the crosshairs of a drug lord, who kidnaps his wife and threatens to have an abortionist maim their child in utero unless he figures out a way to get into the titular maximum-security cell block and murder someone held therein. Advertisement Advertisement
The violence that follows is substantial, since Vaughn’s character has to deal out considerable punishment just to get himself assigned to cell block 99. But the movie is also unusually at leisure — giving us a long introduction to prison-intake systems, allowing minor characters to flare and vanish without being strictly necessary to the plot. The dialogue is hard-boiled, writerly, sardonic, ultimately sincere.
The same habits are at work in Dragged across Concrete . Vaughn returns as Lurasetti, the junior partner to Gibson’s cop, Ridgeman, an aging detective who’s curdling into bigotry and brutality. Together they get suspended for the Gibson character’s not-terrible-but-still-excessive use of force; together they decide to rob a drug dealer (the older cop wants to move his family out of a bad neighborhood; the younger one is proposing to his too-smart-for-him girlfriend); together they end up dragged into a horror-show bank robbery carried out by psychopaths. Dragged with them is the alternative protagonist, Henry (Tory Kittles), a small-time hood hired as the getaway driver, trying to earn money to support his wayward mother and crippled kid brother. Dragged as well are a lot of innocents, to whom it would be unwise to become attached. Advertisement"

Williamson April 18, 2019 11:35 AM Actress Felicity Huffman, facing charges in a nationwide college admissions cheating scheme, leaves federal court in Boston, Mass., April 3, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) You’re not sorry if you’re trying to get something by saying so
F elicity Huffman, an overripe actress charged with fraud in a high-profile college-admissions scandal, has learned at least one thing about professional stagecraft: Always listen to the writer .
She got a pretty good one to do her apology, which reads in part:
I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions. I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.
That is a classical good apology: admission of guilt, statement of regret, specific acknowledgments of harm done — and no excuses. No sudden recollection of childhood abuse or trauma, no prescription-drug side effects, no checking herself into rehab. That’s the kind of apology that might keep you out of jail.
And it’s an increasingly rare thing.
Former Full House actress Lori Loughlin, charged in the same scandal, is going the opposite direction. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. People magazine quotes an “insider” — Lori Loughlin “insiders” are a thing, apparently — explaining the situation. “She felt that she hadn’t done anything that any mom wouldn’t have done, if they had the means to do so.” On top of bad public-relations advice, she’s apparently getting bad legal advice, too. “To her, it wasn’t egregious behavior. Was it entitled and perhaps selfish? Perhaps. But she didn’t see it as being a legal violation.” That’s going to go over just not terribly well: “It didn’t feel like a felony, your honor.” Advertisement
If you’re wondering which is the dumb one, now you know. Advertisement
Apologies in the early 21st century have become almost entirely self-interested affairs — which, in a sense, means that they are not authentic apologies. Which is fair enough, since they are so often demanded for things that are not authentic offenses.
Our apologies are instrumental and, in a popular culture in which people pride themselves on being media-savvy (irrespective of whether they have any real experience in such things), there is a kind of self-conscious cynicism about apologies and the uses to which they may be put. In much the same way that every barstool NFL analyst fancies himself a Bill Belichick in waiting, the gawkers of the political and celebrity worlds (to the extent that they are today distinguishable from each other) like to play spin doctor, thinking of themselves as masters of the dark arts of opinion manipulation. Advertisement
They do not ask whether the apology was honest, but whether it worked . Advertisement
For example, public figures of various kinds constantly are having to apologize for violating social taboos that did not exist five minutes ago: pronoun abuse, “dead-naming,” “cultural appropriation,” etc. Bryan Cranston, the great actor, has been hounded for months by critics who want him to apologize for playing a disabled man when he is not, in fact, disabled. (He is also neither a New Mexico public-school teacher turned meth kingpin nor Lyndon Baines Johnson.) So far, he has held out. But he’s a rarity: Scarlett Johansson groveled and ran away when criticized for accepting the role of a historical character who might have been transsexual. Emma Stone apologized for playing a part-Hawaiian woman who wasn’t supposed to look part-Hawaiian, which Emma Stone isn’t and doesn’t. These apologies serve a pretty obvious purpose: These people would like to continue working and being celebrities, and they fear the mob. That no one really takes them seriously is almost beside the point: This is a ritual, and a kind of game — a contest.
Like much of the tone of our current public life — and much that is wrong with it — this tendency first announced itself in the late 1990s in the person of Bill Clinton, who, lucky for him, followed his career as a politician and intern botherer before there were hashtags. When President Clinton finally was no longer able to keep lying about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, he offered an angry half-apology during which he heaped bile on the special prosecutors investigating him. That did not work . And so he tried again — about a half-dozen times, in fact. A week and a half after his first vitriolic non-apology, he struck a new tone: whiny. “I’m having to become quite an expert in this business of asking for forgiveness,” he said, though the expertise was not in evidence. Advertisement
That failed, too, and so he tried a maneuver I call the Exalted Cyclops, after Senator Robert K. Byrd, the Democratic grandee and quondam Klan boss who often talked about how he had apologized for his KKK ways without ever actually seeming to have made any substantive public apology. Clinton didn’t really apologize, but insisted he had: “You know, I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable time with my family in the last couple of weeks.” Yeah. I’ll bet “valuable” is exactly how Mrs. Clinton remembers it.
That sank, too, and so two days later it was “a big mistake” and “indefensible.” Advertisement Advertisement
Some Democrats founded a group called MoveOn.org — after eleven minutes, it was time to “move on” from the scandal and the perjury and all that ruckus — and the president got a little ahead of himself: Two days after “indefensible” it was time for “reconciliation and healing.” And, later that day, it was back on the public, not the president: “I’ve tried to do a good job taking care of this country, even when I haven’t taken such good care of myself and my family and my obligations. I hope that you and others I have injured will forgive me for the mistakes I’ve made, but the most important thing is you must not let it deter you from meeting your responsibilities as citizens.”
That was a heck of a time to start lecturing people about their responsibilities .
Young Barack Obama surely was paying attention and would put the lesson into effect some years later when, criticized for his longtime association with the racist loon Jeremiah Wright, he gave a speech in which he hectored other Americans — Americans at large — about their racial hang-ups. He didn’t even make a pro forma apology, just straight for the neck. “As imperfect as . . . he may be,” he said of his pastor, “he has been like family to me.” Advertisement
“ I’m sorry? You’re sorry!” It helps if you read it in Robert De Niro’s Taxi Driver voice.
Harvey Weinstein tried that approach, too, roughly: “I’m sorry? The NRA should be sorry!” He had less success: Obama had better writers.
President Clinton got real sorry real quick when the big stick came out and he was impeached. The public and his family got angry half-apologies: Congress got groveling. “What I want the American people to know, what I want the Congress to know, is that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds,” Clinton said. “I never should have misled the country, the Congress , my friends, and my family. . . . Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel for what our country is going through, and for what members of both parties in Congress are now forced to deal with. These past months have been a torturous process of coming to terms with what I did. I understand that accountability demands consequences, and I’m prepared to accept them. Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have caused my family.”
No one believed that, of course, and no one pretended to — not even that fink Bill Clinton, really. People just kind of kept score. Clinton got reelected and did a little F***-You dance on the lawn in the Rose Garden — advantage: Big Creep. Advertisement
By one count, Hillary Rodham Clinton included almost 40 different apologies in her book What Happened. These were not exactly exercises in heartfelt contrition: “I regret handing Trump a political gift with my ‘deplorables’ comments,” she wrote. “I am sorry about that.” Sorry about gratuitously insulting people? Please — she’s sorry in the way someone who shoots himself in the foot is sorry. She’s genuinely sorry she lost.
The memory of Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign calls to mind the case of Nick Burchill, who was banned for life by the Fairmont Empress Hotel in Victoria, Canada, because of a mishap involving a suitcase packed with pepperoni. (How do you travel?) He left his hotel window open, to help keep the pepperoni cool, and . . .
“I remember walking down the long hall and opening the door to my room to find an entire flock of seagulls in my room,” he wrote in his letter of apology to the hotel. “I didn’t have time to count, but there must have been 40 of them and they had been in my room, eating pepperoni for a long time.”
Seagulls. Eating pepperoni.
For a long time.
“They immediately started flying around and crashing into things as they desperately tried to leave the room through the small opening by which they had entered. The result was a tornado of seagull excrement, feathers, pepperoni chunks and fairly large birds whipping around the room.” After almost 20 years and a pretty good letter of apology, his exile was lifted.
Burchill got a long stay in the woodshed for what was an honest mistake, if a stupid one. Felicity Huffman probably will never find herself declared persona non grata by a nice hotel. Bill Clinton is welcomed almost everywhere. Advertisement"

W hat will the Democrats run on in 2020 if the economy is good? Perhaps a return to the normal discourse, where the rubes are smoothed and groomed by soft hands and silver tongues and can be herded into the pen of consensus. The rhetoric will be familiar, but there’s a complication this time. It’s hard to reach out to people you despise.
Sample blather you might get from earnest candidates:
“We have to join together to fight the people who have joined us to fight! Only through unity can all of us unite, and only by putting aside our differences can we agree on the things that divide us.”
Uh — okay, but I don’t agree with you.
“And that’s fine! Not agreeing is what makes America great. We can find common ground where we both can stand, together.”
Yeah, but what about regulations that forbid us to stand on that particular ground because it was a wetland in 1964 and has to be preserved to protect the habitat of a hermaphroditic weevil?
“Then together, on different parts of ground that border the common ground, we can reach across and do the work that needs doing. I see an America where everyone does the doing, works the work, and does not shirk from the hard tasks of making tomorrow not only happen, but happen for everyone.”
Tomorrow, by definition, happens for everyone who does not expire before sunrise. Are you proposing federal regulations that make it illegal to die between sundown and sunup? Let me guess: the Dare All to Wake Now Act, or DAWN. It contains a package of incentives to keep people from dying before sunup, as defined by the National Weather Service. People who die before sunup shall be fined on a graduated scale. Is that it?
And so on. You suspect that the Dems really want to run on America’s wrack and ruin: This nation has always been a racist, patriarchal hellscape, except for a brief shining moment between 2008 and 2016, when it seemed possible — nay, likely — that everyone in the future would be a gender-neutral Web programmer. Everyone who mattered, anyway.
How do they find a polite way to let everyone know that Trump is literally Hitler and must be replaced with figurative Marx?
A recent Twitter thread with almost 10,000 likes and retweets detailed how far down the Hitler Path we’ve gone, including building a wall whose real purpose is to keep people trapped in America.
Really? you say. Yes. According to the #Resistance side of Twitter, the president’s Schicklgruberness is obvious, but you wonder if they have any historical knowledge. We already had a Hitler president, the previous iteration being the blood-and-oil-soaked George W. McChimpy Bushitler. He was such a grave threat to international peace and happiness that the Left deployed every tool it had, from mocking photoshops to papier-mâché puppets, and it worked: Chastened, he did not declare himself Führer, probably on advice from Dick Cheney, who thought he’d mispronounce it.
Ah am yore Furr-hurr! Heil, y’all!
(Cheney rolls eyes, thinks, “We’ll take another run at this in eight years.”)
So the Left probably believes, anyway. People with long memories — past 2016, I mean — recall that Hitleresque terminology was floated to describe Panamanian dictator Noriega. When he was in the news, some people thought his actual name was “Strongman Noriega,” since that’s how he was always described, as if he wore an animal-print tunic and lifted barbells in a circus. It is difficult to remember why someone who looked like a malevolent pineapple rose to near-Hitler status, but it was a more peaceful time.
Saddam Hussein had a better run as the next Hitler, since he had an ideology — Ba’athism, which sounds like socialism for sheep — and ethnic quarrels. He had an enemy to the east. Like Hitler, he fancied himself an artist — the German dictator painted, Hussein wrote novels in his own blood, which is really the definition of self-publishing.
Bonus — he threw rockets at the Jews! You’d think this would be an important part of the neo-Hitler definition and would disqualify Bush the Latter and Trump. But the Left just defined Muslims as the new Jews, and Jews became honorary Christians of a sort — meaning, you could hate them now, to your immense relief — and all was good.
Now Trump is Hitler Galore, complete with Ayatollah Pence at his side. Stands to reason that this will be the main rhetorical thrust of the Democratic candidate, no? If you’re the last shot to save the nation from Hitlerian Hitlerism at its Hitlerest, you’d better not play nice.
But the current golden-boy duo of Beto-Buttigieg, which sounds like a wedding announcement in a Star Wars movie, are praised for their un-Trumpian tone. The positivity. The hope! That might work for people not inclined to pay attention to particulars. The people who want an angry ranter who denounces Trump for putting toddlers in cages and making them deny Science (in Russian) won’t be happy with a cotton-candy spinner.
They might have to pause in their denunciation of old gropey white males to tout the fierce necessity of Joe Biden. They might have to stop condemning the state for sending minorities to prison for drug matters to rally behind Kamala Harris. They might have to stop railing against hypocrite millionaires to back the Bern."
A Reflection on the Beginning of Spring | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Richard Brookhiser,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/stepping-to-spring/,"April 18, 2019 11:20 AM Spring in Central Park (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)
T he first step comes on New Year’s Day. I am very strict about this: There will be no belated Christmas trappings like hungover guests who collapsed in the coatroom. The ornaments come off, and the tree comes out of its stand and gets hoisted to the lawn. The sawn-off branches mulch the garden, the bare trunk gets pitched on the brush pile. Time also to take down the colored metal balls I hung on the potted pines by the front door, unless crows and jays have beat me to it, spiriting them away to their hordes of shiny objects.
The boughs we lay on the mantel, having no definite holiday significance, stay through the cold weeks, until time sucks all moisture out of them and a touch sends showers of needles to the floor. Taking them down is hand-prickling business. We once found, among the twigs, a mouse who had crept up, eaten juniper berries, and was no longer stirring. I stack the boughs in the fireplace and touch a match. A grate full of pine needles offers myriad surface areas; they blaze, and actually roar, like the last judgment. The orange afterglow lingers for minutes.
One step we used to take about this time was an addition, not a subtraction — hanging out two or four buckets to collect sap. When the sun is higher but the ground is still covered with snow, that is the time to rap spiles into the maple trunks and let the sap flow. It comes in drops, but it does not stop, like the ticking of a no-wind tree clock. The tink-tink sound is both pert and primal. Even the pure sap has a slight sweet tang, and the syrup, when you finally boil it down, is rich and wonderful. But the process of collecting and reducing is unrelenting; the ratio of sap to syrup is 40 to one. I am glad we did it for a couple of late winters; our friend Doug even made a custom label for our — one jug, or was it two? Now I am content to get my syrup from the retired prison guard who boils and bottles it professionally down the road.
Chipmunks appear. Squirrels we have always with us, their smaller striped neighbors hibernate. There comes a day though when the chipmunks are back, with their scraggly tails and their big babies’ eyes. They make squirrels look staid and slow-footed. I have not seen them yet this year. Have they caught some disease? Is there a cycle of which I am unaware? Did red squirrels, of which I have seen several, move in on their niche? I have 22 acres; something that weighs a couple of ounces can find its own niche. About the same time, or a little later, the colors in or on certain tree branches change. Willows brighten, the high-up tips of maples blush. The red of the maples is caused by a haze of tiny flowers, which precede the leaves. Look at them, they will soon be gone.
Next you take down the bird feeders. In the worst weather you were never without the company of the winter flock. There is food intelligence, if not safety, in numbers, and so they come together, making, I imagine, the rounds of other feeders in the neighborhood, in addition to mine. When I top up with a load of sunflower seeds, chickadees announce, the café car is open. Then come the juncos, bellies seemingly whitened from the snow they stick to, no-longer-gold finches, upside-down nuthatches, titmouses, sparrows, maybe some exotic that sends you to guidebooks — wait, did it have a spot on its breast?

Samuel Johnson & 'The Club' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John J. Miller,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/the-club-book-review-samuel-johnsons-world/,"April 18, 2019 11:05 AM A literary party at Sir Joshua Reynolds’ by D. George Thompson (National Portrait Gallery)
I n the famous dictionary he published in 1755, Samuel Johnson defined a “club” as “an assembly of good fellows, meeting under certain conditions.” Nine years later, in 1764, the lexicographer became a founder of the Club, with a capital C. Its good fellows met under these conditions: They gathered one evening each week near the Strand in London, where they took a private room at the Turk’s Head Tavern, ordered food and wine, and conversed about topics great and small. Members “had to be good company — ready to talk, laugh, drink, eat, and argue until late into the night,” writes Leo Damrosch in The Club , an ambitious, multi-part biography of their lives and times. Advertisement
The Club was no ordinary collection of drinking buddies. Rather, it represented an astonishing assembly of talent and accomplishment. Members included Johnson as well as James Boswell, Edmund Burke, Edward Gibbon, and Adam Smith. These five, according to Damrosch, were “arguably the greatest British critic, biographer, political philosopher, historian, and economist of all time.” The Club’s second-tier members also were extraordinary: David Garrick, the greatest actor of the age; Joshua Reynolds, a top painter; and Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, two of the era’s most successful playwrights. Men of this caliber of intellectual and cultural firepower have congregated only rarely, in places such as classical Athens, Renaissance Florence, and, coincidentally, in Philadelphia at roughly the same time as Johnson’s group.
Who wouldn’t want to eavesdrop on the Club’s conversations? Imagine Johnson and Garrick debating the art of Shakespeare. Or Boswell and Reynolds discussing the differences between written and visual portraiture. Or Burke and Smith — a pair of thinkers whose ideas echo loudly in today’s conservative movement — chatting about just about anything. That’s the implicit promise of Damrosch’s book. “The Club is the virtual hero of this story,” writes the author, a retired professor of literature at Harvard University. Yet this organizing principle turns out to be a curious weakness. Although the members of the Club left behind a massive record of books, essays, and speeches, almost nothing remains of what they said when they met in person. There are no transcripts. Only occasionally did one of them jot down the remarks of another. We have a star-studded cast, but there’s no script. Advertisement
Damrosch solves this problem by shifting his attention away from the specific activities of the Club and onto the amply documented friendship of Johnson and Boswell. They were an impressive duo, and The Club is essentially about them, with several tangents into the lives of their compatriots. This is well-trod ground, starting with Boswell’s own Life of Johnson and running through a long list of biographies that focus on one, the other, or the two together. Do we really need a new account of this old story? Perhaps. “When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life,” Johnson once said. It’s also hard to tire of Johnson, a dazzling wit who shaped the way we think about language and literature. Boswell, too, is a good subject. He was a pioneer in the art of biography and a dutiful diarist, whose revealing journals comprise more than a dozen volumes.
The world of Johnson is so rich that scholars have given it a name: Johnsoniana. There’s even a subfield: Boswelliana. Yet the map of their lives contains a few frustrating areas of terra incognita. Writers have had little to say about the friendship between Johnson and Burke, for example. Both were founding members of the Club, belonging to it for about a decade before Boswell, Gibbon, and Smith joined. They enjoyed a long connection, shared many interests, and were mutually admiring. Johnson was a hard man to impress, but he had the highest regard for Burke: “You could not stand five minutes with that man beneath a shed while it rained, but you must be convinced you had been standing with the greatest man you had ever seen.” The only thing that he may not have liked about his fellow Clubber was Burke’s fondness for groan-inducing puns. One time, for example, Burke sat near a ham. “I am Ham-Burke ,” he said, punning on the name of Hamburg, the German city. In recounting the incident, Damrosch says the most charitable thing possible: “You had to be there.” Advertisement Advertisement
This is the fundamental obstacle for any biographer who seeks to describe the friendship of Johnson and Burke: You had to have been there. They might have engaged in some of the greatest conversations in history, but we just don’t know, because conversations are ephemeral. Unless someone records them, they vanish like wisps of smoke. To compensate for their disappearance, Damrosch offers a brief biography of Burke, but it fails to show why Burke deserved Johnson’s profound admiration. Part of the problem may be Damrosch’s garden-variety liberalism. Today’s conservatives honor Burke as one of their intellectual heroes, largely for his authorship of Reflections on the Revolution in France , which warned against the chaos of mobs and the abandonment of tradition. Damrosch tries to push back, scolding American conservatives for having “idealized Burke as their foundational thinker” when the radical Thomas Paine mattered more to the Founding Fathers. Damrosch goes to great pains to make this point — or great Paines, to use a Burkean pun — but he seems unfamiliar with the writings of Peter Stanlis, Russell Kirk, and Yuval Levin. They’re nowhere in the footnotes, even though their work is indispensable to an understanding of Burke’s brand of conservatism and what American conservatives see in it. Advertisement Advertisement
Damrosch’s coverage of Smith is also a letdown, though in this case his characters hobble him. The introverted author of The Wealth of Nations was a “strangely recessive” member of the Club. When he was elected to it in 1775, Boswell, his former student in Edinburgh, grumbled that the Club had “lost its selective merit.” Johnson was sharper: Smith, he said, was “as dull a dog as he had ever met with.” The animosities at the Club extended to others as well: “Johnson and Boswell both loathed Gibbon,” writes Damrosch. In this instance, at least, their ire is rooted in disdain for what they perceived as anti-Christian views in Gibbon’s magnum opus, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . So here’s a substantial disagreement, and the prospect of rhetorical fireworks, but the fact remains that we just don’t know much about what Johnson, Boswell, and Gibbon said to one other at the Turk’s Head Tavern. Advertisement
With so little to report about what really happened at meetings of the Club, Damrosch turns not only to potted biographies of great men but also to what he calls Johnson’s “shadow club” or “second club.” This was the social circle that surrounded Hester Thrale, who became something of a patron to Johnson. She was also a devoted diarist, and if Boswell never had lived, her writings would serve as the favorite source of Johnson’s biographers. Even with Boswell’s biography, Thrale offers a unique contribution. Boswell, writes Damrosch, “felt a jealous rivalry with Hester for Johnson’s affection.” He essentially ignores her in The Life of Johnson , and she has much to say that Boswell doesn’t. Advertisement Advertisement
Thrale has provided anecdotes and insights into everything from Johnson’s method of composition to his mental health. He clearly suffered from what people in the 18th century called “melancholy.” Our word for it is “depression,” and Johnson’s case seems to have been severe. It may also be linked to his brilliance, making him a quintessential case of a tortured genius.
The torture was literal, according to Katharine C. Balderston, the editor of Thrale’s diary (known as — wait for it — Thraliana ). In 1949, Balderston described Johnson as a victim of “erotic maladjustment.” She continued: “His compulsive fantasy assumed a masochistic form, in which the impulse to self-abasement and pain predominated.” In other words, Mrs. Thrale padlocked Johnson and beat him with rods in acts of sexual perversion. Provocative claims require compelling proof, and in this case the evidence is thin. Most Johnson scholars have rejected it, including W. Jackson Bate, Peter Martin, and John Wain. Damrosch, however, accepts Balderston’s theory without hesitation. That’s fine, but beyond labeling her original article “controversial,” he doesn’t indicate to readers that this wild speculation is in fact a minority opinion.
Elsewhere, Damrosch makes better observations and wiser judgments. He marvels at the “remarkable” fluke that both Johnson and Garrick hailed from Lichfield, a small city near Birmingham, and they were buried beside each other in the Poets’ Corner of Westminster Abbey. Damrosch also endorses Johnson’s own belief that if he hadn’t quit Oxford for lack of funds, he might have disappeared into the mire of academia, never to be heard from again. Johnson instead moved to Grub Street, the traditional home of Londoners who scribbled for a living. Damrosch goes on to suggest that Johnson should have tried a medium that was just starting to catch on: “In hindsight it’s clear that the best path to success would have been as a novelist.” Unfortunately for fans of the novel, Johnson disliked the form.

Regarding “Neither Idol Nor Tool” (February 11): Here’s what, I think, Tucker Carlson meant in his critique of markets. Rather than bowing to GDP and the free market by offshoring factories, jobs, and supply chains to lower-cost locales, national leaders and policymakers should have tempered their fealty to the god of commerce with consideration for the national good. Carlson argues that the health of the family is a good proxy for the national good. In those terms, what you call “restrictions on trade” may prove salubrious. Retaining factories and jobs would certainly have proven to be “a great economic boon for Americans in [now] distressed communities.”
A similar framework can be used regarding Trump’s proposed changes to our current immigration processes, including asylum and border security. Has it been useful to our existing citizens, especially those at the lower wage rungs, to have millions of unvetted, low-educated workers competing in an increasingly slack labor market? Our national leaders and policymakers should have, rather, implemented policies supportive of our existing citizens and their dreams of starting and supporting families by responsibly limiting the waves of illegal migrants these past years. Blamoh Holmes Blue Ash, Ohio
Ramesh Ponnuru responds: While I am sympathetic to much of this commentary, I would caution that before imposing restrictions on trade to benefit American workers, we should make sure they actually will benefit American workers. Tariffs on steel in the past have injured many more Americans than they have helped, by inflicting harm on steel-using industries that employ more people than the steel industry does. Too often proposals on trade ignore these pitfalls.
Beliefs Can Go Bad
My very liberal aunt, chairwoman of the English department at UC Davis, gave me a subscription to NR in the late 1950s. I have been a subscriber ever since. Lately I have become disappointed in much of NR’s editorial slant.
An example is your paragraph (April 8) on the New Zealand massacre. I think you need to explain why you take it as a given that white nationalism is a creature of the Right. Perhaps you should carefully define exactly what it is that NR believes constitutes “the Right” that harbors white nationalism. James Bridges Lafayette, Calif.
The editors respond: Conservatism expresses, among other things, a reverence for community and custom. White nationalism is a demonic parody of this disposition."
'Dragged across Concrete' Movie Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ross Douthat,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/dragged-across-concrete-unapologetic-pulp-fiction/,"April 18, 2019 11:32 AM Vince Vaughn and Mel Gibson in Dragged across Concrete (Unified Pictures)
I t is not necessarily praise to say of someone “he would have been more successful in the ’70s,” but I’m pretty sure S. Craig Zahler would take it as a compliment. Zahler is the writer and director of a series of extremely long, carefully composed, brutally violent movies, which have mostly had their life on video and on-demand. Each one has starred big names (Kurt Russell, Vince Vaughn) somewhat on the down side of their careers; the latest, Dragged across Concrete , stars Mel Gibson as a racist cop suspended for putting his foot on a suspect’s head, a casting move that naturally has created extra interest and controversy for the film. Advertisement Advertisement
Some of that attention has been dismissive, depicting Zahler as just a right-wing provocateur. But some has been more intriguing, and intrigued. “A singular, dangerous talent,” The Ringer ’s Scott Tobias called Zahler, while asking of his filmography: “How often are American viewers confronted by a movie that doesn’t need to be liked?”
The answer, in the age of blockbusters and algorithms and fan service, is not often. I had not watched any Zahler before his latest movie, so last week I watched Concrete back to back with Brawl in Cell Block 99 , his second effort, from 2017. (His first film, Bone Tomahawk , a pulp western in which Russell fights cannibals, I’m saving to watch on a completely empty stomach.) I can report that his films are not for the faint of heart, that they are politically incorrect without being politically didactic, that they have dialogue that wavers between pretension and perfection, and that they have an entirely distinctive and unapologetic style. Is that an endorsement? Yes, I think it is. Advertisement
Both movies are essentially pulp fiction, offered with Tarantino-esque enthusiasm for the grindhouse but without his irony or adolescent glee. Both are concerned with the conflict between bad men who have a code and bad men who are essentially satanic. In neither case do you get the Death Wish –style vigilante scenario in which a normal person is just pushed too far. Nobody has to push Zahler’s protagonists: They’re violent men who end up in dire situations because of their own mistakes and sins. Nor are their lives sentimentalized or their criminal chops admired. We are on their side only because they end up against something much worse than mere criminality and vice.
In Brawl , the protagonist, Bradley Thomas, is played by a looming, stoic, bald, and tattooed Vaughn: He’s a former boxer whom we first see destroying a car in rage over his wife’s infidelity, only to go inside and calmly decide that they should stay together and try to have another child. To support them, he becomes the muscle for a drug dealer, promising that it will be temporary, but by the time she gets pregnant it seems permanent. Then a deal goes wrong, and Vaughn’s character makes a moral but unwise choice, one that lands him in prison and in the crosshairs of a drug lord, who kidnaps his wife and threatens to have an abortionist maim their child in utero unless he figures out a way to get into the titular maximum-security cell block and murder someone held therein. Advertisement Advertisement
The violence that follows is substantial, since Vaughn’s character has to deal out considerable punishment just to get himself assigned to cell block 99. But the movie is also unusually at leisure — giving us a long introduction to prison-intake systems, allowing minor characters to flare and vanish without being strictly necessary to the plot. The dialogue is hard-boiled, writerly, sardonic, ultimately sincere.
The same habits are at work in Dragged across Concrete . Vaughn returns as Lurasetti, the junior partner to Gibson’s cop, Ridgeman, an aging detective who’s curdling into bigotry and brutality. Together they get suspended for the Gibson character’s not-terrible-but-still-excessive use of force; together they decide to rob a drug dealer (the older cop wants to move his family out of a bad neighborhood; the younger one is proposing to his too-smart-for-him girlfriend); together they end up dragged into a horror-show bank robbery carried out by psychopaths. Dragged with them is the alternative protagonist, Henry (Tory Kittles), a small-time hood hired as the getaway driver, trying to earn money to support his wayward mother and crippled kid brother. Dragged as well are a lot of innocents, to whom it would be unwise to become attached. Advertisement "
Kamala Harris Kind of Campaigns in Iowa | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Mccormack,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/kamala-harris-kind-of-campaigns-in-iowa/,"April 18, 2019 11:35 AM (Roman Genn) But retail politics, so far, is not her thing Des Moines
K amala Harris is at the Mars Cafe, an environmentally conscious coffee shop on the edge of Drake University’s campus, to grab a coffee and meet some students for a photo op. When she places her order, Harris knows she wants an iced coffee but isn’t sure whether she should choose soy milk, almond milk, or oat milk to go with it. The barista helpfully has a recommendation: “Oat milk is the most sustainable of the alternative milks,” he says, later explaining that California’s almonds consume a considerable amount of resources. The California senator happily heeds the advice of the potential Iowa caucus-goer, perhaps becoming a little more enlightened along the way. Advertisement Advertisement
At the moment, Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign is a bit like oat milk: not exciting but potentially the most sustainable of the Democratic alternatives to front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Harris has faded somewhat in the polls since she first launched her campaign, while former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg are taking their turns in the spotlight. Harris was in second place, at 18 percent, in an Iowa poll conducted by Emerson a week after she launched her campaign in late January. By the end of March, Emerson found that Harris had dropped to 10 percent and was sitting in fourth place in Iowa, behind, respectively, Biden, Sanders, and Buttigieg. (As of this writing, Biden has not announced that he is running.) At the same time, Harris’s $12 million fundraising haul for the first three months of 2019 bested that of every Democratic candidate in the field except Sanders.
Despite her dip in the polls, the case for Harris as the Democratic nominee remains compelling: Biden and Sanders are too old; O’Rourke and Buttigieg are too inexperienced. In the Goldilocks theory of the race, Kamala Harris is just right. The 54-year-old biracial first-term female senator checks almost every box, in terms of both intersectional identity politics and the progressive policy agenda, including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. And she is cozy enough with the tech titans of Silicon Valley to raise lots of money. Harris is almost the perfect synthesis of the modern Democratic party. Advertisement
“If she was a stock right now, I’d buy her,” Jim Messina, Barack Obama’s presidential-campaign manager, said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on April 11. Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign chief, told CNBC at the end of March that a Kamala Harris–Beto O’Rourke ticket would offer Democrats their “best shot” at defeating Trump in 2020.
Here inside the Mars Cafe, Lily Feiger, a junior studying politics at Drake, tells me she’s still undecided about which Democrat she’ll back in the 2020 caucuses. But she sees a lot to like in Harris. “I love her,” says Feiger. “I think she has what Hillary didn’t have. And I loved Hillary, and I think she was the most qualified candidate we’ve ever had ever. But I think she just wasn’t personable enough. And I think Kamala is.” Advertisement Advertisement
So why hasn’t Harris taken off in the polls? On the trail, the answer is pretty obvious: She’s running a scripted and methodical (you might even say boring) campaign focused on fundraising and policy proposals. Her latest big idea is $315 billion of federal spending to raise the salaries of public-school teachers.
While Beto O’Rourke crisscrossed Iowa, holding 23 events in March and April, Harris, according to the Des Moines Register , held zero events there in March and just two during her recent April trip (in addition to her unannounced trip to the Mars Cafe): a town hall at the University of Iowa that drew more than 900 attendees and a small house party at a supporter’s home in Des Moines.
“Right now, that’s fine, but sooner or later, she’s going to have to put the time in there to win it,” Joe Trippi, the veteran Democratic campaign consultant, tells National Review . Caucus-goers want to see the candidates up close, not just at a big rally or on TV. “You’ve got to do the retail politics of the state.” Trippi, who worked with top Harris strategist Ace Smith on Jerry Brown’s 2010 California gubernatorial race, says that Harris has built an impressive fundraising operation and campaign team. Advertisement
There has been some talk in the press that Harris might not actually need to win any of the February 2020 contests and that she can rely on her delegate-rich home state of California, which moved up its primary to March 3, as a firewall. But history suggests that would be a foolish strategy; ask Rudy Giuliani and Marco Rubio how their “Florida firewall” held up in the 2008 and 2016 GOP primaries. Polling also casts doubt on that tactic: A Quinnipiac survey in April found Harris in third place, behind Biden and Sanders, respectively, in the Golden State. “To a lot of Californians, she is still a cipher,” Bill Whalen, of the California-based Hoover Institution, tells me. Whalen notes that Bernie Sanders has about 100,000 donors in California. Advertisement Advertisement
“I think they know they’ve got to win South Carolina,” Trippi says of the Harris campaign. “But I think they also know they’ve got to score before then — a third, or a second,” depending on who would come in ahead of Harris. The Democratic party awards delegates on a proportional basis, but the early states will still have their traditional effect of shaping the race. Would Barack Obama’s national coalition have come together in 2008 if he hadn’t won Iowa? “No way,” Trippi says. Advertisement
Political operatives and pundits have called Harris the “female Obama” since before she was first elected as California’s attorney general in 2010, a label that Harris has long dismissed in the way that a star college quarterback might dismiss comparisons to Tom Brady — just enough to provide a passing attempt at humility.
On the campaign trail, however, the comparison between Obama and Harris does indeed seem inapt. Obama was famous for his soaring and inspirational speeches. Harris seems to consciously reject “hope and change” rhetoric. On the stump, Obama boldly and vaguely declared, “We are the ones we’ve been waiting for.” The peroration of Harris’s stump speech is modest: “We are better than this.”
“For those of us who speak behind a microphone or behind a podium, there’s an incentive that we will make everyone feel lovely — sprinkle lovely dust all over the room, and everyone will applaud, and [the] job will have been done. Well, speaking truth doesn’t always accomplish that goal,” Harris told the crowd gathered at the Des Moines house party on April 11. Yet the plainspoken truths Harris then delivers don’t seem all that bold: the need for a $6,000 middle-class tax cut, for boosting the average teacher’s pay by $12,200, and for renewing the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Advertisement
Harris seems to assiduously avoid making unwanted headlines. The one exception during her trip to Iowa was her explanation of why she owns a handgun, and it was the only comment widely picked up by national press. “I own a gun for probably the reason that a lot of people do — for personal safety. I was a career prosecutor,” Harris told reporters after the party. A Harris-campaign spokesperson would not tell National Review whether her firearm is a semiautomatic, like most handguns. In a general election, Harris’s gun could reassure millions of fellow gun owners, but right now she is trying to win over progressive voters, some of whom would like to see all semiautomatic weapons banned.
Another fun-house-mirror effect of the Democratic primary is that her biggest vulnerability is the charge that she was an overzealous prosecutor. She supported a law that mandated jail time for parents of chronically truant children, and she faces allegations of working to uphold wrongful convictions. But in a general election, one of her biggest weaknesses would be the charge that she was too soft on crime.
As San Francisco district attorney, Harris declined to seek the death penalty for a man who had murdered police officer Isaac Espinoza with an AK-47 in 2004. At Espinoza’s funeral, Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein called on Harris to seek the death penalty and received a standing ovation from police officers in attendance. “This is not only the definition of tragedy, it’s the special circumstance called for by the death-penalty law,” Feinstein said. California enacted a law in 1977 allowing the death penalty only in special circumstances, including when a police officer is murdered. In early April of this year, Espinoza’s widow spoke on camera for the first time. “She did not call me,” Renata Espinoza said of Harris in a tearful interview with CNN. “I felt like she had just taken something from us. She had just taken justice from us.” "

McCarthy on Twitter April 18, 2019 11:43 AM Attorney General William Barr, flanked by Edward O’Callaghan and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, at a news conference to discuss Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, in Washington, D.C., April 18, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Understanding the disagreement between Barr and Mueller
T he most interesting new disclosure to come out of Attorney General William Barr’s press conference on the Mueller report was about obstruction of justice.
As I pointed out in a Fox News column this morning, the obstruction issue was one of the main reasons why the media-Democrat complex’s caterwauling about Barr’s unremarkable decision to hold a press conference was ludicrous. Special Counsel Mueller declined to render a prosecutorial judgment on whether obstruction charges should be brought against the president. Since it is the attorney general who made the judgment, for that reason alone it was worth hearing from him this morning. Advertisement Advertisement
The attorney general stated that the special counsel evaluated ten incidents with an eye toward whether they amounted to an obstruction offense. Barr elaborated that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein disagreed with Mueller on whether these incidents even could have amounted to obstruction as a matter of law.
It is important to grasp what that means, and what it doesn’t, because I’ve heard some inaccurate commentary. Barr was not saying that Mueller found one or more of these incidents to constitute obstruction; Mueller was saying that the incidents involved actions that could theoretically have amounted to obstruction.
A concrete example may make this easier to grasp: the firing of FBI director James Comey. Before a prosecutor considered evidence regarding that incident, there would be a preliminary question: Could the president’s dismissal of an FBI director amount to an obstruction offense as a matter of law? If prosecutors were to decide that, even if the evidence showed corrupt intent on the part of the president, a president’s firing of the FBI director cannot constitutionally amount to an obstruction crime, then the prosecutors would not bother to investigate and make an assessment of the evidence. Advertisement Advertisement
What Barr is saying is that he and Mueller did not agree, with respect to all ten incidents, on whether the incident could legally amount to obstruction. What the attorney general therefore did was assume, for argument’s sake, that Mueller was correct on the law (i.e., that the incident could theoretically amount to obstruction), and then move on to the second phase of the analysis: Assuming this could be an obstruction offense as a matter of law, could we prove obstruction as a matter of fact ? This requires an assessment of whether the evidence of each element of an obstruction offense – most significantly, corrupt intent – could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
That is why Barr laid out the facts that the president could have shut down the investigation but did not; that he could have asserted executive privilege to withhold information from the investigation, but instead made numerous witnesses and well over a million documents available to the special counsel; and that – reportedly according to Mueller – the president sincerely felt frustrated that the investigation was unfairly undermining his presidency. The point is that these facts so cut against the idea of corruptly impeding an investigation that it is inconceivable the prosecutor could prove an obstruction case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Eighties: A Sequel | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Peter Tonguette,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/the-eighties-a-sequel/,"April 18, 2019 11:36 AM Henry Thomas in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Universal Studios) To judge by recent pop culture, we miss the decade
W hy would you want to purchase a book with a ragged dust jacket and stained pages? More to the point, why would a publisher release a book in which those defects were not the result of use but built into the product?
If you don’t know the answer to those questions, you are unlikely to be an adherent of the current craze for pop culture produced in the 1980s. The book in question, published last fall by the Random House imprint Del Rey Books, is an utterly remarkable object: Stranger Things: Worlds Turned Upside Down bills itself as the authoritative guide to the almost universally well-liked Netflix series depicting assorted supernatural phenomena in 1980s-era suburbia. Advertisement Advertisement
The book, though, comes close to matching the series for nostalgia value. The publisher must have recognized that it was not enough for the book merely to be about a series set in the ’80s — it had to somehow be of the ’80s. The inside design is spot-on — the chunky, wide typefaces used for headings are instantly identifiable as dating from the decade in question — but even more on point is the intentional wear and tear. The dust jacket — torn on the spine and at the edges — is itself encased in a transparent jacket cover, a touch evocative of a public-library tag sale from, say, 1987. Stamped on the cover is an orange sticker from “Melvald’s General Store,” on which this presumably secondhand book’s condition is identified: “FAIR.” For those who aren’t in on the joke, the publisher helpfully provides a disclaimer. “Don’t freak!” the message reads. “This book is supposed to look worn and torn.”
That says it all, doesn’t it? Stranger Things: Worlds Turned Upside Down may represent the ne plus ultra of ’80s nostalgia, but it is one of countless pop-culture products that seek to replicate the stuff we read, watched, and listened to in the ninth decade of the 20th century. Tapping into the same audience that helped resurrect vinyl records, Mill Creek Entertainment’s “Retro VHS” Blu-ray line — including the Chuck Norris thriller Silent Rage (1982) and the John Candy comedy Who’s Harry Crumb? (1989) — presents Blu-ray discs packaged to suggest beat-up VHS boxes. Blockbuster Video may be dead, but its spirit lives on. Advertisement
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks contemptuously of the politics of Ronald Reagan, but, as was made clear in the video footage in which the future congresswoman danced in the style of the cast of 1985’s The Breakfast Club , even she is not immune to the charms of the ’80s. You don’t have to be a Young Republican to be a fan of the entertainment choices available during the Gipper’s presidency. How else to explain the popularity of not just Stranger Things but also the 2017 film version of Stephen King’s It (which, like Stranger Things , meticulously recreated an ’80s-era neighborhood) or Nintendo’s NES Classic Edition? It is a fair bet that many of Ocasio-Cortez’s constituents, like the rest of America, eagerly await Jason Reitman’s sequel to Ghostbusters , which promises not to break in tone or spirit with the original version from 1984. And I wonder: Would Lori Loughlin’s indictment in the still-unfolding college-cheating scandal make such headlines if the actress had not been a staple on the ultimate lame ’80s sitcom, Full House ?

Signs of the pending ’80s mania came as early as 2001 — a mere eleven years after the ’80s came to a close! — with the release of Richard Kelly’s stellar supernatural flick Donnie Darko , which, for reasons that could not be justified dramatically, was set in 1988. In the opening sequence, Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes to his bicycle to navigate his residential streets — shades of Elliott and company in Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) — while his mother curls up with a fat hardcover edition of (you guessed it) King’s It . During dinner, the Darko clan hashes out the looming presidential election; Donnie’s sister (Maggie Gyllenhaal) expresses her preference for Dukakis. Advertisement
The craze was confirmed in 2010, when the late writer-director John Hughes — who churned out such ’80s-era favorites as The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986) — was given a royal send-off at the Academy Awards. During a tribute unfolding over a staggering six and a half minutes, former teen stars including Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall tipped their hat to the man who catapulted them to fleeting celebrity. That Hughes was never honored with an Oscar nomination, let alone a win, was tactfully overlooked; all that mattered were the warm and fuzzy feelings his films conjured. Few could miss the fact that major historical revisionism was under way, as it continues to be. The 1987 Goldie Hawn farce Overboard was long considered a debacle of Ishtar -level proportions, but when the film was revived last year as a vehicle for Anna Faris, numerous outlets — including Variety , which should know better — described it as a “classic.” Perversely, the ineptitude of the new Overboard made the old Overboard look better.
Indeed, the current ’80s mania is on some level nothing more than a matter of aesthetics. Even those who did not live through the decade or do not have conscious memory of it can recognize the solid craftsmanship of Amy Heckerling’s Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) or Richard Donner’s The Goonies (1985), or the retro appeal of old-school book and VHS covers. Yet, if we go back to the mass entertainment that prompts our present feelings of nostalgia, a more complicated picture emerges. Simply put: Many movies and TV shows made during that decade ought to be celebrated — not for their elements of rad design but for their surprising wholesomeness. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Gone were the soul-searching sensitivity of James Dean in Rebel without a Cause (1955) and the aimless intensity of Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider (1969). Instead, the ’80s gave us a new sort of screen hero: well-adjusted teenagers who, snug and secure in their well-appointed homes, seemed to embody the energy and enthusiasm of Reagan’s “morning in America.” Think of Tom Cruise’s entrepreneur-in-training in Risky Business (1983) or Corey Haim’s automobile-obsessed youth in License to Drive (1988). Meanwhile, in the Back to the Future series and on the sitcom Family Ties , Michael J. Fox proved that by-the-books ordinariness could be popular with audiences, too.
In fact, rare was the ’80s teen comedy in which the traditional family unit was presented as anything but a positive, or at least benign, force. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off features the hero (Matthew Broderick) evading all forms of authority, but he has no particular animus toward his elders; after all, the elaborate sound-effects system through which he fools his father is installed in his bedroom in his parents’ home! And, in the surprisingly sharp and funny License to Drive , Corey Haim flouts all the rules in his pursuit of wheels, but he is situated firmly within the constellation of a family, including his assertive but tolerant dad (Richard Masur), his daffy, pregnant mom (Carol Kane), and a pair of harmless siblings. This is a family in harmony, more or less. Even when Dad is a Wally World–obsessed fool, like Chevy Chase in the Vacation string of comedies, the family most often ends up where they started: together. Advertisement
Significantly, a family lacking in two parents was usually seen as a deficit in the cinema of the ’80s. For example, E.T. — a far richer film than anything by John Hughes, let alone License to Drive — touchingly depicts the unavoidable struggles of single motherhood. After her husband has flown the coop, Mary (Dee Wallace) is left to rear her three children, Elliott (Henry Thomas), Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Alas, Mary’s grip on her kids’ comings and goings is so tenuous that she is the last to know of the presence of a space alien in her home. Released two years after E.T. , Michael Apted’s Firstborn goes a step further in chronicling the hazards a single mother (Teri Garr) exposes her brood to when she tests the dating waters with a no-good guy (Peter Weller). Advertisement
That is not to suggest that the decade was all sanctimony or devoid of wit. In Gremlins (1984) and The ’Burbs (1989), director Joe Dante had fun upending our ideas about small towns and cul-de-sacs; the former film remains forever distinguished by the extraordinary monologue in which Phoebe Cates recounts the circumstances of the death of her father, who, while donning a Santa Claus costume one Christmas, accidentally lodged himself in the chimney. Hearth and home were sent up in George Roy Hill’s Funny Farm (1988), but — guess what? — the urbanites at the center of the film (Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith) ended up staying in Redbud after all.
By the same token, Tobe Hooper’s Poltergeist (1982) has been said to revolve around suburban sprawl — after all, the family in the film has the misfortune of having their house built on what was once an Indian graveyard — but, in the end, the film makes no challenge to the bonds of family. In the final scene, when dad Craig T. Nelson deposits his family in a Holiday Inn and tosses out the television set, he is striking a blow for strong, decisive fathers everywhere. Traditional movie tough guys were fading from the screen — Steve McQueen almost bridged the gap in his last film, The Hunter (1980), playing a flinty, competent bounty hunter who reluctantly partakes in his pregnant girlfriend’s Lamaze exercises — but there were still allowances made for such male authority figures as Sam Elliott in Mask (1985) or Sean Connery (as Indiana Jones’s old-school, disciplinarian dad) in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)."
'Big Business' Book Review: In Defense of Corporations | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/big-business-tyler-cowens-compelling-case-for-large-corporations/,"About Kevin D. Williamson April 18, 2019 10:31 AM Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos laughs during the grand opening at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle, Wash., January 29, 2018. (Lindsey Wasson/Reuters) Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero , by Tyler Cowen (St. Martin’s Press, 272 pp., $28.99)
P rofessor Tyler Cowen of George Mason University and the Mercatus Center — and Marginal Revolution , and the New York Times , and much else — is consistently one of the most interesting and original thinkers on human affairs that our public discourse has to offer. He is an economist, but an economist who understands economics in the very broad sense of praxeology — “human action,” as Ludwig von Mises put it. And so you can read Cowen on street food in Singapore; the “market underpricing of autistic labor”; art collecting (his review of Doug Woodham’s Art Collecting Today contains this quibble: the author “should have done much more to explain how art is used for money laundering, and also tax arbitrage through donations at inflated prices, based on corrupt appraisals”); and, from time to time, on more straightforwardly economic questions as such. Advertisement
Professor Cowen has a reputation as a contrarian, but that is not exactly right. He has a great talent for revealing truths that are right under our noses but oddly overlooked — or willfully obscured. His latest book, Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero , is an excellent, easily digestible exercise in exactly that. Why is it, he asks, that Big Business is not more widely admired and appreciated? Large-scale corporate enterprises provide a great many jobs; relative to smaller firms, they typically pay their workers more and treat them better, invest more in research and development, are more productive and more innovative, and conduct their business at least as ethically. He knocks down a series of myths about excessive executive compensation, “quarterly capitalism” obsessed with short-term profits, monopolistic temptations, and the purportedly outsize role of finance in our economy.
On the last of those, Professor Cowen offers one of his extraordinarily useful, obvious-if-you-think-about-it insights: The argument that finance has grown too large as a share of U.S. economic activity is based in part on the fact that in the 1960s finance accounted for about 4 percent of GDP whereas it recently has been above 8 percent. That’s the wrong comparison, he argues: Finance is engaged in the business of managing wealth, not in the business of managing current income flows exclusively; it makes more sense, then, to examine the share of assets that the financial sector controls, which, as is turns out, has not changed very much over the years, floating around 2 percent. While other social critics have written great volumes about “financialization” — where it comes from, what it means, whether it is desirable — Professor Cowen first stops to ask whether the thing that everybody knows is happening is in fact happening.
Big Business is particularly useful at the intersections of these questions. For example, the belief that CEOs are paid too much is closely linked with the belief that corporations are excessively and unproductively oriented toward the short-term concern of quarterly reports and share prices. But the evidence does not support that conclusion. The reality is that firms undertaking aggressive and in the end unprofitable expansions into China were, like many investors in technology start-ups, suffering from excessively long-term thinking and
failed to be hardheaded enough about short-term limitations. Tesla in 2017 achieved a higher market value than either Ford or General Motors, even though there are no visible signs that the company is capable of selling electric cars at an affordable price for a profit. . . . You can see the same kind of price spikes with a lot of biotech stocks, often before they have brought their products to market.
From where I sit right now in 2018, I don’t know which of these high valuations are the mistakes, and that is part of the point — most critics don’t either. But for sure, in many of these cases the market is thinking too long-term and should be worried about the lack of revenue today. More generally, price-to-earnings ratios are historically high. . . . My point is that these currently high P/E ratios are directly inconsistent with the charge of excess short-termism. In essence the price has been high because the market is expecting high forthcoming earnings, not because earnings are high enough today to justify those valuations.
He goes on to consider the case of Amazon and Jeff Bezos, who has become the wealthiest man in the world while famously forgoing short-term profitability goals in favor of reinvesting revenue in the company and its remarkably ambitious long-term strategy. He notes that in 2015, the average Fortune 500 CEO had been in his job for eleven years, the longest average tenure in more than a decade. And CEO compensation increasingly is performance-based, with pay structures that reward the achievement of long-term goals: Very few billion-dollar fortunes are built on salaries and quarterly bonuses Advertisement
Professor Cowen has a great gift for simplification. His subject here includes complex and nuanced questions of economics and business organization, but his presentation of them is perfectly lucid. In an introductory note to his famous Brief History of Time , Stephen Hawking relayed his publisher’s observation that every equation in the book would cost him half his readers. Professor Cowen here spares the reader equations and most economic and financial jargon: If you can read the Wall Street Journal , nothing in this book will prove esoteric. Advertisement Advertisement
The book does have a slightly catalogue-ish feel to it, as though Professor Cowen has been (as I suspect) keeping a list of college students’ most common complaints about Big Business (and about capitalism generally) and addressing them in series: “Are the Big Tech Companies Evil?” “What Is Wall Street Good for, Anyway?” “How Monopolistic Is American Big Business?” Etc. It goes: Here you go. Next? Here you go. Next? Not boom . There is nothing of the cable-news/social-media mode of discourse here, and there is no temptation to write “Tyler Cowen DESTROYS!” . . . this or that argument. If it seems like the book does not build to a dramatic conclusion, that is because the case is pretty clear from the beginning.
In fact, Professor Cowen’s approach to these questions as a matter of argumentation is, while neither fussy nor even formal, pleasantly anachronistic. Another way of putting that is to say that he is unusually evenhanded and intellectually honest. Of course, there is plenty of evidence that runs contrary to his theme: Big businesses and their executives sometimes do awful things. (But are they more unethical than the rest of us ? Cowen asks.) He is forthright on the issue of crony capitalism, noting, for instance, oil companies’ tolerance (or encouragement) of corruption in badly governed African countries. He does not attempt to explain away real abuses but puts them in context: “On the whole, American corporations would rather invest in Canada than in Bhutan or Cameroon, and that is a more important reality than any stack of anecdotes.”
The book offers a good return on investment, even when its conclusions and sense of proportion seem not quite right. There are certain homogenizing effects of Big Business that are of immediate present concern, and Professor Cowen is a good deal more comfortable than I am with Silicon Valley’s emerging role as global arbiter of political speech (and other kinds of speech). He asks important questions about our relationship with our employers (“is work fun?”) but is more blasé than he might be about the cultural consequences of employment’s growing role as a locus of meaning, especially when the corporation is being programmatically transformed into an explicit instrument of political and social discipline. Perhaps these issues are not as easily treated with economic argument. Or perhaps Professor Cowen thinks better of general corporate culture than some less generous observers do. Consider his observations on monopoly power:
The American economy today does have some pretty notable superfirms. At the time of writing the list would include Google, Facebook, Amazon, Walmart, Apple, Exxon, the major auto companies, United Health, CVS, and AT&T, to name just a few. "
A Letter to My Irish Father | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Brendan Dougherty,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/a-letter-to-my-irish-father/,"For men improve with the years; And yet, and yet, Is this my dream, or the truth? O would that we had met When I had my burning youth! — “Men Improve with the Years,” W. B. Yeats
D ear Father,
We feel like we are getting to know this child already, the way she turns over or dances for us as the doctor shakes her awake to observe her on the ultrasound. We’re in for it, they tell us, about parenthood. We are getting tired of everyone warning us that the struggles of a new baby will leave us so tired. War metaphors abound. Other parents are “veterans” on their way back from the front lines. An adorable tiny rocking hammock is recast as “the essential weapon” to deploy. If it’s a battle to raise a child, we need reinforcements. Advertisement
I suppose we get reinforcement. Not only extended family and friends, but the larger culture raises and forms our children, whether you’d want it or not. A home is a refuge, but it still sits within something larger, a homeland or a culture. In your absence, my mother had given me familiarity with Ireland’s story and the high ideals of its national history. And then this larger culture around us began to deconstruct that story, and it nudged me along in efforts to deconstruct that national mythology as well. Deconstruction of this sort was just the thing to do.
A culture is a funny thing. Somehow it is this collective personality that is constantly feeding you information about itself. It ranks and re-ranks everything in life — people, objects, and ideas. It turns articles of clothing into symbols of high or low status. It suggests certain ideas and dismisses others. Its judgments become so familiar that it exists like a voice in your head. And yet it is impossible to explain exactly how this happens. Advertisement
A culture feeds you even the terms on which you would resist it. The culture that encouraged me to deconstruct the ideals and taboos of Ireland’s past because they have “an unhealthy hold upon the living” was the same culture that told me that by doing so, by doing what everyone else was doing, I was defining life on my own terms, and for myself. Advertisement
So what were our background cultures? Our boyhoods could not have been more different. You had five siblings and two parents at home. You grew up in a tight two-up, two-down in Donnycarney and the streets had hundreds of children in them. The schools that were built to handle this were called “industrial.” One of the most infamous of these, Artane, cast its shadow into your neighborhood. In summers you were sent to your grandparents in Monaghan, to avoid the training in criminality available just out your door. Fathers were deputized by God to rule their homes. The Catholic Church of your youth was a spiritual empire, sending Irish emissaries across the sea. It spoke Latin, threw incense generously, and ran the world as you knew it, because the unquenchable fire of hell burbled beneath everything. People you knew would be genuinely afraid of receiving Holy Communion unworthily.
The heroes of Ireland’s Easter Rising were still venerated as saints. When you were a child, Ireland’s president, a hero of that rebellion, laid a wreath at the jail where his comrades were condemned to death and killed. The life of the nation was serious business. The adult world throbbed with authority and frequently abused it. Maybe Ireland would be poor, but it would be sanctified and creative. This was what one of Ireland’s leading writers calls the myth of Holy Catholic Ireland, a myth that shaped your childhood. A myth that Ireland has spent the last three decades dismantling. The last artifacts of it are eagerly chucked away. Advertisement
That world was as distant from mine as medieval France is. I grew up an only child with a single mother. I lived in a series of American suburbs, each seemingly more prosperous than the next. There were dozens of kids in the neighborhoods, not hundreds, and nothing as exciting as criminality. The Church was a friendly ghost. Nobody feared approaching for Communion. God would be merciful, surely. If you were unusually curious and asked about the apparent change of attitude, you would be assured that many theologians thought hell was empty. Advertisement
When I was a child the nation’s president disclosed to us his preference in underwear for a laugh. The adult world that I encountered was plainly terrified of having authority over children and tried to exercise as little of it as practicable. At every turn my mother, my teachers, and the Church just sort of gave up and gave in to whatever I wanted. They seemed grateful when a child wasn’t difficult. The constant message of authority figures was that I should be true to myself. I should do what I loved, and I could love whatever I liked. I was the authority. In the benighted past somewhere, there was pain and misery, but Baby Boomers had largely corrected this for us in their titanic generational battles. This I would call the myth of liberation. I was raised on this mythology, and it ordered the world around me. The future ought to be bright. This was the end of history, and wasn’t it good? Advertisement
A t the spiritual level, this myth of liberation — a liberation already accomplished — made my generation into powerless narcissists. We worshiped authenticity — being your true self — even as most of us accused ourselves, in our own hearts, of being frauds. Some of us fell into despair and chemical dependency. Others coped through dual membership in the cults of productivity and therapeutic self-care. A few turned to Internet father figures who told them that life is struggle, that it is defined by self-assertion and dominance. And some, tired of trying to find a motive for existence from within, turned to political radicalism. But all this wreckage was a decade or more away from me and my friends then. We had no idea what was coming. Depression? Economically, we were assured it was unlikely to ever come again. Personally? Well, there were new drugs for it. Advertisement Advertisement
And my mother was increasingly on those drugs. When my grandmother died, my mother lost her role as the dutiful daughter. And she could see that in a few years I would also fly from home. Where would it leave her? I experienced the 1990s as a coming into my own, as the world opening up for me. My mother experienced something else. Her life shrank. She didn’t travel as much. She tried to make arrangements to move us to London, where she had been so happy once. But she shelved them.
There was a great deal of talk at that time about the heroism of single mothers, but not all the taboos were pulled down. She had stuck it out with the baby, assured that the world would increasingly accept, and admire, her decision. In truth, it did so only provisionally. IBM would not and then could not fire her for being a single mother. But her form of life as mother, often overworked due to her circumstances, had none of the honor and understanding that is extended to widows, whom everyone feels obliged to help generously. This state of life was what she chose, after all. Or people would retain the suspicion that she must be at fault somehow, that she had failed to keep the man for a reason. Her form of being single was impaired by motherhood, having none of the real freedom and allure of those who were truly unattached. I would later discover that she had admirers and even lovers, but she could — or would — never make them into committed boyfriends or suitors. Advertisement
As depression set in, she gained weight and became more frequently ill. I heard people worry for her, saying that she was “letting herself go.” She was. She lived on the other side of the culture’s liberation, and her unhappiness in life was held to be her fault. The cliché about lying in the bed you have made for yourself became her reality. She had finally thrown away the old couch and pullout for a real, proper queen-sized bed. But now she slept in it constantly. It was as if the culture had slipped her its real judgment in secret, the cruel truth that was unspeakable in public. And she accepted that judgment and internalized it.
Late in high school I grew close to an English teacher, Mr. Scanlon. He was the most important in a long succession of substitute father figures. In the long run, I suppose, he was giving me a livelihood. He was also a man with Irish roots. Knowing my background, he began feeding my imagination with W. B. Yeats, the Pogues, and James Joyce. “Who goes with Fergus?” he asked as he bounded into a room. He played “Bottle of Smoke” while we edited the school’s literary magazine, and he filled my world with sad, colorful Dubliners .
In a way, the clatter of Irish music, the strangeness of the Irish sky, and a repository of Ireland’s national genius were all returned to me, not as an inheritance to be treasured and passed on, but as ornaments of a life defined by enjoyment, consumption. And this curator’s approach seemed to let me enjoy them safely. That little bit of ironic distance prevented these things from really touching the parts of my soul and mind that were vulnerable to developing a deep conviction.
You say your father prayed five decades of the rosary with the family each day. At night, your four sisters would file into one bedroom. You and your brother would come in to sleep in the same room with your parents. Your father would climb into bed and pray five decades of the rosary again with your mother. Years later, in the old-folks’ home, when nurses and orderlies offended his sense of modesty, he would rage and struggle in his dementia. But these angels attending him learned to just shout the beginning of a prayer. Instantly, the rage subsided, as he started his stiff, ceremonious sign of the cross and joined them in prayer. For you and the usual audiences for the story, the image is funny. For me, it has become something else. In a world where everything is plastic, everything is unserious, this adamantine stubbornness feels like a shelter. Advertisement
Yet you remain heathen. Even with all the aid of cruel, holy Ireland and a father willing to drill you in The Penny Catechism , which discloses the purpose of life and the mysteries of religion in precisely 740 English sentences: “Who made you?” “God made me.”
I n college, the 1916 Easter Rising came back to me as well, in history classes where I was advantaged by childhood familiarity with the rebels’ names, their views, and their deeds. The hardline historical revisionists had the courage to take those rebels seriously, alternately detesting and pitying their subjects. But as time went on, with a little distance from the Troubles, with the Celtic Tiger in full swing, the rebels’ views became somehow muted and less threatening, and before long no one even offered them the dignity of hating them. Instead of being celebrated or reviled, the rebels were given back to me as trivia and kitsch. James Connolly had died convinced that the causes of Ireland and labor were intertwined, but modern and free Ireland was lately hailed as a capitalist miracle. Patrick Pearse had believed that Ireland could win a place among sovereign and free nations by reclaiming the creative energy still existing in its Irish-speaking culture, but the great power in Irish culture today is English and American media, and the nation’s lifeblood is found in the creative way America’s tech giants wring continental profits through Irish tax loopholes. Aspiration after aspiration had proven idealistic and naïve, so we hung the idealists’ faces on the walls of the local pub as decoration and made them watch Irish America’s version of Erin Go Puke every Paddy’s Day. Having them around was like an inside joke about how irrelevant they were.
Your generation makes a different kind of joke about the Rising. I’ve seen it when you’re in St. Sylvester’s Gaelic Athletic Association club. Maybe a man with a Kerry accent toasts a local singer for his rebel song and his Sinn Féin politics. You put on your thickest Dublin accent, asking, “And where were youse when we was doing all the fighting?” As if you yourself, as a Dub, inherit the reputation of having fought in the Rising and all these culchies inherit the guilt of having sat out Ireland’s great hour. When you joke like this, the humor is a backward way of paying tribute to the real thing. The self-deprecation inherent in it is like an act of humility, even gratitude.
What I mean by the Rising becoming kitsch for me is that in my generation, our joke would be to say anything is serious at all. The idea that events and ideals have real meaning, that something outside of ourselves deserves our loyalty, is what’s ridiculed. We think this aloofness makes us look unflappable, that it even grants us a certain austere dignity. But it really just makes us satisfied with remaining shallow. We call the higher ideals a form of narrowness, and shrink away from them. Keep an open mind, play the options in front of you. Be smart. Aloof is the safe bet.
But aloofness misleads us. This ironic distance is insufficient when we are really tested. I notice that Sir Roger Casement is now one of the few leaders of the Rising whom Ireland can praise without equivocation. Born in Ireland, he went into British-imperial service. He became something like the first modern human-rights activist, after documenting the abuses of Belgium in the Congo. Gradually he embraced the Irish national cause. Caught off the coast of Kerry trying to deliver weapons from Germany ahead of the Rising, he was tried for treason. Britain exposed his “black diaries,” which detailed his sexual preoccupation with young men. And now, I read many articles about how he foreshadowed this more inclusive Ireland. In a recent biography, the author tried to cast him as fully modern in his sensibilities. And at some times in his life, he did take the modern view of things, including religion. He wrote to a friend, “There can be no heaven if we don’t find it and make it here and I won’t barter this sphere of duty for a hundred spheres and praying wheels elsewhere.” And yet that sense of duty eventually carried him beyond what was safe and modern.
In his prison cell, awaiting certain death, he decided he would convert to Catholicism. The archbishop demanded that he recant his Irish nationalism. He refused. But the priests attending him said that he died “with all the faith and piety of an Irish peasant woman.”
He wrote a letter explaining himself.
Ireland alone went forth to assail evil, as David Goliath, unarmed, save with a pebble, and she has slain, I pray to God, the power and boast and pride of Empire. That is the achievement of the boys of 1916, and on it the living shall build a sterner purpose, and bring it to a greater end. If I die tomorrow bury me in Ireland, and I shall die in the Catholic Faith, for I accept it fully now. It tells me what my heart sought long in vain — in Protestant coldness I could not find it — but I saw it in the faces of the Irish. Now I know what it was I loved in them — the chivalry of Christ speaking through human eyes — it is from that source the lovable things come, for Christ was the first Knight. And now my beloved ones goodbye — this is my last letter from the condemned cell. I write it always with hope — hope that God will be with me to the end and that all my faults and failures and errors will be blotted out of the Divine Knight — the Divine Nationalist.
These Irish men and women of the Rising and the struggle against England in the years afterward were modern people, which is to say that they were people who could be easily labeled and analyzed by professional historians and our intellectual caste. Their social position could be vivisected: They were a typical revolutionary generation, a rising class of educated people who would be excluded from normal positions of power absent a major shake-up. Their writings and thoughts can be easily tagged — Victorian Gaels, 19th-century nationalists, progressive educationists — and then filed away. And yet they had done something that modern people should no longer be able to do in a world of trench warfare, gas attacks, and mass-mechanized death. They became legends. They lived on this edge of life, where aloofness was burned away until some greater conviction emerged.
I n quieter moments you have said that you wished you could believe, you just don’t. And I know nothing I write or say can change that. Just as the archbishop could not make Roger Casement repent of Ireland’s cause. You insist that before the Tiger, Ireland was a dark place. Who, looking at it honestly, can fail to see its faults? Some of its peculiar defects did leave a residue here in America. It could be coldly intellectual. It could become the vindictive enforcer of a Victorian morality that made no sense in Ireland. Even now I find the speed at which Irish rosary sodalities move through their prayers totally alien and alienating. Worst of all, the Church in Ireland abetted child abuse and hid this crime through moral cronyism, elaborately disguised as a fear of scandal.
But the idea that there is nothing for Ireland to do with 15 centuries of Christianity but celebrate its destruction seems uncreative somehow. If a man like Casement could see something in it, surely there is something you might. The idea that there is nothing “useful” in the Rising for modern Ireland also seems like blindness. There is a Patrick Kavanagh poem about Irish religion that haunts me. Often titled “Pilgrims,” it found no publisher in his life. It recounts the way Irish people went to a holy well, seeking life, knowledge, and vision, but all related to the immediate necessities of life. “Life that for a farmer is land enough to keep two horses,” or “knowledge that is in knowing what fair to sell the cattle in.” But these very practical petitions are answered with something greater.
I saw them kneeling, climbing and prostrate —
It was love, love, love they found:
Love that is Christ green walking from the summer headlands
To His scarecrow cross in the turnip-ground.
When I was a young man, I was not pushed anywhere near the edge. Unlike Casement I had nothing like the pride and boast of Empire to confront in life. I had no needs so earthy as those in Kavanagh’s poem. But I did choose to confront you. I needed to send you my petitions. Advertisement
On a Saturday afternoon, I went to the library of my college and ended a decade of silent treatment, of having ignored your letters. I wrote you a long one, trying to condense my teenage years into a dozen or so pages. I was proud to give my report: I was at a good school. I had learned to fend for myself as my grandmother aged. I could cook. I still watched after my mother. I had had one serious girlfriend when I was in high school, and I had another serious girlfriend now that I was in college. After some journeying, I had come back to Catholicism. At the same time, I tried to demonstrate to you that I was arch, witty, and smart. I was no sucker or raving lunatic. I wasn’t sentimental or self-deluded. All in all, I was a young man to be reckoned with.
I would cringe to reread it now. All the above amounted to a series of not-so-subtle digs about how different I was from you. This is who I am , I seemed to say — and the heavy implication was that you had nothing to do with it. And you ought to get to know me; maybe I’m worth knowing.
But was I worth knowing? I doubt it. Not only was I painfully insecure, I was shallow. Someone who approaches life like a curator will exchange his faith for merely believing in belief. He’ll substitute taste where conviction belongs. I was merely gliding on the surface of life.
Still, you treated this little gesture as if it could be the basis for going forward. It wasn’t long afterward that you and I arranged to meet up in New York. You would bring your wife and your other children, my half siblings whom I’d met only in pictures you sent me. I’d bring that girlfriend, the woman who is now my very pregnant wife.

Bill Barr said the Mueller report will be lightly redacted, that the president made no claim of executive privilege, that Congress will see an unredacted version of the report (except for grand jury material), and that he has no problem with Mueller testifying before Congress. Yet the press is outraged that he’s supposedly covering for Trump. Incredible…"

But, it is better thought of as the word A bachelor mulls as he writes through the night And which enables him, some thought occurred, To set it down in prose both broad and tight.

Socialism's Rise & Fall: 'Heaven on Earth' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Paul Hollander,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/socialisms-rise-and-fall-heaven-on-earth-book-review/,"About Paul Hollander April 18, 2019 11:10 AM Britain’s Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers his keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool, Britain, September 26, 2018. (Phil Noble/Reuters) Heaven on Earth: The Rise, Fall, and Afterlife of Socialism , by Joshua Muravchik (Encounter Books 424 pp., $18.99)
T he volume here reviewed is the second edition of a book first published in 2002. I reviewed it favorably (with some reservations) in 2003. A good case can be made for the new edition, given the survival of socialist ideals and the persisting disagreements about their nature and realizability. It remains of interest why people in different parts of the world are still attracted to these ideals and why the same ideals have been so difficult to implement. Of special interest is what Joshua Muravchik calls the “afterlife” of socialism — what happened to these ideals and political aspirations after the political systems supposedly dedicated to their realization, such as the Soviet Union, ceased to exist. Advertisement Advertisement
As the reader is informed in the preface, the new edition is largely unchanged, except for the addition of an epilogue, some updating of the chapter on the kibbutzim (collective farms of modern Israel), and the correction of small errors.
The difficulty of coming to grips with the subject — that is, the proper understanding of the nature of socialist ideals and their realizability — has not diminished since the book was first published. The problem begins with the widely held, undifferentiated views of socialism shared by most Americans. They are unaware of the fundamental differences between authoritarian (or totalitarian) state socialism embedded in one-party systems, such as the former Soviet one or the Chinese one under Mao, and social-democratic societies, such as those in Scandinavia. The latter are politically liberal and pluralistic and seek to reduce economic inequalities through high taxes and a range of social services. It is this ignorance of the deep moral and institutional gulf between these two very different political systems that allowed President Trump to hold forth about the horrors of socialism without specifying whether he had in mind the Soviet Gulag or child care in Sweden. By the same token, it is also incumbent on the new, young Democratic representatives in Congress who sing the praises of socialism to make clear that they are aware of the morally decisive differences between democratic socialism and the repressive one-party states calling themselves “socialist.” Advertisement
Since one-party-state socialist systems largely succeeded in usurping the “socialist” designation, it might have been wiser in this new edition to either completely eliminate or greatly reduce the discussion of British social democracy (i.e., the chapters on Atlee and Blair). On the other hand, if it was the author’s intention to present different approaches toward the realization of socialist ideals, the durable democratic socialism of the Scandinavian countries should have been included. Advertisement
Important conceptual distinctions are further obscured when under the same heading (“Triumphs”) we find chapters on Lenin’s seizure of power, Mussolini’s “socialism,” British social democracy under Atlee, and Nyerere’s African socialism. It is also unclear why a chapter on conflicts within the American trade-union movement was put in the part entitled “Collapse,” along with chapters on Deng and Gorbachev, Tony Blair, and the kibbutz. Advertisement
The volume might have been made more coherent by clearly separating the discussion of socialist ideals from the historical attempts to realize them, whether in small utopian communities, social-democratic countries, or authoritarian one-party states.
Apart from these structural-organizational problems, the book remains an informative introduction to the attempts to create socialist systems or communities variously conceived. Especially interesting is the chapter on the kibbutz, a unique experiment in creating, without coercion, utopian communities that had an authentic socialist — that is to say, egalitarian — inspiration. Advertisement
It is the attempted updating by means of the epilogue that is the least satisfactory. The “afterlife” of socialism, its continued appeal and divergent interpretations, and the unforeseen consequences of its attempted realization, cannot be adequately dealt with in a brief epilogue. There have been developments in this century that deserve attention and that this epilogue did not, and could not, address. They include the political disposition and influence of some prominent Western intellectuals — Alain Badiou, Noam Chomsky, Stephen F. Cohen, Angela Davis, José Saramago, and Slavoj Zizek, among others — who still cling to certain socialist ideals or seek to revive them. The afterlife of socialism cannot be reduced to the toxic disposition of Jeremy Corbyn of Britain or the more benign concerns and misconceptions of our Bernie Sanders — two figures (and their supporters) who dominate the epilogue. A particularly important phenomenon overlooked is the alienation of left-leaning young people in affluent, pluralistic Western societies and similar sentiments among the new right-wing populists. The former know little about the repression, regimentation, and scarcities that prevailed in the state-socialist systems. This ignorance makes it easier to harbor illusions about the sense of community attributed even to the remaining authoritarian socialist societies. Many of these young people are anti-capitalist because they associate capitalism with selfishness, impersonality, and lack of community more than with social injustices. Advertisement
Arguably, it is the “afterlife” that brought us right-wing populism, especially among the white working classes and older people similarly concerned with loss of community, weak social bonds, and meaninglessness. It seems to me that the central, shared grievance of the “new New leftists” and the right-wing populists can be traced to modernity (in its familiar capitalist incarnation): that is, to social isolation, secularization, and the loss of meaning. The populist nationalism and glorification of the past are pathways to a hoped-for restoration of community and stable moral values that modernity has undermined. "
"Game of Thrones, Season 8, Episode 1: Recap | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Rob Long,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-1-recap/,"April 18, 2019 11:40 AM Jon Snow (Kit Harington) in Game of Thrones (Helen Sloan/HBO)
This episode opened with echoes of the first episode of the first season — a small child running through the village as a royal procession makes its way to the castle in the North, in preparation for the final battle to come. It’s a satisfying and tension-filled parade, with (almost) all of the characters we’ve loved and hated over the past few years finally gathering together, in a kind of uneasy unity.
But for all of the pageantry and protestations of peace and common cause, it’s impossible to watch the episode without remembering that most of these characters will not make it to the series finale. Even those who manage to navigate the treacherous and deadly politics of the final six episodes will end up facing almost-certain death in the grand battle against the undead king.
It’s clear, for instance, in the first moments of this episode that the power and momentum is entirely with Bernie Sanders. He arrives in Winterfell a wiser and more battle-tested warrior and the obvious front-runner.
But is he too battle-worn? Given to outbursts and paranoia, he seems like a figure from yesterday. For instance, he has essentially zero dragons, while his chief rival, Kamala Harris, has two of them. One of Harris’s dragons is her law-and-order credentials, the result of her earlier career as a public prosecutor. The other dragon is her quirky and intriguing ethnicity — not exactly Westeros, not exactly Dothraki — that contrasts well with the tired and sagging Bernie Sanders. She seems sleek and poised, he seems like a guy who can’t eat a sandwich without inadvertently spitting most of it on his lunch partner’s shirt.
Now that the High Sparrow is dead and the period of fundamentalist religious revival is gone, audiences are more willing to see Mayor Pete, the Unpronounceable, as a potential winner of the Game. He has some terrific moments in the first episode, though longtime Game of Thrones watchers know that this is often a setup — the producers like to take an early audience favorite and kill him or her off in spectacular fashion. Be forewarned: Don’t fall in love with this guy.
Cory Booker, who fell on his head in childhood, sits quietly for most of the episode, staring out into the middle distance, seeing the future but unable to clarify in any useful way what, exactly, he’s talking about. Booker is a long shot to win the Game of Thrones — mostly because of his head injury — and it’s clear that the people of Winterfell have a hard time taking him seriously.
Unlike Maester Elizabeth Warren, whom they take too seriously. In this early episode, at least, she’s left in the library, writing tracts and treatises that no one will read. In one pivotal and revealing scene, she looks up from her writing to discover that she’s not alone. Next to her are Eric Swalwell and Tim Ryan. “Aren’t you guys supposed to be with the third-tier candidates?” She asks. “We are,” they say. It’s a powerful moment when Maester Warren realizes that she’s a third-tier candidate. The camera lingers on her, and we see her spirit and enthusiasm slowly drain from her face.
Spoiler alert! The camera pans over two lifeless bodies as two other unidentified characters dig their graves. If you pause the image, it looks a lot like John Hickenlooper and Kirsten Gillibrand are the bodies and Tulsi Gabbard and Jay Inslee are the gravediggers, though on subsequent viewings it seems possibly the other way around. And that’s what’s so great about Game of Thrones — so many layers of meaning!
Joe Biden, First of His Name to Go to College (Unconfirmed), wanders aimlessly through this episode, mumbling apologies and offering back rubs. He has aged a great deal since Season 7, but in a few quick moments we see a glint of the familiar Joe — and it’s clear that the producers (and maybe Joe himself) are encouraging us to underestimate him, perhaps preparing us for his eventual victory."

• Bernie, soak thyself.
• Representative Ilhan Omar’s latest turn on the national stage came in a March speech to a meeting of CAIR, in which she referred to 9/11 as “some people did something” and said Muslims in America were subjected to bigotry as a result. Omar was minimizing one of the greatest attacks on American soil. She provoked outrage, most heatedly in New York, where the New York Post ran a cover juxtaposing her words with an image of the burning Twin Towers. Harsh, but fair. Then President Trump piled on, with a video tweet making the same point. Omar’s allies meanwhile branded criticism of her as incitement, since she has been getting death threats. Death threats should be prosecuted zealously, but criticisms are not death threats; the madly wicked are responsible for their own violence. Pols across the board could speak more carefully, and it can start with the member from Minnesota.
• Bernie Sanders reintroduced his Medicare for All bill, which keeps getting more expensive: Now it’s going to cover long-term care, too. As always, the pitch for socialized medicine is that in other countries it delivers better health outcomes at lower costs. It is a misleading comparison, since, among other things, it glosses over differences in lifestyle among countries. Besides, what Sanders is proposing is unprecedented: throwing scores of millions of people off private plans they mostly like (and another 20 million off Medicare Advantage) while slashing payment rates to medical providers. Americans should avoid this dangerous experiment for the sake of their health as well as their finances.
• The revelation that Sanders made millions from his post-2016 book Our Revolution brought a spirited defense from the candidate himself. “I wrote a best-selling book,” Sanders said proudly. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.” Well, if Marx had put it that way . . .
• Sarah Sanders declared that members of Congress may not be “smart enough” to examine President Trump’s tax returns. This is a silly defense of the president’s unreasonable refusal to release his tax returns for public examination. But there is a much better public defense: The law congressional Democrats are invoking is overbroad and dangerous. It essentially exempts the chairmen of key congressional committees from tax-privacy laws. It allows them to examine any taxpayer’s records merely on request. And while the law has rarely been used since its passage in 1924, its very public use against Trump sets a dangerous new precedent. Trump should release his taxes voluntarily. But he should challenge Congress’s power to demand his records at will — the better to protect all citizens from curious, snooping government eyes.
• The first major poll in Maine since the 2018 midterms has good news for Republican senator Susan Collins, who leads her potential Democratic challenger by more than 20 percentage points. The Pan Atlantic Research of Portland poll found that the current senator received 51 percent support compared with 29 percent for Sara Gideon, who is currently the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. You’ll recall that Collins was briefly a top target of Democrats after she gave Brett Kavanaugh the decisive vote to join the Supreme Court. At that time, the Kavanaugh controversy was supposed to cost Republicans nationally. It ended up helping red-state Senate candidates. It doesn’t seem to be hurting them in at least one blue state either.
• Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind., is rising in the polls in the presidential race. Much of his appeal is based on his combining qualities that are often opposed in our politics. He is a standard-issue liberal, but religious; gay, but from (a reliably Democratic city in) the heartland; a young veteran. It helps that he is well spoken and moderate in demeanor; it does not seem to hurt that South Bend is not noticeably better for his tenure. It looks like we are all going to have to learn to spell and say his name.
• Every major analysis of the tax law that Republicans enacted in late 2017 has found that it cuts tax bills for most Americans. Polls have just as consistently found that most Americans don’t think they’re getting a tax cut — and that many more of them think they got a tax increase than actually did. (Fewer than 10 percent saw a tax increase.) Blame liberal spin, aided by the media; but also blame the public’s skepticism about government. Conservative sentiments don’t always aid conservative politicians.
• After medical professionals warned that pain patients are having increasing difficulty getting effective treatment, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control both issued statements clarifying that they do not endorse “mandated or abrupt” reductions in opioid prescriptions for such patients. It’s an overdue move. Excess opioid prescriptions undoubtedly played a role in unleashing a social plague. But they are playing less and less of one — heroin and fentanyl account for a high and rising proportion of all overdoses — and policymakers have been slow to adjust. Senators Cory Gardner (R., Colo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) want to legislate new limits on prescriptions for acute pain. The adage about generals’ fighting the last war applies, it turns out, to the war on drugs.
• The fallout from the Supreme Court’s Janus decision guaranteeing public-union employees their First Amendment rights — eradicating compelled speech, which in turn eradicated compelled “agency fees” — is hurting the bottom line of Big Labor. The NEA, AFSCME, and SEIU all report a decline in fees as nonmembers have embraced their opt-out right. This reporting doesn’t include figures from the late-June decision, but the NEA’s latest annual report, which includes only two post- Janus months, shows a decline of 75,000 dues payers. Bloomberg reports that the rolls of SEIU and AFSCME declined by a combined 210,000. In areas where pro-liberty groups — such as the Freedom Foundation, which operates on the West Coast — are aggressively informing workers of their Janus rights, the declines have been sharp: The Oakland-based AFSCME Council 57 has lost over 12 percent from its rolls. The bosses, disregarding the Laffer Curve, have reacted by raising dues. All the more reason to opt out.
• Conservatives scored a big win in a little-watched Wisconsin supreme-court election the first week of April. The state’s justices are elected to ten-year terms, and in last year’s spring election the conservative lost by twelve percentage points to the liberal one. This year, conservatives again appeared doomed when business groups abandoned their candidate Brian Hagedorn, former governor Scott Walker’s counsel, after the local press and the Left labeled him an anti-gay bigot. The smear was based in part on Hagedorn’s role in founding a private Christian school that upholds the traditional Christian teachings that marriage is a union between one man and one woman and sex outside of marriage is wrong. But the attack backfired, and conservative activists propelled Hagedorn to a 50.25–to–49.75 percent upset victory. The win likely protects conservative gains made under Scott Walker’s tenure from liberal judicial activists for at least several more years and serves as a warning nationwide about the perils of smearing a candidate as a bigot for believing his faith’s two-millennia-old teaching about marriage.
• Two different airports have blocked Chick-fil-A from the premises. First, the city council of San Antonio banned the chain because, in the words of councilman Roberto Treviño, “everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport.” Then, two weeks later, a New York Democratic assemblyman, Sean Ryan, announced that the Buffalo airport food vendor was prohibiting Chick-fil-A from operating in its food court. Ryan was explicit about the reason, declaring in a statement that “the views of Chick-fil-A do not represent our state or the Western New York community.” This is a dramatic action — one that is both plainly unconstitutional (the government may not bar access to benefits based on the private religious or political views of the owner) and extremist. Chick-fil-A is being punished for its foundation’s donations to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, two Christian organizations that do great good for America’s youth and for the poor. The signal has been sent: Not even mainstream Christian organizations are safe from the far Left’s wrath.
• A measles outbreak among ultra-Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn caused Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare a public-health emergency. When new cases appear, public-health officials will check the vaccination records of those who could be infected and levy fines where appropriate. Nothing in ultra-Orthodoxy forbids vaccination; an editorial in a Hasidic newspaper branded resistance to it “Senseless! Heartless! Torah-less and Reckless.” But a minority in that community, as among New Age types in the Pacific Northwest, has fallen prey to a superstitious dread of the procedure. Airhead celebrities, including former centerfold Jenny McCarthy, have helped spread the nonsense in the broader culture. In 1806, Thomas Jefferson sent Edward Jenner, discoverer of the smallpox vaccine, a heartfelt tribute: “Mankind can never forget that you have lived.” Jefferson was too sanguine.
• “Water and fire shall rot / The marred foundations we forgot, / Of sanctuary and choir. / This is the death of water and fire.” So T. S. Eliot wrote during the Blitz. The fire that consumed the roof and spire of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was, it appears, the work of accident, not of the Luftwaffe, but the destruction was vast. Stones and timbers that witnessed reformation, revolution, occupation, every species of horror, heroism, and everyday life, fell in four hours. In the wake of this incineration, every man is a Parisian, and a Frenchman. But buildings can be rebuilt, treasures lost can be reimagined, if the spirit is willing. “The end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.”
• Last year Sir Roger Scruton, Britain’s most eminent public intellectual, who risked his life protecting academic freedom behind the Iron Curtain, was nearly sacked as an unpaid government adviser on architecture after left-wing journalists (the usual offense-archeologists) fueled a social-media frenzy against him. In April, the show trial was revived and Scruton was sacked. His supposedly bigoted comments, deemed “unacceptable” by the Tory party, were made during an interview with the deputy editor of the New Statesman, George Eaton. Eaton quoted Scruton selectively, isolating phrases such as “Soros empire,” “tribes of Muslims,” and “robots” (in reference to the Chinese; though, in fact, Scruton was referring to the authoritarianism of the Chinese Communist Party). Gratified, Eaton then posted a picture of himself on Instagram, swigging champagne, and added the smug caption, “The feeling you get when you get right-wing racist and homophobe Roger Scruton sacked as a government adviser.” After much criticism, Eaton apologized for his social-media conduct and removed the picture. He has not yet released the full transcript of the interview. As Niall Ferguson wrote in the Times of London, “the reputation destroyed last week was not Sir Roger Scruton’s but the New Statesman ’s.”
• The Times of London reports that five clinicians have resigned from the British National Health Service’s only gender clinic for children, citing unethical treatment. Over the past three years, at least 18 staff have reportedly quit the clinic for reasons of conscientious objection. The five former staff at the Gender Identity Development Service clinic had been responsible for determining which children were transgender and which should be prescribed hormone therapy. Clinicians complained that lobbyists — such as the transgender-child charity Mermaids UK — had been putting pressure on doctors to provide drugs and surgeries. The director of the Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford called the treatment “an unregulated live experiment on children.” Such practices are not, alas, unknown in the U.S. National Review has reported that the Office for Human Research Protections is starting a review of a five-year study on transgender children’s being given hormones and puberty blockers. A FOIA request has revealed that the age minimum of participants for cross-sex hormones was lowered from 13 to eight. Across the developed world, the transgender revolution is putting pressure on medical ethics.
• Julian Assange took a seven-year vacation in the Airbnb of Ecuador’s London embassy. A new government in Quito, tired of his presence, lifted his immunity, whereupon the Brits arrested him. The United States will now demand extradition. Assange and WikiLeaks have been bad actors from Day One — and specifically, when they were broadcasting life-imperiling military information during the Afghan War, and when they were feeding DNC documents to the media in 2016. In both instances they acted at the behest of their frequent bankroller, the Kremlin, which sought to hobble presumed future president Hillary Clinton or to sow division generally. The Justice Department has indicted Assange for computer fraud, wisely sidestepping his status as a “journalist” but inviting a fight over the statute of limitations. Shame on him, and on those many Republicans, from Trump on down, who applauded him when he seemed to be doing their work.
• When Benjamin Netanyahu called for a general election months ahead of its due date, many observers were sure that “Bibi” had taken a risk too far and would cease to be prime minister. Under Benny Gantz, a former chief of staff, the Left had reinvented itself as the Blue and White party, reassuringly centrist and from time to time ahead in the polls. It played into their hands when Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit let it be known that Netanyahu was likely to be indicted on three charges of doing illegal, or at least unethical, favors for friends. For his part, Netanyahu campaigned on a promise to incorporate into Israel the controversial Jewish settlements on the West Bank. His general policy on terrorists, Iranians, and the hostile Western media is to give as good as he gets, and then just a little more. Hence voters were happy to give him an unprecedented fifth term in office.
• At long last, the United States designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization. It has been a terrorist organization since its founding, and it has been active in Iraq. Iran is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers since the start of the War on Terror, and the IRGC has often been at the tip of Iran’s spear. As a practical matter, the designation makes it easier to prosecute individuals or corporations who do business with Iran. As a symbolic matter, it declares U.S. resolve to deal with the Iranian threat. Combined with the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal, the terrorist designation of the IRGC sends a clear and necessary message to Tehran.
• Since 2002, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has risen from being the mayor of Istanbul to being prime minister of Turkey and then its president, all the while a reconstituted Ottoman sultan in his own imagination. His Justice and Development party, the AKP in its Turkish acronym, wins elections by hook and especially by crook, so it was all the more mind-blowing that in recent local elections it lost Istanbul to the opposition. The winning Republican People’s party has so slim a majority that the AKP took the chance to demand recounts in selective districts, first of invalid ballots and then of the entire vote of the 14 or so million Istanbulis. Should they get their way, have the election canceled, and hold another that puts them in power, a Republican spokesman says that even crows will laugh.
• The Saudi government is doing what it does: arresting dissidents and torturing them. Lately, the government has concentrated on women: women who have been asking for simple rights, such as the right to move about on their own, without the permission or company of a male relative. Most recently, the government has rounded up at least ten people, two of whom are Saudi-U.S. dual nationals. The new prisoners are not “front-line activists,” as one report put it. Instead, they are merely known to support women’s rights, or to have ties to those already imprisoned. One of the new prisoners is pregnant: Khadijah al-Harbi, a writer. Women have been held in solitary confinement, and some have reported being electrocuted, caned, sexually assaulted — the usual. The Saudi government may be a necessary ally of the United States, but we should be clear that our ally is a nasty piece of work.
• Omar al-Bashir, the president of Sudan since 1989, was deposed and detained in a military coup in April, after months of protests in the capital, Khartoum. Beginning in 2003, Bashir directed mass assaults on civilians in the Darfur region, the International Criminal Court alleged. Issued in 2009, the ICC’s warrant for his arrest on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity has yet to be honored. Spokesmen for the Sudanese army say that they won’t let Bashir be extradited to stand trial at The Hague, or anywhere, and that he’ll be tried in Sudan instead. To that end, the U.S. State Department should provide encouragement and expert legal counsel to Khartoum, with the specific aim of identifying witnesses and Sudanese jurists, many of whom are now in exile. It’s the best chance the world stands of bringing to justice the alleged war criminal on a massive scale.
• In 1997, the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to the Chinese Communist Party, which rules China. The CCP promised “one country, two systems.” In short, Hong Kong could remain free, while the rest of the country was Communist. That was always an unfunny joke. In 2014, democratic protests broke out, known as the Umbrella Movement. (Protesters used their umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray.) Participants have been tried and locked up. Most recently, nine leaders of the movement were convicted, and they now face seven years in prison. One of them, Professor Benny Tai, said, “This is a case about some Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong very much.” The CCP may love its power still more.
• “Why did pedophilia reach such proportions?” the former Pope Benedict XVI asked in a stunning intervention into the Catholic Church’s self-examination, published at the beginning of April. He answers his own question: “Ultimately, the reason is the absence of God.” The pope emeritus had promised to live a life of silent prayer. But the publication of his recent letter, one written to help the cardinals and bishops who gathered to discuss the abuse of minors in the Church, is the most clear and expressive message to date. He writes as a witness to the events in question. He traces the abuse crisis to a theological breakdown in the 1960s, in which the Church tried to revise its understanding of moral theology. Some theologians were so bold as to say that no action could be described as intrinsically evil. “What must be done?” the former pontiff asks, before mocking the pretensions of his opponents. “Perhaps we should create another Church for things to work out? Well, that experiment has already been undertaken and has already failed.” In some ways the question can be turned back on Benedict, who has created something new in the Church, an office for retired popes. His intervention is a reminder that Benedict has put the Church in an ironical and sad position: The ecclesiastical figure who exercises no authority in the governance of the Church still possesses the lion’s share of intellectual and moral authority among the hierarchs.
• For years, Cuban players joined Major League Baseball the hard way: by undertaking escapes, often dangerous, and putting themselves in the hands of smugglers (human traffickers). Wishing to prevent this, MLB struck a deal with the Cuban Baseball Federation. Under the terms of the deal, the federation would allow players to join MLB teams. A player would keep 100 percent of his signing bonus — but the team would have to pay the federation 25 percent of the bonus, on top of that. Also, the player would have to send back 4 percent of his earnings to Cuba, as income tax. MLB has similar arrangements with Japan, South Korea, and China. The Trump administration, however, has nixed the deal, saying that the Cuban Baseball Federation is an arm of the Cuban government — which it certainly is — and that the deal treated Cuban players like property of the Cuban state. (Needless to say, there are no independent entities in China, either.) We regard this as a close call, with the wishes of the players themselves probably getting low priority. The ultimate solution, of course, is the liberalization of Cuba, which our government should hasten in all ways possible and prudent.
• Last September, Tiger Woods won the Tour Championship, his first victory in five years. It was his 80th win, putting him two behind Sam Snead, the all-time leader in this category. Of Woods’s victory in the Tour Championship, we said, “Some experts are calling this the greatest comeback in the history of sports.” We continued, “Woods is now 42, and is unlikely to stop winning.” Woods has now won the first major since the Tour Championship: the Masters. It is his 15th victory in a major. (Jack Nicklaus is the leader in this category, with 18.) Woods had not won a major since the U.S. Open in 2008. The eleven years between ’08 and ’19 were a strange trip for him, involving moral, mental, and physical collapse. The comeback of Tiger Woods has thrilled people all over the world, and many of them have no interest in golf. They just know an inspiring story when they see one.
• James Lane Buckley, brother of our founder and onetime director of this entity, has served the nation as have few others — in all three branches of government. A former United States senator from New York, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and undersecretary of state for President Reagan, he somehow also managed to be president of Radio Free Europe. And Lieutenant Buckley, U.S. Navy, was in the thick of combat at Leyte, Okinawa, and other major Pacific battles. Several weeks back, seeming decades younger than his 96 years, this gentlest and happiest of warriors capped the National Review Institute Ideas Summit by addressing the assembled on his favorite theme, our country’s need for federalism. (An excerpt from his speech is below.) His remarks were smart, powerful marching orders deserving of heed. Before he gave them, Jim Buckley let it slip that the speech would be his final public appearance. It was fitting punctuation on the career of a great American, and it has been a singular honor for National Review to be alongside him for much of this journey. The Case for Federalism
Editor’s Note: The following is adapted from James L. Buckley’s speech at the National Review Institute Ideas Summit, March 29, 2019.
The Tenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights provides that “the powers not delegated to the United States by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” This allocation of powers mirrors those of the venerable Rule of Subsidiarity, which assigns responsibilities to the lowest levels capable of handling them. Its effect is to decentralize political power and ensure, wherever feasible, that the decisions that most directly affect people will be made by those who are the closest to them and most familiar with both their priorities and the relevant facts.
But with the advent of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, Congress began a wholesale assumption of the states’ responsibilities. This was done through a proliferation of programs that offer states and their subdivisions regulation-ridden grants of money for purposes that are acknowledged to be the sole responsibility of the states. The Supreme Court has ruled that the states may not be coerced into accepting the grants and their attendant regulations. Experience, however, has demonstrated that the states find it enormously difficult to decline them, whatever their conditions. Thus the practical effect of the Court’s decision has been to empower Congress to, yes, coerce the states into adopting Washington’s approach to matters that remain the states’ exclusive responsibility.
Federal grant programs have effectively nullified the Tenth Amendment, and, in the process, helped undermine Congress’s ability to function effectively. But what can be done about it? Four years ago, I had the temerity to write a book with the title “Saving Congress from Itself,” in which I detailed the extraordinary systemic and financial costs of those programs on both state and federal levels and proposed a simple reform that would restore federalism; namely, their conversion into block grants free of federal directives telling the states how the money was to be spent. It is a reform that, at one stroke, would reduce federal spending by major amounts in administrative costs alone, rid Congress of a significant distraction from its essential national responsibilities, and restore the people’s ability to control their own state and local affairs. Needless to say, Congress has yet to act on my advice.
I recognize, however, that we now live in novel times. The power to move political mountains is passing from printed books to the social media, or so I’m told. So there may be another way to force congressional attention. What I dream of is a tweet in which the president advises Congress that he will veto any bill that tells the states how to run their own affairs. Such a tweet would stir up a vigorous debate of the merits of my proposal and encourage its adoption. It might even remind our countrymen that our Constitution indeed places limits on what the federal government may engage in and that the enforcement of those limits might well be in their interest.
• “One of the best things about writing is that it’s private,” Charles Van Doren noted in The New Yorker in 2008. For 15 minutes in the late 1950s he’d been famous, as a telegenic, well-spoken young champion of the TV quiz-show circuit. The shows were rigged, though, and he lied at first when law enforcement and the media got wise to the game. Then he confessed and lost his teaching job at Columbia (where his father, Mark, was already a pillar of the English department), and NBC fired him from his lucrative gig. He never quite shook off the infamy. He went to work in publishing and wrote and edited for many years with some distinction, primarily for Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. Having made himself a high-profile villain in an age of relative innocence, when dissimulation in pursuit of ratings was considered not just tawdry but a shocking ethical scandal of national importance, he paid the price. The Greatest Generation held one another to some pretty high standards of honor and integrity. Dead at 93. R.I.P.
• Paul Hollander was born in Hungary in 1932. In 1944, his family (Jewish) went into hiding. Twelve-year-old Paul, anticipating his death, wondered what it was like to be shot. He discussed it with his father, who had been wounded in World War I. When the Soviets came in, Paul welcomed them as liberators and allied himself with Communism. As was true for many, that did not last long. He escaped to America, where he earned a Ph.D. in sociology at Princeton. He spent most of his career at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He also spent a good deal of time explaining Communism to sleepy people in free countries. He wrote many books, among them Political Pilgrims (1981), about the travels of Western intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba. He wrote for NR over the years, including a review for this issue. He was authoritative on anti-Americanism, political correctness, identity politics, etc. He had a clear, unflinching eye, and he taught a lot of us, mainly outside the classroom, through his writings. Paul Hollander has died at 86, having given of his rich experience — asked for or not — and exceptional intellect. R.I.P.
• After recovering from the shock of Pearl Harbor, most Americans never doubted that their country would defeat the Axis in World War II. Still, there were times in 1942, amid ship sinkings, the relentless Japanese advance in the Pacific, and American defeat in the Philippines, when that faith was hard to sustain. Those dark early days were brightened considerably when a group of 16 fearless Army Air Forces crews led by Colonel James Doolittle struck a blow at the very heart of the Japanese empire by taking off from the deck of the USS Hornet and flying 600 miles to bomb Tokyo. After the bombing, the pilots had to crash-land their planes in China and do their best to find a way to safety. Strategically, the raid had little significance, but for boosting morale, in the armed forces and among civilians, it was monumental. From the late 1940s to 2013, the brave men who had volunteered for this mission met every year in reunion, and now the last of them, Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Cole (Doolittle’s co-pilot), has died at age 103. R.I.P.
IMMIGRATION Irresponsibility at the Border
T he border crisis rumbles on. There were more than 100,000 apprehensions in March, higher than the 76,000 in February, which had been the highest monthly figure in more ten years. By some estimates, we could receive more than a million migrants in a year, and nearly 1 percent of the population of Guatemala and Honduras could come here.
It is true that apprehensions were higher in the 2000s, but the population was different then. It was overwhelmingly single men from Mexico who, if caught at the border, were simply returned home (perhaps to try to cross again). Now, the majority of migrants are minors or family units from Central America who under our perverse immigration rules can’t be easily sent back.
President Trump is understandably enraged by the situation, but is lashing out in foolish ways. He cashiered Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. The White House believes she wasn’t pushing the bureaucracy hard enough for regulatory changes, and there may be truth to this, but the biggest problem was that, through no fault of her own, Nielsen was presiding over this crisis.
He has threatened to close the border to force more cooperation from Mexico, but a border closure would cause considerable economic pain on our side of the border, too, and Mexico will never be as invested in stopping migrants coming to the U.S. as we want them to be. It’s not their problem.
Finally, he has talked of sending migrants to sanctuary cities. But ICE is underfunded and overwhelmed and doesn’t have the wherewithal to carry out a major logistical operation on top of its current responsibilities. Regardless, migrants shouldn’t be shipped around the country as political pawns."
Ben Shapiro's 'The Right Side of History' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Tracy Lee Simmons,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/ben-shapiros-right-side-of-history-a-call-to-reclaim-the-wests-birthright/,"April 18, 2019 10:44 AM The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor (Brendan McDermid/Reuters) The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great , by Ben Shapiro (Broadside Books, 288 pp., $27.99)
T he trashing of Western civilization in the academy has been moving apace for decades. It’s an easy target for the chronically disaffected. Back in the 1980s, in a gust of consciousness-raising, Jesse Jackson flew out to Stanford to help student marchers shoulder the heavy lifting of chanting “Hey hey, ho ho, Western Civ has got to go” while paying little heed to what might replace the civilization that made their protest possible. Advertisement
The contemporary descendants of those protesters likely won’t queue up for Professor Ben Shapiro’s course in Western Civ 101, the lecture notes for which are available in Shapiro’s The Right Side of History , a book delineating a view of the past that few educated people would have disputed in its essence 75 years ago but that is now so heterodox as to deserve the moniker of “trendy.” Western civilization, which has provided such a munificent spiritual and material bounty for millennia, owes its very existence to a sturdy though delicately landscaped grounding in tenacious moral purpose matched with a relentless hunger for rational understanding that drove our ancestors to make the universe explicable in the face of its manifold mysteries. This is cutting-edge musing in a.d. 2019 (or c.e., if they insist), which might say more about us than it does about the grand old view itself.
In other words, those enriching traits of our civilization so disparaged and deconstructed by postmodernists with such dismissive facility are the very graces — from Aristotle to aeronautics, from Dante to dentistry — that have made us thrive and have ennobled all those men and women down the ages who have endeavored, often through colossal hardships, to build a humane world and to pass on its accumulated wisdom and knowledge from one generation to the next. Shapiro’s case is, among other things, an exercise in how not to take gifts for granted. Advertisement
Those twin peaks of morality and rationality Shapiro sums up, predictably enough, as Jerusalem and Athens, taking his cue from Tertullian, a crotchety third-century Church father, who asked, somewhat puritanically, “What does Athens have to do with Jerusalem?” For those who wish to live intelligently with moral rectitude, quite a bit. Without reason, imparted by “Athens,” we cannot make heads or tails of the world we’re living in; we have no map. Without revelation, though, imparted by “Jerusalem,” we have no rules that can guide us with that map toward a better, more fruitful life — to a life lived, that is, in consonance with God. Both are required, along with their auxiliaries: the discipline needed to learn from reason and the humility needed to learn from revelation. Reason, Shapiro argues, can teach us how not to be bad, but only revelation can teach us truly how to be good according to transcendent norms. We’re free to disagree with all this, but the notion has had, to say the least, a fairly long run with people of former times who might best us in the greatness sweepstakes, which is more than a faint subtheme to this book. Better people have preceded us, and we ignore them at our peril.
Ignore them we have but, as Shapiro also explains, the neglect has been going on for some time. This book provides an excursion into the intellectual history of the West, from Mt. Sinai to the latest barbarity in Slate , usefully retold for those who know the story and accessibly digested for those who don’t. Nothing frightfully original comes out of these pages — and that’s one of the book’s virtues. Despite Shapiro’s jubilant reputation among young fans for controversy, he writes here more as an ardent student of history and a defender of the old wisdom than as a debater blithely chalking up points. His point of view shines out of every sentence, but it’s a methodical, not a grenade-throwing, one; those who come here to see idiocy “destroyed” — in agitated YouTube-descriptor fashion — may be disappointed, though they’ll be rewarded if they keep reading (and one may say that to expose most idiocies is also to destroy them). Advertisement Advertisement
Shapiro does a masterly job outlining the last 3,000 years of the intellectual struggles our betters endured to figure out our place in the cosmos, a feat harder to pull off than it looks, and he shows how our progenitors have progressed as well as regressed from time to time. He begins with the story of the ancient Hebrews and their wrestle to understand God and His not always comprehensible ways and then moves on to the ancient Greeks to show how they bestowed the gift of philosophy at a time when thinkers still assigned a high premium to the love of wisdom and believed that there was nothing the human mind could not grasp. When these two worlds courted during the early Hellenistic period and finally wed with the coming of Christianity during the high tide of the Greco-Roman world, we had the birth of Judeo-Christian civilization. This fusion created and sustained the values we lived by until the day before yesterday. Advertisement
But the Judeo-Christian worldview brought more than rules to live by. It made the practice of science as we know it possible and even inevitable — which will come as news to those who sophisticatedly assume that faith and reason have always been enemies. Indeed, Shapiro credits the intellectual ferment of the Middle Ages with eventually ushering in the scientific revolution from the 16th to the 18th centuries. And he is particularly adept at countering the expedient misconceptions propagated by secularists who have held that never the twain shall meet — such as the notion that all men of science were anti-religious martyrs to truth, when most, with few exceptions, from Copernicus to Francis Bacon to Newton, were men of faith who understood that their beliefs did not preclude their ability to practice science. Even the woes of Galileo, the chief martyr, are shown to have been not nearly as woeful as we have been led to believe. Advertisement Advertisement
But this book isn’t an intellectual survey alone, nor is such a survey its central purpose. Shapiro is out to reclaim a legacy. He never tires of taking us back again and again to the nexus between ideas and life, tracing the seeds of rebellion from good sense to somewhere in the 17th century with Hobbes and Spinoza, on through the brilliantly cloying influences of Voltaire and Rousseau and the murderous French Revolution they partially wrought, past Hume and Kant and on to the growls of smoldering dissent in the 19th century, from Hegel to Marx, after which the bottom drops out, and the Judeo-Christian tradition that built Western civilization is put permanently on a defensive footing. Enter then the more modern miscreants, the folks who have laid the foundations for sundry varieties of utopianism and heterodoxy and whose ruinous ideas we are saddled with today: Freud, John Dewey, Sartre, and even Dr. Benjamin Spock. Advertisement Advertisement
Shapiro reserves his heavier artillery, though, for those lapses from tradition and civilization that have been pushed to direst effect by the political machinations of men with more obscure names, such as Antonio Gramsci, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse. The influence of the last can be felt every day somewhere on almost every college and university campus in the West, from redrawn curricula fitted to political stances to shout-downs of speakers who challenge the reigning dogmas. Anybody who doesn’t know these figures should make their acquaintance. They have changed the cultural air we breathe. "
Robert Mueller's Report Release: Congress was a Better Forum | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Brendan Dougherty,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/william-barr-report-release-congress-was-a-better-forum/,"Follow Michael Brendan Dougherty on Twitter April 18, 2019 10:59 AM
Watching the extreme reactions of reporters and journalists to Attorney General Bill Barr’s conference, including accusations of cover-up and citing his press conference as evidence of our nation’s descent into an authoritarian junta, my mind leapt back to an argument between Rich Lowry and David French on the proper forum for the kind of investigation Robert Mueller was doing.

French argued that it was fine for a department of the executive branch — created by Congress to enforce federal law — to investigate the president for violations of that law. Lowry argued that the role of investigating the president more properly belonged to Congress."
The Constitution Was Never Pro-Slavery | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Allen C. Guelzo,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/the-constitution-was-never-pro-slavery/,"April 18, 2019 11:14 AM (VisionsOfAmerica/Joe Sohm) It was deliberately written to avoid establishing a legal precedent for ownership of human beings
I n the world of the woke, the U.S. Constitution is, simply on its face, a document of racial oppression. No one less than Bernie Sanders has declared that the United States is “a nation” that in “many ways was created, and I’m sorry to have to say this, from way back, on racist principles.” Others are less sorry. Paul Finkelman, president of Gratz College in Philadelphia, argues that the Constitution deliberately intended to protect slavery, principally through its provisions for interstate extradition of fugitives from “service” (Art. 4 IV, Sec. 2), through the notorious three-fifths clause in Article I, Section 2, which allowed states to count three-fifths of their slave populations toward representation in Congress, and through the 20-year free pass given to the slave trade (Art. I, Sec. 9). Advertisement Advertisement
In fact, for Finkelman, that’s only the beginning of the Constitution’s love affair with slavery. Other offenses include the ban on export taxes in Article I, Section 9 (written to give the products of slave labor an open trade door); the limitation of “privileges and immunities” to “citizens” in Article IV, Section 2 (since slaves could not be “citizens”); the “full faith and credit” requirement between states in Article IV, Section 1 (this required recognition of legalized slavery everywhere in the nation); the power of “calling forth the Militia” to “supress insurrections” in Article I, Section 8 (these “insurrections” could naturally refer only to slave insurrections); and, of course, the Electoral College, since its formula for determining electors was swollen by the numbers of “three-fifths” slaves who would be counted and thus granted slave states an extra advantage in electing presidents.
This is the reasoning that leads David Waldstreicher of the City University of New York to claim that “of the 11 clauses in the Constitution that deal with or have policy implications for slavery, 10 protect slave property and the powers of masters. Only one, the international slave-trade clause, points to a possible future power by which, after 20 years, slavery might be curtailed — and it didn’t work out that way at all.” Even George Van Cleve, the most dispassionate advocate of the “pro-slavery Constitution,” concludes (in A Slaveholders’ Union ) that the Constitution “was pro-slavery in its politics, its economics, and its law.” By these reckonings, the Constitution would have ensured slavery’s perpetuation into the indefinite future had it not been for the fatal intervention of a civil war. Advertisement
What often comes next is a demand to rid the Constitution of the vestigial props for slavery that have somehow survived into our times, usually beginning with the Electoral College. Or maybe, as with University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson, it leads to a call for junking the whole “We the People” business and starting over with a new constitutional convention.
The accusing finger that links slavery and the Constitution would have surprised no one more than the delegates to the Constitutional Convention. At the outbreak of the Revolution, every one of the newly independent states had legalized slavery. (The numbers varied widely from place to place: Georgia had 18,000 slaves, Pennsylvania 6,000, Virginia 200,000, Massachusetts 5,200, and New York 17,000.) Advertisement Advertisement
But opinion about the moral legitimacy of slavery was shifting. Benjamin Franklin bought and sold slaves in colonial Philadelphia, but by 1772 he had begun denouncing slavery as “a constant butchery of the human species” and the slave trade as a “pestilential, detestable traffic in the bodies and souls of men.” New York founded a Manumission Society in 1785, while the Virginia Gazette in 1782 asked the Revolution’s most logical question: “Whilst we are spilling our blood and exhausting our treasure in defence of our own liberty, it would not perhaps be amiss, to turn our eyes towards those of our fellow men now in bondage under us. We say, ‘all men are equally entitled to liberty and the pursuit of happiness’ but are we willing to grant this liberty to all men?”
That question was also being asked among the members of the Constitutional Convention when it assembled in Philadelphia in May 1787. Of the Convention’s 55 delegates, 26 were slaveowners, most of them from southern states — Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia — but a smattering from New York, New Jersey, and Delaware. Still, many were uneasy with the thought of giving slavery a continued lease on life in the new republic. James Madison, who was the prime mover behind the Convention, had long wondered whether emancipation “would certainly be more consonant to the principles of liberty,” and, though the Madison family depended on slave labor, he hoped “to depend as little as possible on the labour of slaves.” When a slave who accompanied him to Congress in Philadelphia in 1783 refused to return with Madison to Virginia, Madison simply apprenticed him to a Philadelphia Quaker, since he “cannot think of punishing him . . . merely for coveting that liberty for which we have paid the price of so much blood, and have proclaimed so often to be the right, & worthy the pursuit, of every human being.” Advertisement
It was not, however, until August 8, well into the deliberations, that the issue erupted on the floor of the Convention. In the midst of the ongoing debate over representation in the new Congress, the Convention was ready to agree to the formula used for Congress in the Articles of Confederation (the three-fifths ratio) when Rufus King of New York objected. “The admission of slaves” into a formula for representation “was a most grating circumstance to his mind” and would only encourage slaveowners to import more slaves, according to the Convention’s minutes. He was seconded by the raffish Gouverneur Morris, who attacked slavery wholesale as “a nefarious institution” that had “the curse of heaven on the States where it prevailed.” Slavery was “a sacrifice of every principle of right, of every impulse of humanity,” and Morris ringingly declared that “he would sooner submit himself to a tax for paying for all the negroes in the U. States, than saddle posterity with such a Constitution.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Morris drew an immediate response from South Carolina’s John Rutledge, who warned that “religion & humanity had nothing to do with this question.” If the Convention wanted to meddle with slavery, then the “question” would become “whether the Southn. States shall or shall not be parties to the Union.” Anxiously, other members sought to seal the breach. Connecticut’s Roger Sherman hastily assured Rutledge that “he disapproved of the slave trade; yet as the States were now possessed of the right to import slaves, . . . he thought it best to leave the matter as we find it.” But this concession was worth making because it actually offered so little. Slavery, Sherman insisted, was dying out on its own: “The abolition of Slavery seemed to be going on in the U.S.” and “the good sense of the several States would probably by degrees compleat it.” Oliver Ellsworth agreed. “As population increases poor laborers will be so plenty as to render slaves useless,” so that “slavery in time will not be a speck in our Country.” Advertisement
But later that month, slavery reappeared in debate — although it now came in the form of a deal aimed at allaying the hostility of King and Morris toward importing slaves. Congress would be empowered to tax slave imports and, after 1808, prohibit slave importation completely (although the wording of the provision gently tiptoed around using the term “slave”). An additional provision made the extradition of fugitive slaves a state obligation — although again gingerly applying it to all “those held to service” rather than to slaves . On the surface, a great compromise appeared to have been struck, and southerners went home congratulating themselves that they had “a security that the general government can never emancipate [slaves], . . . for no such authority is granted.”
But they missed the big picture. As Roger Sherman insisted, the Constitution might contain concessions to the states regarding the existence of slavery, but nothing in it acknowledged “men to be property.” As “dishonorable to the National character” as the concessions were, added James Madison, it would be intolerable “to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in men.” And so the fundamental basis on which the entire notion of slavery rested was barred at the Constitution’s door, even while its practical existence slipped through.
J ust how much distance the Framers wished to put between slavery and the new Constitution emerged even before the Convention adjourned. On July 13, 1787, the final Congress under the Articles of Confederation, sitting in New York, adopted the Northwest Ordinance as the instrument for organizing the territory ceded by Great Britain around the Great Lakes. The Ordinance’s sixth section provided that “there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.” The Ordinance did not at once liberate slaves living in the Northwest (especially the slaves belonging to old French colonial families along the Mississippi River), but it did turn the face of the future away from slavery.
As the Constitution moved toward ratification, one member of the Massachusetts ratifying convention recognized the same dynamic at work in the new federal instrument. “It would not do to abolish slavery . . . in a moment,” conceded Bostonian Thomas Dawes (whose cousin, William, had ridden with Paul Revere). Nevertheless, even if “slavery is not smitten with an apoplexy, yet it has received a mortal wound and will die of a consumption.” And the Pennsylvania abolitionist Benjamin Rush rejoiced that, by refusing to include slavery or “ slaves in this constitution,” the Framers had saved the republic from “the very words” that “would contaminate the glorious fabric of American liberty and government.” The “cloud” of anti-slavery, “which a few years ago was no larger than a man’s hand, has descended in plentiful dews and at last cover’d every part of our land.”
And so it seemed. The new Congress created by the Constitution was in a constant ferment from petitions “teasing and pestering them with something about slavery,” and one Georgia representative grumbled that “it was the fashion of the day to favor the liberty of slaves.” In its first three decades, Congress received proposals to tax slave imports, impose regulations (including prohibitions on the use of American ports or shipyards for equipping slave ships) on the slave trade, extend the Northwest Ordinance’s ban on slavery to the Mississippi territory, and impose gradual emancipation on the Louisiana territory (after its acquisition under Thomas Jefferson in 1803), as well as petitions to “undo the heavy burthens, and prepare the way for the oppressed to go free, that every yoke may be broken.” When truculent slaveowners tried to insist that “slaves are property . . . by the Constitution guaranteed,” John Quincy Adams just as truculently replied that “the Constitution does not recognize slavery — it contains no such word.” In fact, “a great circumlocution of words is used merely to avoid the term slaves .” Any argument that would make the Constitution a pro-slavery document has, on the evidence of the Framers’ generation, quite a boulder to roll up the hill. Advertisement
B ut rolling that boulder was what slaveholders nearly accomplished in the generation after the Framing, and they did so not because the Constitution sanctioned slavery but because of cotton. South Carolina’s prime champion of slavery, John Caldwell Calhoun, conceded that “many in the South once believed that it was a moral and political evil.” But times had changed, and they had changed largely because cotton — the preeminent commodity grown by slave labor in the American South — had been transformed by the Industrial Revolution into the white gold of the transatlantic economy. As late as 1809, cotton was only a secondary crop for southern agriculture; on the eve of the Civil War, it accounted for 27.5 percent of all United States exports and 57.7 percent of agricultural exports.
The South now saw slavery “in its true light,” Calhoun said, and regarded it as “the most safe and stable basis for free institutions in the world.” In the kingdom of cotton, the Constitution was a relic. Guarantees of free speech and a free press were disregarded in the South. Anyone who proposed a discussion of slavery, wrote Alvan Stewart, an anti-slavery lawyer, “may then provoke a syllogism of feathers, or a deduction of tar.” Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton congratulated mobs that attacked abolitionists for exerting “a vigor beyond all law,” saying that “they had obeyed the enactments not of the statutebook, but of the heart.” And so long as he agreed with their spirit, “he cared nothing for laws written in a book.” In 1836, the Virginia legislature adopted a statute decreeing the imprisonment of any member of anti-slavery society so unwary as to enter the Old Dominion. That same year, Calhoun proposed a post-office bill that would have allowed postmasters to destroy abolitionist publications — only to have it fail, narrowly, by a vote of 19 to 25 in the Senate. They were more successful in passing a “gag rule” to prevent the reading of anti-slavery petitions in the House of Representatives. The resolution stayed in force until 1844.
In the southern argument, the states were “as independent of each other as they were before the Constitution was formed,” and in some places even more so. South Carolina, declared one state legislator, was no longer a republic but an oligarchy, “an odious cunning, tyrannical intriguing oligarchy,” determined to “rule or ruin every man who tries to think, speak or act for himself. Not that this departure from constitutional government was seriously opposed; to the contrary, it was the wave of the future.”
“The time must come,” warned Thomas Roderick Dew in 1836, when slavery would rescue the nation from its outdated laws. “Domestic slavery, such as ours, is the only institution which I know of, that can secure that spirit of equality among freemen, so necessary to the true and genuine feeling of republicanism.”
But slavery’s opponents just as vigorously demanded recognition of the Constitution’s anti-slavery import. Senator William Henry Seward of New York defended the Constitution as the shrine of “perpetual, organic, universal” freedom; slavery had only a “temporary, accidental, partial and incongruous” presence in it, and only because slavery had the protection of state, not federal law. The Constitution devotes “the national domain” to “union, to justice, to defense, to welfare and liberty” — not to slavery. Ohio governor Salmon Chase (who was known as the “attorney general for fugitive slaves”) declared that “the founders of the Republic in framing our institutions, were careful to give no national sanction” to slavery; “all recognition of the rightfulness of slaveholding, and all national sanction of the practice, was carefully excluded from the instrument.”
Above all, Abraham Lincoln, in his great Cooper Union speech in February 1860, appealed to the Framers as proof that the Constitution “marked” slavery “as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only, because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity.” Far from justifying slaveholding as a right, “the Constitution . . . is literally silent about any such right,” and any impartial inspection of the Constitution “will show that the right of property in a slave is not ‘distinctly and expressly affirmed’ in it.” Like Madison, Lincoln resisted the “idea” that “the Constitution” sanctioned the pretense “that there could be property in man.” Advertisement
And when push came to shove, the slaveholders conceded the point. They seceded from the Union and wrote the kind of constitution the Framers had not written, one declaring at last that “no . . . law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.”
T o read the Constitution as pro-slavery, in the manner of Finkelman, Waldstreicher, and even Sanders, requires a suspension of disbelief that only playwrights and morticians could admire. Yes, the Constitution reduced slaves to the hated three-fifths; but that was to keep slaveholders from claiming them for five-fifths in determining representation, which would have increased the power of the slaveholding states. Yes, the Constitution permitted the slave trade to continue; but it also permitted Congress to shut it off, which it did in 1808. Yes, the Constitution banned export taxes, required “full faith and credit,” and limited “privileges and immunities” to citizens. But the debates over those provisions betrayed no inkling that the hidden subject was slavery. And the accusation that the militia clause was meant to suppress slave insurrections was actually only a speculation tossed off at one moment of energetic accusation by Gouverneur Morris, not a deliberately conceived strategy by scheming slaveholders.
Smearing the Constitution by characterizing it as a contract for the perpetuation of slavery is worse than trying to see as half empty a glass that’s half full; it is to see as bone dry a glass that’s nearly full, or even to see no glass at all. As the late Don Fehrenbacher wrote in The Slaveholding Republic (2002), “the Constitution as it came from the hands of the framers dealt only minimally and peripherally with slavery.” Its authors, even when they turned a blind eye to slavery, did so believing that “slavery would disappear” and that “the imprint of that expectation is visible in the document they finally approved.”"
Robert Mueller Report Debunk's Buzzfeed's Michael Cohen Testimony Story | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/robert-mueller-report-refutes-buzzfeed-claim-that-trump-directed-cohen-to-lie-to-congress/,"Follow Jack Crowe on Twitter April 18, 2019 1:51 PM Michael Cohen testifies before a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., February 27, 2019. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report contradicts a high-profile Buzzfeed News story that indicated Mueller’s team had evidence President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.
Cohen pled guilty to lying to Congress last year after it was revealed that he told lawmakers that conversations about the construction of a Moscow Trump Tower ended in January 2016, when they actually continued for months thereafter and involved Trump personally.
A January 18 Buzzfeed story claimed that Cohen told the Mueller’s team that Trump “personally instructed him” to mislead lawmakers “in order to obscure Trump’s involvement” in the Moscow Trump Tower project.
Buzzfeed touted Cohen’s supposed testimony as “the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.”
The report’s authors claimed the special counsel learned of Trump’s directive through “interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents” and later from Cohen himself.
Mueller’s report , however, directly refutes those claims. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen’s testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the specifics of his planned testimony,” the report reads.
Mueller’s team did acknowledge in the report that Trump knew Cohen’s testimony was false but stipulated that the “evidence available to us does not establish that the President directed or aided Cohen’s false testimony.”"
Robert Mueller Report Release: Democrats Must Move On | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/robert-mueller-report-release-should-have-democrats-moving-on/,"April 18, 2019 1:19 PM President Donald Trump in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., April 18, 2019 (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)
Some of you will be familiar with a lefty, partisan Democratic organization called MoveOn, formerly MoveOn.Org. It was founded during an investigation into President Bill Clinton’s shenanigans (which were not, Democratic mythology notwithstanding, strictly sexual in nature) and argued that it was time for the country to “move on” from the Clinton scandals. Congress disagreed, and impeached President Clinton. Advertisement Advertisement
The investigation into the Trump campaign’s relationships with various foreign actors and into the president’s possible obstruction of justice has come to a conclusion, and that conclusion is that there was no criminal collusion and insufficient evidence to support an obstruction prosecution. In a reasonable world, this would be the obvious time to move on. Of course the Democrats believe, or want to believe, that there is unfinished business here. Some Republicans do, too, and would like an investigation into whether the investigation was improper and whether investigators acted improperly.
It does not seem to me that the investigation was entirely without basis, and it does seem that the reasonable conclusion here is to concede that there was smoke (maybe just the smell of smoke) but no fire, that some of Trump’s actions may have been unseemly but that there’s no law against unseemliness — and that treating criticism of an investigation as potential obstruction of justice comes queasily close to arguing that to defend one’s self from an accusation is a confession of guilt."
Samuel Johnson & 'The Club' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John J. Miller,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/the-club-book-review-samuel-johnsons-world/,"April 18, 2019 11:05 AM A literary party at Sir Joshua Reynolds’ by D. George Thompson (National Portrait Gallery)
I n the famous dictionary he published in 1755, Samuel Johnson defined a “club” as “an assembly of good fellows, meeting under certain conditions.” Nine years later, in 1764, the lexicographer became a founder of the Club, with a capital C. Its good fellows met under these conditions: They gathered one evening each week near the Strand in London, where they took a private room at the Turk’s Head Tavern, ordered food and wine, and conversed about topics great and small. Members “had to be good company — ready to talk, laugh, drink, eat, and argue until late into the night,” writes Leo Damrosch in The Club , an ambitious, multi-part biography of their lives and times. Advertisement
The Club was no ordinary collection of drinking buddies. Rather, it represented an astonishing assembly of talent and accomplishment. Members included Johnson as well as James Boswell, Edmund Burke, Edward Gibbon, and Adam Smith. These five, according to Damrosch, were “arguably the greatest British critic, biographer, political philosopher, historian, and economist of all time.” The Club’s second-tier members also were extraordinary: David Garrick, the greatest actor of the age; Joshua Reynolds, a top painter; and Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, two of the era’s most successful playwrights. Men of this caliber of intellectual and cultural firepower have congregated only rarely, in places such as classical Athens, Renaissance Florence, and, coincidentally, in Philadelphia at roughly the same time as Johnson’s group.
Who wouldn’t want to eavesdrop on the Club’s conversations? Imagine Johnson and Garrick debating the art of Shakespeare. Or Boswell and Reynolds discussing the differences between written and visual portraiture. Or Burke and Smith — a pair of thinkers whose ideas echo loudly in today’s conservative movement — chatting about just about anything. That’s the implicit promise of Damrosch’s book. “The Club is the virtual hero of this story,” writes the author, a retired professor of literature at Harvard University. Yet this organizing principle turns out to be a curious weakness. Although the members of the Club left behind a massive record of books, essays, and speeches, almost nothing remains of what they said when they met in person. There are no transcripts. Only occasionally did one of them jot down the remarks of another. We have a star-studded cast, but there’s no script. Advertisement
Damrosch solves this problem by shifting his attention away from the specific activities of the Club and onto the amply documented friendship of Johnson and Boswell. They were an impressive duo, and The Club is essentially about them, with several tangents into the lives of their compatriots. This is well-trod ground, starting with Boswell’s own Life of Johnson and running through a long list of biographies that focus on one, the other, or the two together. Do we really need a new account of this old story? Perhaps. “When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life,” Johnson once said. It’s also hard to tire of Johnson, a dazzling wit who shaped the way we think about language and literature. Boswell, too, is a good subject. He was a pioneer in the art of biography and a dutiful diarist, whose revealing journals comprise more than a dozen volumes.
The world of Johnson is so rich that scholars have given it a name: Johnsoniana. There’s even a subfield: Boswelliana. Yet the map of their lives contains a few frustrating areas of terra incognita. Writers have had little to say about the friendship between Johnson and Burke, for example. Both were founding members of the Club, belonging to it for about a decade before Boswell, Gibbon, and Smith joined. They enjoyed a long connection, shared many interests, and were mutually admiring. Johnson was a hard man to impress, but he had the highest regard for Burke: “You could not stand five minutes with that man beneath a shed while it rained, but you must be convinced you had been standing with the greatest man you had ever seen.” The only thing that he may not have liked about his fellow Clubber was Burke’s fondness for groan-inducing puns. One time, for example, Burke sat near a ham. “I am Ham-Burke ,” he said, punning on the name of Hamburg, the German city. In recounting the incident, Damrosch says the most charitable thing possible: “You had to be there.” Advertisement Advertisement
This is the fundamental obstacle for any biographer who seeks to describe the friendship of Johnson and Burke: You had to have been there. They might have engaged in some of the greatest conversations in history, but we just don’t know, because conversations are ephemeral. Unless someone records them, they vanish like wisps of smoke. To compensate for their disappearance, Damrosch offers a brief biography of Burke, but it fails to show why Burke deserved Johnson’s profound admiration. Part of the problem may be Damrosch’s garden-variety liberalism. Today’s conservatives honor Burke as one of their intellectual heroes, largely for his authorship of Reflections on the Revolution in France , which warned against the chaos of mobs and the abandonment of tradition. Damrosch tries to push back, scolding American conservatives for having “idealized Burke as their foundational thinker” when the radical Thomas Paine mattered more to the Founding Fathers. Damrosch goes to great pains to make this point — or great Paines, to use a Burkean pun — but he seems unfamiliar with the writings of Peter Stanlis, Russell Kirk, and Yuval Levin. They’re nowhere in the footnotes, even though their work is indispensable to an understanding of Burke’s brand of conservatism and what American conservatives see in it. Advertisement Advertisement
Damrosch’s coverage of Smith is also a letdown, though in this case his characters hobble him. The introverted author of The Wealth of Nations was a “strangely recessive” member of the Club. When he was elected to it in 1775, Boswell, his former student in Edinburgh, grumbled that the Club had “lost its selective merit.” Johnson was sharper: Smith, he said, was “as dull a dog as he had ever met with.” The animosities at the Club extended to others as well: “Johnson and Boswell both loathed Gibbon,” writes Damrosch. In this instance, at least, their ire is rooted in disdain for what they perceived as anti-Christian views in Gibbon’s magnum opus, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . So here’s a substantial disagreement, and the prospect of rhetorical fireworks, but the fact remains that we just don’t know much about what Johnson, Boswell, and Gibbon said to one other at the Turk’s Head Tavern. Advertisement
With so little to report about what really happened at meetings of the Club, Damrosch turns not only to potted biographies of great men but also to what he calls Johnson’s “shadow club” or “second club.” This was the social circle that surrounded Hester Thrale, who became something of a patron to Johnson. She was also a devoted diarist, and if Boswell never had lived, her writings would serve as the favorite source of Johnson’s biographers. Even with Boswell’s biography, Thrale offers a unique contribution. Boswell, writes Damrosch, “felt a jealous rivalry with Hester for Johnson’s affection.” He essentially ignores her in The Life of Johnson , and she has much to say that Boswell doesn’t. Advertisement Advertisement
Thrale has provided anecdotes and insights into everything from Johnson’s method of composition to his mental health. He clearly suffered from what people in the 18th century called “melancholy.” Our word for it is “depression,” and Johnson’s case seems to have been severe. It may also be linked to his brilliance, making him a quintessential case of a tortured genius.
The torture was literal, according to Katharine C. Balderston, the editor of Thrale’s diary (known as — wait for it — Thraliana ). In 1949, Balderston described Johnson as a victim of “erotic maladjustment.” She continued: “His compulsive fantasy assumed a masochistic form, in which the impulse to self-abasement and pain predominated.” In other words, Mrs. Thrale padlocked Johnson and beat him with rods in acts of sexual perversion. Provocative claims require compelling proof, and in this case the evidence is thin. Most Johnson scholars have rejected it, including W. Jackson Bate, Peter Martin, and John Wain. Damrosch, however, accepts Balderston’s theory without hesitation. That’s fine, but beyond labeling her original article “controversial,” he doesn’t indicate to readers that this wild speculation is in fact a minority opinion.
Elsewhere, Damrosch makes better observations and wiser judgments. He marvels at the “remarkable” fluke that both Johnson and Garrick hailed from Lichfield, a small city near Birmingham, and they were buried beside each other in the Poets’ Corner of Westminster Abbey. Damrosch also endorses Johnson’s own belief that if he hadn’t quit Oxford for lack of funds, he might have disappeared into the mire of academia, never to be heard from again. Johnson instead moved to Grub Street, the traditional home of Londoners who scribbled for a living. Damrosch goes on to suggest that Johnson should have tried a medium that was just starting to catch on: “In hindsight it’s clear that the best path to success would have been as a novelist.” Unfortunately for fans of the novel, Johnson disliked the form."
Socialism's Rise & Fall: 'Heaven on Earth' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Paul Hollander,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/socialisms-rise-and-fall-heaven-on-earth-book-review/,"About Paul Hollander April 18, 2019 11:10 AM Britain’s Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers his keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool, England, September 26, 2018. (Phil Noble/Reuters) Heaven on Earth: The Rise, Fall, and Afterlife of Socialism , by Joshua Muravchik (Encounter Books 424 pp., $18.99)
T he volume here reviewed is the second edition of a book first published in 2002. I reviewed it favorably (with some reservations) in 2003. A good case can be made for the new edition, given the survival of socialist ideals and the persisting disagreements about their nature and realizability. It remains of interest why people in different parts of the world are still attracted to these ideals and why the same ideals have been so difficult to implement. Of special interest is what Joshua Muravchik calls the “afterlife” of socialism — what happened to these ideals and political aspirations after the political systems supposedly dedicated to their realization, such as the Soviet Union, ceased to exist. Advertisement
As the reader is informed in the preface, the new edition is largely unchanged, except for the addition of an epilogue, some updating of the chapter on the kibbutzim (collective farms of modern Israel), and the correction of small errors.
The difficulty of coming to grips with the subject — that is, the proper understanding of the nature of socialist ideals and their realizability — has not diminished since the book was first published. The problem begins with the widely held, undifferentiated views of socialism shared by most Americans. They are unaware of the fundamental differences between authoritarian (or totalitarian) state socialism embedded in one-party systems, such as the former Soviet one or the Chinese one under Mao, and social-democratic societies, such as those in Scandinavia. The latter are politically liberal and pluralistic and seek to reduce economic inequalities through high taxes and a range of social services. It is this ignorance of the deep moral and institutional gulf between these two very different political systems that allowed President Trump to hold forth about the horrors of socialism without specifying whether he had in mind the Soviet Gulag or child care in Sweden. By the same token, it is also incumbent on the new, young Democratic representatives in Congress who sing the praises of socialism to make clear that they are aware of the morally decisive differences between democratic socialism and the repressive one-party states calling themselves “socialist.” Advertisement
Since one-party-state socialist systems largely succeeded in usurping the “socialist” designation, it might have been wiser in this new edition to either completely eliminate or greatly reduce the discussion of British social democracy (i.e., the chapters on Atlee and Blair). On the other hand, if it was the author’s intention to present different approaches toward the realization of socialist ideals, the durable democratic socialism of the Scandinavian countries should have been included. Advertisement
Important conceptual distinctions are further obscured when under the same heading (“Triumphs”) we find chapters on Lenin’s seizure of power, Mussolini’s “socialism,” British social democracy under Atlee, and Nyerere’s African socialism. It is also unclear why a chapter on conflicts within the American trade-union movement was put in the part entitled “Collapse,” along with chapters on Deng and Gorbachev, Tony Blair, and the kibbutz. Advertisement
The volume might have been made more coherent by clearly separating the discussion of socialist ideals from the historical attempts to realize them, whether in small utopian communities, social-democratic countries, or authoritarian one-party states.
Apart from these structural-organizational problems, the book remains an informative introduction to the attempts to create socialist systems or communities variously conceived. Especially interesting is the chapter on the kibbutz, a unique experiment in creating, without coercion, utopian communities that had an authentic socialist — that is to say, egalitarian — inspiration. Advertisement
It is the attempted updating by means of the epilogue that is the least satisfactory. The “afterlife” of socialism, its continued appeal and divergent interpretations, and the unforeseen consequences of its attempted realization, cannot be adequately dealt with in a brief epilogue. There have been developments in this century that deserve attention and that this epilogue did not, and could not, address. They include the political disposition and influence of some prominent Western intellectuals — Alain Badiou, Noam Chomsky, Stephen F. Cohen, Angela Davis, José Saramago, and Slavoj Zizek, among others — who still cling to certain socialist ideals or seek to revive them. The afterlife of socialism cannot be reduced to the toxic disposition of Jeremy Corbyn of Britain or the more benign concerns and misconceptions of our Bernie Sanders — two figures (and their supporters) who dominate the epilogue. A particularly important phenomenon overlooked is the alienation of left-leaning young people in affluent, pluralistic Western societies and similar sentiments among the new right-wing populists. The former know little about the repression, regimentation, and scarcities that prevailed in the state-socialist systems. This ignorance makes it easier to harbor illusions about the sense of community attributed even to the remaining authoritarian socialist societies. Many of these young people are anti-capitalist because they associate capitalism with selfishness, impersonality, and lack of community more than with social injustices. Advertisement
Arguably, it is the “afterlife” that brought us right-wing populism, especially among the white working classes and older people similarly concerned with loss of community, weak social bonds, and meaninglessness. It seems to me that the central, shared grievance of the “new New leftists” and the right-wing populists can be traced to modernity (in its familiar capitalist incarnation): that is, to social isolation, secularization, and the loss of meaning. The populist nationalism and glorification of the past are pathways to a hoped-for restoration of community and stable moral values that modernity has undermined."

The Mueller Report and Special-Counsel Investigations | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-report-special-counsel-investigations/,"About The Editors April 19, 2019 12:22 AM Attorney General William Barr, flanked by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, speaks at a news conference to discuss Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report in Washington, D.C., April 18, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
S o much for collusion. The media conversation has now officially moved on from the obsession of the last two years to obstruction of justice.
That’s because the first volume of the voluminous Mueller report, the half devoted to what was supposed to be the underlying crime of a Trump conspiracy with Russia, came up completely empty. It tells us very little that’s new. There’s no particularly sinister information about Carter Page, the bit player the FBI repeatedly told the FISA court was probably a Russian agent. The operators who portrayed themselves as closest to WikiLeaks or Russia were usually braggarts and liars exaggerating their importance. Nothing came of the infamous Trump Tower meeting. Paul Manafort wasn’t at the center of conspiracy between the campaign and Russia, but operating in his greedy self-interest. Advertisement Advertisement
The Trump campaign was amateurish and without scruple in exploiting the WikiLeaks disclosures, but we all could have agreed on that long ago, without a years-long special-counsel investigation. Indeed, given how unlikely collusion always was and how far the evidence gathered by Mueller is from showing it, one wonders why the special counsel couldn’t have issued an interim report long ago, dispelling the persistent — and poisonous — idea that Trump was about to be proven a traitor.
The business end of the Mueller report is the second volume, on obstruction. The investigation ended up following the typical pattern of special-counsel probes on a much larger scale — fixating on process crimes even when there is no underlying offense. Only in this case, the target was the president of the United States. Advertisement
The report implicitly picks an argument with Attorney General William Barr over the question whether a president can obstruct justice in the course of exercising his lawful powers. We are inclined to Barr’s view that he can’t. Regardless, the case against Trump is ambiguous, as even Mueller acknowledges. Advertisement
The firing of FBI Director James Comey was almost certainly motivated by the president’s frustration that the FBI director wouldn’t say publicly that he wasn’t under investigation, indeed creating the opposite public impression. Some of Trump’s deceptions were for public consumption, not to influence the investigation. Trump’s attempts to fire Mueller and get then-attorney general Jeff Sessions to curtail the investigation came to nothing.
Finally, despite Trump’s hatred for the investigation, his White House cooperated with it fully. Advertisement
None of this is to deny the report’s distressing portrayal of how President Trump operates. He avoids potentially disastrous missteps, such as firing Mueller, when his aides ignore him and he fails to follow up. His dishonesty constantly creates dilemmas for those around him, forcing them to choose between lying for him or defying him. No president of the United States should ever applaud people for refusing to cooperate with prosecutors, or call someone who cooperates a “rat.” Most White House scandals involve presidents getting ill served by overly zealous, norm-defying advisers. In this episode, Trump flipped the script."

But What About . . .? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Charles C. W. Cooke,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/but-what-about/,"David writes :
the idea that anyone is treating this report as “win” for Trump, given the sheer extent of deceptions exposed (among other things), demonstrates that the bar for his conduct has sunk so low that anything other than outright criminality is too often brushed aside as relatively meaningless.
I disagree. It is, in fact, a “win” for Trump. The central question in American politics over the last two years — and, indeed, the central question that the investigation into Russian interference gradually evolved to answer — was not “is Donald Trump a good person?” or “is Donald Trump a liar?” or “is Donald Trump fit to be president?” or even “does Donald Trump behave well when under investigation?” It was “is Donald Trump a traitor who colluded with the Russian government to steal the 2016 election, and if not, did his campaign do so on his behalf?” The answer to that question — to those question s , in fact — is a resounding “No.”"

1972 —Dissenting from the Supreme Court’s ruling in Sierra Club v. Morton that the Sierra Club lacks standing to challenge federal actions regarding a ski development, Justice William O. Douglas proposes “the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.” The question of standing “would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded.” Advertisement Advertisement
Under Douglas’s rule, these inanimate objects—“valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life”—would be named parties. “The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.” The “legitimate spokesmen” in court for the inanimate object would be “[t]hose who have [an] intimate relation with the inanimate object.” “Then there will be assurances that all of the forms of life which [the inanimate object] represents will stand before the court—the pileated woodpecker as well as the coyote and the bear, the lemmings as well as the trout in the streams.”
Needless to say, Justice Douglas is unconcerned by the massive increase in judicial power that would result from his proposed obliteration of constitutionally rooted restrictions on standing. Concerns about “government by the Judiciary” are insignificant, he says, in light of the inadequacies of Congress (“too remote” and “too ponderous”) and the federal agencies (“notoriously under the control of powerful interests”) in addressing the problem.

2016— Never has a more brazen and aggressive bureaucratic misreading of federal law encountered a more craven and confused judicial reception.
In G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board , a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit defers to the Obama administration’s radical claim that federal law requires any school that receives federal funding to make its single-sex restrooms, locker rooms, showers, housing, and sports teams available to “transgender students consistent with their gender identity.” Never mind that the Obama administration never actually interpreted the particular 1975 regulation in the manner that the panel majority imagined it owed deference to. Never mind that assigning facilities and programs on the basis of biological sex disregards—and thus clearly does not discriminate on the basis of —gender identity.
In August the Supreme Court will block the Fourth Circuit’s ruling from taking effect, and in late October it will grant the school board’s certiorari petition. In March 2017—after the incoming Trump administration repudiates the Obama’s reading of federal law—the Court will vacate the Fourth Circuit’s ruling and remand the case for further consideration.
