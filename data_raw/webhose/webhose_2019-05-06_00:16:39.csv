it was Biden who called to a handicapped veteran in a wheelchair telling him to stand up
and it was a democrat who baited handicapped McCain about not being fast on a keyboard i
it was Obama who commented that his inept bowling would get him into the Special Olympics
when Trump mimed a reporter shaking in fear when the reporter backpedaled on a controversial report , the media claimed he was mimicking the man‚Äôs palsy, the man did not have palsy
The motion Trump made mimicking someone shaking in fear is commonly used in New York, I‚Äôve seen many relatives use it and not one of them was making any kind of ‚Äúattack‚Äù that anyone was handicapped
Then we have a Kennedy who drowned his female companion in the lake and no one had a problem with that
Or complained for years about Biden pawing young girls
liberal discernment and standards are always interesting"

Click here to view on the original site: Original Post
LAS VEGAS ‚Äî Speaking before a crowd of influential GOP donors and Jewish Republicans, President Donald Trump on Saturday accused Democrats of mistreating Israel and allowing the ‚Äúscourge of anti-Semitism to take root‚Äù in their party.
‚ÄúDemocrats are advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúIf implemented‚Ä¶ the Democrats radical agenda could very well leave Israel out there all by yourselves.‚Äù
In remarks at an annual conference hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, which endorsed Trump in 2016 and has spoken glowingly of his administration during his first two years in office, the president riled up the crowd by tearing down his political opponents one-by-one.
Taking direct aim at freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somalian-born Muslim congresswoman who‚Äôs been rebuked by Republicans and members of her own party for comments perceived as anti-Semitic, Trump jokingly thanked her at the outset of his remarks.
thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota. Oh, I almost forgot. She doesn‚Äôt like Israel‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù Trump quipped, as an audience in the gilded Venetian Hotel booed the congresswoman‚Äôs name.
The hour-plus speech hit on all the campaign themes that Trump has been touting as he enters the 2020 fray.
He reassured the crowd that Republicans will soon become ‚Äúthe party of healthcare,‚Äù a claim that has baffled some top GOP lawmakers in recent days who have hoped to avoid wading back into the divisive issue after failing to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017. He also spoke about the flow of immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border, including asylum seekers from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, claiming that his administration has been unfairly criticized for moving to cut off aid to the Central American countries.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve taken a lot of heat from the stupid people,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWhat about building our own country for a change?‚Äù
And in what has become a big applause line for Trump since Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) introduced her climate change initiative known as the Green New Deal, Trump complained about the menu of ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù policies that he claims Democrats are pushing Americans to embrace.
People would have to take ‚Äútrains to Europe, Hawaii and Australia,‚Äù Trump claimed as he criticized Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs resolution ‚Äî proposed by ‚Äúa wonderful young bartender, 29 years old,‚Äù he added derisively.
Earlier in the day, the president on Twitter denounced special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs probe into Russian collusion as well as Democratic-led investigations into his administration. However, he notably avoided the topic while speaking to the Jewish Republicans.
Trump‚Äôs remarks to the Jewish crowd come less than a week after he hosted embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for ongoing discussions about a Middle East peace agreement and Iran. Netanyahu is currently facing allegations of corruption and accusations that he used his position as Israel‚Äôs top elected official for personal gain. At one point on Saturday, Trump asked the crowd how they thought the Israeli leader would fare in his upcoming bid for re-election.
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to be close. Two good people,‚Äù Trump said, as the crowd yelled ‚ÄúBibi‚Äù to voice their support for the incumbent, Netanyahu.
The president also recognized conservative mega-donor Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, to whom Trump recently awarded a presidential Medal of Freedom. The 85-year-old Adelson, who has been undergoing cancer treatment, hadn‚Äôt been expected to be in attendance Saturday. But those close to the Casino mogul, who with his wife gave over $120 million to GOP causes in the 2018 midterms, said he decided that he wanted to make it to the gathering.
Adelson, who arrived in a red ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù baseball cap, received a standing ovation from the crowd, many of whom wore kippahs or other apparel embellished with Trump‚Äôs name or iconic campaign slogan.
Trump‚Äôs trip to the West Coast, where he continues to suffer from sky-high disapproval ratings, began Friday, when he traveled to Calexico, Calif., to tour a segment of the border that was recently upgraded for security purposes. He participated in a fundraising event late Friday before reportedly dining at a golf club he owns in Rancho Palos Verdes.
A group of pro-Palestine activists attempted to disrupt the president‚Äôs speech early on Saturday, but were escorted out as the large audience drowned them out with chants of ‚Äúfour more years‚Äù and ‚ÄúUSA!‚Äù
Trump carried on unfazed, ticking through a series of campaign promises related to Israel that he has fulfilled since taking office, and reminding the crowd that one of those promises ‚Äî his withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran ‚Äî is being threatened by Democratic presidential contenders.
‚ÄúUnlike other presidents, I keep my promises,‚Äù he said, citing his decision to relocate the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as an example of a ‚Äúhistoric action that had been decades in the waiting.‚Äù
Trump used his remarks to generate enthusiasm for his own re-election bid, but also for congressional Republicans who face tough races in 2020 and were dealt a major blow last November when Democrats won back the House of Representatives.
‚ÄúWe need more Republicans,‚Äù he said, thanking audience members for their ‚Äúoutstanding commitment to our country‚Äù and to helping ‚Äúlead our party to another historic victory‚Äù next fall.

Babies may remember music heard in the womb,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120639.html,"Post: #1 Babies may remember music heard in the womb
Advertisement Babies may remember music heard in the womb
https://www.nhs.uk/news/pregnancy-and-ch...-the-womb/
""Babies remember melodies heard in womb, study suggests,"" reports The Guardian. The study found that babies exposed to the lullaby ""Twinkle, twinkle little star"" while in the womb showed signs of remembering it up to four months after birth.
The study involved two groups of mothers:the learning group ‚Äì mothers who played the well-known lullaby ""Twinkle, twinkle little star"" in late pregnancy
the control group ‚Äì mothers who did not play music regularly
After birth, researchers found signs that babies in the learning group showed signs of ""remembering"" the lullaby.
The brain activity of babies whose mothers regularly played the lullaby in pregnancy was stronger when similar music was played after birth and at four months.
The researchers suggest prenatal exposure to music may influence brain development at a critical period for the development of the auditory system.
The researchers also speculate that being exposed to less soothing sounds during pregnancy may have a negative effect on a child's development, but this hypothesis is unproven."
