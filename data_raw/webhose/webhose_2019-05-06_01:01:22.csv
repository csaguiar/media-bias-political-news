The wonderful predator hunter groups we have operating in this country, which infuriate the Establishment so much, tend to snare a majority of white child rapists. The Islam brigade frequently form groups which enlist the tacit cooperation of the supposed forces of law and order, which gives them far greater protection from being caught. But don’t doubt it, there are a great many being snared by the hunter groups every single week, and the lenient sentences they receive are a precursor to the Deep States attempts to make the rape of children legal and seemingly ‘normalised’."

But I stand by my adverb for the following reason:
There is no culture which covers up quite like the Muslims do when such activity comes to light. How else do you explain outrages like Rotherham ??? We have known about this since around 2005 - in any decent society, it would have been eliminated in weeks. But we are a full decade and a half later and it is still rife.
Now compare this with the BBC helicopter coverage of the raid on Cliff Richard's house. High impact yellow journalism on stilts !!!
By contrast, where does the BBC dare to question Muslims ??? Not a hope !!!
If you think the Muslims are in the minority as offenders, then you have simply swallowed the propaganda of the MSM.

"The uneasy co-existence of national struggles and conservative clerics - Islands, churches and partition",www.economist.com,msn.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/04/07/the-uneasy-co-existence-of-national-struggles-and-conservative-clerics,"FOR BOTH the Irish and the Greek-Cypriots, at opposite geographical extremes of the European Union, this is a time of year when you expect to hear acrimonious debates about some sensitive moments of national history. These include the circumstances in which people on each island rose up against British rule.
Ireland has often mingled its religious commemorations of Jesus Christ’s resurrection with events that recall the Easter Rising in 1916. Meanwhile the Greek-Cypriots hold ceremonies that recall the formal start of their violent campaign to end British domination, and if possible unite the island with Greece, on April 1st 1955.
In some respects, historical discussions in the two countries sound remarkably similar. In each place, people argue about the roles, sometimes complementary and sometimes competing, played by armed anti-British resistance and the national church, both of which claimed to be the moral representative of a hard-pressed people. And in both islands, people wonder whether territorial partition could have been avoided if demands for freedom had been pursued in a different way.
In Ireland, there was a deeply ambivalent relationship between the Catholic church and the Republican movement that emerged in the 19th century. The leaders of the rebellion which engulfed Dublin in 1916, who in 16 cases were executed, included devout Catholics who entrusted new Irish republic to the care “of the most high God”. Yet their action was condemned by some Catholic bishops.
In later years, generations of Irish schoolchildren were taught to see a link between the re-emergence of Jesus Christ from the grave and the self-sacrifice of the rebels which led to the rebirth of the Irish nation. But hard-core Irish republicans, who tend to be secular, dismiss such talk as sentimental, or as a cynical attempt by the church to jump on their revolutionary bandwagon.
For militant Irish republicans, one of the many bad consequences of the partition of Ireland between an independent south and a British north was that it cleared the way for the southern state to be ultra-Catholic in its public ethos, leaving little room for religious minorities and people of no religion. Conservative Irish nationalists would disagree. In certain ways, that argument is still sputtering on.
Sinn Fein, the political voice of Irish republicanism, has recently shown its secular face by taking a firm line in favour of gay rights and a liberal abortion regime in both parts of Ireland, to the point of virtually forcing members who dissent from this line, on grounds of Catholic conscience, to leave the party. A decade or so ago, Sinn Fein might have hesitated to take this uncompromisingly secularist stance for fear of alienating devout Catholic voters; but it now calculates that any political cost is bearable because the church’s authority has waned.
But to see a really tortured, and still contentious, relationship between an armed rebel movement and a Christian church, consider the modern history of Cyprus.
The campaign by the island’s ethnic Greek majority to expel the British, who had ruled the island as a protectorate since 1878 and as a crown colony since 1925, drew on two contrasting kinds of rhetoric: the anti-colonial militancy that was gaining ground all over the world, and the much more conservative ethos of Greek nationalism and irredentism.
The most visible leader of the Greek-Cypriots in the 1950s was Archbishop Makarios (pictured), the head of the national church, who later became the first president of the Cyprus republic. The cleric always kept his own relationship with the EOKA fighters in a kind of mysterious grey area. But in the eyes of their British enemies and their ethnic Greek admirers, the prelate and the guerrillas were, at least in the early days, co-leaders of a single cause.
However close the relationship was at the start, it turned sour in the 1960s, with consequences that are still with us. But things evolved in a way that was almost the mirror image of what happened in Ireland.
The hard core of EOKA guerrillas hewed to the political right. They were led by a Greek-trained, ultra-rightist officer, George Grivas, who was furious with the archbishop for accepting a compromise (Cyprus becoming an independent bi-communal state co-managed by Greeks and Turks) as opposed to fighting on for the maximal aim of union with Athens. The archbishop, meanwhile, seemed to swing to the international left by cultivating the non-aligned movement, opposing NATO and prompting American cold-warriors to dub him the Castro of the Mediterranean.
In the end, ultra-rightist and Greek-nationalist forces in Athens and Cyprus colluded to overthrow him, albeit briefly, in July 1974. That in turn prompted Turkey to invade the island, citing the need to protect the Turkish-Cypriot minority; there was a massive, forced exchange of population and the island was partitioned.
Although the memory of Archbishop Makarios is generally revered among Greek-Cypriots, they still argue over whether the charismatic cleric bears some responsibility for triggering the island’s violent partition. This week Takis Hadjidemetriou, a veteran Greek-Cypriot politician respected for his work in reconciling Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots, published an assessment of the 1950s. He argued that the archbishop to some degree created his own nemesis by choosing Grivas as a tactical ally in the 1950s. Teaming up with the old-time Greek nationalist, and blessing his “armed struggle”, was a conscious, deliberate and avoidable choice by the archbishop, in the politician’s view. Things might have been better if the archbishop had from the beginning focused his energies more exclusively on an anti-colonial campaign, Mr Hadjidemetriou believes.
In Cyprus, more than in Ireland, it could be argued that the church has had the last word. Although nobody could now imagine political and religious leadership being fused in a single person, the island’s church retains huge wealth and quiet influence in Cypriot affairs. It has recently exercised its power in a conservative way; the days when its leader, Makarios, was known internationally as the “red bishop” are long gone.
Although different prelates take different views, the church has in the last few years resisted proposals for a compromise solution between Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots. And in Cyprus as well as in Greece, politicians sometimes skirmish with the church but they generally avoid a final showdown because the cost would be too high; a large proportion of voters still feel protective of their traditional faith and its guardians. That no longer seems to be the case in Ireland.

The long-standing alliance between the United States and Israel keeps getting stronger. On Sunday, the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the American National Academy of Sciences and Humanities signed a cooperation agreement at the President’s Residence.President Reuven Rivlin entered the reception hall flanked by Prof. Nili Cohen, the president of the Israel Academy, and Prof. Marcia McNutt, her American peer. The two academics are old friends, having met when each delivered an address at the French Academy of Sciences. Cohen listed those who facilitated the cooperation – first the Blavatnik Family Foundation which over the past decade has contributed more than $700 million to more than 250 educational organizations in Israel, the US and elsewhere.Guests included Alex Blavatnik, the brother of Sir Leonard Blavatnik, a British-American businessman and philanthropist. The Ukraine-born Sir Leonard, who studied at Columbia University and Harvard Business School, takes a particular interest in the annual Blavatnik Awards for promising Israeli scientists.The 2019 honorees included Dr. Michal Rivlin and Dr. Erez Berg, both of the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Dr. Moran Bercovici of the Technion.In their addresses, Cohen and McNutt both wished the president’s wife, Nechama Rivlin, a speedy recovery after undergoing a lung transplant. Cohen described the gathering as “historic.” She and McNutt both hailed the formalizing of cooperative relations between the two academies and between the scientific communities of their respective countries.The agreement stipulates that two annual scientific conferences be held – one in Israel and one in the US – to be attended by eminent scientists in various fields from both countries.The Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities has similar agreements with counterparts in more than 40 countries.The Academy is housed next to the President’s Residence in Talbieh but also has historic proximity. Cohen noted Israel’s first and fourth presidents, Chaim Weizmann and Ephraim Katzir, were both scientists. She mentioned that President Rivlin’s father had been a professor at the Hebrew University. This gave Rivlin the opportunity to quip his father had also been nominated for president, “but he was too busy.” (Yosef Yoel Rivlin had been a candidate to serve as the third president of Israel, but was defeated by Zalman Shazar).“In a world where we see chasms opening up before our eyes, we have to utilize every opportunity to build another bridge. Scientists all over the world speak the same language and use the same methods to plumb the truth,” McNutt said.“We want our children to grow in safety,” she said, adding that parents also want education, economic security, prosperity, independence and happiness for their children. “These bridges we are building are more than just science. They enable people in our two nations to get to know each other.”

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 07th April, 2019) The Islamabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry has lauded the new approach of FBR for selection of lesser number of audit cases for income tax, sales tax and Federal excise duty for the tax year 2017 through computer balloting and termed it a healthy approach that would minimize the audit related issues of the taxpayers and encourage non-filers towards tax net. Ahmed Hassan Moughal, President, Islamabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry said that last year, FBR had selected around 45000 audit cases that have been reduced to just over 14000 this year which showed that FBR was now focused on conducting professional audit instead of creating harassment in the taxpayers.
He said previously, same taxpayers were selected repeatedly for audit that always created lot of concerns in the business community. Ahmed Hassan Moughal said that the prevailing audit policy of FBR was quite problematic and stressed that FBR should further improve its audit policy.
He said that once a taxpayer was selected for audit, at least five years exemption from next audit should be given to such taxpayer. He urged that for audit exercise, FBR should focus on quality instead of quantity.
He said that audit policy should be formulated in such a way as it should encourage people towards tax compliance.ICCI President further said that FBR should review the audit powers of Commissioners to issue audit notices to taxpayers and these powers should be clearly defined as the current trend of frequent issuance of audit notices to the same taxpayers was not making any useful contribution towards expansion of tax base in the country.
He said separation of assessment office from the audit office could be a good option to improve audit process."

ABU DHABI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 07th Apr, 2019) The UAE government , in cooperation with the World Economic Forum on the middle East and North Africa (MENA), has become the first signatory to the ""Scale 360"" initiative, which aims at moving towards a more circular economy while using less natural resources and reducing pollution to tackle climate change.
This step reaffirms the UAE ’s position as a global and an open laboratory for economic and technological innovations in line with UAE Vision 2021 and the Centennial Strategy 2071.
The initiative was signed from the UAE side by Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, and Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, and Borge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum.
The signing, which took place during the participation of the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa , translates the strategic directions of the UAE government into practical initiatives by creating an enabling a sustainable infrastructure to support the growth of the economic, social and environmental sectors.
Dr. Thani Al Zeyoudi said: ""The UAE 's success in linking development plans with environmental considerations is the result the leadership's endless support in promoting development while maintaining the sustainability of our natural resources which contributed to a global leading model. We seek to promote Scale 360 to existing and future projections in order to ensure the conservation of resources, greater reliance on clean energy, the application of sustainable development standards, as well as create future opportunities for the youth in the region.""
Omar Al Olama said: ""The UAE ’s signing on Scale 360 launched by the World Economic Forum reflects the government 's commitment to employ the Fourth Industrial Revolution’s technologies for a better future for communities while joining the global efforts to sustain the environment for future generations. ""
""Artificial Intelligence is a major contributor to the sustainable development efforts and recycling initiatives. We seek to emphasise the need to adopt artificial intelligence in development strategies,"" the minister added.
The initiative provides a model for a circular economy, which employs the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in order to keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and material at the end of each service life.
The innovative economic concept aims at minimising waste by designing recyclable and renewable goods to ensure their utilisation even after the end of their shelf- life and in order to achieve efficient use of natural resources.
To address these challenges, the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies are used today to envision a new way of managing our resources. These technologies range from digital datasets linked to physical products using a product passport and internet of Materials as well as blockchain-based schemes. Scale 360 would offer enormous potential that can reduce waste and recycling resource efficiently as the foundation of future cities and sustainable economy.
A World Economic Forum report indicated that over US$1 trillion a year could be generated by 2025 for the global economy and 100,000 new jobs created within the next five years if companies focused on encouraging the build-up of circular supply chains to increase the rate of recycling, reuse and remanufacture."

Krahenbuhl voiced commitment to offering education to 122,000 students currently studying in UNRWA schools in Jordan.
He said that the Agency is currently investing in important efforts to rehabilitate schools in the Kingdom, in order to improve the educational conditions of tens of thousands of students. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

ISLAMABAD, Apr 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The Islamabad Cleft Lip and Palate Association (ICLAPA) is all set to build a well-equipped hospital here to treat cleft lip and palate patients on voluntarily basis.
A piece of land had been acquired for the purpose and the construction work on it would be started soon, this was announced at the end of a day-long medical camp, organized here Sunday by ICLAPA), said a press release.
The ICLAPA, a body of volunteer doctors and social workers, is engaged in a humanitarian task, hoped that philanthropists would come forward to help in the early construction of the hospital, which would cater the medical needs of patients suffering from cleft lip and palate. The treatment would be provided by a team of local and foreign doctors free of charge.
A group of doctors, who treated the patients at the camp, pledged to continue to serve the patients so that they could lead a normal life. About 30 patients, mainly children, were examined at the camp, most of them had traveled from some far-flung areas for the purpose.
Some of the patients would be operated upon next week at a local hospital, however, major surgeries would be conducted in the month of June by a team of Chinese and local doctors, the press release said.
""We are providing volunteer services to the patients for the last many years,"" stated ICLAPA President M Aftab and Mrs Farhat Akhtar Rehman.
The ICLAPA President said his organization had been providing free medical facilities to the poor families since 2004 with the support of families, friends and well wishers.
Prof Farhat Akhtar said the ICLAPA was a group of volunteers, which relied on donors to bring hope and happiness in the lives of people, for whom it was financially difficult to give treatment to their children. The noble mission was initiated by her late husband Dr Akhtar Rehman.
Prof Dr.Muhammad Azhar, who leads the team comprising Dr Zahida Ahmad, Dr Ayesha Aslam and Dr Maidah Hanif and other junior doctors, explained the complexity of the deformity and the treatment process.
Delay in treatment of the suffering children could lead to speech, behavioural and psychological problems making them vulnerable in society. Nearly 10,000 children with these deformities are born every year in Pakistan and alarmingly about 200,000 kids with these deformities are waiting to be operated upon.
Cleft lip occurs more frequently than cleft palate. Boys are more commonly affected by only cleft lip or cleft lip with cleft palate whereas girls suffer more from cleft palate. The causes of cleft lip and palate are still unknown; however, it is believed that it is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors or as a result of exposure to viruses and chemicals during the development of the fetus.
Problems in eating or feeding, ear infections, hearing loss, speech impairment, dental issues and social isolation are also issues associated with the such deformities.
As planned, the ICLAPA will provide general paediatric and mother and child care facilities at the planned hospital. It will also offer physical and speech therapy needed for the rehabilitation of cleft lip and palate patients."

Survey Shows Less Than Half of Americans Support NATO,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/survey-shows-less-than-half-of-americans-support-nato/ ,"A new survey shows that less than half of Americans support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an alliance originally designed to provide collective security against the Soviet Union, but now focused on Russia and non-state actors such as the Taliban and the Islamic State group.
The YouGov survey, released to commemorate the 70th anniversary of NATO, found that only 44 percent of Americans support the United States’ place in the agreement. That was down 3 percentage points from when the survey was conducted in 2017.
The poll also surveyed other NATO countries and found that support for the alliance had decreased significantly in the past two years among key European allies. Support for NATO dropped in Britain from 73 percent to 59 percent, in Germany from 68 percent to 54 percent, and in France from 54 percent to 39 percent.
YouGov said there is a generational divide in the United States over support for NATO, with 56 percent of the Baby Boomer generation, who grew up at the beginning of the Cold War, believing that the treaty continues to serve an important role in defending Western nations. Only 35 percent of Millennials and 33 percent of Generation X members support U.S. participation in the alliance.
There is also a political divide, according to the survey, with 60 percent of Democrats in the United States agreeing the alliance serves an important role, while only 38 percent of Republicans believe the same.
YouGov contacted more than 1,200 U.S. adults for the survey, which was conducted online, as well as more than 1,000 adults in several European countries.
NATO was formed to be an alliance of Western nations that would balance the military power of the Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe. After the former Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, some experts questioned what part the alliance would play in international security, but the return of Russian assertiveness under President Vladimir Putin has partly changed that.
NATO has expanded to include countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc, and has also added countries that are further away, such as Turkey and Greece.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the group, saying many NATO members do not spend enough on defense to fully meet their commitments under the agreement.

"Trump, Newsom Clash Over Illegal Immigration as President Visits California Wall Construction",tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/trump-newsom-clash-over-illegal-immigration-as-president-visits-california-wall-construction/ ,"by Fred Lucas
President Donald Trump was greeted Friday by a friendly crowd of border security officials in California, the state where he has the most political opposition and which has declared itself a “sanctuary state.”
He also toured the site of some border wall construction there.
Trump was briefed by officials from the U.S. Border Patrol in the Calexico, California, station near the border with Mexico.
“We expect to have close to 400 miles [of wall] done within two years from now. That’s a lot,” Trump said. “We love California. But those people wanted us to build a wall, and we got it built, including wall in San Diego, which is pretty much completed. It’s had a tremendous impact. The wall has had a tremendous impact.”
Trump said the country is “full” and insisted the immigration asylum laws must be changed.
“We have a system that is full. It’s just full. … There’s nothing we can do about it,” the president said. “ … The system is full. When it’s full, there’s nothing you can do. You have to say, ‘I’m sorry. We can’t take you.’”
California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized Trump’s call for changing the laws on asylum.
“Since our founding, this country has been a place of refuge—a safe haven for people fleeing tyranny, oppression, and violence,” Newsom said in a statement . “His words show a total disregard of the Constitution, our justice system, and what it means to be an American.”
Trump said the governor is out of touch with the security situation at the border.
“Gov. Newsom is honestly living in a different world, and that’s a very dangerous world he’s living in, and if he keeps living there, it’s lots of problems for the people of California. They don’t want that,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question.
“They want to be secure. They want to be safe, and not only asylum, but many other things. … When you have an asylum situation where rough, tough people with criminal records are asking for asylum, it doesn’t work that way.”
Trump declared a national emergency after Congress failed to provide full funding for the border wall. California is among 20 states suing to block the emergency declaration.
While later speaking in front of the wall, the president described it as an “anti-climb” wall. The newly constructed wall is see-through, and some portions are 30 feet tall.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection engaged in more than 100,000 border enforcement actions in March, the most actions in a single month in more than a decade, according to a White House statement.
That represented a 516% increase from enforcement actions in March 2017. Of the actions in March, 64% involved unaccompanied illegal immigrant children and family units. In February, 75,000 migrants were apprehended or deemed inadmissible at the border.
Trump said he doesn’t want to shut down the border, but said it only “would take a day” to do so.
“We’re going to shut it down if we have to,” he said.

Massachusetts Allocates Funds Supplementing Planned Parenthood Losses,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/massachusetts-allocates-funds-supplementing-planned-parenthood-losses/ ,"by Connor Maldo
The state of Massachusetts has approved funding to compensate abortion providers for the possible loss of federal contributions due to changes in federal policy.
This legislation responds to a new rule under the Trump administration that prohibits federally funded family planning offices from sharing space with an abortion provider.
The law approves $8 million in funding to prepare for the potential loss of federal support under Title X, the Associated Press reported.
Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said the bill “ensures women’s health providers across Massachusetts will continue to have access to these critical funds.” Prior to reaching the governor’s desk, the measure received wide support from the Democratic-led state legislature.
In 2017, Maryland passed a similar law, predicting the Trump administration rule, that allocated funding to protect Planned Parenthood, which became law when Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan refused to veto the bill.
Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, believes that a loss of federal funding could affect more than 75,000 women.
“The Trump/Pence administration is obsessed with Planned Parenthood, and not in a good way,” Childs-Roshak said. “They are obsessed with abortion.”
Pro-life advocates supported the new rule under the Trump administrating, with many arguing that the funds were a back channel to finance Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics.
Massachusetts is part of a coalition of 20 other states that are challenging the rule and its changes to Title X .

State Rep. London Lamar Reportedly Nominated to Chair Shelby County Democratic Party,tennesseestar.com,Chris Butler,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/state-rep-london-lamar-reportedly-nominated-to-chair-shelby-county-democratic-party/ ,"State Rep. London Lamar, D-Memphis, wants to chair the Shelby County Democratic Party, according to The Daily Memphian .
Someone recently nominated Lamar for the position, the paper went on to say.
“I decided to run because I was asked by several elected officials and Democratic officials to help us to put our party in a position to thrive in 2020,” The Daily Memphian reported.
“We had a landslide election in 2018. We wanted to make sure we could provide the county party leadership to continue to build on those victories – not only to maintain our power here in Memphis, but to be in a position to lead the state to a Democratic win in 2020.”
Lamar reportedly revived the Shelby County Young Democrats organization and is currently finishing up her term as chair of the Tennessee Young Democrats organization, the website said.
Lamar is one of two contenders for the position, The Daily Memphian reported.
As The Tennessee Star reported last year , Lamar generated international attention after she declared in November, shortly after her election to the Tennessee House of Representatives that “Tennessee is a racist state,” as The Tennessee Star reported :
… Lamar live streamed a 15-minute rant on Facebook and said, among other things, Tennessee is a racist state and full of uneducated Republicans. She also reprimanded white men for wanting to keep more of the money they earn and suggested allowing felons to vote will help elect more Democrats.
Lamar later said she merely summed up the thoughts and feelings of her constituents when she scolded white Tennessee Republicans as supposedly racist and uneducated. She removed the video from Facebook a few days later after it got international media attention she apparently didn’t want.
In January, as reported , the state’s Registry of Election Finance fined Lamar for filing her disclosures late. Lamar was originally supposed to pay $8,175 in fines, as registry officials decreed in November. Lamar reportedly told registry officials this was her “first rodeo.” But, because of her inexperience with such matters, registry officials reduced her fine to $300.

Joe Biden Jokes About Accusations While Hugging Boy,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/joe-biden-jokes-about-accusations-while-hugging-boy/ ,"by Neetu Chandak
Former Vice President Joe Biden cracked a joke in reference to his inappropriate conduct allegations while hugging a boy at a labor union conference in Washington, D.C., Friday.
Biden wrapped his arm around a boy onstage as he was speaking to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).
“By the way, he gave me permission to touch him,” Biden said.
Biden also hugged the union’s president, Lonnie Stephenson, before the child.
“I just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,” Biden said, The New York Times reported.
Former Democratic Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores accused Biden on March 29 of sniffing her hair and kissing her head without her permission in 2014.
A second woman , Amy Lappos, claimed Biden inappropriately touched her during a 2009 political fundraiser in Connecticut.
“It wasn’t sexual, but he did grab me by the head,” Lappos said Monday to The Hartford Courant . “He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.”
A total of seven women have come forward against Biden’s alleged acts so far, according to The Washington Post Thursday.
President Donald Trump tweeted a video meme of Biden Thursday.

Commentary: Trump Follows in the Footsteps of King Cyrus,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/commentary-trump-is-cyrus/ ,"by Larry Greenfield
Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, found inspiration in the writings of Xenophon, a contemporary of Socrates, who chronicled the life of the great Persian, King Cyrus, whose vast empire was known for toleration of religious minorities and for demanding no single state religion.
For his military prowess and political statesmanship, Cyrus is the most admired ancient king, a hero to Alexander the Great, future Greco-Roman leaders, and philosophers of both the European and American Enlightenment.
Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, and modern Iran’s last Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, also considered Cyrus a model.
When U.S. President Harry S. Truman recognized Israel’s independence on May 14, 1948, over the objections of his State Department, he entered Jewish history. Soon after he left office, in November 1953, Truman met with leaders at the Jewish Theological Seminary, accompanied by his former Army buddy, business partner, and lifelong good friend Eddie Jacobson. Jacobson introduced Truman: “This is the man who helped create the state of Israel.” Truman asserted, “What do you mean, ‘helped to create’? I am Cyrus. I am Cyrus.”
Truman was honest, not immodest. Though he lacked a college education, as a boy he had studied the Hebrew Bible (known to him as the Christian Old Testament) which celebrated Cyrus II (“the Great”) for defeating the Babylonian empire in 539 B.C. and subsidizing the return to Jerusalem of the Jewish community that been held captive in Babylon for 70 years.
Cyrus’s successors allowed the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and city walls. Throughout the two-and-a-half millennia of historical difficulties that followed, Cyrus has been the symbol of the righteous gentile ruler who promoted the return of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and promoted Jewish security against enemies.
Today, President Donald Trump has established himself as another in the long line of pro-Israel American leaders, with a record that history will record as among the best.
First, Trump quickly got the U.S.-Israel special alliance back on track after the extraordinary hostility of his predecessor. Barack Obama, mentored by a range of anti-Israel thinkers including Edward Said, Rashid Khalidi, Ali Abunimah, and Pastor Jeremiah Wright, sought to reverse the warm political goodwill expressed to Israel by President George W. Bush.
Obama asserted it was time for “daylight” between the United States and Israel. He pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on land settlement policy, including building apartments in Jerusalem. Obama advocated and then immediately reversed his position that Jerusalem was Israel’s capital. He called for an Israeli return to the 1967 armistice lines, widely considered indefensible borders. Speaking in Cairo, Obama pandered to Arabs by equating Palestinian demands with Israeli statehood, which he claimed resulted from the Holocaust, rather than 3,000 years of Jewish history.
Ignoring wide objection in Israel, Obama tilted toward the Iran, which threatens to annihilate Israel, conducts aggressive regional terrorism, and remains at war with the United States. In the political battle over the Iran nuclear deal, Obama disclosed secret Israeli military actions in Syria and hinted that American Jews were dual loyalists.
Finally, opening the door to the deteriorating relationship between the American Left and Israel, Obama crossed the line to support an anti-Israel resolution at the United Nations.
Acting quickly, President Trump rejected the flawed Iran deal and re-imposed sanctions on the Iranians, hitting them in the pocket and challenging their hegemonic ambitions.
Trump’s administration consistently has combated the anti-Israel posture of so many at the United Nations. The president also signed the Taylor Force Act which prevents U.S. financial assistance to the Palestinians until they cease payments to the families of terrorists, and he closed the PLO mission in Washington, D.C. for failing to offer sincere efforts at peacemaking.
Finally, in moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, and now recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, President Trump has powerfully put into diplomatic and strategic deeds his own heartfelt words: “My administration will always stand in solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters, and we will always stand strong with our cherished friend and partner, the state of Israel.”
