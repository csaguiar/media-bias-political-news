Boeing rejects claim of 'shoddy production' at Dreamliner factory,www.nbcnews.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/boeing-rejects-claim-shoddy-production-dreamliner-factory-n996861,"Boeing Co. sharply denied published allegations that ""shoddy production"" and oversight at its North Charleston, South Carolina, factory threatens the safety of the company's long-haul 787. The report, published Saturday by The New York Times , comes as Boeing is the subject of multiple investigations into the certification process for a different aircraft, the 737 Max series, after 346 people were killed in crashes of a Lion Air flight in October and an Ethiopian Airlines flight last month .
In a communiqué to employees, Brad Zaback, site leader of the South Carolina facility and general manager of Boeing's 787 program, said The Times distorted information and rehashed old stories ""that have long ago been put to rest.""
Boeing denies allegations of 'shoddy production' at Dreamliner factory April 22, 2019 02:14 The Times reported Saturday that Boeing ignored and in some cases sought retribution against employees who complained that the plant turned a blind eye to problems created by what the newspaper characterized as the company's rush to produce the planes as quickly as possible.
Citing internal emails, corporate and federal documents and interviews with current and former employees, The Times reported that the plant valued production speed over quality, leading to problems like manufacturing defects and potentially dangerous debris left in completed planes.

The report examined only the South Carolina facility, and The Times acknowledged that ""there is no evidence that the problems in South Carolina have led to any major safety incidents.""
Zaback, who called the Times report ""offensive,"" responded by telling employees that the planes undergo ""rigorous quality inspections"" and ""perform exceptionally well in service for our valued airplane customers around the world.""
""It's unfortunate and disappointing that the New York Times chose to publish this misleading story,"" he said, saying the company invited The Times to ""visit Boeing South Carolina once they contacted us, so that they could see first-hand the great work that is done here.""
""They declined this invitation,"" Zaback wrote.
Danielle Rhoades Ha, The Times' vice president for communications, said Sunday night that Boeing made its offer of a tour on Friday and that the newspaper declined to delay Saturday's scheduled publication. She said the company declined to make executives at the plant available for on-the-record interviews.

Ukraine elections: Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy declares victory in presidential race,www.nbcnews.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-elections-comedian-volodymyr-zelenskiy-declares-victory-presidential-race-n996776,"Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy won Sunday's runoff election in Ukraine, ousting incumbent President Petro Poroshenko in a landslide. With over 90 percent of the ballots counted, Zelenskiy had 73 percent of the vote with Poroshenko at just under 25 percent.
Zelenskiy, 41, also took the first round of the election on March 31 .
The former entertainer and political novice recently starred in a popular TV series, ""Servant of the People,"" in which he played a history teacher who is elected president after his rant about government corruption goes viral.
Zeleskiy declared victory Sunday night at his campaign headquarters.
""I'm not yet officially the president, but as a citizen of Ukraine, I can say to all countries in the post-Soviet Union look at us. Anything is possible!"" he said.
Related News News A brain drain is devastating Ukraine Zelenskiy is now poised to take over the leadership of a country on the frontline of the West's standoff with Russia following Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine.
An emotional Poroshenko conceded defeat to his supporters, some of whom were crying.
Poroshenko said on social media he thought Zelenskiy's win would spark celebrations in the Kremlin.
""They believe that with a new inexperienced Ukrainian president, Ukraine could be quickly returned to Russia's orbit of influence,"" he wrote.
Ukrainian presidential candidates tested for drugs, alcohol April 5, 2019 01:30 Throughout his campaign, Zelenskiy has stressed that he's unmarred by political “filth,” and vowed to change the system.
But his outlined policies were largely vague and short on detail.
Nevertheless, his message of change resonated with voters across the war-torn country with a flailing economy.
“It’s very important that this voting is based on reason,” said Poroshenko, while casting his vote accompanied by his grandson earlier Sunday. “It might be fun and hilarious at first, but I don’t want it to get painful later,” he added, in what appeared to be a reference to Zelenskiy’s comedy career.
The two clashed in a much-publicized debate at the nation’s largest sports arena Friday, hurling insults and attacking each other’s vision for Ukraine’s future.
Asked by the moderators to pose a ""yes or no"" question to each other, Zelenskiy didn’t hesitate, looking Poroshenko in the eye and saying: “Are you not ashamed?”

SERGEI SUPINSKY / AFP - Getty Images Poroshenko’s response, muted by loud cheering from the comedian’s supporters, was — no. “I am proud of Ukraine and the last five years,” the former president said.
But many Ukrainians don’t share that view. Despite his uncompromising efforts to keep the country on a pro-European path, Poroshenko has been accused of reluctance to tackle rampant corruption, a failure to reinvigorate the economy and an inability to end the war with pro-Russian separatists in the east — a five-year-long conflict that he promised to resolve in just two weeks before he swept to power in 2014.
“I am the result of your mistakes and promises,” Zelenskiy told Poroshenko during Friday night’s debate. “I am not your opponent,” he said, pointing a finger at the president. “I am your sentence.”
Zelenskiy has pledged to keep Ukraine on a pro-Western course, but has sounded less emphatic than Poroshenko about possible plans for the country of 42 million people to one day join the European Union and NATO.
Related World news World news No policies, no problem: A comedian's election success is latest warning for old-school politicians “Zelenskiy’s presidency ushers in a period of major political realignment in Ukraine,” Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, told NBC News. He added that Zelenskiy will need to show from day one that he is “a radical break” from the past.
“I would expect Zelenskiy going after corrupt officials as a very popular move,"" he said.
There have been questions raised around what fate may befall Poroshenko after he loses the election — especially after Zelenskiy said that the former president might have to “meet with a prosecutor” during Friday’s debate.
Despite the loss, Poroshenko said he planned to stay in politics.
As the new commander in chief, Zelenskiy will have to deal with the increasingly belligerent actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Poroshenko declared martial law in parts of the country in November after Russia fired at, rammed and then captured three Ukrainian ships.
Ukraine military forces preparing for potential showdown at sea with Russia Feb. 18, 2019 01:14 Zelenskiy has consistently said he is ready for direct talks with Putin, but will ""never sacrifice our territories and people"" — a point he reiterated in a recent interview.
“Zelenskiy’s victory may be interpreted in Moscow [in] that the high point of anti-Russian politics in Ukraine has passed,” Trenin said.
But Zelenskiy will face challenges in the months ahead.
Related News News No joke: A comedian leads the presidential race in a country in Putin's sights Kiev-based political analyst Valentyn Gladkykh told NBC News that Zelenskiy will now have to deal with a parliament, in which he does not have his own party and in which Poroshenko’s faction dominates.
Gladkykh says he will be hard-pressed to make friends with the lawmakers as he prepares for parliamentary elections in October, all while trying not to lose the support of his voters.
“Poroshenko, if he doesn’t do anything stupid after losing the election, will hand over power and start preparing for parliamentary elections, trying to destroy Zelenskiy’s approval rating, with the help of his faction in parliament and people in government,"" Gladkykh said.

"'Game of Thrones' episode two recap: Families reconcile, warriors reconnect and a knight gets her due",www.nbcnews.com,Ani Bundel,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/game-thrones-episode-two-recap-families-reconcile-warriors-reconnect-knight-ncna996876,"It may seem hard to remember now, amid HBO’s hysterical season eight spoiler lockdown , but “Game of Thrones” didn’t become the cultural phenomenon it is today solely because of plot twists. Sure, moments like Ned’s beheading and the Red Wedding made for big headlines and social media reactions. But the show’s greatness is really tied to its ability to build drama slowly but steadily over the course of each season. Like AMC’s “Mad Men,” “Game of Thrones” has allowed fans to luxuriate in character interactions and development. And in the second episode of the final season — the final TV hour before its massive battle next week — the show refused to hurry. Revealing once again the vision of its showrunners, ""A Knight of Seven Kingdoms"" included scenes like one dedicated to characters simply sitting around a fire and drinking. This confidence makes it one of best episodes of the last few years.
(Spoilers below.)
Like AMC’s “Mad Men,” “Game of Thrones” has allowed fans to luxuriate in character interactions and development.
“Game of Thrones” maintained a slower pace in its early seasons in part because of the sheer size and scale of the world depicted in George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” novels. Westeros was big, as the opening credits emphasized every week, and the faux-medieval society didn’t have modern modes of transportation. There was one major highway, the King’s Road, and anyone who didn’t want to travel on it was stuck hiking through forests, across plains and forging rivers. This meant a lot of groups spent a lot of time simply trying to get from one area to the next, whether the destination was King’s Landing, Winterfell or other points east. ( Only the scheming Littlefinger ever seemed to be exempt from the slog, magically turning up wherever required.) Along the way, these characters forged ties that would bind them, sometimes in ways invisible to the outside world.
Seasons six and seven were too focused on wrapping things up to spend much time with the characters. This was most obvious in the show’s sudden timeline problems, which critics complained about last season . For instance, Arya’s journey from The Twins, where the Red Wedding was held, to Braavos took 12 episodes, lasting from season three’s finale to season five’s premiere. Her return trip happened magically between the finale of season six and the cold open of season seven’s premiere. In another show, such compressions in storytelling would not have garnered much notice. Of course, this isn’t any other show. And viewers knew that skipping the journey meant they were also losing the intimate moments these journeys created; moments that often planted the seeds of future plot points.
Related Opinion Opinion 'Game of Thrones' season eight premiere reconnects fans with the pilot that started it all This week’s episode also didn’t include any road trips. Winter is here, the Night King and his Army of the Dead are on their way and road travel is not currently advised by Westeros weathermen. Yet plenty of bonding happened just the same. Some of this bonding was the result of long overdue reunions, including between Jaime Lannister and his brother Tyrion. Jaime also got a face to face with Bran, where they discussed how their respective paths molded them into the men they are today.
Other important interactions included first-time sit-downs, as when Daenerys attempted to clear the air between her and Sansa after last week’s awkwardness. On the one hand, like good in-laws-to-be, they found common ground talking about their shared love for Jon Snow — who last week was revealed to be a family member to both. On the other, the meeting made it clear that Sansa was not about to bow to a Targaryen ruler without a lot of persuasion, something Daenerys clearly hadn’t anticipated. No one said the relationship between the Starks and Targaryens would be easy, but no one told them it would be this hard either.
No one said the relationship between the Starks and Targaryens would be easy, but no one told them it would be this hard either.
Such interactions filled the hour, with little dramatic action but a whole lot of emotional complexity. Characters fell into bed together, cementing relationships long in the making. Families estranged for years reconciled, knowing this might be their last chance. And in the hour’s most moving moment, Brienne of Tarth was finally made a Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, just in time for her to give her life for the realm. In a series where women find themselves on the short end of the misogyny stick far too often, seeing Brienne honored and recognized by her peers was something every fan of the show should cheer.
Showrunners also made several references to the original books — something the show hasn’t been able to do since, well, it ran out of book material a few seasons back. This hour included nods to not one but two specific moments from the pages of “A Song of Ice and Fire,” with Tormund telling the story of his “Giantsbane” moniker. The show also worked in one of the songs that populates the fantasy series, cut from an earlier season’s streamlined plotline, as the characters prepare for a battle most won’t likely survive.
From here on out, “Game of Thrones” will be in its final stages, as the fights to determine control of the Iron Throne and the world of Westeros are decided. But it was good to see the series slow down one last time, as fans prepare to say goodbye to their favorite characters forever.

Sri Lanka blocks social media after Easter Sunday bombings,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/sri-lanka-blocks-social-media-after-easter-sunday-bombings-n996886,"Sri Lankan authorities have blocked most social media services in the country following the Easter Sunday attacks that killed more than 200 people , a group that monitors internet censorship said. The NetBlocks observatory said it detected an intentional nationwide blackout of popular services, including Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat and Viber.
Sri Lankan officials said they were temporarily blocking social media to curtail the spread of false information and ease tensions.
The defense ministry said the shutdown would extend until the government concludes its investigation into the bomb blasts that rocked churches, luxury hotels and other sites.
NetBlocks cautioned that such post-attack blackouts are often ineffective.
""What we've seen is that when social media is shut down, it creates a vacuum of information that's readily exploited by other parties,"" said Alp Toker, executive director of the London-based group. ""It can add to the sense of fear and can cause panic.""
Sri Lankan officials inspect St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo, north of Colombo, after multiple explosions hit churches and hotels across the island nation on Sunday. Officials said they temporarily blocked social media, including popular services Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat and Viber, to curtail the spread of false information. The group said its monitoring of Sri Lankan internet connectivity found no disruptions to the fundamental infrastructure of the internet, meaning the blackout was directed at specific services. Some social media outlets, such as Twitter, appeared unaffected, but the blockage affected popular messaging services.
""That's going to be a problem for people trying to communicate with friends and family,"" Toker said.
Some internet users are circumventing the social media blocks by using a virtual private network, which masks the location of a computer, Toker said.
It isn't the first time Sri Lanka has blocked social media. The government imposed a weeklong ban in March 2018 because of concerns that WhatsApp and other platforms were being used to fan anti-Muslim violence in the country's central region.
An analysis by Sri Lankan researcher and author Yudhanjaya Wijeratne of thousands of Facebook posts made during last year's ban found that many Sri Lankans simply found ways around it. Wijeratne has recommended narrower and more ""technically challenging"" approaches to curbing hate speech, such as better detection and strengthening local laws.
Facebook, which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has struggled in recent years to combat the use of its platforms to incite violence and spread hate messages and political propaganda in countries including India, Myanmar and the United States.
The company said in a statement Sunday that it has been working to support first responders and law enforcement in Sri Lanka and identify and remove content that violates company standards.
""We are aware of the government's statement regarding the temporary blocking of social media platforms,"" the company said. ""People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time.""
Google didn't respond to a request for comment about the disruption to its YouTube service in Sri Lanka. Requests for comment made to messaging services Snap and Viber were not returned Sunday.

Beyond the Green New Deal: Another climate cause is dividing Democrats,www.nbcnews.com,Benjy Sarlin,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/beyond-green-new-deal-another-climate-cause-dividing-democrats-n996541,"WASHINGTON — Democrats running for president have debated the Green New Deal for months, but a separate demand from climate advocates to aggressively restrict fossil fuel extraction is exposing new fissures within the field of primary candidates. unveiled a plan for public lands last week headlined by a moratorium on fossil fuel exploration. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called for a similar ban as well.
""Any serious effort to address climate change must include public lands  —  fossil fuel extraction in these areas is responsible for nearly a quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions,"" Warren said in a Medium post outlining her plan.
The move drew cheers from activists in the ""keep it in the ground"" movement, a coalition of environmental activists who seek to block mining, drilling and fracking operations in order to push the economy toward renewable energy more quickly.
How oil and gas projects could be detrimental to the environment April 12, 2019 07:16 ""Keep it in the ground"" supporters draw on the same arguments as the Green New Deal: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world has only a limited window to slash greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are likely to head off a dangerous increase in global temperatures.
But the two causes, while closely related, are not identical. The Green New Deal resolution co-authored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., called for sweeping investments in renewable energy, but kept silent on how to regulate fossil fuels. That omission prompted some criticism from groups like Greenpeace , which praised Warren and Sanders for their plans.
The climate advocacy group 350.org is keeping a scorecard for 2020 candidates that grades them separately on their support for the Green New Deal and for ""keep it in the ground"" policies. ""In order to actually achieve a Green New Deal, you have to transition off fossil fuels,"" Thanu Yakupitiyage, U.S. communications manager for 350.org, told NBC News. ""It's implicit in the deal.""
Sens. Warren, Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., have signed onto the ""Keep It In The Ground Act,"" a bill by Sen. Jeff Merkley that would block new oil, coal and gas leases on public land and waters. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who is running on a climate-focused platform, has said he supports it as well. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is backing a separate bill with Sanders that seeks ""a mandatory fossil fuel phase-out"" in the electricity sector by 2050. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has tweeted that she opposes drilling on public land.
The issue is set to be a major divide in the general election. President Donald Trump has regularly disparaged climate science and renewable energy technology, while pushing for an expansion of coal, oil and gas and rolling back Obama-era regulations. Republicans have made the Green New Deal an early focus of their attacks.
But even among Democrats and climate-minded policymakers, keeping it in the ground is far from a default position.
Some argue natural gas, a booming industry in recent years, is an important component of any climate strategy because it displaces energy sources like coal that produce more pollution. On the political front, some Democrats worry about ceding ground on economic policy to Republicans, who cite oil and gas production as a source of job growth.
""I see these attempts to ban production of oil and gas on public lands more as a campaign ploy than a serious climate change strategy,"" said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate aide to President Bill Clinton and strategic adviser at the centrist Progressive Policy Institute.
Within the 2020 Democratic field, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has made his ties to the oil and gas industry a key part of his campaign message, setting up a contrast with candidates like Warren and Sanders. Dubbed ""Frackenlooper"" by environmental critics in the state, he cites his work negotiating with gas companies to regulate methane leaks, a major source of climate emissions, as a national model.
""If climate change policy becomes synonymous in the U.S. psyche with higher utility bills, rising taxes and lost jobs, we will have missed our shot — and we might not get another one before it's too late,"" he wrote in an op-ed last month.
Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who recently announced a jobs-focused presidential campaign, has also praised the ""immense climate-related benefits and economic benefits"" of natural gas, a growing industry in his state.
Others are still working out their approach. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, faced criticism for voting to lift a decades-old ban on oil exports, which environmental groups worried would discourage countries from transitioning to clean energy. O’Rourke's campaign defended the move , arguing oil production faced stricter environmental regulations in America, but also said he now opposes lifting the ban under Trump.

Rep. Seth Moulton is latest Democrat to enter 2020 field,www.nbcnews.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rep-seth-moulton-latest-democrat-enter-2020-field-n996881,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., became the latest Democrat to enter the 2020 presidential race Monday, launching a presidential campaign focused on national security. ""I'm running because I'm a patriot. Because I believe in this country. And because I've never wanted to sit on the sidelines when it comes to serving it,"" Moulton said on ABC News' ""Good Morning America."" ""I'm going talk about patriotism, about security, about service. These are issues Democrats too long have ceded to Republicans.""
A 40-year-old Marine combat veteran who earned a Bronze Star in Iraq, Moulton's stature has been rising since he won a seat in Congress in 2014 by defeating a long-time Democratic incumbent in a primary.
Rep. Seth Moulton launches 2020 bid April 22, 2019 01:12 “Decades of division and corruption have broken our democracy and robbed Americans of their voice,” Moulton said in his announcement video. ""It's all led to an administration that's turned away from our values and is shredding our moral authority.”
I’m running for President to build a strong and safe country, create the jobs of the future, and elect leaders we can be proud of. Join our mission: https://t.co/9caxN9579q . https://t.co/Pyr6IRNq5e
— Seth Moulton (@sethmoulton) April 22, 2019 Moulton highlighted gun control, climate change and national security as a trio of issues he wants to address.
""I'm running because we have to beat Donald Trump, and I want us to beat Donald Trump because I love this country,"" he said. ""We've never been a country that gets everything right. But we're a country that, at our best, thinks that we might. I'd be honored if you joined me in this mission.""
Moulton may be best known, however, for his opposition to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. His call for new leadership in internal House elections early this year cost him some support back home in his congressional district north of Boston, which includes Salem and the famous fishing town of Gloucester. He later came around to support Pelosi.
Moulton has been traveling to early primary and caucus states as he prepared for a presidential run. This week, he'll visit all four of them again and participate in a service project in each, something he has long made a part of his campaigns.
Moulton is the 19th candidate to enter the very crowded Democratic field . He's hardly a household name and may struggle to stand out from the eight other male candidates.
Related Politics Biden and Bernie lead early polls, but don't place bets yet But his advisers think the primary contest is still wide open and believe voters want a fresh, younger voice who is willing to break with their own party if need be. And his team argues he can carve a place for himself in the field by focusing on national security, which none of the other candidates have prioritized thus far.
He’s used his position in the House to recruit and support veteran candidacies with his PAC, which contributed $4.3 million in last year’s midterms.
Unlike most other young veterans in politics, Moulton joined the military before the September 11 terror attacks and led one of the first platoons to enter Baghdad during the initial invasion.
The other veterans in the 2020 field are Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.
Moulton holds three degrees from Harvard — including an MBA and masters of public policy — and attended the elite Phillips Academy prep school in Andover, Mass.
Ideologically, Moulton is progressive on many issues, coming out for the Green New Deal and abolishing the Electoral College and Senate filibuster before some other candidates. But he’s temperamentally considered more moderate.

Rajitha Senaratne, the country's health minister and a spokesman for its Cabinet, said international intelligence agencies had informed Sri Lankan counterparts on April 4 that churches and tourist destinations were being targeted. Five days later, police were given the names of suspects behind the plot.

Senaratne blamed National Thowheed Jamath, a local Islamist group, for the attacks.
Blasts occurred at St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo; St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo, a Catholic majority town north of Colombo; and a church in the eastern town of Batticaloa.
The targeted hotels included the Shangri-La Colombo, Kingsbury Hotel and Cinnamon Grand Colombo — all popular with foreign tourists.
Around 22 million live in Sri Lanka. Around 70 percent of the population is Buddhist, 12.6 percent is Hindu, 9.7 percent is Muslim and 7.6 percent is Christian, according to the country's 2012 census.

Kodikara / AFP - Getty Images Mathew Schmalz, a religious studies professor at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, said there isn't a history of tension between Christians and Muslims on the island nation.
However, he said, religious extremism among the Buddhist community has been on the rise in the decade following the end of Sri Lanka's civil war.
""I think extreme Buddhism has tried to fill the void in Sri Lankan society for a sense of identity,"" Schmalz said, adding that it may have had a ""domino effect"" and prompted extremism among other groups.
Both Muslims and Christians have been subject to persecution, which is seen as inconsistent with the country's identity, according to Schmalz. There have even been demonstrations against the sale of halal food that adheres to Islamic dietary restrictions.
The group blamed by Sri Lanka's government for the attack has been linked to vandalism of Buddhist statues in the past, according Frederica Jansz, an expert witness specializing in Sri Lankan asylum cases in Britain's courts.
Jansz added that the group had never previously been implicated in any deaths.

NASA astronauts Steven Smith and John Grunsfeld perform a spacewalk during a December 1999 mission of the space shuttle Discovery to service the Hubble Space Telescope.
Hubble flew into orbit on April 24, 1990, aboard Discovery. The first major optical telescope to be placed in space, Hubble is currently located about 340 miles above Earth’s surface where it completes 15 orbits per day — one approximately every 95 minutes. The satellite moves at the speed of about five miles per second, fast enough to travel across the United States in about 10 minutes.
Here's a small sampling of some of the dazzling images captured by Hubble that have changed the way we view the universe. — NASA/JSC / via AP Share Southern Crab Nebula
In celebration of the 29th anniversary since Hubble's launch, astronomers captured this festive, colorful image of the tentacled Southern Crab Nebula (not to be confused with the Crab Nebula)
This nebula, a giant cloud of dust and gas, is officially known as Hen 2-104. It's located several thousand light-years from Earth in the southern hemisphere constellation of Centaurus. It appears to have two nested hourglass-shaped structures that were sculpted by a whirling pair of stars in a binary system. The duo consists of an aging red giant star and a burned-out star, a white dwarf. The red giant is shedding its outer layers. Some of this ejected material is attracted by the gravity of the companion white dwarf. — NASA / ESA / STScI Lagoon Nebula
Hubble shows this vast stellar nursery in unprecedented detail.
At the center of the photo, a monster young star 200,000 times brighter than our sun is blasting powerful ultraviolet radiation and hurricane-like stellar winds, carving out a fantasy landscape of ridges, cavities, and mountains of gas and dust. This region epitomizes a typical, raucous stellar nursery full of birth and destruction. — Space Telescope Science Institute Office of Public Outreach / NASA, ESA, and STScI Share Pillars of Creation
Hubble Space Telescope has taken many breathtaking images of the universe, but one snapshot stands out from the rest: the iconic view of the so-called ""Pillars of Creation."" The jaw-dropping photo, taken in 1995, revealed never-before-seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young, massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, or M16.
Hubble revisited the famous pillars in 2015, providing astronomers with the sharper and wider view seen here.

This group of five galaxies are known as Stephan's Quintet.
Three of the galaxies have distorted shapes, elongated spiral arms, and long, gaseous tidal tails containing myriad star clusters, proof of their close encounters. But studies have shown that group member NGC 7320, in the upper left, is actually a foreground galaxy that is about seven times closer to Earth than the rest of the group. — NASA/ESA/Hubble SM4 ERO Team / via AP Share Pismis 24
The star cluster Pismis 24 sits in the core of the large emission nebula NGC 6357.
Part of the nebula is ionized by the youngest (blue) heavy stars emitting intense ultraviolet radiation, heating the gas surrounding the cluster, and creating a bubble in NGC 6357. — NASA/ESA, Jesus Maiz Apellaniz - Instituto de Astrofisica de Andaluc?a / via AP Share Carina Nebula

This cluster of young stars — one to two million years old — is located about 20,000 light-years from Earth.
The central region, containing the Westerlund 2 star cluster, blends visible-light data and near-infrared exposures. The surrounding region is composed of visible-light observations. — NASA/ESA Hubble / via EPA Share Crab Nebula
The Crab Nebula, the result of a supernova noted by Earth-bound chroniclers in 1054 A.D., is filled with mysterious filaments. Not only are the filaments tremendously complex, but also they appear to have less mass than those expelled in the original supernova and a higher speed than expected from a free explosion.
The Crab Nebula spans about 10 light-years. In the nebula's center lies a pulsar: a neutron star that emits electromagnetic radiation. The Crab Pulsar rotates about 30 times each second. — NASA, ESA, Allison Loll/Jeff Hester - Arizona State University / via AP Share Bubble Nebula
An enormous bubble is blown into space by a super-hot, massive star in this image of NGC 7635, or the Bubble Nebula.
The Bubble Nebula is 7 light-years across — about one-and-a-half times the distance from our sun to its nearest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri — and resides 7,100 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia. — NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team Share Horsehead Nebula
Looking like an apparition rising from whitecaps of interstellar foam, the iconic Horsehead Nebula has graced astronomy books ever since its discovery more than a century ago. The nebula is a favorite target for amateur and professional astronomers.
This image shows the region in infrared light, which has longer wavelengths than visible light and can pierce through the dusty material that usually obscures the nebula's inner regions in visible light. — NASA/ESA/ Hubble Heritage Team / via AP Share Ring Nebula
Messier 57, or the Ring Nebula, is a planetary nebula, the glowing remains of a sun-like star.
The tiny white dot in the center of the nebula is the star’s hot core, called a white dwarf. M57 is about 2,000 light-years away in the constellation Lyra, and is best observed during August. Discovered by the French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix in 1779, the Ring Nebula has an apparent magnitude of 8.8 and can be spotted with moderately sized telescopes. — NASA/ESA, C. Robert O'Dell (Vanderbilt University) / via AP Share Planetary nebula NGC 5189
Hubble's website compares this bright gaseous nebula to a festive ""glass-blown holiday ornament with a glowing ribbon,"" but some see a menacing skull instead.
Planetary nebulae represent the final brief stage in the life of a medium-sized star like our sun. While consuming the last of the fuel in its core, the dying star expels a large portion of its outer envelope. This material then becomes heated by the radiation from the stellar remnant and radiates, producing glowing clouds of gas that can show complex structures, as the ejection of mass from the star is uneven in both time and direction. — NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team Share Cosmic Caterpillar
Harsh winds from extremely bright stars are blasting ultraviolet radiation at this ""wannabe"" star and sculpting a light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust. The culprits are 65 of the hottest, brightest known stars, classified as O-type stars, located 15 light-years away from the knot, toward the right edge of the image.
The caterpillar-shaped knot, called IRAS 20324+4057, is a protostar, a very young star that is still in the process of collecting material from an envelope of gas surrounding it. — NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team Share Butterfly Nebula
The bright clusters and nebulae of planet Earth's night sky are often named after flowers or insects. Though its wingspan covers over 3 light-years, NGC 6302 is no exception.
With an estimated surface temperature of about 250,000 degrees C, the dying central star of this particular planetary nebula has become exceptionally hot, shining brightly in ultraviolet light but hidden from direct view by a dense torus of dust.
The star was once about five times the mass of the sun. — NASA/ESA/Hubble SM4 ERO Team / via AP Share Tarantula Nebula
Several million young stars are vying for attention in this image of a raucous stellar breeding ground in 30 Doradus, located in the heart of the Tarantula Nebula. Early astronomers nicknamed the nebula because its glowing filaments resemble spider legs.
30 Doradus is the brightest star-forming region visible in a neighboring galaxy and home to the most massive stars ever seen. The nebula resides 170,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small, satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. No known star-forming region in our galaxy is as large or as prolific as 30 Doradus. — NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team Galaxies galore

Wearing protective helmets, employees evacuate their office building after an earthquake in Manila on Monday. Aaron Favila / AP Breaking News Emails April 22, 2019, 11:10 AM UTC / Updated April 22, 2019, 5:17 PM UTC By Associated Press MANILA, Philippines — A strong earthquake killed three people and trapped several others Monday in a collapsed building that housed a supermarket in a northern Philippine province, where an international airport terminal was closed due to damage, officials said. Mayor Condralito dela Cruz of Porac, a town in Pampanga Province, north of Manila, said rescuers pulled two survivors from the collapsed building, where other trapped people could be heard screaming for help as rescuers struggled to save them. An Associated Press photographer saw a third survivor and the body of a woman being extricated by rescuers from the rubble late Monday. The rescue work picked up pace after four cranes arrived at the scene, where Red Cross volunteers, police and soldiers helped out. A child was one of two dead people pulled out from the rubble earlier in the day. The leg of one of the two survivors had to be amputated to extricate him, Porac Councilor Maynard Lapid said, adding that at least eight trapped people could be heard pleading for help at one point. ""One of the trapped was seen waving for help from behind a glass window but we cannot see him now,"" Lapid told The Associated Press by telephone. At least 31 people remained unaccounted for at the collapsed Chuzon supermarket, based on a rough accounting of its employees, although some could have been elsewhere when the earthquake struck, Lapid said. The four-story building crashed down when the 6.1 magnitude quake shook Pampanga as well as several other provinces and the capital, Manila, on the main northern island of Luzon. The quake was caused by movement in a local fault at a depth of 8 miles near the northwestern town of Castillejos in Zambales province, said Renato Solidum, who heads the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. ""People told me that the ground moved like waves,"" Lapid said. Pampanga Gov. Lilia Pineda told DZMM radio that she had received reports that the quake left at least eight people dead in her province, a rice-growing agricultural region, but could not provide details. Cellphone signals were erratic in the province. The quake also damaged an airport terminal at Clark Freeport, a former U.S. Air Force base, and an old Roman Catholic church in Pampanga, and caused cracks in highways and bridges, Pineda and other officials said. Clark airport was closed temporarily because of damaged check-in counters, ceilings and parts of the departure area, airport official Jaime Melo said, adding that seven people were slightly injured and more than 100 flights were canceled. In Manila, hundreds of office workers dashed out of buildings in panic, some wearing hard hats, and residents ran out of houses. Dozens of aftershocks were recorded. The Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because of its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" a seismically active arc of volcanos and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. A magnitude 7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people in the northern Philippines in 1990."

San Diego Police were called to Mt. Everest Academy, where a nondenominational service was being held Sunday afternoon, and found church members had already managed to disarm the woman. The gun was not loaded, and no one was harmed, police said. The building was also swept for bombs and police found nothing. Anna Conkey, 31, was arrested and charged with displaying a firearm at a school, making a false bomb threat, assault, disturbing a religious meeting and child cruelty, according to jail records. The baby and the suspect's 5-year-old daughter, who was discovered at a different location after the incident, were taken into protective custody. Conkey was a former intern and freelance digital producer for NBC San Diego, according to the station, which reported she was also in the U.S. Navy. She had sent her former employer an email news tip five minutes before entering the church, according to NBC San Diego . ""There’s a woman claiming to be the Messiah, saying she was sent to blow up the foundation of the Church — she’s got a gun and a child is involved.

Vaping teens exposed to as much nicotine as tobacco smokers but don't know it,www.nbcnews.com,Linda Carroll,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/vaping-teens-exposed-much-nicotine-tobacco-smokers-don-t-know-n996866,"Many teens who use e-cigarettes aren’t aware they are inhaling nicotine when they vape , even though they are often taking in high levels of the addictive substance, a new study suggests. Researchers who collected both survey data and urine samples from more than 500 adolescents found that 40 percent of teens who thought they were using nicotine-free products had positive urine sample tests, according to the study published Monday in Pediatrics.
“This is one of the first studies showing the amount of nicotine kids are getting from e-cigarettes ,” said the study’s lead author Dr. Rachel Boykan, a clinical associate professor of pediatrics in the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. “They’re getting a lot — as much or more than they would with traditional cigarettes.”
The analysis of urine samples showed that vapers are getting plenty of nicotine even when they think they weren’t getting any, Boykan said.
New push to raise national smoking and vaping age to 21 April 19, 2019 01:08 Boykan and her colleagues also found that vaping teens were often using their devices with cannabis.
Experts worry that use of e-cigarettes with nicotine will produce a generation of addicted young people who may stick with vaping, or later turn to more dangerous traditional cigarettes.
Between April 2017 and April 2018, the researchers asked 517 adolescents, aged 12 to 21, to complete a questionnaire on tobacco, e-cigarette and marijuana use. Of the volunteers, 284 were also asked to provide a urine sample. The surveys and samples were collected anonymously, with the researchers connecting the two types of data through numbers assigned to each of the volunteers, who received a $5 Starbucks coupon for participating.
Nicotine levels were measured indirectly through the amount of a metabolite called cotinine found in volunteers’ urine.
Among the 517 volunteers: 13.9 percent reported ever smoking cigarettes; 36 percent reported trying e-cigarettes; and 31.3 percent reported they had tried marijuana. Only 2.9 percent reported smoking in the previous week; 14.3 percent reported e-cigarette use during the past week; and 11.4 percent reported using marijuana in the past week.
For their analysis, the researchers used data from 265 of the volunteers who had both survey and urine sample data. Among those who said they thought they were using nicotine-free products, 40 percent had significant levels of cotinine in their urine.
Cotinine levels were highest among adolescents using a newer vaping technology: pod mods. A pod mod is an e-cigarette that uses a disposable pod, or cartridge. The levels of cotinine in pod users was nearly the level seen in tobacco smokers. People who vaped older versions of e-cigarettes had much lower levels of cotinine in their urine samples.
'A bigger buzz' “Now we have this huge problem with lots of kids using these products with many not understanding what they are getting into,” said pediatrician Dr. Sharon Levy.
“ Nicotine is a highly addictive substance and it’s being delivered at much higher concentrations than before,"" Levy, director of the Adolescent Substance Use and Addiction Program at Boston Children’s Hospital and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Harvard Medical School, told NBC News. ""So they’re getting a bigger buzz.”
Related Health Health FDA to investigate reports of seizures possibly linked to e-cigarette use Levy’s own son asked her if e-cigarettes contained “just juice flavoring” when he was in the eighth or ninth grade, she said.
Dr. Andrew Stokes, an assistant professor of global health at the Boston University School of Public Health, is alarmed by the new study.
Stokes conducted an e-cigarette study, published in February, that found an increased risk of teens who vape to eventually smoke traditional cigarettes.
In fact, vaping teens who didn’t see themselves as ever smoking at the beginning of the study were nearly nine times as likely as those who didn’t use e-cigarettes to later smoke traditional cigarettes.
“What is most alarming is the finding of significantly higher cotinine levels in those who used pod mods, a new class of cartridges on the market,” Stokes said. “And the finding that many of the kids were not aware the products contain nicotine is concerning. It suggests that this may be a pathway into nicotine addiction that the kids were not anticipating.”

Warren's plan to wipe out student debt (and how she'd pay for it),www.nbcnews.com,Benjy Sarlin,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/warren-s-plan-wipe-out-student-debt-how-she-d-n996856," unveiled a plan Monday that would offer free tuition at public colleges while canceling up to $50,000 in student debt for over 40 million Americans. Warren said her proposal was designed to confront a recent surge in student loans, now totaling $1.5 trillion nationally. She blamed insufficient funding for higher education — the result of lower taxes — for the mounting student debt.
""The first step in addressing this crisis is to deal head-on with the outstanding debt that is weighing down millions of families and should never have been required in the first place,"" she said in a statement.
The real college crisis: Student debt drags down economy March 17, 2019 01:49 Much of the 2020 Democratic presidential field has already signed onto plans for either free public college, a signature part of Sen. Bernie Sanders' platform, or debt-free college, as well as various proposals to refinance student debt and lower interest rates.
President Donald Trump last month proposed limiting the amount of loans students can take out while offering a new income-based repayment option.
Warren's proposal goes further by allowing former students to immediately wipe out their debt.
Households making under $100,000 could cancel up to $50,000 of student loan debt. Those making up to $250,000 could still qualify for partial debt cancellation, with the amount available declining by $1 for every $3 they make over $100,000.
Related News News These five charts show how bad the student loan debt situation is In an accompanying analysis, her campaign estimated that 95 percent of Americans with student loan debt would qualify for relief under her plan and more than 75 percent would wipe their debt out entirely.
Moving forward, Warren's plan would eliminate tuition and fees at two-year and four-year public colleges and redirect student loan benefits to cover additional costs incurred by students.
The campaign estimated the total cost at $1.25 trillion over 10 years, $640 billion of which would come from its student loan plan. Warren said she would pay for it using her proposed wealth tax .
The campaign unveiled its plan accompanied by a statement of support from Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, who called it ""as consequential as the GI Bill.""

The Mueller report makes a damning case about Trump's dishonesty,www.nbcnews.com,Chuck Todd,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/mueller-report-makes-damning-case-about-trump-s-dishonesty-n996966,"WASHINGTON — The Mueller report makes a damning case about Trump’s dishonesty: One of the unmistakable takeaways after reading the Mueller report is how the president of the United States wasn’t honest with the American public when it came to Russia and the entire Russia probe. During the 2016 campaign and afterward, Trump raised doubts that Russia really interfered in the election .
But as Mueller writes, “The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.”
Trump denied that Putin and Russia wanted him to win.
But as Mueller writes, “[T]he investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would be benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”
Trump said he had no business ties with Russia .
But as Mueller writes, “Between 2013 and June 2016, several employees of the Trump Organization, including then-president of the organization Donald J. Trump, pursued a Moscow deal with several Russian counterparties.”
Trump and his team said former FBI Director James Comey was fired because of his handling of the Clinton email investigation.
But as Mueller writes, “[T]he White House maintained that Comey should be discharged for mishandling the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the president had decided to fire Comey before hearing from the Department of Justice.”
And Trump wasn’t forthcoming — especially early on — about that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians.
As Mueller writes, “On several occasions, the president directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting the emails would not leak and that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited.”
Bottom line: Almost every step of the way – during the campaign, during the investigation itself – the president and his allies weren’t being honest with the American people.
And outside of the questions about obstruction of justice and conspiracy/coordination/collusion, isn’t THIS dishonesty one of the biggest storylines out this entire Russia episode?
Normalizing foreign election interference On “Meet the Press” yesterday , Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani normalized foreign election interference by defending Trump’s use of the WikiLeaks disclosures during the 2016 campaign, as NBC’s Ben Kamisar put it.
TODD: So it is now okay for political campaigns to work with material stolen by foreign adversaries? GIULIANI: It depends on the stolen material. If the stolen material is -- first of all, was it all right for The New York Times and The Washington Post to print against the objections of the president… Giuliani added on WikiLeaks: “They were putting out things that were true and very, very damaging to Hillary Clinton… It'd be like the Pentagon Papers. I mean, Pentagon Papers were stolen. They were stolen from the, from the, from the Department of Defense.”
One of the pragmatic reasons why Giuliani is making the WikiLeaks = Pentagon Papers argument is that the Roger Stone trial is coming, and this WikiLeaks story isn’t going away.
But also remember: Only one campaign/party had its emails stolen during the 2016.
Only one campaign/party weaponized those disclosures, even after the Obama administration said WikiLeaks was part of Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign .
And the 2016 election was decided by fewer than a combined 80,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Tweet of the day When the Gore campaign was sent debate prep material stolen from Bush campaign, they immediately called the FBI and turned material over. Had that been Trump’s campaign, they would have kept it, used it and lied about it if confronted. https://t.co/mlPLOM22WH
— stuart stevens (@stuartpstevens) April 22, 2019 Impeachment question divides Dems As we said on Friday — the day after the Mueller report was released — Democrats are facing a gigantic split about whether to pursue impeachment proceedings against President Trump.
That divide now applies to the 2020 presidential field, after Elizabeth Warren became the first Dem presidential candidate to call for the House to begin the impeachment process.
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office said they’re taking the Mueller aftermath one step at a time.
""We’re focused on getting the full unredacted version of the report and its underlying documents — as well as hearing from Mueller,"" a Pelosi spokeswoman said, per NBC’s Rebecca Shabad . ""The report raises more questions and concerns that we believe the American people deserve answers to.""
But also don’t miss what House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on “Meet the Press” yesterday:
TODD: Do you think this is impeachable? NADLER: Yeah, I do. I do think this, if proven, if proven, which hasn't been proven yet some of this -- if proven, some of this would be impeachable, yes. Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable.” For Democrats, it’s damned if you do, damned if you don’t.
If they don’t go down Impeachment Road, they might regret it.
But they also might regret it if they go for it.
2020 Vision: Moulton’s in This morning, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., became the latest Democratic politician to jump into the 2020 presidential race.
His announcement video plays up his military service. “Before I knew it, I was commanding a platoon in the first company of Marines into Baghdad,” he says.
And Moulton, 40, calls for generational change. “The Greatest Generation saved our country from tyranny. It’s time for our generation to step up and do the same.”
NBC’s Alex Seitz-Wald has more on Moulton’s bid: “[He] may be best known, however, for his opposition to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. His call for new leadership in internal House elections early this year cost him some support back home in his congressional district north of Boston, which includes Salem and the famous fishing town of Gloucester. He later came around to support Pelosi.”

Park ranger's selfie with orphaned gorillas goes viral,www.nbcnews.com,Ben Kesslen,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/park-ranger-s-selfie-orphaned-gorillas-goes-viral-n996951,"A park ranger's selfie with two orphaned gorillas is going viral. Ranger Mathieu Shamavu was working at Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo when the two gorillas decided to strike a pose.
Shamavu works for the park's anti-poaching unit, and the gorillas in the photo, Ndakazi and Ndeze, are orphans who have been raised in the park.
Virunga National Park posted the picture on Instagram after it went viral, saying, ""YES, it’s real!""
It also told readers not to be shocked by the gorillas' poses. ""It's no surprise to see these girls on their two feet either — most primates are comfortable walking upright (bipedalism) for short bursts of time,"" the park explained.
While the selfie shows the lighter side of being a ranger, it can be a dangerous job. Last year, gunmen killed five Virunga National Park rangers , who often risk their lives to protect wildlife and the gorillas.
Virunga said the photo happened under ""exceptional circumstances,"" reminding people that ""it is never permitted to approach a gorilla in the wild.""

"How to recycle, resell and buy used electronics",www.nbcnews.com,Herb Weisbaum,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/how-recycle-resell-buy-used-electronics-ncna996956,"We all know that used products cost less. And yet, two-thirds of Americans have never purchased a secondhand cellphone or laptop, according to a survey by ecoATM Gazelle , a company that buys, sells and recycles electronic devices. While many consumers said they were comfortable buying secondhand cars (48 percent), clothing (31 percent) and furniture (26 percent), less than 10 percent would purchase pre-owned electronic devices, the survey found. Nearly half (48 percent) of respondents admit they don’t recycle their old cellphones, with most of them ending up in the trash. Chase Freeman, public relations manager for ecoATM Gazelle, says people need to realize that electronic waste should not be thrown in the trash.
“There are many harmful chemicals and toxins in e-waste, such as cadmium, mercury, lead and arsenic, and those are ending up in landfills across the U.S. where they can leach into the soil and underground waterways,” Freeman told NBC News BETTER. “More times than not, these discarded devices have a lot of life left in them.”
Recycling old electronics keeps this toxic waste from going to the landfill. Buying previously owned devices not only saves you money, it reduces the resources needed to make new ones.
“We found that it’s a great way to save money ,” said Chris Raymond, deputy editor for electronics at Consumer Reports. “You can, in fact, save hundreds of dollars or more on a smartphone and hundreds of dollars when it comes to a laptop or tablet.”
A few examples of the deals we found available on Gazelle :
iPhone XS Max (64GB) in “excellent” condition for $824 Galaxy Note 9 (128GB) in “good” condition for $574 iPhone 6 (16GB) in “excellent” condition for $174 iPad Pro 12.9"" (128GB WiFi + 4G LTE) in “excellent” condition for $529 While buying secondhand digital devices may seem risky, Consumer Reports surveys found that most people — more than 80 percent — who have purchased a refurbished phone are satisfied with the device and the shopping experience. Of the 3,200 Consumer Reports members who bought a refurbished phone since January 2016, 67 percent said they had no complaints. That’s slightly less than the 69 percent of new smartphone owners who said the same thing.
“You have to be careful and do a little bit more homework than if you were purchasing a new product,” Raymond said. “But I don’t think it’s that hard to make sure you’re getting something decent.”
The highest-rated refurbished cellphone stores based Consumer Reports spring 2018 survey : Consumer Cellular (89 out of 100), eBay (88), Apple Store (87), Amazon (86) and Gazelle (83).
ecoATM Gazelle HOW AND WHERE TO BUY USED electronics When you go secondhand shopping, look for products that are “refurbished” or “certified pre-owned.” It means they are like new — inspected and restored to their original condition.
In most cases, these are products that were purchased and then returned. This doesn’t mean the item was damaged; there could have been a minor blemish. Sometimes, the device wasn’t even used after the package was opened.
Here are just a few of the sites that sell refurbished items: Amazon Warehouse Deals , Apple Store , Best Buy Outlet , Black Market , Crutchfield Outlet Store , Dell Outlet , Microsoft , Samsung Certified Pre-Owned and Walmart Certified Refurbished . Your wireless company may also offer refurbished phones.
CHECK THE WARRANTY BEFORE BUYING used devices Warranties on secondhand devices vary greatly. Refurbished products purchased directly from Apple and Samsung include a one-year warranty. Google offers 90 days. Refurbished items sold by most retailers typically have 90-day warranties. EcoATM Gazelle has a 30-day return policy.
“Be careful where you shop,” said Edgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org . “A refurbished product from a reliable source will save you money and is less likely to have problems than a used device purchased from an unknown website. Remember, a super-low price on a pre-owned cellphone or tablet that breaks down or doesn’t work properly, isn’t a deal, it’s a headache.”
HOW TO RECYCLE OLD ELECTRONICS Selling or donating unwanted technology is a good way to keep it out of the landfill. You can sell things on your own or take advantage of trade-in programs offered by many big-box stores, manufacturers and wireless companies.
You can sell your old cellphone, tablet, laptop, mp3 player, MacBook or Mac Computer at a Gazelle trade-in site and get an offer in less than a minute. If you accept, the company will send you the box and pay for the shipping. Once the device is inspected (to make sure it matches your description), you will be sent payment via Amazon Gift Card, PayPal or check (your choice).
Or visit an ecoATM kiosk in your area and get instant cash for that smartphone, tablet or mp3 player.
By using ecoATM or Gazelle you know your unwanted device will be resold or responsibly recycled. If you have an old device that you can’t turn into cash, visit 1-800-Recycling.com to find an electronics recycling program in your area.
Related Cyber security Cyber security 6 common habits that put you at risk for identity theft PURGE YOUR DIGITAL DEVICES BEFORE YOU SELL OR RECYCLE THEM You need to make sure your laptop, tablet, mobile phone or any other device that stores your data is scrubbed clean, to prevent that information, including passwords, usernames, contacts, credit card numbers and even tax information, from being accessed by someone else. In the hands of an identity thief , the consequences could be devastating.
40 percent of all secondhand digital devices available for sale had personally identifiable information on them.
All too often, sensitive data is not destroyed. A study by the National Association for Information Destruction (NAID) published in 2017 found that 40 percent of all secondhand digital devices available for sale had personally identifiable information (PII) on them.
“Never trust a recycling company to delete your information; it’s your responsibility,” said
Robert Siciliano, security awareness expert and CEO of Safr.me . “Simply hitting the delete button or reformatting a hard drive isn’t enough. The device has to be fully wiped for all the data to be removed.”
His advice:
For PCs, use DBAN or Active@ KillDisk to “nuke any data” that’s on the hard drive. Macs have a built-in OS X Disk Utility. For phones and tablets, do a factory reset and then use a program called Blancco Mobile . Be sure to remove the sim card from a smartphone. If you buy a previously owned device, assume it could contain hidden malware. You need to reset the operating system and run security software before you use that device.

Emmanuel Dunand / AFP - Getty Images file Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 22, 2019, 12:48 PM UTC / Source: Reuters By Reuters Tesla said it has sent a team to investigate a video on Chinese social media that showed a parked Model S exploding, the latest in a string of fire incidents involving Tesla cars. The video, time stamped Sunday evening and widely shared on China’s Twitter-like Weibo, shows the parked electric car emit smoke and burst into flames seconds later. A video purportedly of the aftermath showed a line of three cars completely destroyed. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the origins of the videos, which Weibo users said were taken in Shanghai. The cause of the explosion could not be immediately ascertained from the videos. “We immediately sent a team onsite and we’re supporting local authorities to establish the facts. From what we know now, no one was harmed,” Tesla said in a statement on Monday. It declined comment further when contacted by Reuters. There have been at least 14 instances of Tesla cars catching fire since 2013, with the majority occurring after a crash. The automaker has said its EVs are about 10 times less likely to experience a fire than traditional gas-powered cars, based on its fleet of over 500,000 vehicles which have driven more than 10 billion miles. It did not specify whether the statistic referred to normal use or involving accidents. The latest incident comes as Tesla tries to push sales in China, where its prices were impacted by tit-for-tat tariffs imposed last year. The automaker currently imports all the cars it sells in China, but is building a factory in Shanghai that will initially make its Model 3 and help reduce the impact of a trade war. In March, Tesla was also on the receiving end of a labeling mix-up at Shanghai customs that led to a temporary suspension of clearance for a batch of Model 3 cars. Analysts said the latest fire incident would likely increase attention on the safety of EVs but was unlikely to have a significant impact on Tesla’s sales or reputation in China while the cause was being investigated.

Huawei earnings show U.S. campaign is doing little to slow China's 5G giant,www.nbcnews.com,"Arjun Kharpal, CNBC",04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/huawei-earnings-show-u-s-campaign-doing-little-slow-china-n996981,"Huawei reported a 39 percent year-on-year increase in first-quarter revenue on Monday as it continues to see growth despite continued political pressure. The Chinese networking equipment maker said revenue totaled 179.7 billion yuan ($26.8 billion) for the first three months of 2019. The company said it shipped 59 million smartphones in the first quarter.
Huawei said in a press release that 2019 “will be a year of large-scale deployment of 5G around the world” and its carrier business “has unprecedented opportunities for growth.” By the end of March, Huawei had signed 40 commercial contracts for 5G with leading global carriers. 5G refers to the fifth generation of mobile networks that promises super-fast data speeds with the ability to support new technologies like driverless cars.
It’s the first time ever that Huawei has released a quarterly earnings report. The company usually reports financial results for half a year and then the full year. Now, however, the company is seeking to show it is still growing despite effectively being banned from being involved in the rollout of 5G in Australia and Japan .
The U.S. has reportedly tried to pressure other allied countries like Germany and the U.K. to block Huawei from 5G, but neither country has done so yet. Washington has accused Huawei of being a national security risk, warning that its equipment could be used by the Chinese government for espionage purposes. Huawei has repeatedly denied this claim.
In a recent interview with CNBC , Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei said that the U.S. has been helping advertise for the company by talking about it so much.
“For such a powerful country to be scared of a small company like us, some other countries are saying, ‘Your products are so good that the U.S. government is scared. We won’t test your products. We’ll buy them directly.’ That’s why some deep-pocketed countries with rich oil reserves are buying from us. They are buying our products in large quantities as the U.S. government is advertising for us,” Ren said without specifying the nations he referred to.
Ren also projected that, over the next five years, Huawei will grow its revenue to $250 billion from $100 billion last year."

From left, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts with Justices Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh before President Trump's State of the Union address on Feb. 5. Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images file Breaking News Emails April 22, 2019, 1:07 PM UTC By Pete Williams WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court hears its highest profile case of the term Tuesday — a battle over the Trump administration's plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form that goes to every U.S. household. A total of 18 states, several of the nation's largest cities and immigrant rights groups say the question would make immigrants reluctant to respond to census takers, resulting in an undercount of the population. They won two battles in the lower courts, prompting the government's appeal to the high court. The Constitution requires a census every 10 years, and the results determine how many members each state gets in the House of Representatives. The data is also used to calculate a local government's share of funds under many federal programs. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the question was added at his direction after he received a letter from the Department of Justice that said the data was needed to properly enforce civil rights laws. But Federal District Court Judge Jesse Furman of New York said the evidence at a trial on the issue revealed that Ross' claim was nothing but a pretext. Furman concluded that Ross actually prodded the Justice Department to send the letter, which demonstrated that he ""made the decision to add a citizenship question well before he received DOJ's request."" The judge also found that including the question would violate a federal law requiring the government to get as accurate a count as possible, because it would ""materially reduce response rates among immigrant and Hispanic households."" Is it legal for the Census Bureau to collect data on non-citizens? March 8, 2019 04:34 Led by New York, the states opposing the question also said Ross' directive sidestepped the Census Bureau's long-standing procedures for testing changes to the questionnaire in order to evaluate whether they would lead to an undercount. Because the citizenship question would depress minority responses, the challengers said, including it on the form would actually produce a less accurate count than leaving it off and using Social Security and IRS data to supplement the information gathered from the census form. The administration of President Donald Trump argued at the trial that questions about citizenship or country of birth have been asked during all but one census from 1820 to 2000. But in recent decades, the long-form version that included those questions — along with others about race, sex, Hispanic origin and relationship status — was not sent to every household. Separately, a judge in San Francisco ruled in March that including the citizenship question would violate the Constitution's requirement for an ""actual enumeration"" of the population. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg agreed with California that adding the question would discourage responses within the noncitizen and Latino communities, even among those here legally. The negative effect of including the question would be magnified by the current immigration debate, he said. A Supreme Court brief filed by civil rights advocates agreed. ""The Census Bureau's confidentiality obligations provide cold comfort to Latino immigrants,"" it said. ""The Trump Administration has created an environment of fear and distrust in the Latino community."" The American Civil Liberties Union said an analysis by the Census Bureau estimated that almost 6 percent of households where a noncitizen lives would not respond to the census if the question is added. That would amount to about 6.5 million people. Trump weighed in on the controversy in early April . ""Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question,"" he said in a tweet. ""Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!"" The court will decide the case by late June.

'Game of Thrones' theories and buzz following 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms',www.nbcnews.com,Daniel Arkin,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/game-thrones-theories-buzz-following-knight-seven-kingdoms-n996891,"The people behind ""Game of Thrones"" have only four more chances to set the internet ablaze with wild fan theories, feverish predictions, rampant speculation and a Citadel's worth of memes before the series wraps May 19. As the faithful await next Sunday's installment, here's a spoiler-heavy look at what could soon go down in Westeros. (The Three-Eyed Raven already knows the answers, of course, but he stopped returning our calls.) Get Ready to Rumble That creeping feeling of dread during the final minutes of this week's episode? Well, brace yourself for more where that came from, apparently. The teaser for next week's edition promises plenty of carnage and mayhem for the brave souls hunkered down at Winterfell. And it's about time — there were zero deaths in the latest episode, and no one of importance has been killed in the final season yet.
The most hair-raising moment in the trailer: Brienne of Tarth, newly-minted knight, hollers at her assembled warriors: ""Stand your ground!"" It's a more galvanizing line than Jon Snow grimly informing Dany that the Night King is on his way.
Whither Dany and Jon? Daenerys and Jon Snow (erm, Aegon Targaryen) shared a romantic moment by that Windows screensaver-style waterfall in the season premiere. But their love affair could be doomed, and not just because all the main characters might get ripped to shreds by ice zombies in the Battle of Winterfell.
Dany seemed less than thrilled this week to learn that Jon is the trueborn son of her dead brother, Rhaegar, and Lyanna Stark — lineage that makes Jon her nephew, although she honestly doesn't seem too concerned about that fact. Dany appears more rattled by the knowledge that Jon is the rightful heir to House Targaryen with a competing and compelling claim to the Iron Throne.
Jon: ""tbh I'm actually your nephew and we had unprotected sex multiple times""
Dany: ""you mean you're the true heir to the throne?""
— Barry McCockiner (@SportsTalkBarry) April 22, 2019 It may be the right time to paraphrase Yrigette, Jon's old wildling girlfriend: They should've stayed at that waterfall.
Name That Tune So what's Dany's next move? Well, this week's episode contained what could be a clue in the form of ""Jenny's Song,"" the somber, mournful, I-just-have-something-in-my-eye ditty sung by good old Podrick Payne amid a montage of grim-faced warriors trudging off to battle. The song was later performed by Florence + The Machine during the closing credits.
Waiting for Jenny’s Song remixes like #GameOfThrones pic.twitter.com/7acdhi76Rd
— Benjamin Smith (@benjamingsmith) April 22, 2019 The song, pulled directly from George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" novels, refers to a woman named Jenny of Oldstones and her prince, Duncan Targaryen — Dany's uncle. Duncan gave up his claim to the Iron Throne in order to marry his beloved Jenny. (You can read more about the typically convoluted backstory here .)
The very-on-the-nose cameo appearance by ""Jenny's Song"" harkens back to a prescient question Samwell Tarly asked Jon in the season premiere: ""You gave up your crown to save the people. Would she do the same?"" And for that matter, would Jon do the same for Dany?
We'll find out soon enough — and that brings us to our next item of business ...
Dany Breaks Bad? Twitter was buzzing Sunday night with speculation that ""Game of Thrones"" scribes David Benioff and D.B. Weiss could be positioning Dany as the stealth villain of the final episodes. The proponents of what might be called the ""Dany Was a Villain the Whole Damn Time, If Only You'd Paid Attention"" theory were thrilled, no doubt.
really pumped about everyone jumping on this Dany-Is-A-Villain train 🥰
— Sarafina Nance (@starstrickenSF) April 22, 2019 We know that Dany is strong and a natural-born leader, but she has also shown herself to be ruthless in her quest for power. (Samwell Tarly, whose father and brother were killed by the would-be queen, can tell you all about that M.O.) It's not inconceivable that Dany would dispense with any obstacle in her path to the Iron Throne — even her bearded BF and his sister Sansa, with whom she shared a conciliatory-turned-tense conversation.
Big Man Bran Bran Stark, who seems to always just ... be there, staring and thinking Deep Thoughts, revealed this week that the Night King is coming straight for him because the dreaded zombie ""wants to erase the world, and I am its memory."" In other words, Bran knows everything, and he's the Night King's top priority. Humility!
But anyway, Bran tells everyone at Winterfell that he'll offer himself up as bait for the Night King. He also mutters some vague words of wisdom, including this depressing quip about what might follow the violent confrontation with the White Walkers: ""How do you know there is an afterwards?”
Bran should be in a small, strong castle empty of civilians guarded by a group of elite fighters and the bulk of the army should be somewhere else nearby able to hit the Army of the Dead in the rear as they try to fight their way to Bran.
— Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) April 22, 2019 Does the young seer (who some folks on the internet believe is actually the Night King) know something we don't? Definitely. He knows everything, remember? But specifically, does Bran know that the White Walkers will win the war? It's possible.
Oh, One More Thing It's been an interesting few days for ""Game of Thrones"" crossovers with American politics. President Donald Trump tweeted a ""GoT""-inspired meme after the public release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report . Presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote a piece for The Cut titled ""The World Needs Fewer Cersei Lannisters.""
But then there was Chasten Buttigieg, husband of 2020 contender Pete Buttigieg, who laid down the law on Twitter late Sunday. ""I’ve waited 18 months, #GamesOfThrones,"" he tweeted . ""If there isn’t an epic dragon scene next episode I’m writing a strongly worded letter to Cersei.""

Elijah Cummings, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to block a subpoena for years of financial records from several Trump entities. The lawyers filed the lawsuit Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, saying the subpoena for records from Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, “lacks any legitimate legislative purpose, is an abuse of power, and is just another example of overreach by the president's political opponents.""
Earlier this month, Cummings, D-Md., issued the subpoena to Mazars regarding Trump’s finances to corroborate the testimony of his former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, in February.
House Oversight preps subpoena for Trump financial documents April 13, 2019 07:08 “We will not allow congressional presidential harassment to go unanswered,” Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers, said in a statement. ""Harassment"" is a phrase Trump often uses to attack his critics in Congress.
The lawsuit argues that House Democrats have “declared an all-out political war against President Donald J. Trump” and that “subpoenas are the weapon of their choice.” It goes on to say Democrats are “obsessed” with finding something that could “damage the president politically.”
Cummings said in a statement Monday afternoon that Trump ""has a long history of trying to use baseless lawsuits to attack his adversaries, but there is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress.""
""This complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief, and it contains a litany of inaccurate information,"" he continued. ""The White House is engaged in unprecedented stonewalling on all fronts, and they have refused to produce a single document or witness to the Oversight Committee during this entire year.""
In late March, Cummings sent a letter to Mazars chairman and CEO Victor Wahba requesting documents related to his panel’s probe into allegations that Trump inflated or deflated financial statements for potentially improper purposes. Cummings said Cohen provided documents to his committee in support of his testimony.
“Mr. Cohen produced to the Committee financial statements from 2011, 2012, and 2013 that raise questions about the President’s representations of his financial affairs on these forms and on other disclosures, particularly relating to the President’s debts,” Cummings wrote in the letter. “Several of these documents appear to have been signed by your firm.”
Cummings asked that Mazars produce the documents to the committee by April 3, a deadline that the accounting firm did not meet, prompting him to issue the subpoena.
After Cummings issued the subpoena, Oversight ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, sent a letter to him and a memo to committee members calling the move an ""unprecedented abuse"" of the committee's subpoena authority.
The lawsuit comes as Democrats are ramping up their investigations of Trump, issuing subpoenas for information about White House security clearances and the 2020 census and for the full, unredacted Mueller report , which was released in redacted form last Thursday.

""Just thankful that today she may be just a hair better than she was yesterday, and we'll take it one day at a time,"" Topeka Zoo Director Brendan Wiley told NBC affiliate KSNT of Topeka.
Investigators still haven't spoken about the wounded trainer since she was mauled Saturday by a 7-year-old male tiger named Sanjiv, according to Wiley.
The attack happened in Sanjiv's outdoor habitat as several visitors watched. The tiger was lured away so the injured zookeeper could be rescued.
The zookeeper, who has not been identified yet, has worked at the zoo since 2002 and has several years of experience with tigers, officials have said.
The zoo opted not to euthanize Sanjiv, who was back on display Sunday.

Supreme Court to rule whether civil rights law bans discrimination against LGBTQ employees,www.nbcnews.com,Pete Williams,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rule-whether-civil-right-law-bans-discrimination-against-n996996,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide whether existing civil rights laws ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, a question that has divided the nation's lower courts. Federal law forbids workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. It does not explicitly apply to LGBT individuals, but gay rights advocates have argued that firing employees because of their sexual orientation is already prohibited as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. They've been hoping to achieve in the courts what they have so far been unable to get in Congress — a nationwide ban on job discrimination.
The cases accepted Monday reflect the split among federal courts. Two appeals courts ruled that employers violated Title VII by firing gay and transgender employees. A third said civil rights laws don't cover sexual orientation.
For decades, every federal appeals court to consider whether gay employees are entitled to nondiscrimination protection ruled that they are not. But advocates of LGBT rights argued that support for that position has been eroding. In 1989, the Supreme Court said Title VII bans discrimination based on an employee's failure to act according to sex-based expectations, ruling for a woman denied a promotion who was told to walk, talk and dress femininely, wear makeup and jewelry, and have her hair styled.
 Plaintiff at center of landmark gay-rights case never got to witness his victory In 1998, the court ruled that a heterosexual offshore oil rig worker could sue for sex discrimination even though he was sexually harassed by other men on the job. Congress didn't have that kind of discrimination in mind when the civil rights law was passed in 1964, the Supreme Court said, but ""statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils.""
The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission concluded in 2015 that Title VII does protect against LGBT job discrimination. President Barack Obama's Justice Department took the same position, but under President Donald Trump it reversed course, opposing that conclusion.
Among the cases to be heard next term are an appeal from a ruling in favor of a New York skydiving instructor, Donald Zarda, who said he was fired after telling a female client that he was gay so she shouldn't worry about being strapped tightly against him during the dive. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals said sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination.
The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals said a woman who worked for a Michigan funeral home was impermissibly fired two weeks after she told her employer she was transgender. Her employer said she did not follow the dress code, but the court said transgender discrimination is prohibited by Title VII.
""Discrimination 'because of sex' inherently includes discrimination against employees because of a change in their sex,"" it said.
In the third case, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a Georgia man who lost his job with Clayton County after his participation in a gay softball league became known to his employer. That court said the civil rights law does not cover sexual orientation discrimination.
Because of the split among the lower courts, advocates on both sides of the issue were urging the Supreme Court to correct what they said were erroneous rulings.
Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said the Supreme Court's decision to take the case ""is a historic turning point for transgender people across this country.""
""Americans decided long ago that no person should have to fear losing their job because of who they are, and we hope the Supreme Court understands its responsibility to uphold established law and this enduring American value,"" Keisling said in a statement.
The court will hear the cases in its next term, which begins in October.

New York outbreaks drive U.S. measles count up to 626,www.nbcnews.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/new-york-outbreaks-drive-u-s-measles-count-626-n997021,"Outbreaks in New York state continue to drive up the number of U.S. measles cases, which are approaching levels not seen in 25 years. Health officials say 71 more cases were reported last week, with 68 of them from New York. That brings this year's total to 626 in 22 states as of April 19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the latest numbers Monday .
Iowa and Tennessee were the two states that joined the CDC list with new measles cases.
This is the most cases seen since 2014, when 667 were reported for the whole year. The most before that was 963 cases in 1994.
Related Health Health Measles complication sends Israeli flight attendant into a coma Dr. Steven J. Goldstein, a pediatrician in Brooklyn whose office is in the epicenter of the measles outbreak, says the measles outbreak is putting a strain not only on families, but also the doctors who treat them.
""When there is a child in your practice with measles or it turns out the child has measles later, you have to close the office and investigate; you have to contact everybody who was in the practice at or around the time of exposure. Everyone needs to be notified about that possible exposure,"" said Goldstein, who is president of the New York Chapter 2 of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Dr. Steven J. Goldstein, a pediatrician in Brooklyn and president of the New York Chapter 2 of the American Academy of Pediatrics, has an office right in the epicenter of the measles outbreak. Dr. Steven J. Goldstein Goldstein added that he has to check every patient with a fever or rash before they come in to make sure they don't have measles since the virus is highly contagious .
""Measles, which is fully preventable with a vaccine, puts such a burden on pediatric care. The implications of this are huge for the city, the state and the country,"" Goldstein told NBC News.
Twenty-two states have reported cases, but the vast majority have been in New York — mainly in New York City and in nearby Rockland County. Most of the New York cases have been unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities.
After an outbreak of measles in Rockland County , officials there issued a temporary 30-day ban on unvaccinated children from public gathering spaces. The controversial policy was seen as aggressive, but resulted in at least 700 additional mumps, measles and rubella vaccinations through free clinics, according to the county's Department of Health .
Goldstein says the New York State Department of Health is recommending that parents vaccinate their babies earlier, at six months to protect themselves from the virus during the outbreak. The normal MMR vaccination schedule is for a first dose at 12 to 15 months and a second dose at 4 to 6 years old, according to the CDC.
But many time parents have been slow to receive the early vaccine Goldstein noted.
""It's not always that parents are anti-vaccine. Parents need information and the department of health has provided us with a very good booklet highlighting these new changes that we are using to get the word out,"" Goldstein said.

New hope rises for would-be LGBTQ parents in New York,www.nbcnews.com,Dan Avery,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/new-hope-rises-would-be-lgbtq-parents-new-york-n996411,"A measure before the New York Legislature could ease the path to creating a family for thousands of prospective parents: The Child-Parent Security Act, which passed the state Assembly judiciary committee in February, would lift New York’s 27-year-old ban on surrogacy contracts. It has already received support from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who tried to add the bill to his state budget proposal. It’s not just the usual legislative gridlock that’s kept the ban in place, though: Opponents include New York’s Roman Catholic Archdiocese, which has decried commercial surrogacy as “human trafficking.” And in an open letter to Cuomo last month, a group of former surrogates called the process “a cynical money-making enterprise” that turns women “into paid commodities to be used by those with power and money.”
“When things turned bad, we had nowhere to go, no one to help and no resources available to us,” the letter, drafted by Jennifer Lahl of the Center for Bioethics and Culture, reads in part. “We were lied to, used, exploited and still suffer long-term physical and emotional harm.”
 Anti-LGBTQ adoption bills 'snowballing' in state legislatures, rights group says Coloring the issue is the specter of a court case that made headlines over 30 years ago: In 1985, Mary Beth Whitehead sued for custody of the infant, dubbed Baby M, that she had carried to term for a New Jersey couple, William and Elizabeth Stern. Whitehead, who had been struggling financially, agreed to donate an egg and be inseminated for $10,000.
“A lot of states reacted pre-emptively to the negative publicity around the Baby M case,” said Denise Brogan-Kator, policy chief for the Family Equality Council and head of the Protecting Modern Families Coalition , which supports lifting the ban. “There were allegations of exploitation — of baby-selling.”
In the decades since the Baby M case, fertility technology has advanced. Now, almost all surrogacies are gestational — meaning the surrogate does not provide an egg and is not genetically related to the child she carries.
“Most states started to update their laws,” Brogan-Kator said, “but D.C., Michigan and New York actually went a step further and criminalized surrogacy contracts.”
However, D.C. legalized surrogacy contracts in 2017, and even New Jersey, where the Baby M case took place, lifted its ban last spring. Besides New York and Michigan, Louisiana is the only other state that continues to ban paid surrogacy outright. Though the numbers are still relatively small, surrogacy is on the rise in the U.S.: In 2004, there were 738 children born via surrogacy. By 2015, that had increased to 2,807.
“It’s clear that the radical right has taken on our right to form families as their next battleground,” Brogan-Kator claimed. “They’re introducing legislation to allow foster and adoption agencies to turn away same-sex couples . This is the arena they’ve chosen, and [this law] is one of the things we can do to protect our rights.”
Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-New York, speaks to members of the New York State Senate in 2017. Hans Pennink / AP file State Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Democrat and the bill’s co-sponsor, told NBC News he wants to ensure that all of the parties in a surrogacy arrangement are protected. “We need to ensure that surrogates have access to health care and independent legal counsel, and are in a position to freely make the choice,” he explained.
Proponents of the Child-Parent Security Act point out that it goes beyond just surrogacy to address the realities of how people become parents in the 21st century: It would ease second-parent adoptions and provide for “pre-birth” orders that make intended parents the legal guardian from the moment a child is born. Currently New York lacks a clear mechanism to sever a sperm or egg donor’s parental rights, leaving the door open for an ugly custody battle or child-support suit after a child is born.
“We have this presumption of paternity that dates back to the Middle Ages,” Brian Esser, a Brooklyn lawyer who handles surrogacy and assisted reproductive technology, said. “If a woman is married, we assume her husband is the father of the child.""
The proposed surrogacy legislation would clarify that donors do not have parental rights or obligations. Other protections include health insurance and access to mental health services for gestational carriers, independent legal counsel for all parties involved, as well as a requirement that intended parents take their child regardless of his or her condition.
“Right now a nonbiological parent, in order to become a parent, has to go through a long, intrusive process,” Brogan-Kator said.
 Neighbors come together after Charleston family's pride flag is burned In practice the ban hasn’t stopped New Yorkers from pursuing surrogacy — it has just forced them to go out of state, often at great additional expense. Intended parents typically pay a minimum of $80,000 in attorney fees, health care costs and compensation to the surrogate. Most physicians interpret the law as meaning they can’t conduct embryo transplants in New York, so they may also have to be away from home for some time to be present during an out-of-state transplantation. If they want to be a part of the pregnancy, that means even more travel and time away from work.
“The burden of travel is massive,” Esser, a gay dad himself, said. “A lot of intended parents really want to go to all the medical appointments, but you can’t just keep taking time off from work to visit the surrogate. You’re trying to bank your vacation time for when the baby arrives.”
Even if travel isn’t a hardship, the legal landscape can be a nightmare, as everyone involved is at the mercy of the patchwork of assisted-reproduction laws that exist across the country.
“Some states have really good, uniform laws, others have a few statutes or there’s no law at all,” Esser explained. “You’ll have some judges that enter a birth order as a matter of fact for a heterosexual married couple, but are much less inclined to do it for a single parent or same-sex couple.”
Esser said most of his clients, especially gay male couples, approach the process with enthusiasm and are resilient when facing setbacks. But the law would make the path to parenthood less fraught, he said.

Gonzalo Marroquin / Patrick McMullan via Getty Images file For Hoylman the issue is personal: His two daughters, Silvia and Lucy, were conceived with the help of a surrogate in California.
“We had to travel 3,000 miles to have our kids,” he told NBC News. “That’s part of my impulse in jumping into this issue — to protect New Yorkers having to travel to other states to become parents.”
It’s not just gay New Yorkers like Esser and Hoylman who are affected by the legal issues surrounding surrogacy — some straight couples and single parents are, too. “I think of this as an LGBT issue only in the sense that not every heterosexual couple that wants children needs to rely on assisted reproduction,” Esser explained. “Almost all same-sex families do.”
Dennis Williams, a gay man, was single when he decided to work with an out-of-state surrogate in order to become a father. And while he makes a good living, he said that the financial aspect of the experience was ""huge.”
“You miss appointments and milestones,” Williams told NBC News. “You keep calculating: ‘Can I take the day off? Can I afford a flight? Can I keep missing work? Do you want to be there to hear the heartbeat? Or when the sonogram shows the gender?’ You have to pick and choose.”
Dennis Williams and his son. Courtesy of Dennis Williams Williams used a surrogate in Kansas, where he grew up and still has family. Having a support system nearby was a boon, he said, but the situation wasn’t without complications: In Kansas, the birth mother’s name is required on a birth certificate. As a result, Williams had to stay in town for several weeks after the birth in order to go to adoption court, where his surrogate formally ceded her parental rights.
“I had to go through with the adoption of a child who was legally mine already,” he said, frustrated. “I think laws, like life, should be constantly evolving. They should match technology — and the reality of how people create families.”
“They’re not,” he continued. “They’re stuck in the past and in an antiquated mentality.”
While Williams celebrated the arrival of marriage equality, he said for LGBTQ New Yorkers it was only half of the equation.
“It’s undermined by an unevolved law that adds additional complications when we want to create our families,” he said. “For me, all of those rights need to exist together.”

Foods to eat and avoid, rules to follow The high-protein, high-fiber eating plan is sometimes also called the ""caveman"" diet. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 22, 2019, 3:16 PM UTC / Source: NBC News The quest for health and weight loss has led many people to a diet that some believe our ancestors followed, but not everyone is a fan. What is the Paleo diet? It’s been sometimes called the “caveman” diet because it’s supposed to mimic the eating style of humans who lived in the Paleolithic era — hunter-gatherers who likely ate lots of protein because of their high consumption of meat and other animal products, and plenty of fiber from non-starchy vegetables and lower-carb fruits. The diet also emphasizes a lower carbohydrate and salt intake. What can you eat on the Paleo diet? The eating plan is big on lean, grass-fed meats, wild fish, vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs and certain fruits. It also encourages monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats such as avocado and olive oil. What can you not eat on the Paleo diet? Cereal grains (including wheat, rye, oats and rice), dairy, potatoes, legumes (including beans and peanuts), refined sugar, processed foods and refined vegetable oils. This eating plan cuts out whole grains, though there’s some evidence the real “paleo diet” of humans who lived thousands of years ago might have included bread . Why is Paleo bad for you? Some experts believe a strict Paleo diet lacks nutritional balance, falling short in essential nutrients like calcium and vitamin D. Critics say eliminating entire food groups like grains and dairy is problematic. “My biggest issue is [that it] excludes things like beans that have well-established health benefits like fiber,” Marisa Moore, a registered dietitian and nutritionist, told NBC News . Many people also find it too restrictive, which can make it hard to stick with long term. There's no scientific evidence that the Paleo diet helps prevent disease. Does the Paleo diet work? The Paleo diet ranked “poorly” in U.S. News & World Report 2019 Best Diets , coming in at No. 33 out of 41 eating plans. It was considered ""extremely difficult"" to follow, ""minimally effective” when it came to heart health and lacked any good research to show that it could lead to sustainable, long-term weight loss, the magazine’s experts said ."

""Without getting too specific about how big a pay cut this would be, let’s just say I’m pretty confident that if your boss told you to take a similar pay cut, you’d tell him where to go,"" he added, noting that he ""did like the idea of serving on the Fed!""
Trump recommends Cain, but can he survive the process? April 5, 2019 04:40 Cain continued, saying that as recently as last week he told Trump he was ""all in"" and was making plans to visit Washington, D.C., and meet with senators who expressed skepticism about his nomination.
""But the cost of doing this started weighing on me over the weekend,"" he said. ""I also started wondering if I'd be giving up too much influence to get a little bit of policy impact.""
Weeks ago , Trump announced that he was planning to nominate Cain, saying he recommended him ""highly for the Fed.""
""I've told my folks that that's the man,"" Trump added, noting that Cain was going through a background check ""and I would imagine he would be in great shape.""
But the needed support for Cain's possible nomination did not materialize in the Senate. Four Republicans — Sens. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Cory Gardner of Colorado — indicated they were not in favor of his nomination, meaning that if all 47 Democrats were to vote no, Cain would not have the votes to be confirmed.
Cain made his name in the restaurant industry, where he ran the Nebraska-based Godfather’s Pizza franchise from 1986 to 1996 and has claimed his leadership saved the company from bankruptcy. He touted that experience as a conservative presidential candidate who was briefly the GOP front-runner in a crowded 2012 primary field.
But Cain ended his campaign after allegations surfaced that he had sexually harassed several women around the time he headed the National Restaurant Association from 1996 to 1999, and that he had an extramarital affair.
Cain has denied the allegations, and Trump called them an ""unfair witch hunt.""
Earlier this month , Cain posted a video to Facebook signaling that he might not make it through the confirmation process.
""You better believe that the people who hate me, who do not like conservatism ... are already digging up the negative stuff that are in stories from eight years ago,"" he said.
But the administration continued to insist his nomination was on track. In an interview with ""Fox News Sunday"" this month, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Cain's nomination was still alive and that he ""would be a great member of the Fed.""
Trump Fed pick called women playing sports with men 'a travesty' April 22, 2019 04:41 Cain told The Wall Street Journal last week that he wouldn't withdraw his name from consideration.
Cain joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in 1989, later becoming its deputy chairman and then chairman. In recent years, Cain tweeted favorably about raising interest rates — something Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed for doing last year. Additionally, Cain has promoted a return to the "" gold standard ,"" where U.S. currency would be backed by gold.
Cain's withdrawal comes as Trump's most recent Federal Reserve pick, Stephen Moore, has come under fire for reports about his back taxes and failing to make alimony payments to his ex-wife.
Trump has taken aim at the Fed over much of the past year, repeatedly criticizing the institution for its monetary policies and stewardship of the economy under Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump nominated in late 2017.
Soon after news of Cain's withdrawal, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Senate Republicans to reject Moore as well.
""Herman Cain was woefully unqualified to be on the Federal Reserve and his failure to garner adequate support should not be used as a pathway by Senate Republicans to approve Stephen Moore, who is equally unqualified, and perhaps more political,"" Schumer said. ""Mr. Moore, like Mr. Cain, poses a danger to the economic stability of our country.""

"Migrants traveling through Mexico see less support, aid",www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/migrants-traveling-through-mexico-see-less-support-aid-n997011,"MAPASTEPEC, Mexico — Madison Mendoza, her feet aching and her face burned by the sun, wept as she said she had nothing to feed her 2-year-old son who she'd brought with her on the long trek toward the United States. Mendoza, 22, said an aunt in Honduras had convinced her to join the migrant caravan, which she did two weeks ago in the capital of Tegucigalpa. The aunt said she'd have no problems, that people along the route in Mexico would help as they did for a large caravan that moved through the area in October.
But this time, the help did not come. The outpouring of aid that once greeted Central American migrants as they trekked in caravans through southern Mexico has been drying up. Hungrier, advancing slowly or not at all, and hounded by unhelpful local officials, frustration is growing among the 5,000 to 8,000 migrants in the southern state of Chiapas.
""What causes me pain is that the baby asks me for food and there are days when I can't provide it,"" said Mendoza, who fled Honduras with almost no money because she feared for her life after receiving threats from the father of her son. ""I thought that with the baby, people would help me on road.""
Members of the caravan in October received food and shelter from town governments, churches and passers-by. Drivers of trucks stopped to give them a lift. Little of that is happening this time. And local officials who once gave them temporary permits to work in Mexico, now seem to snare them in red tape. Truckers and drivers have been told they will be fined if caught transporting migrants without proper documentation.
Mendoza bathed her son, José, under a stream of water in Escuintla, a Mexican town 95 miles (150 kilometers) north of the Guatemalan border. It was the first time she has been able to bath the child since they left Tegucigalpa.
""I don't even have a peso,"" she said, teary-eyed. Many migrants are collecting mangos and fruits from trees along the route and sharing food among themselves.
Some 1,300 migrants spent the night in Escuintla and were heading north to the town of Mapastepec, Chiapas. Mendoza and José arrived in Mapastepec on Saturday. They joined thousands of stranded migrants waiting to see if local authorities provide them with a temporary permit or visa to work in Mexico or whether they would continue their trip to the U.S. border.
Heyman Vázquez, a parish priest in Huixtla, a community along the caravan's route, said local support for the Central American migrants has dried up because of an anti-migrant discourse that blames them for crime and insecurity.
""It is due to the campaign of discrimination and xenophobia created through social networks and the media that blames migrants for the insecurity in Chiapas,"" he said.
Oscar Pérez, who sells cooked pork in Ulapa, a village along the way, said people have become tired of supporting the migrants because of reports that ""they've become aggressive."" He acknowledged, however, that he doesn't know of anyone who has been attacked by a migrant.
The frustration felt by the migrants is affecting Geovani Villanueva, who has spent 25 days along with several hundred other migrants at a sports complex in Mapastepec waiting for a permit that would let him legally and safely travel north with his wife, two small children and four other relatives.
""I think it's a strategy by the government to wear us out,"" said Villanueva, 51.
Central American migrants traveling in a caravan wash clothes and take baths in a river near Mapastepec in Mexico on April 21, 2019. Moises Castillo / AP The latest caravan is heading north during Holy Week in Latin America, when many activists organize processions to dramatize the hardships and needs of migrants. Caravans became a popular way of making the trek because the migrants find safety in numbers and save money by not hiring smugglers.
Mexico is under pressure from the Trump administration to thwart them from reaching the U.S. border. In April, President Donald Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border before changing course and threatening tariffs on automobiles produced in Mexico if that country does not stop the flow of Central American migrants.
U.S. border facilities have been overwhelmed by the number of migrant families. U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced recent that 53,000 parents and children were apprehended at the border in March.
Nancy Valladares, who is from the city of Progreso in Honduras, is part of the caravan that reached Mapastepec. She is traveling with her husband and two daughters in baby carriages.
She said the family hoped to reach the U.S. and find help for her 2-year-old daughter Belen, who she says was born with microcephaly due to a Zika infection, and cannot walk or talk.
Valladares complained that they weren't able to find anyone to give them a ride, and when her family and scores of other migrants climbed on to a truck-trailer in Escuintla, federal police forced them to get down and walk.
Tired and angry, many migrants no longer want to talk to reporters.
Villanueva, who owned several small stores back in Honduras, said he left his homeland because gangs had threatened to kill him after he refused to pay extortion.
He said he left to save his life and one thing is clear to him: there is no turning back.

Trump administration moves to cut off Iranian oil exports,www.nbcnews.com,Dan De Luce,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-administration-moves-cut-iranian-oil-exports-n997006,"The Trump administration said Monday it will scrap all waivers that allowed eight governments to buy Iranian oil without facing U.S. sanctions — a move designed to choke off Tehran's oil revenue. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned foreign countries and companies that Washington would enforce U.S. sanctions banning the purchase of Iranian oil without exception, saying the Trump administration was intent on depriving Tehran of funds to build ballistic missiles and back its proxies in the Middle East.
""Any nation or entity interacting with Iran should do its diligence and err on the side of caution. The risks are simply not going to be worth the benefits,"" Pompeo said at a news conference.
U.S. announces sanctions for countries who keep importing Iranian oil April 22, 2019 01:17 The news prompted a surge in oil prices. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose $2.26, or 3.1 percent, to $74.23 per barrel on Monday.
The policy shift affects Japan, South Korea, Turkey, China and India. The three other countries that had been granted oil sanctions waivers — Taiwan, Italy and Greece — have already stopped purchasing Iranian oil.
The decision came after an internal debate in the Trump administration in recent months over how far to squeeze Iran's oil exports and after demands from Republican lawmakers, led by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, that the White House make good on its tough rhetoric on Iran. Administration officials last year had been anxious to avoid jolting oil markets and causing a potential spike in gasoline prices in the U.S.
The move raised the risk of aggravating relations with allies such as India, which has been one of Iran's biggest oil customers, and raising tensions with China at a moment when Washington is trying to negotiate a major trade deal. The Trump administration is also looking to Beijing to help push North Korea to agree to abandon its nuclear and missile arsenal in return for a relaxation of economic sanctions.
Iran dismissed the U.S. decision, saying it has always regarded the sanctions as illegal.
Pompeo: 'We will no longer grant any exemptions' to sanctions on Iran April 22, 2019 01:47 In a statement posted by the IRNA news agency, the foreign ministry said Iran was carrying out consultations with European and other international partners” on the sanctions and that it would make an unspecified announcement later on the issue.
Iran has said it has withstood U.S. economic pressure in the past and is well-positioned to absorb this latest round of sanctions. ""We've survived against the United States, against the will of the United States for the last 40 years, and I believe we will survive for the next 40 years,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said in December in Doha, adding that Tehran has perfected ""the art of evading sanctions.""
In a sharply worded tweet, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu criticized the Trump administration's policy shift, which was first reported by the Washington Post on Sunday.
""The #US decision to end sanctions waivers on #Iran oil imports will not serve regional peace and stability, yet will harm Iranian people. #Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbors,"" Cavusoglu posted on Twitter .
Ibrahim Kalin, a senior adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told reporters last week that Turkey ""expected"" another extension from the U.S. but said his government had been offered no assurances.
As of March, Iran exported about a million of barrels of oil a day, down from about 2.5 million last year.
President Donald Trump last year pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers. The accord had imposed strict limits on Iran's nuclear program in return for lifting U.S. and economic sanctions on the regime. But the Trump administration had condemned the agreement as deeply flawed, arguing it did not address Iran's support for militants in the Middle East or its ballistic missile program.
When Washington reimposed sanctions in November on Iranian oil exports it granted waivers to the eight governments. The current waivers expire on May 2.
Pompeo said the U.S. had made the decision after receiving assurances from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that it would ensure an adequate supply of oil for the global market.
""I can confirm that each of those suppliers are working directly with Iran's former customers to make the transition away from Iranian crude less disruptive,"" Pompeo said.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in a statement that his country would work with other oil producers ""to ensure adequate supplies are available to consumers while ensuring the global oil market does not go out of balance.""
Pompeo and other U.S. officials said oil sanctions were the most important tool at Washington's disposal to apply economic pressure on Iran.
""This is the biggest leverage we have on the Islamic Republic of Iran, is their oil exports,"" Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, told reporters. ""And if you want to seek a change in behavior you have to show seriousness of purpose on the oil.""
Pompeo said current sanctions have already damaged Iran's finances and deprived its partners in Syria and Lebanon of cash.
""So we have watched Iran have diminished power as a result of our campaign. Their capacity to wreak harm around the world is absolutely clearly diminished,"" he said.
Iran has accused the Trump administration of causing a shortage of medicine due to economic sanctions and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid as the country suffers from devastating floods.
U.S. officials also said that 2018 had seen a tight oil market but that the market's outlook this year was more positive and could absorb the loss of the Iranian exports.
Behnam Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies think tank which favors tough sanctions on Tehran, said he was not surprised by Iran's dismissive response to the decision not to reissue the waivers.
""Tehran is currently gambling that it can wait out the Trump administration's pressure policy and does not need to talk,"" said Taleblu.
Iran has engaged in sharp rhetoric since Trump entered office but it has not taken actions to upset the status quo, Taleblu said. Tehran has so far chosen to stay in compliance with the nuclear accord despite Washington’s withdrawal, abiding by prohibitions on sensitive nuclear activities.
Trump administration officials did not say if the U.S. would renew waivers that allow Iran to receive international assistance designed to ensure three nuclear sites are used for purely civilian purposes, including one at the Fordow facility near the city of Qom. The issue has divided administration officials.
Some Republican hardliners in Congress, including Sen. Cruz, have urged the administration to end the waivers for civilian nuclear projects.
Other experts who support the 2015 deal say discarding the civilian nuclear waivers could allow Iran to operate those sites with less scrutiny, possibly bolstering any attempt by Tehran to prepare the ground for building atomic weapons.
Pompeo's announcement came after he privately told a group of Iranian-Americans in Dallas that Washington was not seeking to topple the Iranian regime through military action, according to an Axios report.
Asked about the report, Pompeo told reporters Monday that ""we've made it clear to the Iran's leaders that if Americans are attacked we will respond in a serious way.""
He also said the U.S. supports the aspirations of the Iranian people but did not support any opposition group outside of Iran, including the People's Mujahedin of Iran, or the MEK. National security adviser John Bolton and Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have spoken at events in the past organized by the MEK, which was previously designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization.

Recovering an erased history: The Chinese railroad workers who helped connect the country,www.nbcnews.com,Chris Fuchs,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/recovering-erased-history-chinese-railroad-workers-who-helped-connect-country-n991136,"They thought this was their chance. May 10, 1969, marked 100 years since the golden spike was hammered in at Promontory, Utah, signifying the completion of America’s first transcontinental railroad — a monumental engineering feat that linked together the nation's coasts.
A ceremony commemorating the anniversary drew a crowd of around 20,000. Among the attendees were Philip P. Choy, president of the San Francisco-based Chinese Historical Society of America, and Thomas W. Chinn, one of its founders.
Centennial officials had agreed to set aside five minutes of the ceremony for the society to pay homage to the Chinese workers who had helped build the railroad, but whose contributions had been largely glossed over in history. Choy, Chinn and the others gathered at Promontory that day had hoped this would be the moment when the more than 10,000 Chinese who labored for the Central Pacific Railroad finally got their due.
They didn’t.
“Who else but Americans could drill 10 tunnels in mountains 30 feet deep in snow?” then-Transportation Secretary John A. Volpe said in his speech, according to a May 12, 1969, San Francisco Chronicle article .
“Who else but Americans could chisel through miles of solid granite? Who else but Americans could have laid 10 miles of track in 12 hours?”
Volpe’s remarks referenced some of the backbreaking and deadly work done on the Central Pacific by a labor force that was almost 90 percent Chinese, many of them migrants from China, ineligible to become U.S. naturalized citizens under federal law.
But the ceremony featured nothing more than a “ passing mention of the Chinese .” The five minutes promised to the society never happened.
Choy and Chinn were incensed.
“Short of cussing at those people ... I was beside myself,” Choy, who passed away in 2017, recalled during a 2013 interview .
This May, for the 150th anniversary, descendants of the Chinese railroad laborers and other advocates have been working hard to ensure history does not repeat itself. Among the events planned around the sesquicentennial is the 2019 Golden Spike Conference , organized by the Chinese Railroad Workers Descendants Association, which will feature workshops, lectures, tours and a musical by Jason Ma entitled “Gold Mountain.”
“It is the best opportunity I will have in my lifetime to have this story shared, to have it understood and appreciated by people outside our community,” said Michael Kwan, the association’s president, whose great-great grandfather worked for the Central Pacific.
Leaders of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroad lines meet and shake hands in this iconic photograph taken by Andrew J. Russell on May 10, 1869. Previous scholars and historians believed that there were no Chinese workers in this photo, but Stanford researchers identified two of them in the crowd. Stanford Historical Photograph Collection / Stanford University Libraries AN EXPERIMENT YIELDS SUCCESS The Central Pacific broke ground on the first transcontinental railroad Jan. 8, 1863, and built east from Sacramento. The Union Pacific Railroad pushed west from Council Bluffs, Iowa (bordering Omaha), where their rails joined existing eastern lines. Acts of Congress provided both companies with land grants and financing.
The first transcontinental railroad became a boon to the economy of a nation recovering from a civil war, shaving significant travel time across the continent from several months to about a week. Produce and natural resources were among the things that could now be moved more quickly and cheaply from coast to coast.
It also generated tremendous wealth for railroad tycoons such as Leland Stanford, a former California governor who ran under an anti-Chinese immigrant platform. Stanford also served as president of the Central Pacific and later established the university that bears his name.
To grow its workforce, the Central Pacific took out an advertisement in January 1865 seeking 5,000 railroad laborers, but only a few hundred whites responded, according to “The Chinese and the Iron Road: Building the Transcontinental Railroad,” a book scheduled for release in April and edited by Gordon H. Chang and Shelley Fisher Fishkin, co-directors of the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project at Stanford University.
Many whites who took the jobs did so for only a time, reluctant to shoulder the demanding and hazardous work expected of them. Eventually, they headed to the Nevada silver mines for better wages and the prospect of striking it rich, Hilton Obenzinger, the project’s associate director, said.

Hart Photographs, 1862-1869 / Department of Special Collections, Stanford University Libraries Facing a labor shortage, the railroad may have turned to recruiting Chinese at the suggestion of Central Pacific construction contractor Charles Crocker’s brother, E.B., a California Supreme Court justice and an attorney for the company. The Chinese had earlier worked on other California railroads as well as the Central Pacific in small numbers , according to the project.
But the plan hit opposition amid anti-Chinese sentiment that stemmed from the California Gold Rush. Among those initially against it was the Central Pacific construction supervisor, James H. Strobridge.
“He didn’t think they were strong enough,” Obenzinger told NBC News in a 2017 interview.
Strobridge also worried that the whites wouldn’t labor alongside the Chinese, who he thought lacked the brainpower to perform the work as well.
Eventually, he yielded and in 1865 the Central Pacific tested out 50 Chinese laborers. They were among the 50,000 to 60,000 Chinese living in California who arrived in the early 1850s to work in mining and other sectors of the American West, according to the project. They hailed from Sacramento, San Francisco and the gold-mining towns of the Sierra Nevada.
The success of the experiment led the Central Pacific to hire additional Chinese workers, but the Chinese labor pool in California soon ran out. So the company arranged with labor contractors to bring workers directly from China, mostly from Guangdong province in the south.
A camp of Chinese workers near Brown's Station of the Central Pacific Railroad. Alfred A. Hart Photographs, 1862-1869 / Department of Special Collections, Stanford University Libraries At the time, it was a region enmeshed in political and social turmoil, but residents there often had contact with foreigners and were less fearful of taking long ocean voyages, making them good recruits, according to Fishkin.
“And particularly for sons who were not the first sons in the families, it often made more sense to try to seek your fortune abroad,” Fishkin added.
By the end of July 1865, boatloads of Chinese were arriving in San Francisco. Less than two years later, almost 90 percent of the Central Pacific workforce was Chinese; the rest were of European-American descent, mostly Irish. At its highest point, between 10,000 and 15,000 Chinese were working on the Central Pacific, with perhaps as many as 20,000 in total over time.
The Union Pacific, by contrast, had no Chinese laborers during the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. They instead relied on Civil War veterans and East Coast immigrants, among others, according to Chang.
THE LIVES THEY LIVED “The Chinese and the Iron Road: Building the Transcontinental Railroad” and Chang’s separate book “ Ghosts of Gold Mountain: The Epic Story of the Chinese Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad ,” which is scheduled to be released in May, both describe the Chinese taking on some of the most dangerous, most exhausting assignments for less pay (and worse treatment) than their Euro-American counterparts.
Often toiling in extreme weather, they cleared obstructions, moved earth, bored tunnels and built retaining walls — work done virtually all by hand. They became experts in drayage, masonry, carpentry and track laying. Sometimes they were lowered off cliffs to plant explosive charges when blasting was necessary, knowing that once the fuse was lit the difference between life and death hinged on how fast they were brought back up.
But it wasn’t just the blasting that was dangerous.
“There were occasions when avalanches buried workers in snow and they weren’t found until the snow melted the following spring,” Fishkin said.
Workers blast a 60-foot-deep cut above Alta, California. Alfred A. Hart Photographs, 1862-1869 / Department of Special Collections, Stanford University Libraries Since records of worker deaths weren’t kept, Stanford scholars don’t know precisely how many Chinese died building the railroad. They estimate there were hundreds, possibly more than a thousand.
Though they have discovered evidence that many workers were able to read and write in Chinese, Stanford researchers have found no letters or journals from them, perhaps because they were destroyed or not preserved during the ensuing social upheaval in China.
Despite this, the Chinese Railroad Workers Project has been able to glean insight into aspects of the laborers’ lives through their research.
They know, for instance, that the Chinese boiled water for tea, which helped stave off dysentery and other waterborne illnesses. They also know the men set up camps along the worksites, didn’t imbibe too much alcohol, worked well together, and sent money back to their families in China.
They even staged a strike in June 1867 demanding pay equal to whites, shorter workdays, and better working conditions, an action that helped counter the image that the Chinese were docile and wouldn’t fight for their rights.
Related News News 150 years ago, Chinese railroad workers staged the era's largest labor strike From tunneling through solid granite to laying down 10 miles of track in a day, the Chinese workers proved their mettle time and again.
Even Leland Stanford, whose anti-Chinese views were central to his gubernatorial campaign, changed his tune.
“He comes to have open respect for the abilities, the work ethic, the talents and the hard work, the industriousness of the Chinese,” Chang said.
But at times Stanford, who was later elected to the U.S. Senate, still resurrected certain anti-Chinese rhetoric when running for or in office, Chang noted.
“Stanford became one of the wealthiest men in the world because of their labor,” he said. “But there’s also lots of evidence to show that the Stanfords had an affection for many of the Chinese, especially in their employ. So it wasn’t just an exploitative relationship.”
A HISTORY ERASED, A HISTORY RECOVERED After completing the first transcontinental railroad in 1869, Chinese laborers fanned out across the United States to work on at least 71 other rail lines, according to Fishkin.
This came amid rising anti-Chinese sentiment and violence in the U.S., as whites blamed the Chinese for squeezing them out of jobs by accepting work at lower wages.
Owing to white hostility, tens of thousands of Chinese were forced to leave the U.S. by 1882, according to “The Chinese and the Iron Road.” That same year, Congress responded by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act , the first and only major federal law to explicitly suspend immigration for a specific nationality. It wasn’t repealed until 1943.
It is the best opportunity I will have in my lifetime to have this story shared, to have it understood and appreciated by people outside our community.
Michael Kwan
Almost a quarter of a century later, in 1969, amid the backdrop of the civil rights movement, Choy and Chinn found themselves at Promontory Point, Utah, waiting for a moment that never came.
Since that day, advocates have continued working toward giving Chinese railroad laborers the recognition they deserve, in an effort to recover a period of history that connects China and the U.S.
In 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor inducted Chinese railroad workers into its Hall of Honor . Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders elected to Congress in record numbers are among supporters of a House resolution to recognize the workers and their contributions. And a commemorative postage stamp in their honor has been proposed as well.
There’s also the Chinese Railroad Workers Memorial Project , which has raised at least a quarter of a million dollars for a monument, and the Chinese Railroad Workers Descendants Association, whose members visit Utah schools to teach kids about the Chinese laborers.
Even artists, photographers, journalists and academics from China, as well as scholars from Taiwan and those with Stanford’s Chinese Railroad Workers Project, have immersed themselves in the topic.
“We want to make sure that this doesn’t end on May 10th,” Kwan, the descendants association president, said.

Gender 'X': Nevada to allow nonbinary people to self-identify on IDs,www.nbcnews.com,Kate Sosin,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/gender-x-nevada-allow-nonbinary-people-self-identify-ids-n997051,"OUT Politics and Policy Gender 'X': Nevada to allow nonbinary people to self-identify on IDs Nevada’s new driver's license and state ID policy should serve as a “model for the rest of the country,” transgender advocate Ray Mcfarlane said. April 22, 2019, 4:12 PM UTC By Kate Sosin and Nico Lang Nevada has become the 10th state to permit gender-neutral IDs for transgender, nonbinary and intersex residents. Starting Monday, residents of the Silver State can obtain “X” gender markers on driver's licenses and state ID cards, in addition to the traditional “M” and “F” markers for male and female. According to Alexandra Walden, public information officer at the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, the efforts have been years in the making. “The Nevada DMV staff have been working diligently for quite some time in order to offer the nonbinary or ‘gender X’ option to Nevadans,” Walden told NBC News in a statement. Nevada also offers gender-neutral birth certificates for residents. Related NBC OUT New hope rises for would-be LGBTQ parents in New York The new state IDs come on the heels of a progressive policy change last June that allowed applicants to update their ID gender marker without a court order, doctor’s note or corrected birth certificate proving their lived gender identity. That policy of allowing trans people to effectively self-identify their gender now applies to those seeking “X” gender markers, as Walden confirmed. The changes are the result of the efforts of advocacy and education organization Transgender Allies Group, which asked the DMV to consider a series of policy updates around IDs for trans people. “Up until recently, the gender binary was the norm throughout our society,” Brooke Maylath, the group’s president, said. “That leaves a lot of people out. You want an identification system that is authentic on a bureaucracy point, but also is flexible enough that it allows people to tell the bureaucracy who you are.” Since Nevada first added gender identity to a list of protected categories in employment discrimination back in 2011, the state’s DMV said it has been working diligently to expand the means by which trans and nonbinary identities can be fully recognized. Related Politics Supreme Court to rule whether civil rights law bans discrimination against LGBTQ employees In 2016, the Nevada Department of Public and Behavioral Health announced it would begin allowing transgender people to update their birth certificates from male to female or vice versa by submitting a sworn affidavit testifying to their gender identity — waiving the surgical requirement common in other states. It could also be written on their behalf by someone who knows them. “We had intended all along to add the gender marker X, but it was a matter of computer programming,” Kevin Malone, DMV public information officer, said. Prior to Monday’s rollout, DMVs across the state were sent a memo on the new policy. The instructions reminded government employees who issue licenses and IDs that gender and sex are protected classes under Nevada law “but also a personal choice.” “It is not the responsibility of the DMV to question an applicant’s gender choice,” it states. “As we all know, we cannot assume a person’s gender based on a person’s appearance.” Ray Mcfarlane, the transgender and gender diversity program manager at the LGBTQ community space The Center in Las Vegas, said Nevada’s new ID policy should serve as a “model for the rest of the country.” By lifting the requirement of a court order or birth certificate, Mcfarlane noted, it ensures that trans and nonbinary people are able to access affirming documentation without a costly and time-consuming legal process. “All states should let people self-identify,” Mcfarlane said. “The process should be accessible. It should be easy. It should be low cost.” Of the nine other states and Washington, D.C., that permit a third gender option on state IDs and driver’s licenses, only Oregon and the District of Columbia allow applicants to self-identify their gender. Mcfarlane said it costs about $270 to obtain a court order, an often prohibitive expense. Trans individuals are twice as likely as the average American to live in poverty, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. Easing the burden of updating their IDs will help trans and nonbinary people navigate the process of correcting all their documentation. The center’s 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that only 11 percent of respondents had their preferred name and gender on all of their IDs. “Being able to change the gender marker on your ID is one of the most accessible first steps that people can advocate for themselves,” Mcfarlane claimed. “Depending on where your birth certificate is, that costs more and takes longer. Sometimes the paperwork is across state lines.” Related NBC OUT Choice of Pence as graduation speaker divides evangelical university Jane Heenan, the founder and clinical director for Gender Justice Nevada, suggested the state could further simplify the gender-marker process by removing gender from IDs and driver’s licenses altogether. “While I do intend to go and have my license changed to reflect this new designation, I wonder what the state's interest is in labeling anybody in a sex and gender context on identity documents,” Heenan told NBC News. “I don't understand the state's interest in doing so. It wasn't that long ago that the state required persons to list an ethnic label on driver's licenses.” Walden said the state has to keep gender markers on IDs due to federal requirements, but otherwise agrees with Heenan. But until those requirements are waived, she explained, “Whatever they put on the paper is what we put in the system.” “Truthfully, why make it difficult?” Walden asked. “Who are we to stand in the way?” Nevada now joins D.C., Arkansas, California, Colorado, Indiana , Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Utah and Vermont in permitting gender-neutral driver’s licenses and other state IDs (Vermont’s policy will roll out this summer). Gender-neutral birth certificates are now permitted in New York City and several states, including California , New Jersey , Oregon , Washington and Nevada ."
Disney heiress calls CEO Bob Iger's $65.6 million compensation 'insane',www.nbcnews.com,"Lauren Feiner, CNBC",04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/disney-heiress-calls-ceo-bob-iger-s-65-6-million-n997046,"Disney CEO Bob Iger’s $65.6 million total compensation is “insane,” according to Abigail Disney, granddaughter of the company’s co-founder. The Disney heiress and philanthropist criticized the gap between Iger’s fiscal 2018 pay and that of his employees at the Fast Company Impact Council on Thursday . A recent Equilar study found Iger ’s pay was 1,424 times that of the median Disney employee.
It’s not the first time the Disney heiress and philanthropist has criticized CEO pay. In March, Disney stopped short of commenting on Iger’s pay in an interview on CNBC’s “ Squawk Box , ” but said, “If your CEO salary is at the 700, 600, 500 times your median workers’ pay, there is nobody on Earth, Jesus Christ himself isn’t worth 500 times his median workers’ pay.”
In a series of tweets Saturday, Disney made clear she is a fan of Iger although she disagrees with his pay level.
Let me very clear. I like Bob Iger. I do NOT speak for my family but only for myself. Other than owning shares (not that many) I have no more say in what happens there than anyone else. But by any objective measure a pay ratio over a thousand is insane. https://t.co/O34OjXd6rr

Trump says he's 'not even a little bit' concerned about being impeached,www.nbcnews.com,Lauren Egan,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-he-s-not-even-little-bit-concerned-about-n997071,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday that he was not worried at all about impeachment, less than a week after a redacted version of special report was made public and as talk of trying to remove him from office has been increasing among Democrats in Congress. ""Not even a little bit,"" Trump said to reporters at the annual White House Easter egg roll when asked whether he was concerned about the possibility.
Since the release of Mueller's findings, Democrats have been conflicted on what the next steps should be.
Trump 'not even a little bit' worried about impeachment April 22, 2019 01:53 Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a 2020 presidential candidate, have called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings. But other Democrats have warned of the political risk of trying to remove the president.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has urged a wait-and-see approach so lawmakers have a chance to read the full Mueller report and supporting documents.
Trump also told reporters on Monday that he was not concerned about White House staffers' ignoring his orders, even though the Mueller report details how aides sometimes refused to comply with the president's directions to interfere with the special counsel investigation.
Most notably, the report states that then-White House counsel Don McGahn refused to follow through on Trump's request to pressure Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to remove Mueller.
""Nobody disobeys my orders,"" Trump said to reporters on Monday.
During the White House Easter egg roll event, a young attendee appeared to ask Trump about the progress on his U.S.-Mexico border wall.
""Oh, it's happening. It's being built now,"" Trump responded, adding ""a young guy just said 'keep building that wall.' You believe this? He's gonna be a conservative someday.""

Publisher Random House confirmed Monday that ""The Beautiful Ones"" will combine Prince's unfinished manuscript with rare photos, scrapbooks and lyrics.
Announced just weeks before his 2016 death, the 288-page book, issued in partnership with the late artist's estate, will include an introduction by New Yorker writer Dan Piepenbring, whom Prince had chosen as a collaborator. In 2018, literary agent Esther Newberg told Variety that Prince had completed more than 50 handwritten pages.
""'The Beautiful Ones' is the deeply personal account of how Prince Rogers Nelson became the Prince we know: the real-time story of a kid absorbing the world around him and creating a persona, an artistic vision, and a life, before the hits and the fame that would come to define him,"" Random House announced.
The book will span from Prince's childhood to his early years as a musician to the cusp of international stardom, using Prince's own writings, a scrapbook of his personal photos, and the original handwritten lyric sheets for many of his most iconic songs, which he kept at Paisley Park.
Piepenbring's introduction will touch upon Prince's final days, ""a time when Prince was thinking deeply about how to reveal more of himself and his ideas to the world, while retaining the mystery and mystique he'd so carefully cultivated,"" according to the announcement.
Prince died in April of 2016 of an accidental drug overdose.

""Directly to the killer — who may be in this room — we believe you are hiding in plain sight,"" Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter said during a news conference. ""We likely have interviewed you or someone close to you.""
""For more than two years, you never thought we would shift gears, but we have,"" he said. ""We know this is about power to you, and you want to know what we know. And one day you will.""
Police reveal new clues in murders of teen girls in Indiana April 22, 2019 01:46 Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, vanished while hiking in their hometown of Delphi, about 60 miles northwest of Indianapolis, in February 2017. Their bodies were found in the woods the day after they disappeared.
Carter said Monday that their murderer likely lived in, worked in or often visited Delphi, a city of about 3,000 people.
He said investigators were looking for tips on a vehicle parked next to an abandoned building near Hoosier Heartland Highway the day the girls went missing.
Police also released a new sketch of the suspect, which bears little resemblance to the one they released in July 2017.
""We have a witness. You made mistakes. We are coming for you and there's no place for a heartless coward like you to hide that gets his thrill from killing little girls,"" Carter said in a statement accompanying the new information.
Indiana police to Delphi murderer: 'We believe you are hiding in plain sight' April 22, 2019 03:07 Investigators, at first, released two grainy photos of a person walking on an old railroad bridge the girls had visited on their hiking trip, along with audio of a male saying, ""Down the hill."" The evidence had come from Liberty's cellphone.
Police on Monday released more evidence obtained from Liberty's cellphone — a longer audio clip, in which the same male seems to be saying ""guys"" and video of the person walking on the bridge.
Carter encouraged Delphi residents to ""watch the person's mannerisms as they walk"" so they could determine whether it might be someone they know.
He vowed that he would not give up on the investigation. ""We are just beginning. We are just now beginning,"" he said. ""We will not stop.""

Texas cancer center ousts 3 scientists over Chinese data theft concerns,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/texas-cancer-center-ousts-3-scientists-over-chinese-data-theft-n997151,"A prominent cancer center in Houston has ousted three of five scientists whom federal authorities identified as being involved in Chinese efforts to steal American research. The MD Anderson Cancer Center moved to fire the scientists, whose names were not released, after the National Institutes of Health (NIH) contacted at least 55 medical research institutions to report the names of researchers suspected of sharing federally-funded research with China or other foreign governments, the NIH said.
""When NIH notified MD Anderson of concerns with specific individuals within its institution, the university took immediate steps to remediate the problem,"" the NIH said in a statement.
""These incidents are not unique to MD Anderson and we remind universities to look closely at their organizations to mitigate unscrupulous practices by foreign entities that aim to capitalize on the collaborative nature of the U.S. biomedical enterprise.""
The NIH told MD Anderson officials it had concerns about a total of five researchers.
Two of them resigned ahead of termination proceedings, and the third is challenging the dismissal, the NIH said.
A fourth was reprimanded but not terminated. One other MD Anderson researcher is still under investigation. according to the NIH.
""As stewards of taxpayer dollars invested in biomedical research, we have an obligation to follow up,"" Peter Pisters, the president of MD Anderson Cancer Center, said.
Science Magazine was first to report the NIH letters and ousted MD Anderson researchers.
Of the five researchers, three had ties to a talent recruitment program called ""Thousand Talents,"" which is managed by the Chinese government and linked by U.S. intelligence to espionage, according to compliance reports summarizing the investigations and reviewed by NBC News.
The NIH cited the program as an area of concern in its letters to the 55 medical research institutions. The NIH is planning to contact additional medical research facilities detailing concerns over faculty members' links to foreign governments.
An NBC News review of heavily redacted MD Anderson investigation reports show they include detailed payment information from Chinese universities and diagrams documenting how the Thousand Talents program participates in a quid-pro-quo scheme that compensates doctors for intellectual property.
One report said the investigator found ""compelling evidence"" that an MD Anderson doctor also held a compensated position at a Chinese university that paid a monthly subsidy of $30,000 RMB or $4,322.
The reports show that MD Anderson, after gaining access to some of the researchers' email accounts, discovered documents that showed signed consulting agreements with Chinese entities.
The NIH made a presentation last December that focused on foreign influences on research integrity. The NIH specifically highlighted the Thousand Talents program, including a case at Duke University that was previously reported by NBC News.
""The focus of current concern is China - but this issue is not unique to China,"" the NIH said in its Powerpoint presentation.
Before the MD Anderson moved to remove the researchers, a separate medical doctor left the facility while under a federal investigation.
Dr. Keping Xie, 55, a gastroenterology professor, is suspected of funneling advanced research from the facility to the Chinese government, according to U.S. officials briefed on the probe.
Xie had been charged by local law enforcement with possession of child pornography, but those charges were eventually dropped.
Xie’s attorney, Nathan Mays, told NBC News at the time that Xie vehemently denied the child pornography charges and said he was unaware of any investigation into Xie by federal authorities for any type of espionage.
Xie had also been a member of the Thousand Talents program.
When NBC News reported on Dr. Xie’s case last October, congressman Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said he had been briefed on the investigation. “This is a systematic effort by the Chinese government to get into our medical facilities, our research development facilities, academics as well,” McCaul said .
Shortly before Xie was charged in August, the FBI Houston field office conducted an unprecedented public briefing with leaders of Houston's medical, science, and academic institutions.
In announcing the briefing, the bureau said, ""The FBI works closely with private partners and government agencies to ensure that federally funded research grants are guarded and protected against unscrupulous overseas enemies."" The press release did not cite a specific case.
At the briefing, Pisters, the head of the MD Anderson Cancer Center, said: ""We have an obligation to the people of Texas — and to all people facing a cancer diagnosis — to do everything possible to protect our resources and to safely and securely advance our mission to end cancer.""
An unclassified FBI memo obtained by NBC News says, ""Chinese Talent Programs pose a serious threat to U.S. businesses and universities through economic espionage and theft of IP.""
The memo cites a case involving a Chinese national who was convicted of stealing an experimental drug from the Medical College of Wisconsin. The drug is used to treat cancer.
Some Chinese Americans say the crackdown amounts to racial profiling and that it hinders groundbreaking research.
""Scientific research depends on the free flow of ideas,"" Frank H. Wu, president of the New York-based Committee of 100, a group of influential Chinese Americans, told the newspaper. ""Our national interest is best advanced by welcoming people, not by racial stereotyping based on where a person comes from.""

"Evan McMullin: Mueller report proves Trump failed to sound the alarm on Russia, an impeachable offense",www.nbcnews.com,Evan McMullin,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/mueller-report-proves-trump-failed-sound-alarm-russia-impeachable-offense-ncna997076,"As with many Americans, I began reading special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian election interference as soon as it was released. As a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, I couldn’t help but see the events it recounts the way that President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, would have viewed them as they happened. What the report revealed, page after page, was President Donald Trump and his campaign’s efforts to profit from the most “sweeping and systematic” — to use the words of the report — information warfare attack ever waged against the United States of America.
Trump and his team were uniquely positioned to sound the alarm and halt the Russian attack, but instead they welcomed it.
Trump and his team were uniquely positioned to sound the alarm and halt the Russian attack, but instead they welcomed it. And then they tried to obstruct efforts to investigate it . As such, Trump bears distinct responsibility for our failure to defend against Russia’s hostility and take the steps necessary to deter future threats.
SIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE
To ensure that his betrayal and obstruction, and the foreign hostility it invites, do not become the new status quo in America, Trump must be held accountable. This means we must convene public hearings in Congress leading to impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives . We must send an unmistakable message to our adversaries that we will not tolerate attempts to sabotage our democracy and upend the rule of law. It’s not an exaggeration to say that our freedom requires it.
As a former CIA officer, I know that foreign intelligence officers regularly try to infiltrate and manipulate American politics, but what kind of American wouldn’t, out of patriotic duty alone, reject and report a foreign offer to collaborate against our country? The very thought of such betrayal has always sat like a pit in my stomach. Having read Mueller’s report over the past few days, I’m left with that same awful feeling.
Giuliani says 'nothing wrong' with taking information from Russia after Mueller report April 21, 2019 01:50 The document contains more than 100 pages detailing numerous contacts between Kremlin representatives and the Trump campaign. And not just contacts, but textbook Russian offers of illicit collaboration.
According to the report, Ivanka Trump received an offer of campaign assistance in November 2015 on behalf of Dmitry Klokov, a Russian with ties to the government. Later, Klokov spoke with Trump Organization attorney, Michael Cohen, and again offered assistance, claiming he could offer the campaign “political synergy” and “synergy on a government level.”
In late April 2016, Kremlin associate Joseph Mifsud informed Trump foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos that the Russian government had “dirt” on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of stolen emails, which it could use to help the campaign.
In June 2016, Donald Trump Jr. famously received an offer from a Russian prosecutor dangling “information that would incriminate Hillary Clinton,” which was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump...” Trump Jr. responded, “…if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”
In early August, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort went even further, providing polling data, messaging strategy and his thoughts on the battleground states Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Minnesota to Russian intelligence associate Konstantin Kilimnik.
And of course, worst of all was candidate Trump himself, who by late summer of 2016 knew in advance of, and was preparing to capitalize on, impending Wikileaks dumps of his opponents’ hacked emails, not to mention his public call for Russian hacking in July .
The Mueller report documents countless Kremlin efforts to probe and test the Trump campaign while offering its assistance. In encounter after encounter, Trump and his campaign entertained and encouraged Kremlin election interference with a wink and a nod, and sometimes more than that. Not once did Trump or his staff report Moscow to authorities. Not a single time.
One phone call to the FBI, one stern declaration that Putin’s meddling in American elections would result in punishment, likely would have stopped, or at least stymied, Russia’s efforts. But Mueller’s report makes clear that wasn’t the outcome Trump desired.
In encounter after encounter, Trump and his campaign entertained and encouraged Kremlin election interference with a wink and a nod, and sometimes more than that.
Rejecting and reporting illicit overtures from our adversaries is critical because those two actions together convey unmistakable loyalty to America, while their absence reveals openness to hostile foreign activity. We should be able to expect at least that much from anyone aspiring to the presidency.
From the likely perspective of Vladimir Putin, the Trump campaign was flashing a clear, consistent green light; Moscow could escalate its attack without fear of significant consequences as long as it succeeded in electing Trump. Trump’s opposition to imposing stronger sanctions against Russia since has proven this assumption to be correct.
Some excuse the president, citing his ignorance about matters of government. But FBI counterintelligence experts warned the president in August 2016 that Moscow would try to infiltrate his campaign. It didn’t change a thing. It’s not hard to imagine why, given his contempt for American democratic norms, his desire to win at all costs and the Trump Tower Moscow deal he was pursuing at the same time.
Amb. McFaul reacts to scale of Russian election interference detailed in Mueller report April 19, 2019 03:51 Had the president done what almost any patriotic American would have done — reject Russia’s approaches and report them to the authorities — he would have reduced Moscow’s willingness to continue by signaling that doing so would trigger serious consequences, no matter who won the election. Instead, Trump chose his own political and financial interests over our national security and the basic democratic rights of all Americans.
More than anything, the absence of foreign influence in our democratic processes depends on our leaders’ widely understood rejection of it. Absent that, interference from abroad could become the new norm in America, in which our democracy, our economy and our rights are for sale to the highest bidder.
Mueller did his job; now we the people and our representatives in Congress must do ours. Because our commander-in-chief betrayed us by failing to reject help from a hostile foreign adversary in 2016 and obstructing resulting investigations, we must now reject it ourselves and uphold the rule of law. Our representatives in Congress must hear Mueller and others’ public testimony and commence impeachment proceedings for these patriotic purposes.

Easter Bunny throws punches in Orlando brawl caught on video,www.nbcnews.com,David K. Li,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/easter-bunny-throws-punches-orlando-brawl-caught-video-n997156,"A man in an Easter Bunny suit hopped to the defense of a woman and started throwing punches during a brawl Sunday night in Orlando, Florida, that was captured on video. Bunny bystander Antoine McDonald insisted that he had no choice but to join the fray after seeing the woman getting punched.
And witness Lindsey Edwards said he saw the man spit on the woman just before they began scuffling and McDonald came to her defense.
""So I got over there so I could break up the fight, and with me trying to break up the fight, he got on top of her and hit her, so I had to try a different method, basically, to break up the fight, which actually worked,"" McDonald told NBC affiliate WESH of Orlando.
When Josh Manes, night manager of the Underground Public House on South Orange Avenue, heard a commotion in front of his bar, he ran outside and saw that the costumed man had jumped in and started raining blows on the man who was on the ground fighting the woman.
""I was at a loss for words,"" Manes told NBC News. ""I guess that's how Sundays, fun days go around here in Orlando. I can't be too surprised.""
The altercation was quickly broken up by an Orlando police officer on patrol in the downtown neighborhood, which is filled with bars and restaurants. It was unclear why the man and the woman were fighting.
When the bunny was peeled off the man, he was apparently still hopped up on adrenaline as he bounced around throwing shadow punches, the video posted by Instagram user ""workfth"" showed.
In moments immediately after the fight broke up, police initially thought the whole brouhaha had been staged.
""The officer came up to me and said, 'If you do that again I'm going to arrest you and the damned bunny suit,'"" McDonald recalled.
But eventually police came to understand that McDonald was just a good Samaritan.
""The cops broke them up, they shook the hand of the guy in the bunny suit and let him go,"" Manes, 28, said. ""He was just partying, enjoying his Easter Sunday.""
Sgt. David Baker, an Orlando police spokesman, confirmed that the fight happened at about 10:30 p.m. and that no one was arrested.

In a 3-0 decision, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Catholic Social Services failed to show that the placement freeze amounted to religious persecution or bias, violating its First Amendment rights to free speech and religious freedom.
Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro said Philadelphia was trying merely to stop what it considered a “clear violation” of a city anti-discrimination law covering sexual orientation, making a preliminary injunction inappropriate.
“The question in our case is ... whether CSS was treated differently because of its religious beliefs,” Ambro wrote. “Based on the record before us, that question has a clear answer: no.”

“Philadelphia is a welcoming, inclusive city that values the diversity of its residents,” Kenney said in a statement. “This policy is the embodiment of those values.”

San Diego police were called to Mt. Everest Academy, where a nondenominational service was being held Sunday afternoon, and found that church members had already managed to disarm the woman.
The gun was not loaded, and no one was harmed, police said. The building was swept for bombs, and police found nothing.
Anna Conkey, 31, was arrested and charged with displaying a firearm at a school, making a false bomb threat, assault, disturbing a religious meeting and child cruelty, according to jail records.
The baby and the suspect's 5-year-old daughter, who was discovered at a different location after the incident, were taken into protective custody.
Conkey is a former intern and freelance digital producer for NBC San Diego, according to the station, which reported she was also in the U.S. Navy.
She had sent her former employer an email news tip five minutes before entering the church, according to NBC San Diego .
""There's a woman claiming to be the Messiah, saying she was sent to blow up the foundation of the Church — she's got a gun and a child is involved. The address is 4350 Mount Everest Blvd San Diego, CA 92117. There are about 70 people in the auditorium of the school where the church service is held,"" the email read.
Conkey did not say she was the woman who would walk into the building.
Tsidkenu Church Pastor Benjamin Wisan told NBC San Diego that when Conkey came into the room where the service was being held, she seemed frustrated and ""not in her right mind."" He said she was speaking but not making any sense.
Wisan said Conkey had attended the church before and that the congregation ""had some problems with her.""
A post on Tsidkenu's Facebook page late Sunday said the congregation continued with its Easter celebrations.
""To all our wonderful friends and family! Everyone is doing great! And no injuries, JUST DIVINE PROTECTION!"" the post said.
Conkey was being held on $200,000 bail at the Las Colinas Detention Facility and was due in court Wednesday, jail records show.

— AM2DM by BuzzFeed News (@AM2DM) April 22, 2019 Having served as a liaison to Iraqi leaders during his time in the Marines, Moulton has seen the power of diplomacy first hand. And Moulton's musings earned a bit of lighthearted support from one scientist who has long been involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).
“If spacecraft from another solar system were to set down on Earth, you can be sure the occupants are technologically far, far beyond us,"" Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, told NBC News MACH in an email. “Trying to fight them off would be like cavemen taking on the army’s Special Forces .... Diplomacy is the only strategy that might work.”
Then again, Shostak said, hamburgers might not be the best food to offer hungry aliens, “given that the aliens’ biochemistry is undoubtedly somewhat different than ours!”
Angelle Tanner, a professor of physics and astronomy at Mississippi State University in Starkville, echoed Shostak's comments, joking that the aliens “could be allergic to gluten.”
Aliens aside, Moulton’s platform includes support for the Green New Deal , a public option for health insurance and new infrastructure projects, including high-speed rail.

SpaceX's Crew Dragon accident could delay first crewed flight to the space station,www.nbcnews.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/spacex-s-crew-dragon-accident-could-delay-first-crewed-flight-ncna997261,"Less than two weeks after SpaceX triumphantly launched its huge Falcon Heavy rocket on its first commercial flight , the company suffered a setback when its Crew Dragon capsule was hit by an “anomaly” during testing that could force the postponement of the capsule’s first crewed flight to the International Space Station. No injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred during an uncrewed engine test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Photos taken by eyewitnesses showed plumes of smoke coming from the site.
“Earlier today, SpaceX conducted a series of engine tests on a Crew Dragon test vehicle on our test stand at Landing Zone 1 in Cape Canaveral, Florida,” SpaceX officials said Saturday in a statement to Florida Today , a newspaper based in central Florida. “The initial tests completed successfully but the final test resulted in an anomaly on the test stand.”

In a statement released Saturday, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said the agency was working with SpaceX to assess the incident. ""This is why we test,” he said. “We will learn, make the necessary adjustments and safely move forward with our Commercial Crew Program.”
SpaceX launched the Crew Dragon capsule on its first uncrewed test flight to the space station March 2. The spacecraft spent almost a week attached to the orbiting outpost before returning to Earth and splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean , off the coast of Florida.
The company is expected to conduct one more uncrewed flight of the capsule to test the spacecraft’s emergency abort system. After that, NASA could authorize the first Crew Dragon flight to the space station with two astronauts onboard. Neither SpaceX nor NASA has announced the dates for these upcoming flights or said how they could be affected by the recent accident.
The Crew Dragon is one of two new commercially built capsules designed to ferry astronauts to and from the space station — and end NASA’s long reliance on Russian spacecraft. Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner capsule , which has been plagued by delays, is expected to conduct its first uncrewed test flight in August.

"Leader of militia detaining migrants allegedly said group trained to assassinate Soros, Clinton, Obama, complaint says - NBC News",www.nbcnews.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/leader-militia-detaining-migrants-allegedly-said-group-trained-assassinate-soros-n997176,"A leader of a New Mexico militia that has been detaining migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border said the group was ""training to assassinate George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama,"" according to an FBI agent's sworn deposition describing reports phoned into the agency's public tip line. Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, who was arrested Saturday on suspicion of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, made an initial appearance in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on Monday.
Hopkins remains in custody pending a preliminary hearing and a detention hearing April 29 in Albuquerque, according to the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office.
Outrage over armed militia groups detaining migrants at the border April 20, 2019 01:26 Hopkins, who also goes by the alias Johnny Horton Jr., has been described as the ""commander"" of the United Constitutional Patriots, a militia group that has recently been detaining asylum-seeking families at the southern border, drawing outcry from local politicians and activists.
In an affidavit filed Saturday in support of Hopkins' arrest, the FBI agent said that in October 2017, the agency's public access line received reports of ""alleged militia extremist activity"" in Flora Vista, New Mexico, based out of Hopkins’ home, with the group being supported by about 20 members who were ""armed with AK-47 rifles and other firearms.""
""Hopkins also allegedly made the statement that the United Constitutional Patriots were training to assassinate George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, because of these individuals' support of Antifa,"" the complaint said, referring to so-called anti-fascist activists.
It was not clear when and to whom Hopkins made these statements. Hopkins' attorney, Kelly O’Connell, said his client denies the allegations.
Hopkins, also known as 'Striker,' the leader of the Constitutional Patriots militia, speaks with Viper, right, about logistics in Anapra, New Mexico, on March 20. Paul Ratje / AFP / Getty Images file ""He says that is categorically false that that's what they were doing,"" O'Connell said. ""There was no plan to do any of that.""
In late November of 2017, two FBI special agents went to Hopkins’ residence, were invited in and led to a room known as his ""office,"" where they observed about ""10 firearms leaning against a wall in a closet in plain view,"" according to the complaint.
When asked who the firearms belonged to, Hopkins said all the firearms in the home were owned by Fay Sanders Murphy, who lives at the residence and was described as his ""common law wife,"" according to the complaint.

Hopkins also disclosed to the agents that there were additional weapons in the home, including a shotgun, a handgun in the bedroom and another handgun in the kitchen, according to the complaint.
Both Hopkins and Murphy gave the agents consent to search the residence, the complaint said, and showed them the location of the other firearms.
He walked one agent to the kitchen and brought a black tactical vest and said, ""that’s my black right there and it is loaded,"" according to the complaint. The agents recovered a loaded firearm from a holster attached to the vest, the complaint said.
Larry Mitchell Hopkins Dona Ana County Detention Center In the master bedroom, Hopkins directed an agent to a loaded Blackhawk 12-gauge shotgun and said, ""it is legal, actually that shotgun was given to my wife from one of my men,"" the complaint said.
The special agent who wrote the complaint said that after searching the residence, he discovered Hopkins had prior felony convictions.
Hopkins' lawyer questioned why his client was arrested Saturday, when the search of his property happened in 2017.
""If it was that outrageous of a crime, why not lock him up right then?"" O'Connell said, adding he questioned why ""this charge suddenly comes up"" while Hopkins was in the public eye over the debate regarding the actions of the United Constitutional Patriots at the border.
In 1996, Hopkins was convicted of possession of a loaded firearm and was sentenced to state prison in Michigan for 16 months minimum to two years maximum, according to the complaint.
In 2006, he was convicted of felony possession of a weapon in Oregon and sentenced to 40 days in jail and 36 months of probation, the complaint said.
At the same time, Hopkins was also convicted of criminal impersonation of a peace officer and sentenced to 20 days in jail and 24 months of probation, the complaint said.
State records confirm Hopkins’ convictions described in the complaint.
Court records show a warrant for Hopkins’ arrest was issued last week.
If convicted, he faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison, according to the FBI statement.
The American Civil Liberties Union and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham have blasted the United Constitutional Patriots for stopping migrants at the border until immigration authorities can apprehend them in recent months.
Customs and Border Protection has said it ""does not endorse private groups or organizations taking enforcement matters into their own hands.""

Nadler subpoenas former White House counsel McGahn after Mueller report,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/nadler-subpoenas-former-white-house-counsel-mcgahn-after-mueller-report-n997286,"WASHINGTON — House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., issued a subpoena Monday to President Donald Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn for testimony and documents as part the panel's investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the president and others. Nadler said in a statement that special counsel Robert Mueller's report indicates McGahn ""is a critical witness to many of the alleged instances of obstruction of justice and other misconduct described in the Mueller report.""
Full: Nadler: 'There is plenty of evidence of obstruction' April 21, 2019 08:29 ""The Special Counsel's report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses,"" Nadler said.
McGahn's testimony to Congress would help ""shed further light on the President's attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others do the same,"" Nadler said.
Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, blasted Nadler for ""a stunning 36-item subpoena.""
""Instead of looking at material that Attorney General Barr has already made available, Democrats prefer to demand additional materials they know are subject to constitutional and common-law privileges and cannot be produced,” Collins said.
While Mueller opted not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice, he laid out efforts by the president to tamper with witnesses and affect the investigation . The report said, for example, that Trump ordered McGahn to tell Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that ""Mueller has to go.""
""McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President's request. In response to that request, McGahn decided to quit,"" the report said. ""He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, (and) told (then-White House Chief of Staff Reince) Priebus that the President had asked him to 'do crazy shit.'
""McGahn ultimately did not quit and the President did not follow up with McGahn on his request to have the Special Counsel removed,"" the report said.
This is the second subpoena Nadler has issued in less than a week, with the last one being issued Friday for the full, unredacted Mueller report and its underlying documents.

The alleged retaliation, which Google denies took place, follows a worldwide walkout by employees in November to protest the company’s payment of tens of millions of dollars in exit packages to executives accused of sexual misconduct.
Federal law generally prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who complain about harassment or other forms of discrimination.
At the time of the walkout, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he supported the protest, reassuring employees that they would have the support they needed if they wished to participate.
Two of the walkout’s organizers, Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager at YouTube, and Meredith Whittaker, an artificial intelligence researcher, are telling fellow employees that Google hasn’t followed through with that promise.
Watch Google employees walk out over handling of sexual misconduct Nov. 1, 2018 03:32 On Monday, Whittaker said in a message posted to internal Google mailing lists that she was told this month that her role would be “changed dramatically,” Wired magazine reported . She said she was told that she would have to “abandon” her work on artificial intelligence ethics and at a center she co-founded at New York University, the magazine said.
Stapleton said in the message that Google had demoted her and instructed her to take medical leave, even though she was not sick, Wired reported. She hired a lawyer and the company ultimately reversed the demotion after an investigation, the magazine said.
A person familiar with their accusations who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the contents of the internal company message.
My guess is that Meredith and Claire aren’t going to get $90M payouts. Because it’s quite clear the kind of behavior that Google rewards. https://t.co/s5BKxbeJJv

Google on Monday denied that any retaliation had taken place.
“We prohibit retaliation in the workplace, and investigate all allegations,” Google said in a statement sent to NBC News. “Employees and teams are regularly and commonly given new assignments, or reorganized, to keep pace with evolving business needs. There has been no retaliation here.”

SUBSCRIBE April 22, 2019, 9:49 PM UTC / Updated April 23, 2019, 8:38 PM UTC By Janelle Griffith A petition pushing for a Washington state lawmaker — who said nurses in smaller hospitals ""probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day"" — to shadow someone in the field has garnered more than half a million signatures. State Sen. Maureen Walsh, a Republican representing College Place, made the remarks last week while debating a bill that would require uninterrupted meal and rest breaks for nurses and protect them against mandatory overtime. Walsh argued that such requirements would make it difficult for rural hospitals to stay open. ""By putting these types of mandates on a critical access hospital that literally serves a handful of individuals, I would submit to you those nurses probably do get breaks,"" Walsh said on the Senate floor Tuesday . ""They probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day."" Walsh also said: ""I understand helping with employees and making sure that we have rest breaks and things like that. But I also understand that we need to care for patients first and foremost."" Her remark sparked widespread outrage. Juliana Bindas, a registered nurse from Chicago, started a petition on Change.org over the weekend that garnered almost 600,000 signatures by Monday afternoon. ""I would like to take a stand and petition to have the senator experience what really happens during an RN’s 12-hour shift,"" Bindas said. ""She most likely won't be playing Uno."" Walsh said Monday night that she would be happy to accept the petition's proposal. “I understand from news accounts that a petition is being circulated urging me to spend a day shadowing a nurse at a local hospital for 12 hours, and walk a mile in her shoes,"" she said in a statement posted on her website . ""I look forward to receiving it and am happy to accept.” Walsh also said that she regretted her earlier comments, which she said she wished she had phrased a ""little more eloquently."" ""Unfortunately, I didn't, and Facebook scooped it up and ran with it,"" she told NBC News, adding that she had gotten threats. ""Nurses are great people,"" she said. ""They work hard. I totally understand. I'm the product of a nurse. My mother was a nurse for many years."" The bill would require that nurses and some other staff, such as diagnostic radiologic technologists or cardiovascular invasive specialists, be provided uninterrupted meal and rest periods, except when there is an unforeseeable circumstance. Walsh voted against the bill, which passed the state Senate with the amendment to exclude small hospitals. A different version passed by the House will have to be reconciled before it can be signed into law. The Washington State Nurses Association said Walsh's comments were “incredibly disrespectful and patronizing.” ""There is zero logic behind an amendment to the rest breaks bill that would cover nurses and patients in some hospitals, while leaving others without any protections,"" it said in a statement. The association also said it would make it more difficult to recruit nurses to rural facilities. ""With all due respect, Sen. Walsh: perhaps it's time for you to put down the cards and pick up the literature,"" it said. Janelle Griffith"
Trump ‘not even a little bit’ worried about impeachment,www.nbcnews.com,nbcnews.com,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/trump-not-even-a-little-bit-worried-about-impeachment-1502431299893,"The president brushed off a question on whether he’s worried about impeachment at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday, but less than a week after the release of the redacted Mueller report, the President preemptively insisted in a tweet that “only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment.”"
"Pelosi says Dems will 'uncover the truth,' holding call on next steps after Mueller report",www.nbcnews.com,Rebecca Shabad,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-holding-conference-call-house-dems-discuss-next-steps-after-n997216,"WASHINGTON — House Democratic leaders on Monday promised to pursue aggressive and extensive investigations into President Donald Trump — but would not commit to beginning impeachment proceedings. During a conference call with rank-and-file members, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., her leadership team and the chairs of major oversight committees outlined how Democrats would proceed in the wake of the public release of the redacted version of special report, according to four leadership aides on the call.
""We have to save our democracy. This isn’t about Democrats or Republicans. It’s about saving our democracy,"" Pelosi said, according to a person on the call. “If it is what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the Constitution, if that’s the place the facts take us, that’s the place we have to go.""
Dems not committing to impeachment after strategy session April 22, 2019 09:59 But Pelosi also said that saving the Democracy doesn't necessarily constitute impeachment.
""We don't have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts, the presentation of facts,"" Pelosi added.
It was the first time House Democrats have met as a group since the Mueller report was released last week. Congress has been out of session for a two-week break over the Easter and Passover holiday. As Democrats digested Mueller's report late last week, some key members expressed support for impeachment proceedings .
Though leaders wouldn't commit to beginning proceedings, multiple aides and members of Congress on the call say there has been a drastic shift in opinion on the issue since the release of the report.
Most House Democrats were reluctant to entertain the idea of impeachment, worried that it would further divide the country and hurt Democrats' chances at winning the White House in 2020. But most members on the call appeared to be sobered by the detail provided in Mueller's report and worried about long-lasting damage to the rule of law.
Two lawmakers, Reps. Val Demings of Florida and Jared Huffman of California, both spoke up in support of impeachment, according to two sources on the call.
Huffman said he made the argument that Democrats should no longer worry about impeachment further dividing the country. He said it’s not good for the country not to impeach.
“It’s bad for the country if Congress punts,” he said. “I think the script has flipped on political calculations. It’s far harder to defend inaction in the face of what we know.”
Demings said she believes Congress has enough evidence to begin proceedings.
""As a 27-year law enforcement officer, and while I understand we need to see the full report and all supporting documents, I believe we have enough evidence now,"" Demings said, according to her spokesman.
Pelosi's message to the Democratic caucus was similar to a letter to her caucus released earlier Monday, in which she wrote that the ""facts regarding holding the President accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings.""
Committee chairs said they were committed to aggressive oversight, ranging from Trump's finances to his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“We cannot allow this president to continue going down this course,” Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said. “The American people want accountability.”
Just as the call began, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., announced in a statement that he had issued a subpoena for former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the committee. The Mueller report details that Trump ordered McGahn to tell Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller, a command that McGahn refused to carry through.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told his colleagues that it is “factually false” that there was no collusion. He called Trump’s actions “much more significant than Watergate.” He said his committee would call Mueller, FBI Director Christopher Wray and others to testify.
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., chair of House foreign affairs committee, said the committee needs to look at “this bizarre relationship” between Putin and Trump. He said he’d use “all the tools” to investigate but they “should be cautious” on impeachment.
Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chair of the Financial Services Committee, laid out her goals for investigating the president's financial dealings by looking into his relationship with Deutsche Bank. She added, however, that she still supports impeachment.
""Everybody knows I'm for impeachment,"" she said.
Democrats weigh impeachment after Mueller report release April 22, 2019 02:01 On Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts became the first Democratic presidential contender to call on the House to start impeachment proceedings against Trump. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she would sign onto an impeachment resolution introduced by Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.
Monday night, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., agreed that Congress should take steps toward impeachment, adding that she was ""also a realist.:
""Since I've been in the United States Senate, that the United States Senate and the Republicans hold the majority, I've not seen any evidence to suggest that they will weigh on the facts instead of on partisan adherence to being protective of this president, and that's what concerns me and what will be the eventual outcome,"" the 2020 presidential hopeful said on a CNN town hall on Monday night. ""We have to be realistic about the end result but that doesn't mean the process should not take hold.""
When asked whether Democrats might pursue impeachment, Cummings said Friday, ""We may very well come to that very soon.""
Nadler, whose panel would have the power to begin impeachment proceedings, also has not ruled that out. Asked if holding Trump accountable means impeachment, Nadler said last Thursday, ""That's one possibility — there are others.""
Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, spoke to reporters Monday after reading a less-redacted version of Mueller's report at DOJ, saying that what he read did not change the findings of ""no collusion.""
He also criticized Democratic leaders for rejecting Attorney General William Barr's offer to view a less-redacted version of the report on a restricted basis, saying the Democrats were more interested in scoring political points than seeing additional information in the report.
“Nothing that I saw here today, at the end of the day, changed Mr. Mueller’s decision,"" Collins said. ""Nothing went any further except we had no collusion after a long and thorough investigation. We had no obstruction, no charge, there’s nothing there. Nothing today changes those results from last week.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said after an event in Owensboro, Ky., that the country should ""move on.""
“Well, look, I think it's time to move on,” he told reporters when asked about possible impeachment proceedings. “This investigation was about collusion, there's no collusion, no charges brought against the president on anything else, and I think the American people have had quite enough of it, and it's time to move on.”

"The U.S.-Mexico border isn't protected by militias, it's patrolled by domestic terrorists.",www.nbcnews.com,Raul A. Reyes,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/u-s-mexico-border-isn-t-protected-militias-it-s-ncna997056,"It speaks volumes about today’s political climate that anti-immigrant domestic terrorists have begun calling themselves border militias, holding unarmed people at gunpoint and feeling so emboldened that they post videos of their activities on social media, including Facebook and YouTube . Luckily, the hubris of at least one group didn't impress law enforcement: On Saturday, the New Mexico attorney general’s office announced that Larry Hopkins, the leader of the United Constitutional Patriots (which had been detaining migrants at gunpoint near the U.S.-Mexico border) had been arrested by the FBI and charged with felony possession of firearms and ammunition
The efforts of groups like the UCP are disturbing on every level and raise serious legal, humanitarian and public safety concerns.
 Trump's border wall was never just about security. It's meant to remind all Latinos that we're unwelcome. So-called ""militia"" groups have long been active along the southern border: In the 1970s, for instance, the Ku Klux Klan announced that it was creating its own border patrol to combat illegal immigration. In the 2000s, the Minutemen patrolled the border in Arizona. In 2009, Brisenia Flores was shot and killed in her own home in Arizona by members of a border vigilante group called Minuteman American Defense; she was just nine years-old and an American citizen.
Last year, Newsweek obtained leaked Department of Defense documents warning of the threat of armed, unregulated militia groups operating in between ports of entry along the border. The Department estimated that there were about 200 members of militia groups along the southwest border. And, the rise in anti-immigrant rhetoric and calls to build a wall to stem a supposed ""invasion"" has indeed been accompanied by a rise in militia activity.
It is ironic that a group with “constitutional” in their name is so unaware — or defiant — of the law and the constitution. Only trained law enforcement officials, like the Border Patrol and ICE, have the authority to detain migrants. But last week, Hopkins' group posted videos purporting to show their members identifying themselves as ""Border Patrol"" and holding immigrants at gunpoint. One member told Reuters that they had ""helped"" Border Patrol detain 5,600 migrants in the last two months.
Leader of militia group accused of detaining migrants at border April 22, 2019 04:11 By improperly holding people against their will, whether those people legally crossed the border or not, members of the United Constitutional Patriots have opened themselves to charges of assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping and impersonating law enforcement officers. (Hopkins, notably, was previously arrested in 2006 for impersonating law enforcement and illegal possession of a firearm and thus is presumably well aware his actions were not legal.) The UCP members are also likely trespassing on privately-held or federal land.
More importantly, it is perfectly legal under U.S. law for people to cross the border without papers and apply for asylum and other forms of humanitarian relief. So if anyone is “illegal” in a confrontation with Hopkins' followers, it is the United Constitutional Patriots.
A spokesman for the United Constitutional Patriots told the New York Times , “We’re just here to support the Border Patrol and show the public the reality of the border.” But the Border Patrol doesn’t want their help: On April 19 , U.S. Customs and Border Protection tweeted that “CBP does not endorse or condone private citizens or organizations that take enforcement matters into their own hands.” And last month, then-Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said his agency didn’t need the assistance of “civil society groups” to police the border. (McAleenan is now acting Homeland Security Secretary.)
Such groups, then, deserve to be called what they are: Domestic terrorists. They are wannabe- immigration agents who dress up in fatigues and harass migrants with dogs and weapons. They could be considered pathetic if their actions did not hold so much deadly potential.
They are right about only one thing: There is a crisis at our southern border, but it is is a humanitarian crisis created by the Trump administration's failure to come up with an effective plan to process asylum-seekers. There would be far fewer asylum seekers for groups like Hopkins' to harass in the desert if the administration complied with the law about processing them at border checkpoints.
Meanwhile, the current occupant of the White House traffics in the ugliest stereotypes about Latinos and immigrants, using words like “invasion” and “infestation” to describe the border situation he has created. From stoking fears about migrant caravans to declaring a questionable “national emergency,” Trump has sent a clear message that he believes immigrants are a threat to the country and that the border is out of control. His rhetoric encourages groups like the United Constitutional Patriots to trample on the legal and human rights of immigrants.
But armed vigilante activities are unlawful, whether they occur in the border region or any other community. Militia groups like the United Constitutional Patriots only make the border more dangerous — and there is nothing patriotic about making America hate again.

Ka'Shawn Baldwin, of East St. Louis, was pulled over Wednesday in Cahokia by officer Roger Gemoules for allegedly having expired license plates. Baldwin also did not have a valid driver's license. ""I was nervous. I was thinking, I was just going to get some more tickets and have some more fines that I really can't afford to pay,"" Baldwin told NBC News. Gemoules, a high school resource officer with the Cahokia Police Department, was on patrol that day because school was closed for spring break. Baldwin, 22, said he knew his driver's license was suspended but he was unaware the license plates on the car he had borrowed from a friend were expired. Ka'Shawn Baldwin and Cahokia Police Officer Roger Gemoules. Courtesy of Ka'Shawn Baldwin ""The routine thing is to tow the car and take the person to jail who is driving the car,"" Baldwin said. He told the officer that he did not have any other way to get to his interview at an area FedEx facility and that's why he was driving illegally. Gemoules explained to Baldwin that the car could not be driven any further. With no other option, Baldwin then asked the officer if he would give him a ride to his interview. To his surprise, Baldwin said Gemoules followed him home where he parked the car and took him to his interview. Gemoules said he could tell Baldwin really wanted the job. ""He was polite when I pulled him over and he seemed like a good young man, so I wanted to give him a chance,"" Gemoules told NBC affiliate KSDK in St. Louis. ""I knew if I gave him a bunch of tickets and towed his car, it would be tough to recover from."" Later that day, Baldwin wrote about the experience in a Facebook post that went viral. When he learned over the weekend that he had landed the job as a package handler, Baldwin, who currently works at a McDonald's, said he messaged Gemoules on Facebook to let him know and thank him again. Gemoules has since been lauded by his department and the Cahokia mayor for his actions. ""On behalf of Mayor Curtis McCall Jr., I would like to thank Officer Gemoules for showing compassion and being a great example of how community oriented policing actually works,"" the mayor's assistant, Francella Jackson, said on Facebook . Baldwin said the interaction was unlike any other he has ever witnessed involving an officer in his neighborhood and it has given him a newfound respect for those who work in law enforcement. ""I never looked at police in a negative manner or in a positive manner,"" Baldwin said. ""I never looked at them in any manner. But this just made me give them more respect than I did before.""

SUBSCRIBE April 22, 2019, 8:57 PM UTC By Doha Madani Florida prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against rapper YNW Melly who was charged with the murder of his two friends, according to court documents. Melly, whose real name is Jamell Demons, was arrested by the Miramar Police Department in February in connection with the shooting deaths of Christopher Thomas Jr. and Anthony Williams. Demons, 19, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder after police said he shot the men and covered up the crime with the help of Cortlen Henry, 20. The pair allegedly tried to make the shootings appear to be a drive-by. YNW Melly attends a party in Hollywood on Feb. 9, 2019. Alex J. Berliner / AP Williams, 21, and Thomas, 19, were shot multiple times Oct. 26 in Miramar, which is about 30 miles northwest of Miami. Police said Henry drove the pair to the hospital where they were pronounced dead. Henry gave a statement to police after the slayings, but authorities said their investigation did not match the information he gave them. ""Further investigation, supported by forensic evidence, concluded that Demons shot and killed Williams and Thomas Jr., and that Demons and Henry staged the crime scene to resemble a drive-by shooting,"" police said in February. The notice to seek the death penalty against Demons was filed Tuesday. Prosecutors have not filed similar paperwork against Henry, who was also charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Demons, who released the songs ""Melly the Menace"" and ""Murder On My Mind,"" addressed the murders in an Instagram post in February. ""I want you guys to know I love you and appreciate every single one of y’all, a couple months ago I lost my two brothers by violence and now the system want to find justice,"" he wrote. ""Unfortunately a lot of rumors and lies are being said but no worries god is with me and my brother."" Demons, who is out on bond, entered a not guilty plea last month.

Iowa man convicted of plotting to steal domain name at gunpoint,www.nbcnews.com,Kalhan Rosenblatt,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/iowa-man-convicted-plotting-steal-domain-name-gunpoint-n997026,"An Iowa man who founded a social media company highlighting young adults engaging in ""crude behavior, drunkenness, and nudity"" was convicted of plotting to rob a man at gunpoint over a domain name, prosecutors said. Rossi Lorathio Adams II, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who also goes by ""Polo,"" was convicted Thursday of conspiracy to interfere with commerce by force, threats and violence, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Iowa .
As a student at Iowa State University in 2015, Adams founded the social media company ""State Snaps,"" which curated the crude images and videos on sites such as Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter. Followers of ""State Snaps"" were encouraged to use the slogan ""Do it for state!"" when submitting content.
Rossi Lorathio Adams II. Linn County Jail After founding the company, Adams tried to buy the domain ""doitforstate.com"" from a resident in Cedar Rapids, who refused to sell the web address. Adams made multiple attempts to buy the domain from 2015 to 2017, according to the U.S. attorney's office.
Adams owned the domain for ""doit4state.com"" but believed his company needed the domain ""doitforstate.com.""
After failing to persuade the unidentified owner of ""doitforstate.com"" to sell the page, Adams enlisted his cousin Sherman Hopkins Jr., a felon living in a homeless shelter, to break into the owner's home and force him at gunpoint to transfer the domain to Adams.
On June 21, 2017, with instructions on how to transfer the domain written on a note, Hopkins entered the owner's home and pointed a gun at his head while instructing him to transfer the domain, according to officials.
The owner struggled with Hopkins and was shot in the leg but eventually was able to get control of the weapon. He shot Hopkins multiple times in the chest before calling police.

I tried EFT tapping to help beat my sugar addiction — here's what happened,www.nbcnews.com,Sarah Watts,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/i-tried-eft-tapping-help-beat-my-sugar-addiction-here-ncna960356,"After a long day of writing, when the kids have been fed and bathed, when the dishes are clean and the laundry is folded , one of my favorite after-dinner rituals is this: I hole up in my room under an electric blanket with my laptop and eat a king-sized Butterfinger bar slowly while I browse Facebook . For a few brief minutes, I am completely at peace. For a long time, I embarked on this ritual with a little bit of defensiveness (it's not like I'm smoking a pack of cigarettes every night!) and a whole lot of rationalization (I worked hard today. I deserve a treat!). And although those things were true — I do work hard, and I don't smoke cigarettes — eventually I started to realize I had a problem. When I didn't get my nightly candy fix , I noticed I was unusually snippy; I felt sluggish and unmotivated. On the nights I had candy, I'd feel a rush of relief and pure elation — at least until the candy was gone. The research is mixed on whether sugar can be called chemically addictive, but whatever the exact term, I couldn't seem to stop eating it.
In a fit of frustration one night, I searched online for information on sugar dependency and found a blog written by Gabrielle Berenstein , author of ""The Universe Has Your Back"" and ""Spirit Junkie."" In it, Berenstein shared that she had used a technique called “tapping,” formally known as the Emotional Freedom Technique or EFT, to kick her sugar habit. With EFT, a person taps lightly on accupressure points on their body (some refer to these as “energy meridians”) while repeating emotionally-charged statements. By tapping these energy meridians, practitioners can apparently release energy blockages in the body that give way to physical and psychological problems such as fear, addiction, anger , anxiety and more.
When you have a trauma, or some thing that makes you anxious, it's as if your system downloads a malware program ... Tapping is like finding [it] and uninstalling it.
Normally, I would not take anything called “energy meridians” seriously. But EFT caught my attention, because I had heard about it before. In the past five years or so, tapping has gone from a virtually unknown fringe practice to being studied in major medical journals. In 2013, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases published a study that showed veterans who used tapping to treat their Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) had “significantly reduced” their psychological distress as opposed to veterans in the control group. In 2017, a meta-analysis from the same journal found that EFT decreased symptoms for a number of anxiety disorders, not just PTSD. And tapping is catching on globally as well: All over the world , people use this technique to manage their chronic pain, food cravings , emotional upsets and more. Research on its effectiveness is limited, but some medical professionals see the benefits.
“There is still resistance [to EFT] in the psychological community,” said Dr. Larry Burk, a radiologist at Duke University who co-founded Duke Integrative Medicine in 1998. Burk began looking into self-hypnosis early in his radiology career in order to help patients that became clausterphobic in the MRI machine and were averse to taking sedatives. When he was introduced to EFT in 2002, Burk was floored by how effective it was for anxiety, both for patients in his practice and throughout medical literature. “Now research is showing that [EFT] works just as well for food cravings,” he said. Currently, in addition to practicing radiology, Burk leads workshops at Duke to spread the word about EFT.
You'd Be Surprised to Find Hidden Sugars in These Foods April 24, 2017 02:26 How, though, does tapping on your body help you recover from crippling anxiety, or from food cravings, for that matter? Burk used an extended computer metaphor to explain: “When you have a trauma, or something that makes you anxious, it's as if your system downloads a malware program. It gets downloaded into your nervous system and uploaded into your brain in the amydgala and hippocampus,” Burk said. “In that area, there's a file for every bad thing that happens, including a picture of what happened, a story and a program that runs every time you think about it, which is the physiological response in your body.”
Tapping, said Burk, is like finding the malware program and uninstalling it. “A memory is only as old as when you last looked at it. If you are tapping and creating pleasant feelings while you're thinking of that old memory, that file, then you've changed that program,” said Burk. “You might still have a picture of that story in your head, but if your body doesn't respond, that's the definition of emotional freedom.”
I wasn't exactly sold, though. While EFT has clearly been shown to reduce anxiety, researchers are torn on how that happens. Some say that tapping releases blocked energy, trapped in our body due to trauma. Some say it's a placebo effect; others say that tapping on the body in any way can be therapeutic.
“When patients are triggered, they often have that automatic response of anger or resistance. Maybe you hear the same thing your mother used to say, and you have this automatic reaction because your trauma has been triggered,” says Dr. Barbara Nosal, Chief Clinical Officer at Newport Academy, who uses EFT frequently in her clinical practice with families and teenagers. “But [tapping] gives them an opportunity to self-soothe and regulate their emotions before they respond. When these energy points are stimulated, it reduces heart rate and shuts off the fight or flight response, and they're able to respond in a more appropriate way.”
It seemed silly to compare my sugar cravings with serious anxiety, but Burk insisted that EFT helps heal both. “With food cravings, there's a program running that says when bad things happen, I just need to get a candy bar or some junk food. That program tells you it's a quick fix, and you'll feel better briefly. What you do is access the feeling of anxiety that's causing cravings, tap on it, and remove the trigger of anxiety for that personal craving.""
Bingo. That rush of relief I felt when I got my hands on a Butterfinger? That was relief from anxiety, which built up after a long day of writing and errands and working mom chaos . I had become dependent on candy to soothe my anxiety — but I didn't want to be any longer. Since it was quick, no-cost and apparently effective, I decided I'd give EFT a shot and hope for the best.
Related Detox Detox How a 'sugar budget' helped one family eat healthier With the direction of Gabrielle Berenstein , I started tapping on the feeling of anxiety that was causing my sugar cravings. Thumping gently on my forehead, temple, hand, collarbone and various other “energy meridian points” on my body, I vented my anxieties into existence: I feel so trapped by my sugar addiction. I'm frustrated with myself. I feel sad and angry and stuck.
Normally, feeling this anxiety would make me run immediately out the door and buy a Butterfinger bar. But the tapping grounded me. You can sit here and feel this, I told myself. Just stay in your discomfort for a moment — you'll survive. That night, when I had my usual sugar cravings, I tapped again: I really want sugar. I really want sugar. I really want sugar. As I tapped, I hummed with anxiety, but for some reason, saying them out loud made me feel much more at ease.
I didn't eat any sugar that night. Or the night after. I lasted an entire two months without sugar — an unfathomable accomplishment for me that I still think about with pride. After two months, I stopped tapping, having proven to myself that I could do it. Whether it was because of unblocked energy flowing through my body or simply because cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions (of which EFT is a subset) have been shown to improve anxiety, the end result was the same: I beat my sugar addiction. Since then, I've fallen back gradually into eating sugar on the regular. But happily, I'm not eating anywhere near as much as I was, and I'm much more mindful of why I'm doing it. A slice of cake at my child's birthday party? Sure. Three king-sized Butterfingers to help stave off tension and stress? Not anymore. I feel like I have some control again — and to me, that's what emotional freedom is all about.

Katelyn Ohashi: Elite gymnastics culture is cruel. But UCLA's NCAA gymnastics program helped me reclaim my joy.,www.nbcnews.com,Katelyn Ohashi,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/elite-gymnastics-culture-cruel-ucla-s-ncaa-gymnastics-program-helped-ncna996491,"As a little girl, I could not sit still until my parents told me it was time to go to the gym. But when I was 12 years old, I entered into the world of elite gymnastics and soon realized I was not walking into the same joy-driven, love-filled sport. I have said that gymnastics can be abusive and brutal. That was my experience. I felt trapped in a world where authority figures were dictating my future. But in actuality, it’s not the sport that is cruel. It’s the culture. The truth is, gymnastics is a beautiful sport that has allowed me to grow and learn invaluable life lessons: sacrifice, dedication, discipline. Eventually, it lead me to my voice. I learned at a young age that my voice was not wanted or heard, so I went silent.
As an athlete you learn to keep pushing through the pain until the pain eventually becomes unbearable. Even then, you are told to continue. I learned at a young age that my voice was not wanted or heard, so I went silent. I did what I was told and set goals based on what everyone else expected of me. This may sound shocking, but I never dreamed about going to the Olympics. It was just something people expected of me. My voice was so suppressed, I couldn’t even hear it at times. I felt brainwashed. Everyone else’s normal was becoming my reality and I was heading towards a physical and mental burnout.
Despite the exhaustion, I kept getting better. I won the 2011 Visa Championships , the 2012 Pacific Rims and then the 2013 American Cup (the first and only senior elite competition of my elite career.) And yet, I have a vivid image of coming home in tears after that last competition. One of my vertebrates was protruding out from my spine, and I was in excruciating pain. I couldn’t even touch my back without cringing. At just 16 years old, I was told that my back would never be the same again. My wellbeing had been neglected for the opportunity to win a gold medal.
I was told I might not ever do gymnastics again. But when I heard those words, I wasn’t devastated; I wasn’t even sad. The truth is, a weight was lifted from my shoulders. A wave of calmness washed over me and drowned all of my self-doubt, fear and stress. I would never again have to wear a leotard or step foot in a gym, only to be criticized or judged based on my looks. It wasn’t until later that I realized how much I had relied on gymnastics for validation, for my self-worth.
When I stepped away from the sport, I was left with someone I didn’t even know. The only thing I did know was that I didn’t like who I was.
It took a full year to finally start missing the sport that I once loved as a little girl. After countless doctors appointments and imaging, I was allowed to start rehabbing and training again. But my body could no longer take the impact of the elite world, so I switched my path from the Olympics to college gymnastics.
Gymnast Katelyn Ohashi captures hearts with joyful routine Jan. 15, 2019 01:14 I knew that UCLA had an amazing gymnastics program and so I called Miss Val. At that point, I still wasn’t sure if I would be able to do gymnastics again, but I knew I wanted to attend UCLA. She asked me about the last time I was happy in gymnastics. I told her it was when I was 11, before I entered the elite world. We talked for more than an hour, and by the time we hung up I knew that she cared about me, not just about my skills on the mat. Two years after the American Cup, I finally returned to the competition floor again, this time as a level 10 gymnast.
But it took some time to silence the negative voices in my head. During my freshman year of college, it became undeniably clear that I didn’t want to be great again. I correlated greatness with misery. But I now realize that greatness was not the problem. It was the culture and environment that seemed to come along with being great.

— espnW (@espnW) April 21, 2019 Miss Val, UCLA and my teammates have provided me with the trust and love I needed in order to reconnect with happiness. Too frequently, we hear about coaches and programs willing to win at any cost. Miss Val puts the human before the athlete . I was encouraged to use my voice and explore my passions outside of the sport. And when I did that, I was finally able to realize my true self-worth. I was more than that of a gymnast.
Ironically, once I realized this, my gymnastics career began to thrive again. The pressure of trying to be “perfect” was alleviated because the sport did not define me anymore. I found my joy. And that joy has given me all the success in the world.
Katelyn Ohashi scored a 9.950 for the Bruins in her final collegiate floor routine on Saturday at the 2019 NCAA women's gymnastics championships. UCLA finished third overall.
Katelyn Ohashi UCLA gymnast Katelyn Ohashi practically broke the internet in 2019 (and 2018) with a viral floor routine that earned her multiple perfect 10.0 scores, and got people talking about something other than abuse in the gymnastics space. Ranked No. 1 in the nation on floor, and No. 2 on beam, Ohashi took first place on her first seven routines of her senior year season under the tutelage of Bruins Coach Valorie Kondos Field (Miss Val). The 2011 Junior National Champion was an eight-time All-American and a four-time member of USA Gymnastics’ Junior National Team and winner of the 2013 American Cup, defeating Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles to clinch the title. She graduates in June 2019."

Sri Lanka attack: Internet shutdowns are more common than you think - NBC News,www.nbcnews.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sri-lanka-attack-internet-shutdowns-are-more-common-you-think-n997301,"World Sri Lanka attack: Internet shutdowns are more common than you think Since 2011, an expert has documented more than 400 cases of internet blackouts, with about 150 of them occurring last year alone. April 22, 2019 02:14 Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 23, 2019, 12:03 AM UTC By Tim Stelloh Sri Lankan authorities instituted social media restrictions after several deadly bombings on Sunday — a tactic that experts said is increasingly common around the world: the government-imposed internet shutdown. From Ethiopia and Venezuela to India and Iraq, authorities are halting the flow of online information in greater numbers amid political turmoil, large-scale protests and other events, said Jan Rydzak, a research scholar at Stanford University's Global Digital Policy Incubator. Since 2011, Rydzak has documented 400 to 450 cases of internet blackouts, he said. About 150 of those shutdowns occurred last year, many of them in India, he said. Governments use ""a panorama of strategies to control information — this is just one of the most flagrant manifestations of that,"" Rydzak said. People living near St. Anthony's Shrine run for safety after police found explosive devices in parked vehicles, which later exploded in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on Monday. Chamila Karunarathne / AP Officials in Sri Lanka said the blackout of Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp and other services was a temporary way to stanch the spread of false information after the bombings. This approach — although it is sometimes driven by different motives — was once routine in countries like Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan, said Alp Toker, executive director of Netblocks, a nonpartisan, non-governmental group that monitors internet freedom. ""This kind of incident we would've tracked up to three times a month in 2016 and 2017,"" he said. Then, Toker said, came a ""turning point"" — a series of coordinated bombings in Brussels that killed more than 30 people in 2016 . ""The first responders used social media effectively to understand what was going on, where it was happening and how to counter the threat,"" he said. Some of those countries appeared to take notice, and they cut down on post-attack shutdowns, he said. They also seemed to realize not only how popular the services were — and how shutdowns could easily trigger a backlash — but also how governments could use them for their own purposes. ""Authorities have the upper hand on social media,"" Toker said. ""They're the law. They also have control over social media companies, and to some extent they can restrict content they don't agree with."" All of that has made the kind of social media blackout underway in Sri Lanka far less common than it was a few years ago, he said. People used their mobile phones at the Francisco Fajardo highway, where they could get telephone service, during a partial power failure in Caracas, Venezuela, on March 9. Matias Delacroix / AFP - Getty Images file But it's not as if it's unheard of. Three days before the bombings in Sri Lanka, the nonpartisan non-governmental organization NetBlocks documented restrictions on YouTube, Google applications and Bing in Venezuela. The blackouts occurred as the country's opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, was live-streaming an assembly speech in Caracas. While not as targeted as the blackouts in Venezuela, the vast majority of internet shutdowns that Rydzak has documented over the last eight years also appear to have been driven by political motives, he said. One of the first such large-scale shutdowns occurred in Egypt in 2011, when the government blocked the internet for three days during the Arab Spring uprising, Rydzak said. Since then, other governments have embraced similar tactics. In Ethiopia's Oromia region, for instance, there were blackouts in 2016 amid deadly violence between anti-government protesters and security forces . In Sudan, the government blocked the internet for weeks as protesters targeted then-President Omar al-Bashir , he said. In countries like Sri Lanka, where the government says it is blocking social media access to prevent misinformation that could lead to potential mob violence, the outcome can still be devastating, Rydzak said. Governments ""tend to claim they're conducted as security measures, but they actually block access to accurate information,"" he said. ""They may also be means of concealing abuse by security forces and non-state actors."" Nor is there evidence that shutdowns prevent misinformation and violence, Rydzak said. Toker added that such ""vacuums"" can even accelerate the spread of false news. ""Those with technical expertise can get online, and they tend to be the people who are involved in producing content for commercial or political gain,"" he said. ""The people who remain online can drown out the authentic voices from the scene of the incident."" Shutdowns can also keep people from reaching relatives and loved ones, Rydzak added, and they can drain local economies. According to NetBlocks, the estimated impact of shutting down WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram is $4.1 million per day. ""That's pretty significant for a country where GDP per capita is less than $4,000,"" Rydzak said."
