It is clear that the Dems are only interested in minorities to the point of how much they can use them. You just have to look at places like Chicago to see how much Dems care about the Black population.
The Dems have divided America like it has never been since the civil war.
They have blacks against whites, Women against men, straights against gays and rich against poor.
The Dems are at such a point that it is unlikely that Bernie will win the nomination because he is straight, white old man so he does not tick any of the minority boxes. Even at this early stage it is becoming apparent that Harris is the nominee the MSM will be throwing their weight behind and Bernie will likely be cheated again.
It doesn't matter who the best candidate is, it just matters which candidate is in the most 'oppressed' groups
I can't stand Bernie and I hate Harris even more, but if Bernie is cheated again, the Dem party will rip apart. I am a Trump supporter, but certainly recognise the need for an opposition party in any democracy. A one-party state is very dangerous."

Trump (and reality) has set an agenda that separates the Republican base from the Republican Globalist Uniparty establishment. It's no longer enough to simply tsk tsk tisk Cuckservative style about the Left. With the Republicans with actual power, and a Republican President who ran in line with the priorities of the Republican base, the base now gets to see which Republicans are willing to use that power to further *their* policy preferences.

Altruism is as an evolutionary adaptation that arises in the natural world. There are a plethora of examples. If altruism didn't arise from the natural world by way of observable processes, its presence among homo sapiens would make an excellent argument for the existence of a God. How else to account for it?
Ultimately, the process we're talking about shouldn't be controversial to capitalists and probably wouldn't be among libertarians if it weren't for some clinging to the notions of Ayn Rand. Libertarians have been writing about benevolence arising from markets since Adam Smith wrote about the invisible hand in 1759.
And who would argue that society at large doesn't benefit when people respect each other's rights?"

In case that was unclear, evolutionary processes are essentially market processes with specialization as a feature (as in ""specialization and exchange""). And we're not just talking about social adaptations if you imagine that's what altruism is about. Our neo-cortex evolved to leverage the advantages conferred by what you might think of as social adaptations, like language and religion."

Reparations Are More Likely to Divide the Nation Than Heal It Reason.com,reason.com,//,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2019/04/05/reparations-likely-to-divide-not-heal#comment_7748786,"This is a terrible way to close a financial gap. First of all, the financial gap is not race-based, it's how economic systems work. There has to be a financially underprivileged class otherwise nobody would do the shit work. Plenty of other races, including white people, are in the position of having to do shit work. It has nothing to do with race and everything to do with the folks who can afford half million dollar bribes to college admissions officials maintaining their elite status through any means afforded to them by their extant pile of money.
I reject the implied idea that white people have automatically benefited from the institution of slavery as a function of their race and black people did not. If there were benefits of slavery the institution, they would have been societal benefits that are not possible to withhold from modern non-slaves. For example, if slavery was used to build a road, everyone today uses that road to get places, regardless of skin tone. Any profits derived from slavery that launched or bolstered particular family dynasties would have had benefits limited to that particular family, and any that dissolved outward would have benefited all races.
So yeah, not in favor of reparations because it's a pretty obviously poor argument. It's really just a vote-buying scheme. Worse, it's a vote buying scheme that will never ever happen because it's such an objectively spectacularly bad idea."

Drug abuse seeps back into China today the same way it did when the British began marketing opium at huge profit in China back when. It was a top-down phenomenon then, starting in the prestigious huge lazy bureaucracies (once you passed the Confucian exams you had it made) and royal courts around major cities, then working its way downward as the Brits figured out they could drop the price, grow the market, and make more profit.

It requires building or ""rebuilding"" 15 million homes every year, 15 times as many as we currently build.
Googling shows high voltage power lines cost from $300K to $1.5M per mile; call it $1M average, and those 50,000 miles of lines would cost $50T all by themselves.
California's high speed rail was projected to cost $100B for 500 miles, or $200M per miles. Criss-crossing the US with enough rail to replace airlines would probably require at least 10 east-west (3000 miles each) and 20 north-south (1500 miles each) transcontinental lines, plus untold feeder lines; around 100K miles total, or $20T total.

A man is in custody Monday night after an attempted abduction at the Huntington Mall in Barboursville.
That is according to Barboursville Mayor Chris Tatum, who says that the man tried to grab a child by the hair inside a mall store. The mother was able to startle the man, and he took off.
The mom later identified the man in the food court area, and he was arrested by Barboursville Police with help from Huntington Mall Security. The Cabell County Sheriff's Department was also on the scene to secure the perimeter.
Police are in the process of taking a report from the victims in the case.
Joe Bell, director of corporate communication with the Huntington Mall, said they're aware of the incident and praised the police response. Bell also said they're grateful no one was injured. I hope they throw the book at that guy!"

"Final Version, ""Compelled Decryption and the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination"" - Volokh Conspiracy :",reason.com,TwelveInchPianist,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/volokh/2019/04/05/final-version-compelled-decryption-and-t#comment_7748872,"Prof Kerr continues to make the baffling claim that the only aspect of entering a password is the fact that the defendant knows the password, and not the contents of the password.
Fisher is a case about document production, where the defendant was required to turn over evidence to the government. But assuming the government has the phone, and assuming arguendo that they can access the underlying encrypted data inside the phone, then the government already possesses all the evidence.
So the government possesses encrypted data. And Prof. Kerr claims that the government seeks to compel the defendant to perform an act that is non-testimonial (except as otherwise noted) that will result in the government having decrypted data. But of course the only way the defendant can help the government decrypt the data is by disclosing the contents of the password.
It would be nice if Prof Kerr could explain a little better why he thinks that forcing the defendant to disclose the password is not ""testimonial"" as to the contents of the password. Is it because entering testimonial data into a machine, as opposed to telling it to the government, is somehow different?"
