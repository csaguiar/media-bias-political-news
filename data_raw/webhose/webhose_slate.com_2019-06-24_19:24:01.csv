"Elizabeth Warren, Trump nuclear ban, poverty, Late Night.",slate.com,Slate Copy Desk,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/elizabeth-warren-trump-nuclear-ban-poverty-late-night.html,"New Files From GOP Operative’s Hard Drive Suggest N.C. Republicans Lied in Court to Maintain Racial Gerrymander From 2016’s ashes: Elizabeth Warren is having a bit of a moment, and Dahlia Lithwick is cautiously wondering if any woman could (or should) have that kind of moment while Donald Trump is still president . A lot of women think so, apparently, and that kind of traction deserves a second look. Is she just 2019’s Hillary Clinton? Probably not: “Warren is, in brief, almost painfully serious precisely because she is banking on public seriousness, running on the notion that bread and circus have had their day, and it is time now to save the republic.” Dollar debate: Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer made waves with their 2013 study showing that 1.6 million U.S. families had cash incomes of less than $2 per person per day—and that this population had grown more than 150 percent since 1996, implicating President Bill Clinton’s welfare reform in the rise of extreme poverty. Persuasive new research casts doubt on those numbers and, as Jordan Weissmann explains, tells a more complicated story about the holes in the American safety net. The bomb is back: Are we on our way to a nuclear arms race? It sure seems like it: After withdrawing from the INF Treaty and the Iran nuclear deal, Donald Trump seems like he’s about to scuttle two more arms control agreements the U.S. has with several other countries, including and especially Russia. Fred Kaplan explains the shaky peace mechanisms we stand to lose should Trump pull the plug. Art imitating life: Mindy Kaling’s Sundance hit Late Night isn’t just a funny workplace comedy about TV writers. It’s also a very personal response to the challenges she’s faced in her career: being forced to prove herself as a “diversity hire” on The Office and being misunderstood as creator of The Mindy Project . Inkoo Kang highlights the narrative left turns Kaling takes in the first feature film where she’s writer, producer, and star."
Warriors' Silicon Valley strategy now involves venture capitalists shoving opposing point guards.,slate.com,Nick Greene,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/kyle-lowry-shove-warriors-owner-venture-capitalist.html,"This Can’t Be It for the Warriors, Can It? You can’t jump a few feet in the Bay Area without falling on or near a venture capitalist. That’s what happened during Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday, when Kyle Lowry chased a loose ball into the crowd during the fourth quarter and landed next to Mark Stevens, a prominent Silicon Valley investor who used to be a partner at Sand Hill Road staple Sequoia Capital. When Lowry attempted to return to the court, Stevens shoved him on the shoulder and, according to the point guard, told him to “ go fuck yourself .” Kyle Lowry was shaking his head after a courtside fan pushed him when he fell into the crowd. pic.twitter.com/5SwQv3hdnN — NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) June 6, 2019 “Fans like that shouldn’t be allowed to be in there.” Lowry said after the game, adding that he hoped the league will “ban him from all NBA games forever.” Stevens may look like your average polo-and-lanyard-wearing Warriors fan, but his station in life adds a layer of complexity to the incident. As Axios reported on Thursday, Stevens is one of Golden State’s minority owners . Stevens’ seat was left vacant for the remainder of the game, and on Thursday, the Warriors released a statement and apology . The NBA later announced he had been banned for a year and fined $500,000:
Mr. Stevens’ behavior last night did not reflect the high standards that we hope to exemplify as an organization. We’re extremely disappointed in his actions and, along with Mr. Stevens, offer our sincere apology to Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors organization for this unfortunate misconduct. There is no place for such interaction between fans—or anyone—and players at an NBA game. Were he a normal fan, Stevens could have argued that he got caught up in the moment. Lowry came crashing down pretty hard, and the ensuing adrenaline rush must have been pretty killer—at least more potent than what one experiences during a long day of Venture Capitaling. But that argument wouldn’t have worked, as fans who sit courtside know to expect the occasional flying point guard. After all, that’s what they paid for. Stevens, meanwhile, paid for a slice of the team itself. In 2010, billionaire venture capitalist Joe Lacob led a 19-person investment group that bought the Warriors for $450 million. Stevens purchased a stake in 2013 and saw his investment turn into a championship-winning dynasty shortly thereafter. As a result, Lacob and his cohort have been credited frequently for turning the franchise around with their “Silicon Valley–style” techniques. The culmination of this transformation is next season’s move to the Chase Center, the team’s new home across the bay in San Francisco. That stadium will offer premium courtside suites that, according to the Washington Post, will be “ equipped with a butler, a well-appointed dining room area for social events and a private wine cellar. ” Future VCs will wonder why Stevens bothered to shove Kyle Lowry himself—couldn’t he have asked his butler to do it for him? “ Lacob was not the first venture capitalist to buy a franchise ,” the New York Times explained in 2016, “but he is the first to operate one according to what might be called Silicon Valley precepts: nimble management, open communication, integrating the wisdom of outside advisers and continuous re-evaluation of what companies do and how they do it.” Those precepts don’t seem to include “shoving opposing point guards,” though in light of Wednesday’s game, it may be worth re-examining the intended meaning of “nimble management.” Stevens is quoted in that Times feature, and he knocks owners who try to muddle too much, the types who want to control everything “down to the color of the underwear.” He was correct back then. Management really should be hands-off. "
My dog hates when my boyfriend and I kiss: pet advice from Beast Mode.,slate.com,Nick Greene,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/dog-barks-when-we-kiss-hates-boyfriend-affection.html,"My Puppy Always Spills Her Water Bowl and Splashes Around. How Can I Get Her to Drink Up? Dear Beast Mode, I have a wonderful older Lab mix who is, in most situations, an absolute joy. She’s 13-ish now, and I adopted her when she was about 7. I was single back then, but I started dating a great guy about two years ago, and he’s recently moved in with me. She was a rescue and was likely abandoned by a previous owner, so she’s always had separation anxiety, which is well controlled with medication. But since the beau has been around, we’ve been dealing with another stress issue. Whenever her humans show physical affection for each other, she panics. She’ll pant heavily, whine, and eventually begin barking uncontrollably. She doesn’t do this if she’s around other friends who hold hands or kiss. It’s limited to us. We’ve tried giving her Kongs or special treats to help calm her, but it doesn’t really help, and I’m afraid it may be reinforcing bad behavior. Any ideas for what we can try? —Pooches Over Smooches Dear Pooches Over Smooches, PDA can be confusing for dogs. They aren’t good with acronyms, which is why they’ve never bothered to get together to figure out what “dog” stands for. ( Defenders of the Globe ? Dainty Obstinate Goofs? Dear Old Gremlins ?) And then there’s the affection part. They show it differently than we do, so from your pooch’s vantage point, your boyfriend giving you a quick kiss in the hallway probably looks rather strange. I mean, you don’t even sniff his butt beforehand. You might begin to associate intimacy with pungent doggie bites, and we wouldn’t want that, either. Let’s stay with her perspective for a moment. Sure, the smooching and hugging might be alarming, but think about your co-habitation in general. For years, it was just you and her. She got accustomed to your schedule, embraced your scent, and learned when to expect food to “fall” from your fork during dinner. No matter what happened in the world, she knew she could count on all those things. Dogs like to live in the here and now (one of their best, most enviable qualities) and so she couldn’t have foreseen having to deal with a boyfriend . Now, she’s got this guy who showers at weird times and doesn’t smell like you do. He may even be so inconsiderate as to eat over the sink. Given that your dog is already prescribed medication for anxiety, it would be wise to ask your vet about this new situation and whether it warrants an update or change. I imagine the veterinarian’s office is already a stressful place for the pooch, so take a video of how she behaves at home for evidence. If for some reason you feel uncomfortable showing your vet a video of you and your boyfriend kissing, simply point the camera at the dog. You are extremely considerate to give her treats and toys, though it doesn’t sound like they’re working too well. Wait until she calms down to give her some primo goodies. Resist giving her rewards when she starts whining and barking, lest she start associating them with your strange, humanoid PDA. On the other hand, you might begin to associate intimacy with pungent doggie bites, and we wouldn’t want that, either. If you feel this Pavlovian response bubbling into your subconscious, please feel free to pull back a bit. We do a lot for our dogs, but they need to learn to live with us too. This will take time. For now, act with your boyfriend as you would normally (whatever that happens to mean) and try to ignore your dog’s protestations. Don’t force anything, but keep the boyfriend armed with treats and encourage him to build a relationship with the dog. Once she’s more used to his presence, the sight of him giving you a kiss won’t be nearly as disturbing to her. With enough patience, she might even start to like him. After all, that’s what happened with you."
House Republicans won’t stop Trump’s trade war with Mexico.,slate.com,Jim Newell,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/republicans-tariffs-trump-mexico.html,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s got Donald Trump’s back. Alex Wong/Getty Images Most Republicans in Congress believe President Donald Trump’s plan to impose escalating tariffs on Mexico until the country does, well, something or other about the U.S. border is a terrible idea. Their hope, still, is that Mexico offers the Trump administration some face-saving commitment to do more to stem the flow of migrants and that the administration accepts, soon, before tariffs go into effect on … let’s see here … Monday ! Barring that, Republicans will have to decide whether to take legislative action to reject a policy they find abhorrent to their free-market beliefs and disruptive to the daily commercial flow of billions of dollars, or to just let Trump do his thing. There’s a real possibility that Senate Republicans would provide a veto-proof majority to block the tariffs if it comes to that. Fortunately for Trump, House Republicans will likely remain as House Republican-y as ever, doing whatever he tells them to do and forcing a smile while they do it. Senate Republicans, just about to a person, are apoplectic over the tariff proposal, which would start at 5 percent on all goods and increase each month until Mexico solves America’s immigration issues. The White House, in an effort that senators definitely interpreted as a slight, sent a couple of hapless lawyers to Senate Republicans’ Tuesday luncheon to field their questions about the policy. (The actual meaningful people in the administration were busy traipsing around England in silly little jackets.) House Republicans will likely remain as House Republican-y as ever, doing whatever Trump tells them to do and forcing a smile while they do it. The lawyers were given a proper scorching. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said that the administration “is trying to use tariffs to solve every problem but HIV and climate change.” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson told them that they would have trouble voting to sustain the president’s veto of a measure blocking the tariff. And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose state would be particularly hard hit by the broad tariff on its neighbor, told the lawyers that he wanted them to take a message back to the White House: that they “didn’t hear a single yes” from the conference in support of the tariff. In the president’s formal announcement of the plan on May 30, he said he would invoke emergency authorities available to him under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the duty. If the president were to impose the tariffs through emergency powers, Congress could then use its own statutory powers, through the National Emergencies Act, to try to block the move. That’s what Congress tried earlier this year when the president declared a national emergency to unlock border wall construction funds. While the resolution of disapproval passed both chambers, it didn’t pass by enough in the House to override the president’s veto. And that’s likely what would happen this time, too, if House Democrats introduced a disapproval resolution, which they’re preparing to do."
Rocketman musical numbers didn’t include the Lion King or Candle in the Wind. Why?,slate.com,Heather Schwedel,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/rocket-man-musical-numbers-lion-king-candle-in-the-wild.html,"How France Became the Women’s World Cup Favorite According to the movie Rocketman , which purports to tell the life story of Elton John, John didn’t exist between 1983 and roughly now-ish. I take issue with this: I remember the ’90s and can attest to the fact that Elton John was there the whole time. You wouldn’t know it from the movie, however, which skips right from the early ’80s to essentially the present day with one of those post-film real-life photo slideshows to reveal that John is now happily married with two children and a meant-to-be-a-joke-I-think shopping addiction. I’m convinced that this is both an artistic and commercial mistake and that the movie’s story should have extended at least into the ’90s. In its current incarnation, Rocketman covers Elton John’s childhood, his rise to fame, his glory days, and his descent into addiction and self-destruction, with a framing device of John looking back from rehab. The ending is spectacularly anticlimactic: Taron Egerton, as John, monologues about all he’s learned and sings “I’m Still Standing,” which, while thematically appropriate, is no one’s favorite Elton John song. It’s no way to end a movie! Everyone knows you have to have a big closing number that brings the house down. Also, hello, it’s only 1983, what a weird place to stop the story! To apply the logic of Seinfeld , one can’t “ yada, yada ” 35 years. We were there; it happened; it was eventful. Ending a story on a high note when it’s a biopic about a star whose heyday is behind him presents a narrative challenge—but only if one takes it as a given that John’s heyday was behind him by the rest of the ’80s and beyond. Surely this film doesn’t want to look like it buys into the false premise that it’s all downhill after youth? Plus, John was such a strong cultural presence in the ’90s, a fixture on red carpets and at awards shows, that it seems bizarre not to include those years in any film about his life. John went Hollywood by writing the music for The Lion King , which went from blockbuster movie to legendary hit Broadway musical. “Candle in the Wind 1997,” the rewritten song he released in tribute to Princess Diana after her death, became one of the bestselling singles in history and a crucial cultural moment. Both “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” and “Candle,” at least, deserve to be musical numbers in the best version of this movie. Would they stick out tonally from the rest of it? Perhaps, but our only fealty must be to art and truth. To apply the logic of Seinfeld , one can’t “yada, yada” 35 years. Besides, baby boomers may know John as a star from the 1970s, but to millennials, he was the Lion King and “Candle in the Wind” guy. Can you say cross-demo appeal? Throw the millennials a scene of John meeting Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the voice of Simba, on the red carpet—they’ll eat it up! There’s also ample opportunity to depict John’s many famous, and zeitgeist-y, friends and enemies. Without getting too Lifetime-y, I would love to see his feud with Madonna portrayed on screen. Leaving it out is honestly an insult to Pride Month. Plus, the ’90s are also when John met his husband . A third-act love story? Yes, please! The only real problem I can see is how to wring more recognizable musical numbers out of these last three decades, which, while productive, do lack as many chart-topping hits of earlier periods in John’s career. Then I had a good idea, which is that John should just write a new hit song to go with this movie. Seems about as doable as all the other changes I’m requesting. Please let me know.

NYPD Stonewall apology is a distraction from anti-queer police violence today.,slate.com,Christina Cauterucci,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/nypd-stonewall-apology-police-violence.html,"Want to Learn What Makes Masculinity Tick? Just Spend Some Time in a Watch Forum. This post is part of Outward , Slate’s home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture Read more here . On Thursday, NYPD commissioner James P. O’Neill apologized for the force’s harassment of LGBTQ people that led to the Stonewall riots of 1969. Amid pressure from gay New York City Council speaker Corey Johnson, who pointed out in a Wednesday radio interview that the NYPD had apologized for other past offenses, O’Neill issued his statement at a Pride month safety briefing. “I think it would be irresponsible to go through World Pride month and not to speak of the events at the Stonewall Inn in June of 1969,” he said, referencing the international Pride festival coming to New York in the second half of June. “I do know what happened should not have happened. The actions taken by the NYPD were wrong, plain and simple.” “The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive, and for that, I apologize,” he continued. “I vow to the LGBTQ community that this would never happen in the NYPD in 2019.” The Stonewall uprising, a major inflection point in the modern LGBTQ rights movement, marks its 50 th anniversary this year. On June 28, 1969, NYPD officers raided the Manhattan gay bar and frisked, assaulted, and arrested patrons, as was customary at the time. Hundreds of LGBTQ people arrived on the scene to fight back in protests and acts of physical resistance that lasted days. The riots became a galvanizing moment for gay and trans people who were sick of being expected to accept police harassment as the price of being queer or gender nonconforming in public, and they are the event that the Pride marches were originally organized to commemorate. In recent years, O’Neill and his predecessor, Bill Bratton, have refused to apologize for the NYPD’s history of violence against LGBTQ people. When asked in June 2017 if he would “apologize for the discrimination and violence” the NYPD perpetrated during the clash at the Stonewall Inn, O’Neill said , “I think that’s been addressed already. … We’re moving forward.” A year earlier, Bratton said of such an apology, “I don’t think that’s necessary. The apology is all that’s occurred since then.” The “terrible experience” queer and trans people suffered at Stonewall ultimately begat “so much good,” he said. O’Neill was reportedly met with applause when he reversed his stance on Thursday. But it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what his belated contrition will accomplish. The apology will certainly benefit the NYPD, which will enjoy a bump of Pride month goodwill from certain quarters. As for LGBTQ people, however, it’s unclear what a verbal apology for 50-year-old acts of homo- and transphobic violence is supposed to prove. The lesson of Stonewall is not “do not raid Mafia-run gay bars,” which is not really a pressing queer—or cop!—concern in 2019. It’s “do not systemically target, harass, and criminalize LGBTQ and otherwise marginalized communities.” That’s a lesson the NYPD does not seem to have learned. It took activists years—until this very month—to successfully pressure the department into amending its enforcement of a section of the penal code that criminalizes loitering that may be related to sex work. Officers have been profiling trans women as sex workers under the law, using their clothing and other elements of gender presentation as justification for their arrests. This is just one example of the ways the NYPD, like law enforcement bodies around the country , continues to terrorize and punish LGBTQ people for their identities. Stonewall wasn’t remarkable because of the way the cops on the scene behaved—their physical and verbal abuse were, by all accounts, routine. The riots became historically important because of what the targets of the NYPD’s harassment did in response. To apologize for just this one act out of the NYPD’s many, ongoing acts of LGBTQ criminalization is to miss Stonewall’s entire point. At this moment in LGBTQ history, activists are mobilizing in increasing numbers to create their own police-free Pride events and get uniformed police officers out of mainstream Pride celebrations. This movement recognizes the fact that, for many LGBTQ people, law enforcement bodies do not protect from, but rather perpetrate, discrimination and violence. Apologizing for beating queer and trans people, arresting them for wearing the clothes of their choosing, and subjecting them to organized harassment in 1969 is not taking a stance for LGBTQ dignity in 2019. It’s an empty gesture performed far too late to make any meaningful statement on Stonewall, and a slick distraction from the ongoing state violence being perpetrated against LGBTQ people living today.

Fashionable lateness is a scourge. Parties need arrive-by times.,slate.com,Shannon Palus,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/party-lateness-need-arrive-by-times-on-invitations.html,"Want to Learn What Makes Masculinity Tick? Just Spend Some Time in a Watch Forum. The other week, one of my colleagues was headed to an elopement party that allegedly started at noon. She thought she should probably arrive at noon : Though the couple was already married, the party was still essentially a stand-in celebration for a more traditional wedding, and it’s rude to be late to a wedding. Her husband disagreed, intuiting that this party waslow-key enough to arrive after the formal gun time. The fight wasn’t worked out, exactly, but between him not being ready to leave for a bit, and a hunt from parking, they arrived at 12:30. “I was panicked,” my colleague told me. What if their late arrival somehow interrupted their friends’ special day? It didn’t. In fact, it turned out that some people strolled in even later than they did. But the debate she engaged in with her husband is a common one. Coming to the wrong consensus can mean either burdening a host who wasn’t yet expecting guests or interrupting a thoughtfully timed progression of events. Even when things work out fine, as they did here, there can be a lot of stress (and relationship strain) in the process. But there is a small but meaningful way to improve on this situation: party invitations that spell out precisely when to show up. Sure, parties have start times. But these are not directives. Arriving exactly on time is actually kind of rude, since that’s valuable time for the host to perfect the playlist and remove anything breakable. Instead, common wisdom holds that you should arrive fashionably late—but how late is fashionable and how late is too late? This is a total mystery. A FiveThirtyEight investigation once found among hundreds of party guests, the median arrival time was “a whopping 58 minutes after the party’s designated start time,” but also that it depended on many factors. In the case of larger parties, for example, the investigation concluded that you should “show up whenever you feel like it,” which still seems too loaded of an action. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people—I do not want to be regarded as a dweeb. You might not even know what direction to err on. Maybe the host likes to go to bed early, so you shouldn’t arrive too much after the start. But maybe you don’t know the host that well, so you should avoid arriving too close to the start time, because then you’ll have to make one-on-one small talk. But maybe the party will be quite small, in which case it’s rude to lumber in after everyone has carefully selected a spot in the living room around a cheese board. Which brings us to: Will there be dinner there, even a snack-y kind of dinner like pizza? Because it is terrible, for you, to arrive after the pizza is gone. On the other hand, you don’t want to look like you’re just there to eat dinner! When it comes to direct advice, plenty of people advocate for arriving pretty close to on time. “If you show up 45 minutes late for a 45-year-old’s party they will hate you,” according to a colleague who is presumably either 45 or has had a harrowing experience with a 45-year-old. As Jen Doll wrote in a guide to attending parties for the New York Times , “the very best time to get there is right when the party starts,” because that’s when it’s easiest to mingle. This is good advice for some people, people who are bold enough to follow it. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people—I do not want to be regarded as a dweeb. The clear logical solution to this collective-action problem is invitations that specify both a start time, as they do now, and an “arrive by” time. (If you want everyone to be on time, these can be the same thing.) If this seems overbearing, consider that we already spell out the etiquette with other parties. It’s commonplace for the gift situation to be clearly dictated, e.g., “no gifts,” or “accepting donations on behalf of Planned Parenthood,” or “we are honeymooning in the Maldives, can you basically Venmo us?” Many invitations even take a swing at a suggestion of how to dress, particularly if the occasion is more formal. (Additional note: Any deployment of the words cocktail attire should be hyperlinked to photos of example outfits.) Really, in the age of electronic invitations, providing instructions to guests is easier than ever. You’re not limited to the information you can fit on a card or a flier. Your email or Facebook (well, please no ) invite can also include details on what time various other parts of the party will occur. It’s true that as we adjust to the new world order, you will have to be very clear that when you put an “arrive by” time on your invite, you mean it. While you’re at it, consider putting an end time, too, so guests will know when to see themselves out. Even more fraught than a guest who shows up at the wrong time is the one you have to explicitly tell to leave."

2019 Women’s World Cup: How France became the tournament favorite.,slate.com,Eric Betts,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/2019-womens-world-cup-france-favorite-lyon.html,"The Most Interesting Thing About China’s Plan to Relentlessly Foul Germany: It Nearly Worked The world’s best women’s soccer team isn’t going to win the 2019 World Cup, but its players might win it for somebody else. Olympique Lyonnais has won France’s Division 1 Féminine for the past 13 years and the past four Women’s Champions League titles. It features the best player from England (Lucy Bronze), France (Eugénie Le Sommer), Germany (Dzsenifer Marozsán), Japan (Saki Kumagai), and Norway (Ada Hegerberg, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2018 as the world’s top player). The World Cup is not Space Jam , and Lyon’s team of Monstars will go their separate ways for the tournament (minus Hegerberg, who hasn’t played for her national team since 2017). But beyond the headliners, the club’s impact will be seen in the performance of host nation France, which enters as a co-favorite with the U.S. If the French win the title, they’ll owe as much to their domestic league’s resident superteam as to their host nation advantage. Lyon employs seven of the top eight French players, including the team’s goalkeeper, three of four likely starters on defense, captain Amandine Henry, and Le Sommer. The spine of the team has essentially been preparing together for this tournament all season, and those months (or years) of additional reps have historically proved invaluable when trying to build a dominant national side. The famous Hungarian men’s “Golden Team” of the 1950s—Olympic champions in 1952, World Cup runners-up in 1954, and the first foreign opponent to beat the English national team in England—was constructed on a framework of players who had been conscripted by the national service to play for the army’s team Honvéd. The dominant Dutch men’s team of 1974 had a core of players who had won three consecutive European Cups with Ajax. South Korea’s men’s national team spent three months together in a training camp ahead of its home World Cup in 2002 and rode its newfound cohesion (and some fortunate refereeing decisions) all the way to the semifinals. France is hardly the only European squad to benefit from a core that spends most of its season together. England—fourth favorites behind France, the U.S., and Germany—draws nearly half its squad from Manchester City and Chelsea. Spain, perhaps not a threat to win the 2019 tournament but looking to move closer to contention, features 10 players who ply their trade at Barcelona. By contrast, the U.S. team is scattered among the clubs of the National Women’s Soccer League, with no more than four representatives from any one team and no more than two probable starters. The U.S. women are hardly strangers. The team has played 30 games together since the beginning of 2018. But the U.S. has held an institutional advantage in the past: the funding to put on long training camps not just immediately before the World Cup, but before the Olympics and tournaments such as the Algarve Cup. That benefit is beginning to erode as investment increases globally. The U.S. team’s Group F opponent Thailand played only 10 games in 2014 before the 2015 World Cup, but its qualification for that tournament inspired the Thai federation to invest more money in developing women’s soccer. In 2018, it played 26 games and qualified for the World Cup for the second time. The world’s soccer federations still have a long way to go toward resolving the gender pay gap, as evidenced by the U.S. players’ lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation , but the disparity of investment is starkest at the club level. The money spent on female players’ salaries was so paltry a year and a half ago that a study found that all the players in the world’s top seven leagues earned about the same as Neymar by himself, approximately $42 million. It’s not hard to see why a committed spender, like Lyon, is able to create a dominant force. (The same isn’t true on the men’s side, where China’s attempt to manufacture a global men’s soccer power has gotten off to a halting start .) The distribution of that money on the women’s side is still uneven enough in many of the big European leagues that the best talent gets funneled to just a couple of clubs with better environments and higher pay scales. That builds cohesion for those countries’ national teams in the short term, but there is potentially a downside of playing on a superteam. Some suspect that Lyon’s French players aren’t properly battle-tested for a big tournament like the World Cup because they win most of their club games at a jog. If France falls far short of the high standard set by its top club team, then maybe we’ve had it backward. Maybe the national squad is really a feeder team for Lyon."
"Hannity, Trump, and the whole “lock her up” crew are absolutely outraged at Pelosi’s prosecution and prison comment.",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/hannity-trump-lock-her-up-pelosi-prosecution-and-prison-comment.html,"Comment House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told Democratic leaders that she didn’t want to impeach President Donald Trump, something she has long been resistant to politically, but instead wanted to see him “in prison,” Politico reported earlier this week.* The comment was part of Pelosi’s greater argument that the best way to seek some modicum of justice when it comes to what appears to be criminal behavior by Trump outlined in the Mueller report is to wait until he’s out of office and no longer has presidential immunity to allow the legal system to run its course. It’s a strategic decision based on evidence that crimes appear to have been committed, namely obstruction of justice, among many potential others, that may ultimately be prosecutable. It’s also calculus that is largely deferential to Trump, as president, and relies on the now-quaint notion of the rule of law being used to redress past wrongs. Some Democrats don’t love Pelosi’s approach because they believe impeachment proceedings are the appropriate forum to address Trump’s apparent crimes. Fox News host Sean Hannity, on the other hand, was absolutely gobsmacked by Pelosi’s comments. On his show Thursday night, Hannity oscillated between outrage and disbelief that Democrats might see a legitimate legal case for prosecuting Trump once out of office.
Hannity: Speaker Pelosi now apparently telling senior Democrats that she’d like to see Trump behind bars. Based on no actual crimes, she wants a political opponent locked up in prison? That happens in banana republics—beyond despicable behavior. And by the way, they would literally turn, in many ways, the USA into a country we no longer recognize. Hmm … jailing political opponents, you say? Who on earth would suggest such an outrageous thing? Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2018 You get the idea. Trump was actually asked about Pelosi’s comments and had typically Trump things to say. “I actually don’t think she’s a talented person,” Trump said . “I’ve tried to be nice to her because I would’ve liked to have gotten some deals done. She’s incapable of doing deals.” I guess that counts as progress from the president.

"Biden Changes Mind, Says He’s Now Against Decades-Old Ban on Federal Funding for Abortion",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/biden-changes-mind-reverses-hyde-amendment-abortion-dnc-campaign-federal-funding-medicaid.html,"Five Teenage Boys Arrested for Attack on Lesbian Couple in London Bus Joe Biden is eyeing a run against President Donald Trump that stakes out the political center of the electorate, but that means he’s often running to the right of the current Democratic field. On Thursday, however, Biden reversed course , veering left on an issue that is of increasing importance for Democratic voters: the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions. Biden has supported the measure, which dates back to 1976, throughout his political life, with his campaign reaffirming its support as recently as this week. Amidst growing pressure, however, Biden announced Thursday he had changed his mind on the issue, saying that “circumstances have changed.” “We’ve seen state after state including Georgia passing extreme laws,” Biden explained. “It’s clear that these folks are going to stop at nothing to get rid of Roe .” Other Democrats in the 2020 field have called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment because it prohibited Medicaid funding of abortion, which disproportionately affected poor women and women of color. Biden expounded on his change of heart Thursday evening during a DNC-hosted gala in Atlanta. “I’ve been working through the finer details of my health care plan like others in this race, and I’ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents,” Biden said. “If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s ZIP code.” Biden cited the growth of anti-abortion laws in states, particularly in the deep south, that has made abortion procedures more and more difficult to access, while also setting up a potential Supreme Court challenge to Roe v. Wade . “Folks, times have changed,” Biden said. “I don’t think these guys are going to let up.” “At a time where the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Roe are under attack, we need full-throated allies in our leaders,” Ilyse Hogue, president of the abortion rights group Naral Pro-Choice America, said of Biden’s reversal. “We’re pleased that Joe Biden has joined the rest of the 2020 Democratic field in coalescing around the Party’s core values—support for abortion rights, and the basic truth that reproductive freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of equality and economic security in this country.” Biden, a Catholic, hasn’t always hewed to the Democratic Party line on abortion rights, but times have indeed changed. The Democratic Party he hopes to lead has shifted to the left in the era of Trump while anti-abortion legislation has gained traction in state legislatures. That puts the issue front-and-center in the buildup to 2020 and Biden’s stance on the Hyde Amendment was a potential point of attack for Democratic challengers looking to paint the former VP as out of step with the current mood of the party. Biden will likely still have some convincing to do for many on the left, but maintained that he would make “no apologies for the last position.”"
Trump administration to open new mass border facility to hold unaccompanied migrant children.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-hhs-new-mass-border-facility-unaccompanied-migrant-minors-children.html,"Five Teenage Boys Arrested for Attack on Lesbian Couple in London Bus The Trump administration says it will open a new emergency detention facility to house as many as 1,600 minors that come across the border unaccompanied. The new facility will be fashioned out of an old housing complex along the border for oil field workers in Carrizo Springs, Texas, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The move comes after the Trump administration announced Wednesday more than 11,000 of the nearly 133,000 migrants arrested crossing the border last month were unaccompanied children. “All the new facilities will be considered temporary emergency shelters, so they won’t be subject to state child welfare licensing requirements,” a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman told the Associated Press. “The agency is also weighing using Army and Air Force bases in Georgia, Montana and Oklahoma to house an additional 1,400 kids in the coming weeks, amid the influx of children traveling to the U.S. alone.” Overall, as of May, HHS said nearly 41,000 children have been referred to the resettlement agency and that 13,200 children are currently in HHS custody. “After being apprehended by the Border Patrol, unaccompanied minors are generally transferred to HHS custody within 72 hours,” CNN reports . “HHS then is tasked with finding a sponsor in the United States for the children, meaning, for example, an immediate family member or relative. The average length of stay is 48 days.” “The Carrizo Springs facility announced Thursday will consist of hard-sided structures to shelter children and semi-permanent soft-sided structures “for support operations,” according to CNN. “It likely won’t begin to accept children for another month.”"
U.S. and Russian ships come within feet of one another in near-collision.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/american-russian-navy-ships-collide-philippine-sea-uss-chancellorsville-admiral-vinogradov.html,"Five Teenage Boys Arrested for Attack on Lesbian Couple in London Bus A Russian destroyer and the American guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville nearly collided in the Philippine Sea on Friday, prompting both sides to blame the other for the two vessels coming between 50 and 100 feet of one another in open water. The U.S. Navy characterized the Russian ship’s approach as “unsafe and unprofessional,” saying it prompted the American ship to take emergency action. Russia’s Pacific Fleet, however, said basically the opposite, that it was the U.S. cruiser that was at fault for crossing sharply in front of the Russian destroyer Admiral Vinogradov. The Russians say it was they who had to perform emergency maneuvering to avoid the U.S. ship. This sounds like a very familiar Russian line of argument at this point, and Navy Cmdr. Clayton Doss, a spokesperson, dismissed the Russian claims as “propaganda.” The U.S. Navy subsequently released a video of the near collision that shows the Russian vessel appearing to methodically approach the U.S. ship, inching closer and closer until the two ships were abreast and you can see Russian sailors sitting on deck. This is the latest in a series of near-misses between Russian and American craft and the second close call this week. “On Tuesday, the Navy’s 6 th Fleet said a Russian Su-35 fighter plane flew ‘directly in front’ of a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon over the eastern Mediterranean,” the Washington Post reports . “There were no injuries or harm to the planes, but the Navy called the Russian interception an ‘irresponsible’ action that ‘put our pilots and crew at risk.’ ”"
Men’s watch forums taught me all about masculinity.,slate.com,Eli Heina Dadabhoy,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/watch-forum-masculinity-rabbit-holes.html,"Rabbit Holes: Why I Motivate Myself by Scrolling Through Dale Earnhardt Memes Rabbit Holes is a recurring series in which writers pay homage to the diversity and ingenuity of the ways we procrastinate now. To pitch your personal rabbit hole, email . My day job is writing software guides, content for those help sites you only look at when you’re already tearing out your hair about technology meant to simplify your life, not further complicate it. But I can only develop so much helpful visual content in a day, and so at some point, I fire up my incognito window and start poking around. Social media feeds used to be my go-to procrastination station, but then the 2016 election happened, and scrolling took a turn for the decidedly higher stakes. This meant I was courting emotional turmoil every time I logged on, and it’s hard to care about what to call a tricky button in a user interface after my political hot buttons have been pressed. Online shopping saved me. Not only is it calming, but it also reminds me of why I do actually care about word choice at work: I can use my earnings to buy cool things. At the time when I first limited social media, what I really wanted was an affordable, decent watch. But which to buy? I had no idea. My husband is a pocket watch man, so he was of no use. The other men I know, bless them, mostly wear watches that the women in their lives buy for them, or have relatively plain taste. When it comes to aesthetic choices, I am both particular and frugal. Which was how I found myself typing “inexpensive durable stylish men’s watches” into the search bar like my name was Jim and I had been online for all of 20 minutes instead of 20 years. To my surprise, watch research wasn’t as difficult as I had expected. It took fewer than 10 clicks to get past the sponsored lists. What followed were years-old, passionate discussions of watches on archived forums. I can’t tell you how they ended up accidentally search-optimized, but I wasn’t complaining about the unexpected ease. As I read, I saw that in looking for a masculine way to accessorize, I had discovered lessons on masculinity via a less-sexualized version of locker room talk. Watch forums were a context in which men talked to other men about manly things with the assumption that it’s all guys here, bro. Watch forums were a context in which men talked to other men about manly things with the assumption that it’s all guys here, bro. The most vocal men assumed their personal priorities in timekeepers were universally shared by all other reasonable human beings. It was fascinating, this glimpse into the impulse behind mansplaining … and, I feared, a window to what my future would look like if I continued to present in a more and more masculine way. At the same time that I was looking for a watch, I was considering gender transition. Would I end up like these men who derided others’ choices, never stopping to wonder whether priorities different from theirs might be valid, especially when it comes to something as low-stakes as a fashion accessory? Was being that far up one’s own ass a mandatory side effect of having a flatter chest and more testosterone? It turns out that “fashion watch” is effectively a slur to the heirloom fetishists who shout their way through watch forum threads. These men declare that they would only spend money on a watch that they can pass down to their future grandsons. They scoff at the very existence of watches that don’t last for several generations. When it comes to timepieces, they assure, you should care about longevity first, then function, and then maybe form, but mostly nostalgia for your future role as Venerable Patriarch. Think ahead to the year 2070 and imagine the look on little Johnny’s face as you present him with his dear Grampappy’s vintage watch, still keeping time perfectly all these years later. How could anyone so shortsightedly deprive him of that moment? Of that precious keepsake? At first, I found this posturing hilariously out-of-touch. My vilified generation is rejecting heirlooms for practical reasons, not having children due to financial and environmental concerns, and abandoning strict gender roles in favor of flexibility. How bizarrely backward is it for someone to assume he would have a grandson in the first place, let alone one who would want his old relics? I was reminded of the pocket watch in Pan’s Labyrinth , which is my favorite movie, not least because of its unflinching depiction of woman-inclusive resistance to brutal patriarchal fascism. Through the lens of the movie, my initial mirth at the Watch Dudes dissipated, leaving me with my gender anxieties. The villain, Captain Vidal, is meticulous about his appearance and cares deeply about his watch. Vidal’s father had smashed the watch while dying in combat and asked that it be given to Vidal so that he would understand what sort of man Vidal Sr. was. When anti-fascist fighters are about to kill him, Captain Vidal attempts to repeat his father’s gesture, pleading with them to pass the watch along to his son. Unsurprisingly, they assure him that his preferred version of the future will never come to pass. The family line of masculine violence ends up as broken as the heirloom timepiece Vidal so treasures. Whose side would I find myself on, I wondered, as my surface-level appearance and concerns began to resemble the fascist Vidal more than the anti-fascist resistance in the story? After all, I had encountered hypermasculine trans men before, trans men who seemed to me to be no better on the gender equality front than any other man. What did it mean that I was casting aside femininity in a time when fascism and anti-fascism are relevant concepts in the world yet again? There are no clear answers to that question, so I had to take comfort in addressing a much easier one: What did I want from a watch? Aspiring grandfathers could keep their boring-looking, entry-level quartz movements. I wanted what I had searched for from the beginning: an inexpensive, durable, stylish men’s watch for less than $100. In case you’re wondering, I have three now. My first was a gently used fashion watch, followed by a vintage Russian diver’s watch and, last but not least, a brand-new watch that has some chance of surviving me but, more importantly, was both gorgeous and on sale. I have no plans to buy more watches anytime soon. Progressing in my gender transition has strengthened me enough to engage with social media again. And yet, I still find myself trawling watch forums regularly. Happy in my newfound confidence, I marvel at the words of the men I find there, men trying to both keep and cheat time by acquiring a watch that, by outliving them, might lend them a kind of immortality."
The Department of Energy’s decision to reclassify some nuclear waste.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Future Tense Newsletter: How Not to Run an Election Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon. To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.) The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment , the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon . Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff? The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus . But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising , but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets , which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered . Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.” Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending . Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup. We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude. On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the processed waste, turned into glass, currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. (Waste awaiting this processing is kept in a different, larger area.) Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But for comparison, La Hague processes around 1,200 metric tons of waste a year , while the U.S. is expected to accumulate around 2,200 metric tons of waste a year.* Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists , also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term. To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report . “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration. But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.
Update, June 12, 2019: This piece has been updated to clarify the size of La Hague’s processed spent fuel cache."

Elaine May's failed Ishtar may have been sabotaged.,slate.com,Evan Chung,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/ishtar-movie-failure-elaine-may-sabotage.html,"Mindy Kaling Met With Colbert’s Female Staffers as Research for Late Night Elaine May’s film Ishtar came to theaters dead on arrival in the summer of 1987. Advance publicity had killed any potential for it to succeed. Before audiences ever got a chance to see it, they had read newspaper and magazine articles filled with anonymously sourced anecdotes about May’s eccentricities on set and the film’s cost overrun. So it was little wonder that the movie bombed and almost immediately became a sitcom punchline. In recent years critics have been recognizing Ishtar ’s terrible reputation as unearned and Elaine May’s subsequent relegation to Hollywood jail as unjust. The film’s prescient satire of America’s policy in the Middle East has made it a favorite of directors like Martin Scorsese and Richard Linklater. Ishtar is genuinely funny, from its intentionally awful songs to its stunt casting: It is Dustin Hoffman who’s cast as the lady’s man, and Warren Beatty as the schlub with no game. In the latest episode of Studio 360, producer Evan Chung explores some of the possible factors contributing to Ishtar ’s demise, ranging from critical revenge to endemic sexism in the industry. But there’s a juicier theory that’s been put forth by Elaine May and the movie’s stars, Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman. Could Ishtar have been the victim of sabotage?

His replacement was a British producer named David Puttnam—a choice that immediately raised alarms for the Ishtar team for three reasons: David Puttnam was a vocal critic of movies with inflated budgets—like Ishtar . Puttnam arrived at Columbia with a clear goal of eliminating what he saw as rampant overspending in Hollywood. Ishtar— whose budget had ballooned into the estimated $40 million range—appeared to be under threat. David Puttnam had a feud with Warren Beatty . Before Warren Beatty’s film Reds was released in 1981, Puttnam told the columnist Marilyn Beck that “Warren Beatty should be spanked in public” for spending so much on on the film, calling it “a disgrace and an insult to every professional in the film industry.” At the time, both films were seen as Best Picture rivals ( Chariots of Fire would eventually win the Oscar). David Puttnam also had a feud with Dustin Hoffman. As a producer, Puttnam had initiated the 1979 film Agatha ,which starred Dustin Hoffman. Later, Puttnam told an interviewer, “My experience with [Hoffman] was an unhappy one. There seemed to be a malevolence in him, a determination to make other human beings unhappy.” So David Puttnam, who had a public beef with the two stars of Ishtar and a philosophical objection to expensive movies like Ishtar , was now the man overseeing the film in the middle of production. And when negative stories started appearing before the movie’s release—including a particularly damning cover article in New Yorkmagazine—the Ishtar filmmakers smelled a rat. “The feeling was that a lot of these stories were instigated and put out there, if not thought up by Mr. Puttnam, at least with his blessings,” Ishtar ’s artistic consultant Phillip Schopper tells Studio 360. “Because he wanted to be the new regime. Not the old regime that you know would finance a movie like Ishtar . It’s almost as though he encouraged this movie to fail to prove that his way of doing things is better than what these other people were doing before he came on board.” It’s a tantalizing theory, but the allegations of studio self-sabotage remain unsubstantiated. David Puttnam declined to comment. For the full audio version of this story, listen to this episode of Studio 360 below, where host Kurt Andersen introduces the story at the top of the show.

"Scruff app creates gay community for many, but what if you can’t have a smartphone?",slate.com,Mike Stinavage,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/scruff-gay-community-smartphone-access.html,"You Might Cry at Gillette’s Ad Featuring a Dad Teaching His Trans Son to Shave This post is part of Outward , Slate’s home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture. Read more here . I weep as my sweet baby-blue iPhone 5C flickers on and off. Over and over, for no apparent reason, the screen jumbles and pixelates, then blacks out. Though my phone isn’t dead yet, I am already considering how I’ll move on, how I’ll persevere.Financially, I’m not on the verge of anything big except despair, and despair surely won’t cash in enough to pay for a new smartphone. Definitely not an iPhone XR to the tune of $750. Four years ago, I rescued my 5C from a pawn shop in Sheepshead Bay, and now as it lays dying before me, I enter a desert I never knew existed. Not as a hiker or vacationer or to make an amateur porno, as I once did on my 5C. I take the first steps into this bleak desert as an exile on the eve of excommunication from the plethora, the abundance, of gay freedoms that can only be had through smartphones. Here I stand stripped and bare-assed under the pounding sun, alone. I know that many millennial and Gen Z folks are voluntarily opting out of smartphones, and good for them. But I’m not here to reclaim personal liberties. I am here to say farewell to the Scruff community that has made me who I am, helped me come so far. Scruff, for the uninitiated, is an app (much like the more infamous Grindr) where one chats, connects, makes plans, and infrequently meets up with guys who are around the block or across the globe. Moments ago, I used it to send ass pics to old friends and nearby men, and just before that I searched new guys in Chelsea, Zona Rosa, and Kreuzberg. Only now do I realize that those maps, those faces that received my jockstrapped ass, were a distinct privilege I should have savored. For so many months I delayed the Scruff Pro upgrade, thinking that I had time where I didn’t have money. I look back now with regret that I’ll never have access to the videos, unlimited private albums, and the full grid. It’s over. In this polarized world, there are only Democrats and Republicans, smartphones and Jitterbugs , and these classes of people certainly don’t mix. I am about to be a Jitterbugger, and I don’t know where to look for solidarity, for community. Back to the red Midwest? To a retirement home? I’m being dramatic and reactionary and fatalistic because this really is traumatic. Back when it was just me and my 5C, I used to feel desperate when I scrolled up and down the same grid from bed without a flicker of excitement, barely a blood rush to anywhere. The grid was full of familiar faces, not of people I’d met (except for my boyfriend, I’ve met him). They were familiar because I’d done that purgatorial scroll every day for months. So few men ventured through my vicinity. No one new came through the gates of that waiting room, and anyone deemed eager or hyperfriendly had already been blocked. Now that I’m leaving, I curse my callousness. I’m off to a hell where a lack of headless torsos will be my torture. A new desperation consumes me. I face a world where booty calls are limited to people I already know. No more anonymous men will find me blindfolded and waiting in Shape-ups. No more falling asleep while clutching Scruff. No more waking up to Scruff in my palm, the same five conversations from the night before active and ready to blow. No more gym mirror selfies to spur my imagination. I face a world where aggressive locked eyes, furrowed brows, and red-faced cruising are the only option, because without the Scruff safety net, it’s now or never. I suppose I should dive into the gay archives to learn the language of cruising. Thank you, Edmund White, James Baldwin, Dennis Cooper, etc., for your contributions, but they’re fucking useless. Twenty years ago, maybe that would’ve worked, but today, horny men don’t cruise the streets or sit around Christopher Street Pier and do anything but suntan. We stand divided at public urinals, more scared of each other than enticed. There’s one more serious obstacle. If I cruise men and don’t sleep with them immediately, they will expect text-courting and, of course, dick pics. How will I tell them that my Jitterbug doesn’t have a camera? Perhaps I should say that I am concerned about the safety of our digital information, the commodification of our messages? No. Boner killer. The denial of a pic request, no matter the excuse, triggers a red flag, and that flag reads: below average . And who am I to judge? Exchanging dick pics establishes trust throughout the gay community. It guarantees that even if the guy sucks, his dick is still worth blowing. I wonder, would it be a waste of paper to distribute handouts with my recent nudes and dick pics? All banter aside, my concern is real. As interaction increasingly takes place on apps, digital space becomes the only space. The app once allowed me to program my exact erotic fantasies to be as indulgently weird, raw, and anonymous as possible. I filtered men from a distance and flaked in a pinch. I excluded nonsense, the unknown, the known, all the unnecessary, in favor of constantly changing and exciting prospects, just one screen away. Now, there’s simply no way to achieve all the assurances that Scruff provided. Without a smartphone, without the apps, I too am deleted. After a couple days teetering between depression and hysteria, it turns out I underestimated some details. Twenty bucks and a new phone screen later, my baby-blue 5C is back on the grid. Nothing can come between me and my community (that is, unless my 5C can’t handle Scruff’s latest update). But then, as I refresh the grid for the 12 th time in an hour, a thought occurs to me: Maybe something already has? Maybe it’s not great that I feel like I need an app to mediate my gay existence? Maybe. But the thought doesn’t last long—UrNutMy_Butt just unlocked his pics. "
The Free Press Is Under Attack in Australia,slate.com,Rachel Withers,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/australia-media-freedom-police-raids.html,"Five Teenage Boys Arrested for Attack on Lesbian Couple in London Bus A journalist’s home raided after she reported on a secret government plan to spy on citizens’ texts and emails. A public broadcaster raided over a major report into the killing of unarmed civilians. A radio presenter “warned” over reporting on asylum-seekers and asked to turn over his sources. A whistleblower facing 161 years in prison. Human rights groups sounding the alarm about the intimidation of the media. Welcome to Australia. The Australian Federal Police, known as the AFP, the force responsible for policing Australia’s national security, conducted two raids on the media in as many days this week, over two unrelated reports drawing on leaked classified documents—stories that were each over a year old. On Tuesday morning, the AFP showed up at the home of Sunday Telegraph political editor Annika Smethurst as she was preparing for work, conducting a raid that lasted more than seven hours and allegedly involved rifling through her underwear drawer. (Don’t worry, police have since said: They had female officers to do that.) The raid sought to uncover sources from a 2018 Telegraphreport that revealed leaked government correspondence considering radical new surveillance powers —an idea that was reportedly canned following the report. Then on Wednesday, the AFP raided the headquarters of the Australian Broadcasting C orporation, the national broadcaster, with a warrant granting access to journalists’ notes, article drafts, graphics, visuals, meeting minutes, and emails relating to a 2017 story on the killing of unarmed Afghans by Australian special forces, in an eight-hour search that was live-tweeted by an ABC journalist. The military lawyer who leaked “the Afghan files” has already been charged and pleaded not guilty, standing by the leaks . Police say that the two raids were unconnected , outside of both relating to “the alleged publishing of information classified as an official secret.” In both cases, the authorities vaguely invoked “ national security ,” although it’s not been explained how the stories actually compromised Australia’s national security. Initially, the police appeared to be going after the leakers, not the journalists themselves, but the AFP has since updated its post-raid statement , mentioning sections of the law that make not just leaking but communicating classified documents an indictable offence. The acting AFP commissioner on Thursday declared that the police have not “ ruled out ” charging the journalists. Radio host Ben Fordham was reportedly also warned this week of an investigation into “unauthorized disclosure” by the Department of Home Affairs, after he revealed information about asylum-seeker boats attempting journeys to Australia , while the AFP has warned of further raids in the coming days and weeks. This is the culmination of years of increasingly repressive security laws, and an increasingly powerful national security apparatus. Whether or not journalists are ultimately prosecuted, these raids are being viewed as a clear attack on freedom of the press, an attempt to intimidate both journalists and whistleblowers. A spokesman for the Rupert Murdoch–owned News Corp, which owns Smethurst’s Sunday Telegraph, said that the raid “sends clear and dangerous signals to journalists and newsrooms across Australia.” It’s unusual and heartening to see the divided press so united , with the raids being condemned in all corners of the media. It helps that “both sides” have been raided, with bitter enemies the ABC and News Corp rallying around each other in a rare moment of agreement. The National Press Club of Australia said the raids will have a “chilling effect on the right of journalists to carry out their jobs,” while the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery called them “an attack on press freedom and a danger for the wider freedoms of all Australians.” The raids present a strong warning to potential future whistleblowers: don’t. Although the journalists involved have sworn to protect their sources, it’s highly likely that those sources will now be prosecuted. Recent laws have increased the sanctions on whistleblowers, who already faced harsh consequences under Australian law: A Taxation Office whistleblower in another case is facing 161 years in prison , while the whistleblower at the center of the ABC’s “Afghan files” leak faces a potential life sentence. Human rights groups are also sounding the alarm, with the Human Rights Law Centre saying the raids were “part of a damaging trend of attacks on press freedom and democracy in Australia.” Reporters Without Borders tweeted, “The scene might be expected in an authoritarian country but not in a democracy.” Peter Greste, director of the Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom, suggested that these raids are “on the same spectrum” as his 2013 jailing by the Egyptian government. While the raids are being roundly condemned by media and human rights groups, they are being quietly defended by the government. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has refused to condemn the raids , while also denying his recently reelected center-right government’s involvement. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton (a former police officer himself), whose ministry was at the center of Smethurst’s report, denied prior knowledge of the raids, calling suggestions of government interference an attack on police independence. But the timing is suspicious, to say the least. The raids have come just after a contentious election, one that might have been swayed by this kind of scandal. (In the 2016 election, a raid that made the Labor Party look bad took place during the campaign.) They also occurred while Morrison was out of the country, attending D-Day commemorations in the United Kingdom. Even if the raids weren’t directed by the government, the timing suits it rather well. Others have suggested the government’s reelection win may have actually emboldened it to order the raids. The powers being used aren’t brand-new,nor are the reports being investigated, so why pursue these cases now? And if the high-profile raids are unrelated, why have they come back to back? (The AFP claims it was a matter of resources .) New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties President Pauline Wright suggested that government officials are now “ showing their muscle ” on recently expanded laws, while Richard Flanagan, writing in the Guardian , called the government both “uninhibited” and “unhinged,” suggesting this signaled a turn toward authoritarianism. If the cases are not specifically connected, journalist Janine Perrett noted, the timing indicates a “ co-ordinated crackdown ” on press freedom. These raids may seem shocking, but many familiar with Australia’s “ ever-expanding ” national security laws were not surprised. It’s telling that the raid against Smethurst was in response to a report about further attempts to increase surveillance on Australian citizens—this is the culmination of years of increasingly repressive security laws, and an increasingly powerful national security apparatus. Last June, the government introduced new espionage laws , increasing the penalties on public officials who leak classified information and making it an offense for anyone to communicate that information. Under the initial proposal, journalists could have faced charges merely for possessing classified information, but after media industry complaints and a series of amendments, this was changed, and a “ public interest ” defense was added for journalists who report it. But despite pleas from the Law Council, no such defense was added for those who leak the info, leaving public interest whistleblowers at risk. The stories at the center of the raids predate the new powers and will be prosecuted under previous laws, but it’s not hard to see them as part of the same anti-whistleblower trend. The changes are part of an even broader pattern, one that has been going on for many years. In 2014, the government introduced a controversial metadata retention scheme , requiring telecommunications companies to store customer metadata for two years and make it available to government agencies without a warrant—a threat to journalist-source confidentiality. The scheme was later amended to include a “ journalist information warrant ,” requiring agencies to obtain a warrant if data is accessed to identify a journalist’s source, but there’s nothing to stop authorities from fishing around. The Australian government has also been criticized recently, including on Slate, for its increasingly strict national security regulations, including the social media censorship laws it rushed through following the New Zealand terrorist attacks and the restrictions on encryption it passed last year, laws that may affect privacy in the U.S., New America’s director of surveillance policy Sharon Bradford Franklin noted. Australia has more national security laws than any other nation, writes Rebecca Ananian-Welsh in the Conversation , who links recent changes to “a much larger national security framework that includes: control orders, preventative detention orders, [Australian Security Intelligence Organisation] questioning and detention warrants, secret evidence, and offences of espionage, foreign interference, advocating or supporting terrorism, and more.” (Her other research notes that Australia has passed or amended more than 60 anti-terrorism laws since 9/11.) Add in the country’s constrictive defamation laws, considered amongst the most anti-media in the world. (Actor Geoffrey Rush recently won his #MeToo defamation case against News Corp, to the tune of $2.8 million .) And let’s not forget that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, for whom the government has done nothing as he faces extradition to the United States on charges that raise serious concerns about freedom of the press, is an Australian citizen. It’s also difficult to challenge these kind of laws, given that Australia is the only Western nation without a bill of rights , something even former opponents of the idea are now calling for . Why weren’t we panicking sooner? Some were. Following 2018’s new espionage laws, which many saw as a threat to public interest journalism, the Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom released a white paper entitled “Press Freedom in Australia,” providing recommendations to strengthen press freedom, including a Media Freedom Act (something activist group Get Up! is now actively petitioning for ). But overall, Australians weren’t especially concerned. Compared with Americans, Aussies can be disturbingly apathetic about their civil liberties. Even now, opinion pieces are urging regular Australians to care more, as outraged journalists try to convince the people this “ chilling message ” is for them too. Maybe these raids will wake Australians up to the fact to how fragile their rights—especially without a bill of rights to protect them—really are. A movement is brewing in Australia to boycott and change the lyrics of the national anthem, with indigenous Australians—members of the oldest continuous culture on earth—taking issue with the “young” in “ for we are young and free .” Perhaps it’s time we started reconsidering the “free” as well."
Trump should absolutely not raise tariffs after this jobs report,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/business/2019/06/trump-should-absolutely-not-raise-tariffs-after-this-jobs-report.html,"Donald Trump, behatted. Mandel Ngan/Getty Images Friday’s jobs report was not good. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added just 75,000 workers to their payrolls in May; since March, the economy has averaged about 150,000 new jobs a month. That is much lower than what was happening at the start of this year. Jordan Weissmann / Slate This downward trend isn’t necessarily a reason to worry on its own. For instance, employment growth might slow down if we were getting close to full employment—the point where the vast majority of Americans who want a job have one, and there simply aren’t many people left for businesses to hire. But if that were happening now, you would also expect wage growth to be picking up. As Harvard economist Jason Furman points out, it is not. In fact, average pay growth seems to be softening. Here is the puzzling/troubling trend line on nominal wage growth. This could all turn out to have been noise in the data, but for now it is certainly looking like all the celebrations of accelerating wages six months ago (mine included) were premature. pic.twitter.com/a5WWIYrkf6 — Jason Furman (@jasonfurman) June 7, 2019 These trends could just be temporary; the jobs report is fickle, and patterns that have been going on for a few months can always reverse themselves. But they are disconcerting , because the most obvious explanation for what might be going on is that the White House has scared the hell out of businesses in recent months by amping up its trade war with China. (The bond markets are certainly suggesting pessimism among investors.) Trump’s tariffs may be directly cooling the economy a bit as well, since they are, after all, a tax on Americans. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is now on the verge of imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, unless the Mexican government can convince our president that it will stop migrants from heading to the U.S. border. Mexico has already started cracking down in response. But as of Thursday night, the administration said it still planned to go ahead with 5 percent tariffs starting Monday, which could later grow to be as high as 25 percent. (Trump could still decide to pause this plan over the weekend .) Using tariffs to punish our southern neighbor over immigration was already a daft scheme before this month’s jobs report came out. It will almost certainly hurt the U.S. auto industry, which relies on its ability to move parts and cars back-and-forth across a supply chain that stretches across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It will amount to yet another tax on American households. And it is unclear exactly how much the Mexican government can really do to permanently stem the tide of migrants, given the limited resources at its disposal. But with the economy looking as if it could be flagging, the idea of slapping a tariff on every single thing the U.S. buys from Mexico is even worse. If our president had any sense at all, there is absolutely no way he’d be going through with this plan. Unfortunately, we’re not that lucky."

Mindy Kaling met with Colbert's female staffers as research for Late Night (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/mindy-kaling-stephen-colbert-late-night-research.html,"Dr. John Was an Inspiration to New Orleans, The Muppets , and Me Workplace comedies are a hearty perennial, and if there’s one person who’s spent her career sharpening and expanding the form, it’s Mindy Kaling. Most recently, the master of humor-izing paper sales and OB/GYN work fixed her sights on the world of late-night TV in the hilarious (and aptly named) Late Night , which stars Kaling as a wide-eyed diversity hire shaking up an all-white, all-male writers room. As research for the project, Kaling met with actual writers from The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, who, she told Colbert, were much more helpful than the aloof, lazy dimwits populating her fictional writing team. “I actually talked to a lot of female writers on your staff, and it was great to research that because all of my experience is in the scripted half-hour world,” she said while sitting as a guest on Colbert’s show. “It actually made me have a real newfound respect for you.” Kaling has also alluded to drawing inspiration for Late Night from her time writing on The Office , a position she too acquired through a diversity program. Still, Kaling insisted, not everything from the movie reflects her experience. “If you watch the movie, they’re very unwelcoming to my character, but at The Office, those guys were welcoming,” she said. “But I was the only woman and I was the only minority on the staff when I started there.

Barr is lying about Mueller’s evidence.,slate.com,,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/barr-lying-mueller-report.html,"Attorney General William Barr testifies in Washington on May 1. Win McNamee/Getty Images The final report on the Russia investigation , submitted on March 22 by special counsel Robert Mueller, documents multiple attempts by President Donald Trump to obstruct justice. So why hasn’t Trump been indicted? Because one man stands in the way: Attorney General William Barr. Two days after receiving Mueller’s 448-page report, Barr declared Mueller’s evidence insufficient . Since then, Barr has offered no detailed analysis to support his conclusions. Instead, in hearings and interviews, the attorney general has based his judgment on a series of falsehoods. Advertisement It’s time to certify Barr’s declaration as a fraud. No one has cleared Trump. Somebody else—Congress, voters, or a new attorney general—will have to adjudicate Mueller’s evidence. Let’s examine Barr’s statements about the episodes of obstruction Mueller described. 1. The Comey firing. Last week, in an interview with Jan Crawford of CBS News, Barr claimed that Trump’s firing of then–FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 couldn’t be obstruction. The attorney general told Crawford , “We don’t believe that the firing of an agency head could be established as having the probable effect, objectively speaking, of sabotaging a proceeding.” That statement contradicts Mueller’s report. The report says that Comey’s firing could have reined in the investigation by “providing the President with the opportunity to appoint a director … more protective of his personal interests” or “discourag[ing] a successor director or other law enforcement officials” from pursuing the president. The report presents extensive evidence that Trump, prior to firing Comey, pressed him unsuccessfully for personal “loyalty” and favors . In particular, Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had been caught lying about his contacts with Russia. That request exposed Trump’s explicit intent, through the FBI director, to obstruct the investigation. Advertisement 2. The Rosenstein memo. At a Senate hearing on May 1, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas asserted that when Trump fired Comey, “The president was relying, at least in part, on a recommendation by the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, arising out of Rod Rosenstein’s critique of Mr. Comey’s conduct” in the 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails. Cornyn asked Barr, “Is that right?” Barr replied: “That’s right.” No, it’s not right. Mueller’s report spends a dozen pages destroying , through documents and direct witnesses, Trump’s pretense that he relied on Rosenstein’s memo. The report concludes that Trump’s purported reliance on the memo was “pretextual.” Despite this, Barr reaffirmed the pretense. 3. The Lewandowski meetings. Mueller’s report describes two private meetings, in June and July 2017, in which Trump directed his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to tell then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions to abort the investigation of Russia’s 2016 interference. These meetings illustrated Trump’s intent not just to manipulate evidence or replace investigators, but to shut down the whole inquiry. At the May 1 hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked Barr how these meetings could be squared with Barr’s assertion that Trump “fully cooperated” with the investigation. With a straight face, Barr replied: “I don’t see any conflict between that and fully cooperating with the investigation.” 4. The attempt to fire Mueller. The special counsel’s report details two June 2017 phone calls in which Trump instructed then–White House counsel Don McGahn to tell Rosenstein to remove Mueller. Trump made the calls shortly after the Washington Post reported that Mueller was investigating whether Trump had obstructed the Russia inquiry. In testimony to Mueller’s investigators, McGahn said Trump specifically told him “Mueller has to go” and “Call me back when you do it.” Advertisement Barr defends Trump’s contrary account, which the president began peddling only after McGahn’s story came out. At the Senate hearing, Barr presented Trump’s version this way: “What [the president] meant was that the conflict of interest should be raised with Rosenstein, but the decision should be left with Rosenstein.” And in a May 17 interview with Fox News , Barr claimed that according to Mueller’s report, McGahn alleged only that Trump requested to “have Mueller removed for conflicts of interest.” That wouldn’t be obstruction, Barr argued, “because if you remove someone for a conflict of interest, presumably someone else is going to be put in to continue the investigation.” That’s a misrepresentation of Mueller’s report. “McGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House,” says the report. It also notes that “McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President’s request.” The report warns that the president’s removal of a special counsel could “chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel.” Barr simply ignored these points. 5. The McGahn statement. In January 2018, the New York Times reported McGahn’s story about Trump telling him to fire Mueller. In response, Trump demanded that McGahn write a letter denying that that the president had ordered Mueller’s firing. Trump told then–White House staff secretary Rob Porter, “If [McGahn] doesn’t write a letter, then maybe I’ll have to get rid of him.” At a meeting the next day, Trump criticized McGahn for taking notes and asked why McGahn had told Mueller’s investigators about his order to remove the special counsel. Advertisement Trump’s demand for a letter resembles one of the acts for which President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998: encouraging Monica Lewinsky to submit a false affidavit that said, “ I have never had a sexual relationship with the president .” Clinton later argued that the affidavit was true because “sexual relationship” meant “ intercourse ,” not oral sex. Barr offers an equally preposterous defense of the letter Trump demanded from McGahn. It “wasn’t necessarily false,” Barr told senators at the May hearing, because “There is a distinction between saying to someone, ‘Go fire him,’ ‘Go fire Mueller,’ and saying, ‘Have him removed based on conflict.’ ” Barr also misrepresented Mueller’s analysis of why Trump demanded the letter. The attorney general told senators that “as the report shows, there’s ample evidence” to support the argument “that the president’s intent was directed at publicity and the press,” not at the investigation. But the report says just the opposite. Trump’s “efforts to have McGahn write a letter ‘for our records’ approximately ten days after the stories had come out—well past the typical time to issue a correction for a news story—indicates the President was not focused solely on a press strategy, but instead likely contemplated the ongoing investigation,” says the report. Furthermore, it observes the “press strategy” defense can’t explain why Trump, while demanding the letter, also criticized McGahn for telling Mueller’s investigators about Trump’s phone calls seeking to remove Mueller. 6. McGahn’s ongoing testimony. Three times at the Senate hearing, Barr cited McGahn’s cooperation with Mueller as proof that when Trump demanded the letter from McGahn, the president wasn’t trying to obstruct the investigation. “The president was aware,” said Barr, that McGahn “already had testified to the special counsel. He’d given his evidence.” But Mueller’s report makes the opposite point. “Because McGahn had repeatedly spoken to investigators and the obstruction inquiry was not complete,” says the report, “it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again on obstruction-related topics.” In fact, McGahn was interviewed twice more. 7. What Trump knew. Barr’s most astonishing claim is that Trump was entitled to shut down the investigation because the president knew it was “ bogus .” At an April 18 press conference, Barr argued that Trump’s obstructive acts weren’t corrupt because, “ as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion .” Two weeks later, Barr told the Senate: “If the president is being falsely accused—which the evidence now suggests that the accusations against him were false, and he knew they were false, and he felt that this investigation was unfair, propelled by his political opponents, and was hampering his ability to govern—that is not a corrupt motive for replacing an independent counsel.” In fact, said Barr, “ The president could terminate that proceeding, and it would not be a corrupt intent .” Advertisement This position—that a president targeted by an investigation can unilaterally terminate it—is flatly autocratic. For that alone, the attorney general should be impeached. But Barr’s claims about what Trump knew are also false. Mueller’s report documents at least three cases in which Trump tried to thwart, manipulate, or shut down the investigation after learning about suspicious contacts between his advisers and Russia. In January 2017, Trump learned that Flynn had engaged in secret talks with Russia about lifting sanctions. In July 2017, Trump learned that his son, son-in-law, and campaign chairman had met with Russians based on an explicit offer of campaign help from the Kremlin . And in July 2018, Trump was briefed on an indictment that said the 2016 Russian hackers had “ communicated with U.S. persons about the release of stolen documents ,” including Trump adviser Roger Stone . By Trump’s account, these revelations were new to him. But instead of reflecting that the investigation might be onto something, he fired Comey, tried to fire Mueller, and hinted at pardons for Stone and others. A week after the president learned of the Trump Tower meeting, he secretly pressed Lewandowski to shut down the investigation . So when Barr says Trump attacked the inquiry based on personal knowledge that it was meritless, the attorney general is either lying, expressing indifference to what’s in the report, or revealing that he hasn’t read it. Barr’s falsehoods go on and on. He has misrepresented the length of the investigation , the special counsel’s judgment of Trump’s cooperation (“ Bob Mueller obviously felt it was satisfactory ”), and the known effects of Trump’s obstructive acts (“the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation”). He has told so many whoppers that no sensible person should trust his description, much less his assessment, of the Mueller report. The case against the president remains unanswered. "
Trump's Mars-moon-NASA tweet explained.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-mars-moon-nasa-tweet-explained.html,"Alabama Mayor Suggests “Killing” LGBTQ People Is “Only Way” to Fix Society’s Problems Some classic Friday Afternoon Presidential Thoughts (TM) here to unpack: For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2019 First of all, the most glaring of this tweet—the assertion that the moon is part of Mars—is actually both less and more insane than it sounds. It’s less insane in that Trump has previously endorsed a policy of planning moon missions as a means of preparing for a longer mission to Mars. So “of which the Moon is a part” is just a shorthand way of referring to the idea that a modern-era moon landing would be one small step (hahahahaha) toward the larger project of going to the Red Planet. It’s more insane in that highlighting the moon-landing aspect of the project was the Trump administration’s idea in the first place. Mike Pence gave a speech about it in March ! Here’s a tweet about it that Trump sent less than a month ago! Under my Administration, we are restoring @NASA to greatness and we are going back to the Moon, then Mars. I am updating my budget to include an additional $1.6 billion so that we can return to Space in a BIG WAY! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2019 And the most insane, yet also most predictable, part of all of it is that this sudden 180 degree shift in the United States’ position on The Moon seems to have been based on an offhand remark that Fox Business anchor Neil Cavuto made during a noon appearance on his show by NASA’s chief financial officer. Media Matters’ indefatigable Fox watcher Matthew Gertz has the details: When Trump starts tweeting about a weird thing for no apparent reason...Left, Fox Business, 12:26 p.m.Neil Cavuto: NASA is ""refocusing on the moon, the next sort of quest, if you will, but didn't we do this moon thing quite a few decades ago?""Right, Trump, 1:38 p.m. pic.twitter.com/oRTPu4TWEm — Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) June 7, 2019 I mean, for God’s sake. Still, as the headline above indicates, my favorite thing about this tweet is ultimately that the president, whose only area of expertise is reality TV real estate marketing, just told NASA that it should consider working on “science.” When does that trip to Mars leave again? Because I know a certain 60 percent of the U.S. adult population that might be interested in a seat."

Oprah Winfrey to interview Ava DuVernay and the Central Park Five.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/oprah-winfrey-ava-duvernay-central-park-five-when-they-see-us.html,"Dr. John Was an Inspiration to New Orleans, The Muppets , and Me When They See Us , Ava DuVernay’s new limited series on Netflix, follows the five boys of color who were falsely accused of a brutal rape in Central Park in 1989.

"Dr. John is dead: The piano genius was an inspiration to New Orleans, The Muppets, and me.",slate.com,Jack Hamilton,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/dr-john-dead-new-orleans-piano-player-muppets.html,"Taylor Swift’s “ME!” Is Filled With Rainbows, Kittens, and Unicorns. It’s a Trap. Among the many amazing things that can be said about the late Dr. John, who died Thursday, is that his real name, Malcolm John “Mac” Rebennack, was even cooler than his alias. Rebennack was one of the most wildly talented American instrumentalists of the rock ’n’ roll era and one of the most gifted musicians to ever emerge from the city of New Orleans, and he’d surely prefer we emphasize the latter. Dr. John was born on Nov. 20, 1941, a fact he himself may or may not have even been aware of until recently—in his 1994 memoir, the (literally and figuratively) incredible Under a Hoodoo Moon , he confidently stated that he was born in 1940. The second paragraph of that book opens by declaring that “My maternal grandfather, who sang and hoofed for a while for the Al G. Fields Minstrel Show operating out of Mobile, Alabama, was the one who passed the music on to me in a down way for the first time,” a statement equal parts exhilarating in its poetry ( passed the music on to me in a down way ) and bracing in its history. In 1994 many white musicians might have been inclined to downplay the fact that their grandfather had been a blackface performer, but Dr. John recognized the inerasable nature of this despicable but crucial chapter of America’s popular-musical past, as well as the importance of never denying that from which you came. It’s a sentence that, in just a few words, tells you almost everything you need to know about its author. His parents were both music fanatics, with voracious and thoroughly undiscriminating tastes, and by his own recollection, the young Mac Rebennack first began skipping school to hang out outside New Orleans juke joints around the age of 10. While he would become best known to the world as a piano player, Rebennack actually began his musical career as a guitarist, and a brilliant one at that. He first learned the instrument playing along to the records of Lightnin’ Hopkins and T-Bone Walker (classic beginners’ stuff!) before coming under the tutelage of Papoose Nelson, Fats Domino’s guitarist. After paying his dues as a sideman and session player, Rebennack released his first solo recording, the guitar-and-sax instrumental “Storm Warning,” in 1959. I’ve been playing piano for more than 30 years, and these videos make me want to quit. “Storm Warning” wasn’t much of a hit, but if it were the only record Mac Rebennack ever made, he would have still become a legend in the sorts of cultish circles that would have inevitably dug this thing up. It sounds like Link Wray’s “ Rumble ” and Bo Diddley’s “ Who Do You Love? ” thrown together in a gris-gris bag, a roaring, tremolo-laden tidal wave of rhythm. To my ears, there are five instruments on the recording: guitar, baritone sax, piano, bass, and drums, but there might just as easily be a hundred. (Reflecting on working with Phil Spector in the mid-1960s, Rebennack remarked that Spector could have gotten his famed “Wall of Sound” just as easily by recording with just six musicians from New Orleans .) A couple of years after “Storm Warning,” Rebennack was shot in the finger, seriously hampering his guitar-playing ability. In characteristically counterintuitive fashion, Rebennack decided to redirect his focus to the piano. In short order, he transformed himself into one of the premier exponents of a New Orleans piano tradition that included Jelly Roll Morton, Professor Longhair, and the incomparable James Booker, another prodigy who was less than two years older than Rebennack.

Rebennack first became Dr. John on the 1968 album Gris-Gris , an audacious mix of psychedelia and New Orleans R&B that’s probably the most ambitious and best album that he ever made. It’s an utterly original work that feels genuinely steeped in folk magic and shadow histories: a “soundtrack of colonial collisions,” as Charles Hughes put it in a terrific essay commemorating the album’s 50 th birthday last year . At a time when many rock artists were scaling increasingly grandiose and pretentious heights in search of the freakiest freakout, Gris-Gris was a roots record that managed to outfreak all of them. The album didn’t chart, but it quickly became an underground favorite. By the 1970s, Dr. John had become a star. He had a Top 10 hit in 1973 with “ Right Place, Wrong Time ,” recorded with the Meters and produced by Allen Toussaint. (The album it appeared on, In the Right Place , became the best-selling LP of his career.) His leisurely but sneakily precise singing voice could be heard regularly on radio and television. He played with the Rolling Stones, Neil Diamond, Carly Simon, Van Morrison, and pretty much any other A-lister he wanted to. In 1976 he submitted a characteristically graceful and understated star turn at the Band’s famous Last Waltz concert , performing his magnificent composition “Such a Night.” He even served as the inspiration for another budding rock legend, Dr. Teeth, lead singer and keyboardist of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, who first debuted on The Muppet Show in 1975. Through all of this, Mac Rebennack remained implacably himself, even while in the throes of a decadeslong heroin addiction that he wouldn’t kick until the late 1980s. Long after his unlikely rock stardom had faded, he remained a brilliant and tireless ambassador for his city and its musical tradition. In popular culture, he came to function more as a sort of broad and facile embodiment of “authentic” New Orleans than as a singular human being and artist: In the 21 st century, almost any casual music fan knows who Dr. John is, but far fewer could probably name more than one or two of his actual works. But if this was a position he ever resented, he never bore it with anything but wit and grace. In moments like these, it’s always worth taking a minute or two to appreciate the true craft behind the artist, and in Dr. John’s case, there’s an unusually direct opportunity to do so. A number of years back, Dr. John recorded a series of instructional videos called Dr. John Teaches New Orleans Piano that are both unintentionally hilarious and totally breathtaking. Dr. John begins each segment by amiably pontificating on some aspect of the New Orleans piano tradition before launching into utterly spectacular renditions of standards like “St. James Infirmary,” “Goodnight Irene,” and “Key to the Highway.” All the while there is a camera helpfully positioned directly above the keyboard so that you can, you know, follow along at home. I can’t think of a more effective way of convincing a budding pianist to quit the instrument than showing her these videos. I’ve been playing piano for more than 30 years, and these videos make me want to quit. But I also can’t think of a better way to send off Mac Rebennack than this video of him performing “When the Saints Go Marching In” from said video series. In classic New Orleans funeral fashion, he begins the song in a minor key, somberly drawing out the words and melody, his fingers splaying to impossible dimensions to reach chunking chords filled with lachrymose Sturm und Drang . Then, after finally returning to the top of the form, the Doctor abruptly pivots into the song’s more customary, upbeat, major-key rendition, and we’re treated to a little over two minutes of some of the most virtuosic piano playing you will ever witness with this degree of intimacy. His right hand is a dazzling showcase of trills, rolls, and runs, but as with any great sleight-of-hand artist, if you pay too much attention to it, then you’ll miss the real magic: his left hand, the true hallmark of any great New Orleans pianist. That left hand is all over the place , dancing across the entire lower registry of the instrument, perfectly in time and never making a false step. Watching those hands, startlingly up close and personal, is like witnessing a miracle. Mac Rebennack never claimed to be a saint in life, but today he’s in that number."

Why the California confession bill has Catholics up in arms.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/california-confession-bill-catholics-clergy-penitent-privilege.html,"Why Conservatives Are So Angry About Obama’s Reference to “Easter Worshippers” The capital of California was named for a river that was in turn named for the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist. So it’s notable that last month state senators in Sacramento passed a bill that some say will force Catholic priests to violate a different Catholic sacrament: confession, also known as the sacrament of reconciliation. Confession, as shown in a zillion pop cultural depictions, is a private conversation between a priest and an individual, meant to encourage Catholics to examine their consciences and request forgiveness from God. The format varies—for example, the two parties may sit face to face, or with an opaque screen between them—but the penitent is encouraged to offer a full inventory of her sins since her last visit. In return, the priest is bound by an ironclad oath of secrecy called the “seal of confession.” Historically, American law has protected that seal, carving out a “clergy-penitent privilege” for the confessional that is similar to attorney-client privilege. But a bill making its way through the California state Legislature would ever-so-slightly crack the seal open. SB 360, which passed the state Senate in May, would require priests to report suspicions of child abuse obtained through confession in some circumstances. The bill is expected to be voted on by the lower house of the state Legislature in September, according to Catholic News Service. And many Catholics are not happy about it. Clergy are already among the many professionals deemed mandated reporters for child abuse in California. But state law makes an exception for “penitential communications” obtained in settings where the cleric has a sacramental duty to maintain secrecy. As reporter Jack Jenkins recently pointed out , California’s pathbreaking 1990 law designating clergy as mandated reporters included a confessional carve-out that many other states added when they later adopted similar laws. Historically, American law has carved out a “clergy-penitent privilege” for the confessional that is similar to attorney-client privilege. The new bill might seem like a very modest burden. In fact, its current language is even narrower than earlier drafts: In the version that passed, a priest would be bound to report suspicions of abuse only if the confessor is a fellow priest or an employee of the same institution—almost all lay people would remain unaffected. But some Catholics remain alarmed by what they see as a state intrusion into a sacred ritual. The policy arm of the state’s conference of Catholic bishops called it “an attack on the sanctity of the confessional.” Robert Barron, a prominent bishop in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, called it “an egregious violation of the principle of religious liberty” and wrote that it “should alarm not only every Catholic in the country, but indeed the adepts of any religion.” And in an interview with the New Yorker’s Isaac Chotiner this week, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat listed the bill as an example of liberals in power “taking stances that are increasingly hostile to conservative Christian institutions.” These objections can be hard to understand, especially in the context of renewed awareness of the catastrophically widespread sexual abuse crisis within the Catholic Church. No one who objects to the bill would say they want to protect abusers. But it’s not just a human tradition, the argument goes; it’s a ritual instituted by God. And if priests are required to report suspicions of child abuse, then why not other serious crimes? Others raise practical concerns: What if a priest cannot identify the confessor because of the privacy screen between them? The California bill would represent a potentially life-altering decision for priests. The church’s own laws forbid priests from betraying a penitent’s confidentiality for any reason, with an automatic and immediate punishment of excommunication. (This means more than the loss of a job: It signifies expulsion from Christian community and a ban on receiving future sacraments.) Throughout church history, there are stories of priests choosing to be executed rather than betray the seal. Some priests say that if faced with the decision that could be forced on them by the California bill, they would defer to the church’s law. “Break the seal or go to jail? Absolutely, I would not break the seal of confession,” one Nebraska priest told Catholic News Service this week. “I would go to jail.” Because of the nature of the confessional, the only information about how it has actually been used by pedophiles is anecdotal. In 2003, an Australian priest said in an affidavit that he had confessed to 30 priests more than 1,000 times over many decades that he had molested children. (He pleaded guilty and served six years in prison.) But it’s not at all clear that such confessions are common. Priest Stephen Rossetti, a professor at the Catholic University of America who has written about priests’ psychology and wellness issues, told the National Catholic Register that in his 35 years as a priest, he has never heard anyone confess to abusing a minor, nor heard of anyone else who has. Rossetti opposes the California bill, calling it “a dangerous precedent.” But some Catholic thinkers say it is time to consider breaking the confessional seal. “Secrecy in the church is a major problem,” James Connell, a canon lawyer and a priest in the Milwaukee Archdiocese, told me. Connell sees a connection between Catholic resistance to the California bill and a broader culture of secrecy within the church. There’s “ the pontifical secret ,” a rule of confidentiality around a wide range of Vatican documents and communications. And then there’s the oath taken by new cardinals , who swear never to divulge any secrets that might dishonor the church. As critics see it, these are traditions that reflect cultural priorities of self-protection over transparency and truth. Those other traditions of secrecy are also being reexamined in some Catholic circles in response to the abuse crisis. In February, a professor of canon law delivered a keynote address at a Vatican summit on protecting minors in which she called for reforms to “pontifical secrecy.” She urged a revision that “allows the development of a climate of greater transparency and trust, avoiding the idea that the secret is to hide problems rather than to protect the assets at stake.” Connell argues that in these extraordinary circumstances, when the church has failed over and over again to protect children from harm, confession deserves to be reexamined, too. “We have a responsibility to try to prevent aggressors from harming people,” Connell said. “With this privilege [of not reporting child abusers who confess], we’re reversing that. We protect the culprit and endanger the child. This is the reverse of the catechism—and of common sense.”"

"Joe Biden: Hyde Amendment, mass incarceration, and plagiarism.",slate.com,Lili Loofbourow,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/joe-biden-hyde-amendment-plagiarism.html,"The Worst Smears and Falsehoods in William Barr’s CBS Interview Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner, has had a peculiar couple of weeks: The points on which he’s been historically weak—women’s rights, mass incarceration, and plagiarism—have surfaced again, as weak points are bound to do, but if his responses on all three fronts have muddied his record, they haven’t done much damage to his vaunted “electability.” He’s reiterated his support (before retracting it) of the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funds like Medicaid from paying for abortions. He’s defended his 1994 crime bill , which contributed (many believe) to America’s mass incarceration problem. Asked at a recent event whether he’d “commit to reducing the prison population by half,” Biden claimed that the woman asking—whom he addressed as “kiddo”—had been “conditioned” to say it was a bad bill. But “we should not be putting people in prison for drug offenses,” he added, omitting that he was one of the architects of the war on drugs and had specifically criticized then-President Bush’s plan because it didn’t “hold every drug user accountable.” Finally, his campaign was found to have plagiarized some policy language. Of the aforementioned items, the plagiarism might be both the least concerning and the most instructive. While Biden’s campaign seems to have copied some language from the BlueGreen Alliance and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, this, as Politico points out , is far from exceptional. Plenty of other campaigns have done much the same thing. The issue for Biden is that the incident hooks up with a reputation problem: an earlier instance of plagiarism that caused him to pull out of the 1988 presidential race. What remains concerning about that history is Biden’s tendency to enthusiastically claim life experiences that aren’t his own, whether because it’s politically advantageous or rhetorically exciting to do so. He didn’t just use hefty chunks from a published law review for a 15-page paper in law school. He didn’t just lift some phrases from Bobby Kennedy . In 1987, Biden started borrowing not just language but biographical details from U.K. Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock, citing nonexistent coal-mining ancestors and wondering aloud why he was the first in his family to go to college (he wasn’t). Biden also lied—repeatedly, and despite being repeatedly corrected—about marching for civil rights . He has (correctly!) said that he helped in other ways, but he did not march; that didn’t stop him from claiming he did and inviting people to “remember” those brave actions with him. Why would someone do this? One answer might help explain Biden’s appeal today. In certain environments, and contemporary politics has become one of them, lies and mistakes become love tests: If you mess up enough for long enough, while convincing people you’re on their side, plenty of folks will come to find your mistakes not just negligible but charming. They’re proof of your humanity. The plagiarism cost Biden in his 1988 run, back when he was still closer to his wunderkind origins (the lying about marching didn’t seem to hurt him, though). But neither the plagiarism nor his other statements seem likely to cost him much now. For one, it will take a lot to undo Biden’s decade-old recasting as a wacky, spontaneous, white-haired foil to Obama’s professionalism, youth, and polish. He became a principle of not just levity but messiness that people found personally appealing. For another, Trump is so boorish and dishonest that many voters struggle with what standards, if any, are even worth maintaining anymore. It disturbed people in 2007 when Biden described his then-rival Barack Obama as “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,” but the incumbent is a champion of birtherism. Voters don’t seem to have arrived at anything like a clear consensus on what compromises to make. It means Biden can give a sober statement about respecting the personal space of women and then turn it into a punchline at every campaign stop. It’s always a challenge figuring out which parts of a politician’s history are worth attending to when they’ve been around for as long as Biden has. His positions have evolved on a number of issues, and voters are inclined to credit candidates for apparent progress. Biden went from voting for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 to defending gay rights in 2012. He supported the invasion in Iraq, then called it a mistake. He initially (in 1973) said he believed Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided—and repeatedly (in 1977 and again in 1981) voted against allowing federal funds to pay for abortions for women in cases of rape or incest, bragging to supporters in 1994 that he’d done so “on no fewer than 50 occasions.” But far from leading the fight, his progress has been grudging and reluctant. Those hoping Biden’s present position on women’s rights would put more distance between Biden then and Biden now might be less disappointed than confused: Biden told an ACLU member in early May that he supported repealing the Hyde Amendment . Then his campaign said he’d “misheard.” Last Wednesday his campaign confirmed that in fact he still supported the Hyde Amendment. This Thursday, he said he no longer did . Any politician with a record as long as Biden’s has to tell this “evolution” story convincingly and well. Biden’s success on this score is spotty. His appeal despite that makes it interesting. In a weird way, his frankness about his self-contradictions—“I make no apologies for my last position. I make no apologies for what I’m about to say,” he said Thursday as he reversed himself on the Hyde Amendment—bestows upon him a kind of flexibility that allows him to claim (for example) that he won’t accept donations from corporate lobbyists , and then kick off his campaign with a fundraiser held at the home of the head of lobbying for Comcast . People support Biden for a lot of reasons (a desire to beat Trump counts). But a significant part of his success has been getting much of the public to see his flaws and lies as lovable, well-meaning, and proof of his honesty (which these days means something more like “authenticity”). This is prime political terrain very few figures manage to carve out. In the authoritative book about the 1988 campaign, What It Takes , for instance, Richard Ben Cramer gives a remarkably positive spin to Biden’s lies about marching for civil rights while his advisers (who had warned him to stop) look on. “Still, this was also the reason they were working for Biden,” he writes, “for the abandon with which he stretched himself (and not just by exaggeration) to touch a thousand lives a day … for the talent, extravagant effort, the generosity of spirit that made every event with Biden a festival of inclusion.” It is not “generosity of spirit” to lie about your past and your service and your bravery so a crowd will like you. Some might call that narcissistic and self-serving. I’d argue, then, that the generosity here lies more with the audience (Cramer included), who seems willing to interpret Biden’s stretching the truth as Biden stretching himself. To hear Cramer tell it, lying to make yourself look better is proof of graciousness and warmth toward those whose admiration you crave (and whose votes you need). A selfish act becomes a noble accommodation. But there’s no denying that this is the kind of generous reading Biden inspires. People really, truly like Biden. They believe he means well, however many times he messes up. They want to give him the benefit of the doubt— that’s just Joe! —and many think being a “gut politician” (as he calls himself) is the only real strategic counterweight to Trump. This is a real and impressive power. If the erratic and famously “electable” front-runner has one enduring advantage, it’s a long history of branding himself as undisciplined and constantly evolving (but not too quickly). The latter makes him hard to pin down. The former lowers expectations. The combo makes him more immune to scandal than most. (And it tantalizes his more progressive supporters with the hope that he might be “better” on whatever issue they care about than he used to be.) It also means, of course, that he can give a sober statement about respecting the personal space of women and then turn it into a punchline at every campaign stop. It’s also not just possible but proven that America holds powerful men with established patterns of misbehavior to lower standards. There is a certain kind of person who acclimates those around him to his defects (or tantrums, or improprieties). The extreme version of this is sometimes described with the “missing stair” theory—the idea being that there are people who present as clear and obvious a challenge as a missing stair in a house. Instead of fixing it, everyone adjusts. People step over it until the missing stair becomes less an obvious problem than something each individual feels responsibility to work around. After enough time, the people who object to the missing stair are the odd ones. This is just the way he is, and confronting it won’t do any good. When his Kennedy remarks were called out, Biden said they’d been typed for him. Questioned about what he meant by calling Obama “bright,” “clean,” and “articulate,” Biden said others knew perfectly well what he meant. Asked to apologize to Anita Hill, Biden passively regretted what had happened to her. In his younger days, once challenged on his academic history, he attacked his interlocutor by saying, “I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect.” Those tactics may sound familiar . Joe had an unfortunate week, but his “gaffes” are so firmly a part of his identity now that the absence of mistakes gets reported on in the New York Times . These errors aren’t likely to do him much harm—gaffes never do—and so Biden’s supporters are probably right: Given this skill set, he may indeed be the person best equipped to run against the man who has almost perfectly programmed his public to preemptively overlook lies and mistakes while arguing he deserves the most powerful position on earth.

"Gateway episodes: Schitt’s Creek’ “Happy Anniversary,” starring Catherine O’Hara, Eugene Levy.",slate.com,Marissa Martinelli,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/schitts-creek-best-episode-where-to-start-watching.html,"This British Show Was Like Friends , Except That It Was Much Better It’s official: Everyone is watching Schitt’s Creek except for you. OK, maybe not everyone , but you wouldn’t know that judging by the number of adoring think pieces about the show that have cropped up over the past few months. The Canadian sitcom isn’t exactly new—in fact, it recently wrapped up its fifth season—but like another good-hearted CBC comedy , it’s a sleeper hit that has benefited from its availability on Netflix in the U.S. (New episodes also air on Pop, the network formerly known as TV Guide Channel.) If you’re not already a devoted fan, you’ve probably at least come across clips of Catherine O’Hara laughing without moving her mouth or swoony gifs of Daniel Levy with a handsome beau and wondered what you’re missing. Created by real-life father-son team Eugene and Dan Levy, Schitt’s Creek has an Arrested Development –like premise: A wealthy family loses everything and takes refuge in their only remaining asset, in this case a run-down podunk town that they bought as a joke. Johnny Rose (Eugene Levy) is a video rental store magnate married to Moira (O’Hara), a former soap opera star possessed of a flair for the dramatic, an absurd Mid-Atlantic accent, and a menagerie of wigs. After being cheated by their business manager, they go from living in a mansion to a tiny motel room with their two adult children, misanthropic David (Dan Levy) and flighty Alexis (Annie Murphy), in tow. Most of the first season is comprised of exactly the kind of fish-out-of-water antics you’d expect from the premise as the Roses are distressed not only by their new lot in life but their run-ins with the town’s residents, including the mayor, Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott), and their close quarters. If you start watching Schitt’s Creek from the very beginning, you might find yourself wondering if you’re even watching the right show, the same one critics have since praised as “ sincere and uplifting ” and “ rooted in genuine emotion .” Much like its protagonists, Schitt’s Creek was once meaner, cruder, and cringe-ier than it is now. In Season 1, for instance, Roland punishes the Roses by removing the doors to their rooms, Moira and Johnny are caught in an awkward tryst by some townies, and David goes turkey hunting to prove himself to the motel’s sole employee, Stevie (Emily Hampshire). We’re meant to laugh at the out-of-touch, self-absorbed Roses for trying to navigate perfectly ordinary circumstances, or at the rinky-dink small-town attitudes of the locals, or both. That’s not a criticism of the first season, by the way. Many of these gags are genuinely funny, like the episode in which Johnny is guilted into delivering a eulogy for a resident he can’t even remember, and Levy teaches a masterclass in eye-bulging mortification. More importantly, those episodes create a baseline for what’s to come. Schitt’s Creek never fully loses its bite in the later seasons, but its characters have been allowed to grow into kinder, more loving people, and those early episodes are crucial to establishing that they were not always so kind or loving. This also means that if you want an accurate taste of the Schitt’s Creek everyone seems to adore, you’ll have to dive in much later, and there’s perhaps no episode that better exemplifies its extraordinary heart than the Season 2 finale, “Happy Anniversary.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. By the end of the second season, the Roses have more or less settled into their new lives, if reluctantly. Moira has just won a seat on the town council, David has experienced a windfall while working retail, and Alexis has ended not one but two relationships in town, an engagement to earnest veterinarian Ted (Dustin Milligan), for whom she now works as a receptionist, and a fling with taciturn townie Mutt (Tim Rozon). It’s Johnny who’s most adrift in Schitt’s Creek, trying to maintain his position as family patriarch while failing to come up with any new businesses after the demise of his old one. In “Happy Anniversary,” Johnny and Moira celebrate their marriage despite their less-than-extravagant circumstances, narrowly dodging a dinner invitation from Roland and his wife Jocelyn (Jennifer Robertson) by insisting that they’d rather dine alone as a couple. But at a restaurant in the nearby, marginally more glamorous Elmdale, the Roses run into two friends from their former life whom they haven’t seen since they went broke. And while they’re all reminiscing and keeping up appearances, Roland and Jocelyn also show up. So much of Schitt’s Creek is about the balance between who the Roses were and who they are, and here we see both of their lives, new and old, jostling elbows at the same table. Meanwhile in Schitt’s Creek, the rest of the characters are—conveniently!—at a party, where Alexis is dealing with the fallout from both her romantic entanglements with her usual combination of fluttering frivolity and genuine sweetness. (So powerful is her sometimes-thoughtless charm that there are multiple compilations of her just saying the word “David.”) Meanwhile, Stevie and David—once an item themselves—are competing for the attentions of a handsome local whose sexual preference has not yet been determined. Schitt’s Creek is remarkably and deliberately free of storylines about homophobia, making room instead to explore love in all its forms fully and without fear. That’s how “Happy Anniversary” ends, with all of Schitt’s Creek’s couples, siblings, parents, children, crushes, and friends in one location, dancing exuberantly to James Morrison’s “Precious Love”—with only a little bit of eye-rolling from David. This is a show about love, and I hope you love it. In fact, I’m a little bit jealous that you get to experience it for the first time. "
Ada Hegerberg: Why the world's best female soccer player won't be in the World Cup.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/ada-hegerberg-world-cup-norway-protest-why.html,"How to Watch the Women’s World Cup Online if You Don’t Have Cable Ada Hegerberg is the best female soccer player in the world. The 23-year-old Norwegian striker has, during her five seasons with the dominant French club Olympique Lyonnais , scored 130 goals in 105 games. Among other accomplishments, her team has won the past four Champions League titles. In the most recent one, she scored three goals in the first 30 minutes of the final. But she is not playing in this year’s World Cup. Why? She’s protesting—but the details of her protest are still partly unknown. Two years ago, Hegerberg informed the Norwegian soccer federation that she did not plan to play for the national team until she saw some kind of proof of progress toward greater support for the women’s program. She has kept to that promise, and Norway will kick off against Nigeria on Saturday without the country’s star player. Hegerberg has been willing to go on record about some of her frustrations, but she has remained evasive about the details (“When the media asked me what I told the federation, I said, ‘That’s between me and them so they can work on it,’ ” she told ESPN ). The conflict began in 2017, after Norway lost three straight games during the UEFA European Women’s Championship and was eliminated in the group stage. Hegerberg quickly voiced her frustrations with the team’s management, which she blamed in part for their poor performance. (The Norwegian federation in turn criticized Hegerberg for what they called a poor attitude.) Hegerberg rejected what she saw as the Norwegian federation’s attack on her character. “I’ve never been trying to control the starting 11, or something internal to the group,” she told CNN Sport . “This is a feeling that’s based on my whole experience with the national team. It’s not even up to me anymore. I’ve moved on in my career and my life.” She told Aftenposten that the women’s national team was treated as inferior to the men’s when it came to pay, working conditions, investment at the youth and club levels, and team culture, even though the women’s team has historically been more successful than the men’s. She said that, combined with a general lack of ambition from the other players, her time playing with the national team left her feeling like a worse player. “It’s constantly said that we should be pushing our potential, but it’s not happening in practice,” she told the Norwegian paper. She told CNN: “There are federations, there are clubs, there are men in high positions who have that responsibility to put the women in the right place and that’s where I think, I feel, and I know, we have a long way to go.” She has maintained that it’s not about money but more an issue of respect and opportunity for women at the top levels of the sport. She lauded her club team, which she said treated men and women equally: using the same quality fields, dining together, being respected and held to the same high standards. She also expressed, vaguely, the idea that she and the national team were not performing to their full potential in part because of the management style that did not allow Hegerberg the creativity or leadership opportunities that she deserved and needed. As she told ESPN:
I was trying to make an impact [on Norway] for a lot of years, and I could see that in this system, in the federation, it didn’t fit me at all. I feel like I was placed in a system where I didn’t have a voice. I felt this weight on my shoulders more and more: This isn’t working. … For me at that point, being able not to lose myself and not to lose what I believe in, I had to take that choice. I couldn’t go any other way. And as soon as I did it, it was like [exhales], I could be myself again. I could perform on the highest level again. She also told reporters that the Norwegian soccer federation officials didn’t take her protest “in the way they should have,” as she wanted them to work on several specific issues. “It can’t be easy when a woman stands and tries to be critical in a positive way,” she said. “Ever since, I just put that behind me and try to perform at the highest level with Lyon.” But she said she knew she would be facing a fight when she made the decision. According to ESPN, she said:
Even though sometimes I would be like, [sighs], ‘Am I really going to take on that fight?’ I would always think, ‘but what will it bring for the future, for others?’ … It’s impossible to play football in a world among men and not fight for equality. We’re all feminists. Playing football can be damn harsh, but every day is a fight for equality. That’s a fact. We’ve made it here [in Lyon] because you’ve got one man at the top believing in us. But it’s still a long, long way to go, and you can see it in small examples every day. Since she made that decision, Norway has made progress that has pleased some critics and soccer fans. According to the Wall Street Journal , in 2017, the Norwegian federation committed to paying both of its national teams equally, in what is thought to be the first deal of its kind in international soccer. (In March, for comparison, the U.S. Women’s National Team announced that all 28 members of its team had filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation over inferior wages, support, and working conditions compared with the men’s team.) Last summer, the Norwegian federation also appointed a woman as the director of the national programs. That woman, attorney and former player Lise Klaveness, said the federation would spend more money on the women’s team than the men’s this year. “Which for me is a given, because we’re going to the World Cup with the women, but I guess in many federations that’s just utopia,” she told the Journal. But Hegerberg apparently remains unconvinced that these changes resolve the deeper-rooted problems she saw in the team. It’s hard to know how her stand has—or will—affect the national team. But we do know that she has already shed light on sexism in the business. She was once asked by a journalist if she considered herself a soccer player or a feminist, as if the two were mutually exclusive. She has pushed back on the idea. When she received the 2018 women’s Ballon d’Or—she was the inaugural winner of what is now soccer’s highest prize for an individual female player (the Ballon d’Or for men was introduced in the 1950s)—a French musician who helped MC the ceremony asked her if she would twerk on stage. She gave a firm no. Hegerberg is in a uniquely strong position to take a stand on the issues. She is undeniable as a world star, even without appearing at the World Cup, because of her career on her club team. Unlike in the U.S., where club soccer is far less prestigious and profitable than the national team, Hegerberg’s club team pays her more than the Norwegian national team can—she is, according to SB Nation , the highest paid female club player in the world. As James Dator of SB Nation noted, for other Norwegian players, and for many other players across the world, taking such a stand could be a career-killer. For Hegerberg, it’s not. It’s remarkable that this story has not been more dominant in the news cycle. In June, when the Norwegian federation confirmed Hegerberg would be sitting out, search inquiries for Cristiano Ronaldo (arguably Hegerberg’s equivalent as the best male soccer player) still outstripped those for Hegerberg by a factor of 60 to 1. Her story has gained traction in recent days as the World Cup approached, but Ronaldo’s name still has been searched about four times as often. International women’s soccer has been making strides, led by the women themselves . But try to imagine for a second the questions, the public outcry, the wall-to-wall news coverage if Ronaldo had decided to skip the 2018 World Cup in protest."

He died nine days later, after having drank an unboiled glass of water during a cholera epidemic. Deep into the symphony, Symphony No. 6, there is a paradoxical passage that, when played, no one will be able to hear. This is because Tchaikovsky scored it to contain a musical illusion. We uncover the mystery of why he put it there. Sound illusions reveal some of the most puzzling features of the human mind, most notably its insistence that it knows reality better than reality itself. On this episode, we listen to some of the most curious auditory illusions to find out how some of the features of sounds are generated by the human mind, rather than features of the external world. The illusions reveal something deep about some of the most treasured human endeavors, including music and language. Guest voices include Diana Deutsch, Casey O’Callaghan, and Christine Howlett.

"Trump calls off tariff threats after Mexico agrees to tighten borders, expand asylum program.",slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-calls-off-tariff-threats-mexico-border-asylum-deal.html,"Alabama Mayor Suggests “Killing” LGBTQ People Is “Only Way” to Fix Society’s Problems President Donald Trump pulled back from a threat of imposing tariffs that even many in his own party warned would damage the economy when he said a deal had been sealed with Mexico on immigration. Trump celebrated the deal on Twitter Friday night saying he wouldn’t impose a 5 percent tariff on Mexican goods, which he had threatened could increase to 25 percent over time, after its southern neighbor agreed to take certain measures on immigration. Trump tweeted in all-caps Saturday morning that Mexico had also agreed to buy “large quantities” of Agricultural products from the United States, although nothing about that was mentioned in the joint declaration released by the two countries. “I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico,” the president tweeted Friday night . “The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2019 After three days of talks in Washington, Mexico agreed to take more migrants seeking asylum in the United States while they wait for their cases to be decided. “The United States will immediately expand the implementation of the existing Migrant Protection Protocols across its entire Southern Border,” the two countries said in a joint statement . “This means that those crossing the U.S. Southern Border to seek asylum will be rapidly returned to Mexico where they may await the adjudication of their asylum claims.” Mexico also agreed to deploy National Guard troops throughout the country to curb illegal immigration, with a focus on strengthening its southern border. Mexico did successfully push back on a U.S. demand to be designated as a “safe third country” that would have forced it to take in most asylum seekers from Central America. “I think it’s a fair balance because they had more drastic measures and proposals at the start and we reached some middle point,” Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said. Analysts warned though that while Mexico was able to push back potentially disastrous tariffs, it will come at a big cost. “Mexico successfully avoided the catastrophe of tariffs but will pay a heavy price,” said Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington . “Potentially tens of thousands of refugee claimants will have to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. Mexico will have to house, employ, educate and provide health care for them. This is a huge commitment.” Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2019 Trump continued patting himself on the back for the agreement on Saturday morning. “Mexico will try very hard,” he wrote on Twitter , “and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!” The president later kept on celebrating : “Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico! Sen. Chuck Schumer sarcastically responded to the president’s announcement, calling it a “ historic night .” Trump “has announced that he has cut a deal to ‘greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States,’” Schumer wrote. “Now that that problem is solved, I’m sure we won’t be hearing any more about it in the future.” This is an historic night! @realDonaldTrump has announced that he has cut a deal to “greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.”Now that that problem is solved, I’m sure we won’t be hearing any more about it in the future. https://t.co/DNNfbevkGP — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 8, 2019 Support our journalism

2019 Women's World Cup: Germany squeaks out win in incredibly brutal game against China.,slate.com,Eric Betts,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/germany-china-2019-womens-world-cup-brutal.html,"How to Watch the Women’s World Cup Online if You Don’t Have Cable Perhaps the most surprising thing about Germany’s 1-0 win over China at the Women’s World Cup on Saturday was that the game finished with only 26 fouls. France and South Korea on Friday had 22 total, split evenly between the two teams. But those fouls were largely insignificant, the polite and expected collateral damage of a one-sided game, where one team is lunging desperately to halt a superior attack and the other has so much control that the easiest way to prevent counterattack chances is sometimes just to knock down the person running with the ball. China-Germany was not one of those games. It was ruthless, full of high boots and heavy tackles and wincing spectators (at least on one couch that I know of). The play led to some unconventional rooting interests by game’s conclusion: at this point at least half my emotional energy is just hoping no one has their leg broken in the last few minutes here — Michael Caley (@MC_of_A) June 8, 2019 China committed 19 fouls and received four yellow cards, and that was more or less by design. The game’s shape arose from the team’s clear plan to destroy Germany’s rhythms and harass, annoy and, failing that, just knock over German players any time their offense began to look dangerous. China hoped to keep the Germans discombobulated enough to steal a goal for itself. And the strategy nearly worked. The German center backs looking unprepared at moments, including this best series of Chinese chances right before halftime. SO CLOSE!! 😱China expose the German back line yet again but Yang Li's shot hits the post! #FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/zYFvBJIL1o — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 8, 2019 Germany began to respond in kind and was probably fortunate to get away with only seven fouls and one yellow card. At least one Oscar winner thought so: That’s gotta be a card bruh. This ref is showing some legit bias here, if a Chinese player had done that it would have been a card. And the announcers ain’t no better — Barry Jenkins (@BarryJenkins) June 8, 2019 Germany missed on a couple of chances early, but spent much of the game looking far less fluid and dangerous than you would expect from the world’s No. 2 team. The Germans finally put away the game on just about their only chance where China failed to get a body on or in front of the ball. Giulia Gwinn’s shot in the 66th minute scooted just under the raised leg of China’s Yang Li and into the far side of the net. BOOM! 🚀Giulia Gwinn fires Germany into the lead with a sweet hit from outside the box. #FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/up4b1yMBgz — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 8, 2019 Time will probably sand off the rough edges, and the fouls will be remembered as numbers on the stat sheet and not cleats to the leg or rugby tackles. People will recall Germany’s narrow win, and not necessarily how close China’s gambit came to working. Twenty-six fouls. That’s a lot, but is it too many? Support our journalism

“Straight pride” parade: Milo Yiannopoulos will be the marshal.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/straight-pride-parade-milo-yiannopoulos-marshal.html,"George Conway to Trump: “You Would Have Been Fired From Any Other Job by Now” A gay man will be leading Boston’s “straight pride” parade. Super Happy Fun America, which is organizing the parade to “advocate on behalf of the straight community,” announced that Milo Yiannopoulos would be the grand marshal after Brad Pitt made it known he was none too pleased they were using his image to advertise the event. Pitt “made it clear” to the organizers that they had to stop using his name and likeness, according to the Hollywood Reporter . John Hugo, president of Super Happy Fun America, told the Boston Herald that Pitt “was not super happy” that his image was being used. The group complied and by Friday morning had replaced Pitt’s pictures and mentions with “redacted” and “censored” signs. It then announced Yiannopoulos, whom the group described as “the most censored and most lied-about man in the world,” would be the “ mascot and Grand Marshall of the parade .” Hugo acknowledged the choice may be a little strange: “I know it’s a little ironic to have a gay conservative as our icon.” Yiannopoulos explained why he is taking part in the event. “I might technically be a sequined and perfectly coiffed friend of Dorothy’s, but I’ve spent my entire career advocating for the rights of America’s most brutally repressed identity—straight people—so I know a thing or two about discrimination,” Yiannopoulos said. “This parade is a gift to anyone, male or female, black or white—gay and transgender allies, too!—who will stand with us and celebrate the wonder and the majesty of God’s own heterosexuality.” The group still doesn’t have a permit for the event, but Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has implied the group could get one if it fulfills the requirement, even if it would not reflect Boston’s values. “This ‘Straight Pride Parade’ doesn’t yet have a permit, but is working to amend their application for permits to host a public event,” Walsh tweeted Thursday . “Whatever outside groups may try do, our values won’t change. I invite each and every person to stand with us, and show that love will always prevail.” This ""Straight Pride Parade"" doesn't yet have a permit, but is working to amend their application for permits to host a public event."
Kawhi Leonard's message to Canada will inspire you.,slate.com,Nick Greene,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/kawhi-leonards-message-to-canada-will-inspire-you.html,"The Best Player in the Women’s World Cup Might Be Heading Home Early For 23 years of their 24-year existence, the Toronto Raptors rarely gave their fans much to celebrate. Torontonians nevertheless flocked to “Jurassic Park,” the team’s outdoor viewing area, and repeatedly braved nippy Ontario springs to watch their beloved dinos fall short in the playoffs. This season is far different, however, and it is all thanks to Kawhi Leonard. The star forward led his team to a comprehensive 105-92 win over the Golden State Warriors on Friday, and the Raptors are now just one victory away from an NBA title. Toronto traded for Leonard last summer knowing full well that it could be a one-season rental, but it has already proved to be one of the shrewdest moves in recent NBA history. Even if they blow a 3-1 lead (has that ever happened in the Finals before?

Five teenage boys arrested for attack on lesbian couple in London bus.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/five-teenage-boys-arrested-attack-lesbian-couple-london-bus.html,"Alabama Mayor Suggests “Killing” LGBTQ People Is “Only Way” to Fix Society’s Problems Five boys aged between 15 and 18 have been arrested over an attack on a lesbian couple in a London bus this week. Police in London said Saturday a 16-year-old boy who was detained in connection to the attack was the fifth person to be arrested over the attack. The four others who have been detained were between the ages of 15 and 18 , the police said. Melania Geymonat, a 28-year-old doctor from Uruguay who works as a Ryanair flight attendant and Chris, her 29-year-old American girlfriend, recounted the attack earlier in the week , saying it happened when the two refused to kiss one another in front of a group of young men who were harassing them. The women said they were riding the night bus early on May 30 when the group of men started harassing them. “They surrounded us and started saying really aggressive stuff, things about sexual positions, lesbians and claiming we could kiss so they could watch us,” Geymonat said, adding that she tried to decompress the situation by making some jokes but that didn’t help. The teenagers then began throwing coins at them. “The next thing I know Chris is in the middle of the bus and they are punching her,” she added. “So I immediately went there by impulse and tried to pull her out of there and they started punching me. I was really bleeding.” “They started beating me, I was bleeding all over – I was really bleeding”Melania Geymonat tells @BBCMarkMardell on #BBCwato about how she and her girlfriend were attacked after a group of men demanded they kiss. pic.twitter.com/E3kRVLxQtA — The World at One (@BBCWorldatOne) June 7, 2019 A photo that has since gone viral shows the two women covered in blood. Police said they were taken to the hospital for treatment of facial injuries but have since been released. “I was and still am angry. It was scary, but this is not a novel situation,” Chris said. In a Facebook post , Geymonat wrote that what upset her the most “is that VIOLENCE HAS BECOME A COMMON THING, that sometimes it’s necessary to see a woman bleeding after having been punched to feel some kind of impact.” She added: “I’m tired of being taken as a SEXUAL OBJECT, of finding out that these situations are usual, of gay friends who were beaten up JUST BECAUSE. We have to endure verbal harassment AND CHAUVINIST, MISOGYNISTIC AND HOMOPHOBIC VIOLENCE because when you stand up for yourself shit like this happens.” “This was a disgusting attack on two women who appear to have been picked out and targeted by a group of youths,” Detective Superintendent Andy Cox said in a statement. “The suspects have made a number of homophobic comments towards the couple before throwing coins at them. When the women tried to reason with the group, the attack escalated to an assault.” Although London is widely seen as a gay friendly city, attacks on the LGBT community have almost doubled between 2014 and 2018. “With one of the biggest celebrations due to take place in the capital in just under a month, this is a sobering reality check of why Pride is still needed in 2019,” writes Ben Hunte, the BBC’s LGBT correspondent .

NYT: Mexico had already agreed to border measures Trump said were taken to avert tariffs.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/nyt-mexico-already-agreed-border-measures-tariffs.html,"Alabama Mayor Suggests “Killing” LGBTQ People Is “Only Way” to Fix Society’s Problems President Donald Trump spent much of Saturday celebrating the deal his administration sealed with Mexico mere days before threatened tariffs were set to take effect. But, in truth, the agreement consists of a series of measures that Mexico had agreed to months earlier, the New York Times reports , citing officials on both sides of the border. The centerpiece of the agreement involves a measure that effectively expands a program that allows those seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. The program was already in place at three of the busiest border crossings, but the Times notes Mexico had already agreed to expand the program to the entire border. The joint declaration by the two countries issued Friday also highlights that Mexico had agreed to deploy National Guard troops throughout the country, and especially along its southern border, to stop the flow of migrants. But the Mexican government had already agreed to do that in March. Mexico managed to push back on a demand—which would have truly marked a change—that involved a designation of a “safe third country,” meaning the United States could reject asylum-seekers if they had not sought refuge in Mexico first. Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2019 To be fair, the deal could effectively accelerate the implementation of the previous promises, considering U.S. officials were getting a bit impatient with Mexico. But in that case it was just an expansion of things that had already been agreed to by both countries. And that makes sense when you consider that negotiations really didn’t start until last Sunday. Despite all of this, Trump celebrated the deal on Saturday as groundbreaking. “Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico!” Trump wrote on Twitter . In another tweet, Trump thanked the president and foreign minister of Mexico “for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed!” I would like to thank the President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, together with all of the many representatives of both the United States and Mexico, for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2019 “It was unclear whether Mr. Trump believed that the agreement truly represented new and broader concessions, or whether the president understood the limits of the deal but accepted it as a face-saving way to escape from the political and economic consequences of imposing tariffs on Mexico,” notes the Times. Even as Trump said that everyone was “excited” about the deal, Democratic leaders made sure they made their dissent known. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the president’s tactics to get to an agreement. “Threats and temper tantrums are no way to negotiate foreign policy,” Pelosi said in a statement . She also expressed disappointment that the Trump administration is expanding “its failed Remain-in-Mexico policy, which violates the rights of asylum seekers under U.S. law and fails to address the root causes of Central American migration.” Trump also fired a shot at Pelosi Saturday, calling her “nervous” and saying that Democrats aren’t doing anything and should take up the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. “Nervous Nancy Pelosi & the Democrat House are getting nothing done. Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA, the spectacular & very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA, the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers, Manufacturers & Unions!” Trump tweeted . Earlier, Sen. Chuck Schumer sarcastically responded to the president’s announcement, calling it a “ historic night .” Trump “has announced that he has cut a deal to ‘greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States,’” Schumer wrote. “Now that that problem is solved, I’m sure we won’t be hearing any more about it in the future.” This is an historic night! @realDonaldTrump has announced that he has cut a deal to “greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.”Now that that problem is solved, I’m sure we won’t be hearing any more about it in the future. https://t.co/DNNfbevkGP"
The Good Place ending: Michael Schur announces that the fourth season of the Ted Danson / Kristen Bell sitcom will be its last.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/good-place-ending-four-seasons-michael-schur-kristen-bell-jameela-jamil-ted-danson.html,"Is this the Bad Place? NBC The Good Place , NBC’s upbeat, genial riff on No Exit , will soon be exploring the mysteries of the sitcom afterlife: The show’s upcoming fourth season will be its last. Showrunner Michael Schur, who made the decision to end The Good Place on his own terms, announced the news in a statement on the show’s Twitter account: Dear Residents of #TheGoodPlace Neighborhood 12358W... pic.twitter.com/UVsm5x704p — The Good Place (@nbcthegoodplace) June 8, 2019 Castmember Jameela Jamil confirmed the news on Twitter, calling Schur “the classiest motherforkingshirtball ever”: YOU HEARD CORRECT, This next season is the FINAL season of @nbcthegoodplace because Mike Schur is the classiest motherforkingshirtball ever and wanted to leave you at the right time in the right way. We love you and we hope you love our goodbye. ❤️ #teamcockroach4ever pic.twitter.com/nlIWpFpSd4 — Jameela Jamil 🌈 (@jameelajamil) June 8, 2019 It’s always controversial when a television showrunner makes the decision to euthanize a seemingly healthy television show, but it isn’t always unethical, as a simple thought experiment makes clear. Imagine lavish box sets of the hypothetical fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons of The Good Place were tied to a trolley siding, arranged in such a way that they were unlikely to survive an encounter with the trolley. On the main track, someone has arranged equally lavish box sets of the hypothetical first, second, and third season of a different show Schur would make in the time it would take to produce three more seasons of The Good Place , plus lavish box sets of the first, first, and first seasons of the three one-season shows NBC will air in the slot that would normally be occupied by The Good Place in the network’s 2020, 2021, and 2022 primetime schedules ( Supertrain 2020, America in Crisis , and The Great Patriot Farmers’ Mandatory Sketch Comedy Revue ). The trolley has no brakes and is barreling down the main line at an unsafe speed. Worse still, someone has spray-painted the words “CLIMATE CHANGE” on its side. So far, it’s just your basic allegorical trolley disaster: Fun to think about, but not very useful when it comes to making network television programming decisions. But now imagine Michael Shur is standing next to a switch that would send the trolley off the main line and onto the siding. From a utilitarian perspective, it’s clear that Schur should throw the switch, saving four television shows at the regrettable-but-unavoidable cost of three future seasons of The Good Place , plus whatever collateral damage ends up being caused by the shards of smashed Good Place Blu-ray discs sent flying through the air like a thousand knives, right into a crowd of gifted schoolchildren who had hoped to take that very trolley to the Museum of How to Someday Cure Cancer Assuming You Aren’t Cut to Ribbons by Shrapnelized Blu-Ray Discs Before You Even Go to College. Seen from this perspective, it’s clear that the end of The Good Place is just another reminder of the television industry’s deep and longstanding commitment to ethical behavior. Here is Schur’s complete statement on the end of The Good Place :
“After ‘The Good Place’ was picked up for season two, the writing staff and I began to map out, as best we could, the trajectory of the show. Given the ideas we wanted to explore, and the pace at which we wanted to present those ideas, I began to feel like four seasons—just over 50 episodes—was the right lifespan. At times over the past few years we’ve been tempted to go beyond four seasons, but mostly because making this show is a rare, creatively fulfilling joy, and at the end of the day, we don’t want to tread water just because the water is so warm and pleasant. As such, the upcoming fourth season will be our last.
“I will be forever grateful to NBC and Universal TV for letting us make ‘The Good Place,’ and for letting us end it on our own schedule. I will also be forever grateful to the creative team, both on-screen and off, for their hard work and dedication to a very weird idea. We ask the question very frequently, on this show, what do we owe to each other? The answer, for me, is: I owe all of you a whole lot.
“We look forward to a great final season airing this fall.

White House reportedly blocked written testimony of official on climate change.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/white-house-blocked-written-testimony-rod-schoonover-climate-change.html,"George Conway to Trump: “You Would Have Been Fired From Any Other Job by Now” The White House blocked a senior intelligence analyst at the State Department from issuing written testimony on climate science to a congressional committee. The testimony, which warned human-caused climate change is “possibly catastrophic” became the subject of controversy after officials from the State Department refused to delete references to scientific findings regarding climate change. The White House’s Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council all raised objections to parts of the testimony, saying the citing of climate science did not match the administration’s official stance on climate change, according to the Washington Post . Rod Schoonover, who works in the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues, was ultimately allowed to give his testimony before a House Intelligence Committee hearing but he was barred from submitting written testimony. Even his oral testimony was in doubt for a while though, according to the New York Times , which reviewed internal emails demonstrating just how opposed officials were to him presenting scientific findings. “The testimony still has serious concerns with internal components and focuses heavily on the science,” Daniel Q. Greenwood, deputy assistant to the president in the White House office of legislative affairs, wrote in an email. “Because it doesn’t reflect the coordinated IC position, or the administration’s position, there is no way this can be cleared ahead of the hearing,” he wrote, using IC to refer to the intelligence community. Experts said that while reviewing testimony is common, this effort to delete significant portions of the document seemed to be a bit extreme. “I have never heard of basic facts being deleted from or blocked from testimony,” Norman J. Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said. That is particularly the case considering that members of the administration were objecting to citations of work conducted by federal agencies, including NASA. The National Security Council objected to almost every page of Schoonover’s prepared testimony, claiming it contained “lots of climate alarm propaganda.” The White House Office of Legislative Affairs proposed cutting five pages of the scientific foundations for the rest of the testimony. Among the controversial statements? Factual claims such as, “The Earth’s climate is unequivocally undergoing a long-term warming trend as established by decades of scientific measurements from multiple, independent lines of evidence.” Earlier this week, President Donald Trump said that he believed climate change “goes both ways,” noting he didn’t regret his decision to pull out of the Paris accord. “Don’t forget, it used to be called global warming, that wasn’t working, then it was called climate change, now it’s actually called extreme weather because with extreme weather you can’t miss,” the president said . Does the US President believe in climate change?Trump says he discussed climate change with Prince Charles, who he believes is 'a very good person' who 'wants to have a world that's good for future generations'. pic.twitter.com/QNlXhiS1mO — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) June 5, 2019 Support our journalism

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order gameplay: EA debuts their workplace safety polemic at E3.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-gameplay-e3-ea-forest-whitaker.html,"Shake hands with danger. EA E3 officially begins on Monday, but developers have already started unveiling the games of tomorrow at the auxiliary events that accompany the annual electronic entertainment tradeshow. Electronic Arts held their EA Play event Saturday, debuting a new character for Apex Legends , showing off an upcoming sequel to Madden NFL 19 (tentatively titled Madden NFL 20 ), and introducing a new Sims 4 expansion that allows players to (finally!) spruce up their virtual neighborhood by adding an active volcano. But the biggest news was a gameplay video from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order , a highly-anticipated Star Wars adventure from Respawn Entertainment coming in November. It’s a return to the single-player gameplay and questionable colon placement that powered classics like Star Wars: Dark Forces, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II , and Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast . The first trailer suggested something high on intrigue and low on edutainment, but as the gameplay video reveals, the full game is a deep dive into shockingly dangerous industrial safety practices throughout the Empire’s manufacturing sector. The level on display, a Chernobyl -like tick-tock of the disaster at the Wroshyr tree sap refinery on Kashyyk, is nearly enough to make you give up on the Wroshyr tree sap industry entirely: It’s a fool’s game trying to count all the safety violations on display at the Kashyyk refinery, despite one worker’s sardonic promise to “do this by the book,” but it’s clear that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order will not follow the lead of the Imperial government and cynically try to blame the refinery workers for what happened. Neither will it completely absolve them: We see a stormtrooper decide not to call in an accident out of a misguided faith in protocol, a group of workers trying to fend off flame beetles with flamethrowers (!), and management’s stubborn refusal to accept that the presence of Wyyyschokks on the refinery floor means that the outer walls have been breached. All of those decisions made the facility uniquely vulnerable to a terrorist attack from Saw Gerrera and his cronies. But the workers and droids responsible paid a terrible price for their carelessness—each lightsaber-disemboweling is lovingly documented to the point that it feels a little exploitative—and although it’s easy to say you wouldn’t have spent the Kasshyyk Wroshyr tree sap refinery disaster running around in circles yelling things like “Suffer, Jedi!” and “I will make you hurt!” the gameplay video makes it clear there were no good options. Most of the blame, then, must go to the systemic flaws in the Imperial industrial system that allowed a facility like the Wroshyr tree sap refinery on Kasshyyk to exist in the first place, and on this topic, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is an essential corrective to the popular conception of the disaster. It’s one thing to read about the stupidity of Imperial industrial design, and another to wander around a fully-realized game world in which tree sap mixing vats are installed without ventilation hoods, safety tests on the remote cutoff switches for Wroshyr harvester blades are routinely skipped, and goggles and eyewash stations are nowhere to be found. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is shaping up to be the greatest workplace safety polemic since Shake Hands With Danger , and should spark long-overdue reforms in the Wroshyr tree sap refinery industry. The Star Wars video game, industry, on the other hand, looks healthier than ever. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Ghostbusters 3: Sigourney Weaver will return in Jason Reitman’s sequel.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/ghostbusters-3-sigourney-weaver-dana-barrett-jason-reitman.html,"Ceci n’est pas une Dana. Columbia When Jason Reitman announced that he was making a new Ghostbusters film “for all the other fans” of the franchise back in January, the Ghostbusters fan community rejoiced. They had just suffered the shock of having their childhoods ruined by Paul Feig’s 2016 female-led reboot , so Reitman’s promise to “ hand the movie back to the fans ” was taken as an implicit guarantee that nothing in the new Ghostbusters movie would offend the people who got histrionic about the prospect of a Ghostbusters movie starring women. On Saturday, however, the other shoe dropped: Reitman has cast a woman in his movie. Buried deep in a Parade profile of Alien star Sigourney Weaver was the following news:
[Weaver is] also set to reunite with Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd in the new Ghostbusters , due July 2020. “It’s going to be crazy working with the guys again!” she says. She won’t reveal any details except to confirm she’s reprising her role as hauntee Dana Barrett. It’s possible, of course, that fans will give Sigourney Weaver a pass they wouldn’t give to Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones, on the grounds that Weaver was in the original Ghostbusters . But there’s a fine line between “handing the movie back to the fans” and “handing the movie back to the fans except this time Sigourney Weaver gets to do more than just be in peril until an all-male Ghostbusters squad rescues her.” Either way, one thing is becoming clear: This movie is going to generate some hilarious Reddit posts.

"Trump slams MSNBC’s Donny Deutsch, admits attacks on press are not “presidential.”",slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-slams-msnbc-donny-deutsch-attacks-press-presidential.html,"George Conway to Trump: “You Would Have Been Fired From Any Other Job by Now” President Donald Trump spent Saturday night criticizing “Little Donny Deutsch” in a series of tweets in which he acknowledged that it isn’t “presidential” to criticize the media. Despite that little bit of reflection, Trump’s criticism of the media doesn’t end with him calling Deutsch “a total loser.” Trump was still thinking about the media Sunday morning and he went on to criticize the New York Times and CNN. “Little @DonnyDeutsch, whose show, like his previous shoebiz tries, is a disaster, has been saying that I had been a friend of his. This is false,” Trump said . The president also said that Deutsch and CNN’s Erin Burnett used to “BEG” him to be put in episodes of the Apprentice. Trump also insisted that he “hardly knew him” but he still knows that Deutsch “is a total loser” who makes up lies about the commander in chief : “He knows nothing!” Little @DonnyDeutsch , whose show, like his previous shoebiz tries, is a disaster, has been saying that I had been a friend of his.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2019 Although Trump never actually says what is it that made him go on this rant against Deutsch, it does come a few days after he called the president a “ despicable human being ” for his criticism of political opponents before the D-Day anniversary commemorations. Shortly after his late-night tweets against Deutsch, Trump had a moment of reflection. “I know it is not at all ‘Presidential’ to hit back at the Corrupt Media, or people who work for the Corrupt Media, when they make false statements about me or the Trump Administration,” he said . “Problem is, if you don’t hit back, people believe the Fake News is true.” Earlier on Saturday, before Trump got personal with Deutsch, he sent out a more generic tweet criticizing MSNBC in general. “Watched MSNBC this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week. Such lies, almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth,” he said . “Fake News! No wonder their ratings, along with CNN, are WAY DOWN. The hatred Comcast has is amazing!” Watched MSNBC this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week. Such lies, almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth. Fake News! No wonder their ratings, along with CNN, are WAY DOWN. The hatred Comcast has is amazing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2019 Then on Sunday morning, Trump attacked the New York Times for “another false report,” in reference to a piece that said the measures at the border announced as part of a deal with Mexico to avert threatened tariffs had actually been promised months earlier . “The Failing @nytimes , & ratings challenged @CNN , will do anything possible to see our Country fail! They are truly The Enemy of the People!” Trump said . Another false report in the Failing @nytimes .

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2019 The president then continued complaining about the general unfair treatment he thinks he receives from the media, saying he can’t catch a break. “If President Obama made the deals that I have made, both at the Border and for the Economy, the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible, & a National Holiday would be immediately declared,” Trump tweeted . “With me, despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done, no credit!” If President Obama made the deals that I have made, both at the Border and for the Economy, the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible, & a National Holiday would be immediately declared.

"Iowa Poll: Biden still leads but support slipping as Warren, Buttigieg surge.",slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/iowa-poll-biden-leads-warren-buttigieg-surge.html,"George Conway to Trump: “You Would Have Been Fired From Any Other Job by Now” Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the pack of presidential hopefuls among Iowa Democrats, but the latest CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll shows his support is slipping as a few candidates are making big gains. Overall, 24 percent say they back Biden, while second place is a virtual tie between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with 16 percent, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren with 15 percent and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 14 percent . None of the other presidential hopefuls managed to break the double digits in the poll that takes into account those who plan to caucus the traditional way and those who are planning to caucus virtually. California Sen. Kamala Harris is the one who comes the closest with 7 percent support while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke are at 2 percent. Seven candidates have 1 percent support and nine don’t have any backing. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam had particularly dismal showings in the poll as not a single respondent listed them as either their first or second choice for president. While Biden remains clearly in the lead there are lots of warning signs for the former vice president. Chief among them is that his support appears to be clearly declining as the race progresses. In December Biden was leading with 32 percent, compared to 19 percent for Sanders while in March support for Biden was at 27 percent while Sanders had 25 percent. That downward trajectory is quite the contrast to Warren, whose support was at 8 percent in December and 9 percent in March and has since soared to 15 percent. Buttigieg has seen an even bigger surge as he only had 1 percent support in March and is now at 14 percent. Biden supporters are also less enthusiastic. Among those who list Biden as their first choice for president, 29 percent say they are “extremely enthusiastic,” compared to 39 percent for those who make another candidate. Biden also has the biggest name recognition in the field meaning he has less room to grow. Appearing on ABC’s This Week , O’Rourke dismissed his weak showing in the poll. “I don’t know that this many months out from the caucuses in Iowa these polls really indicate what our prospects are,” O’Rourke said. “If I relied on polls, in any race I’ve run, I never would have served in the U.S. Congress, never would have taken on Ted Cruz. Never would have been able to lead the largest grassroots effort in the state of Texas.” For his part, Sanders said that the large number of candidates meant that it’s unlikely any presidential hopeful will get to 50 percent support in Iowa . Beto O'Rourke: ""I don't know that this many months out from the caucuses in Iowa, that these polls really indicate what our prospects are. If I relied on polls in any race that I've run, I never would have been able to serve in the United States Congress"" https://t.co/5F8Y5mHv0t pic.twitter.com/MZbkhNubI2 — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) June 9, 2019 Support our journalism

"""Board man gets paid"": How to write a Kawhi Leonard story.",slate.com,Nick Greene,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/board-man-gets-paid-how-to-write-a-kawhi-leonard-story.html,"The Best Player in the Women’s World Cup Might Be Heading Home Early Kawhi Leonard is in the midst of one of the greatest playoff runs in NBA history, and in just one season he has turned the down-on-their-luck Toronto Raptors into a terrifying juggernaut. While his play has been unbelievable, Leonard has achieved true folk hero status largely thanks to a flood of behind-the-scenes stories that have come to light during the Finals. First, there was an oral history from The Athletic’s Jayson Jenks recounting Leonard’s time at San Diego State. In it, Leonard’s former teammates describe him as a hard-working super-athlete with a penchant for idiosyncratic trash talk.
Tyrone Shelley, guard: Most people say it like, “Oh, I’m about to get buckets on you.” He was just like, “Buckets. Layup.” Just one word.
Shelton: He’d be like, “You’re not scoring. You’re not doing anything.” Or he’d be like, “No, no, no.” He’d just move his feet and say, “No.”
Gay: You couldn’t score on him, so that’s what he would say: “Nope, nope, nope.” And when he would score on you: “Bucket. Bucket.”
LaBradford Franklin, guard: If he was grabbing a rebound, he’d say, “Give me that” or “Board man” or “Board man gets paid.” “Board man gets paid” is a particularly wonderful turn of phrase, and it’s no surprise that it has become a delightful meme. board man gets paid https://t.co/eMet7mV8FF — Becca Laurie (@imbeccable) June 9, 2019 Then, there was the “Yo-Yo machine” story , via NBC Sports’ Tom Haberstroh, about when Leonard broke an infamously brutal piece of workout equipment with the San Antonio Spurs.
For most pro athletes, this is a grueling exercise, like a super squat. But after several repetitions on “The Yo-Yo,” it was clear that this wasn’t a challenge for Leonard. Under close observation of strength coaches and teammates, Leonard took it to another level. The trainers added a steel plate that would create a downward force of two times Leonard’s body weight, which at the time was around 250 pounds.
Leonard kept going, with relative ease. Then suddenly, Leonard stopped. The room turned silent as Leonard looked down at his feet. He cracked the metal platform. He literally broke the machine. Said one Spurs staffer who witnessed it that day: “Too strong for it.” Like Keyser Söze or Bill Brasky , Kawhi Leonard is a legend who’s benefited from being mysterious. He’s a frontier myth, the silent hero who rides into town, cleans up a mess, and then saunters away before dawn. We want to believe all the stories we hear about him, and this explains why this tweet from comedy writer Mike Camerlengo went viral. Few people thought it was a joke. damn Kawhi really is a different dude pic.twitter.com/bLTBSDZQy2 — Mike Camerlengo (@MCamerlengo) June 8, 2019 It’s a pitch-perfect gag, but, because it’s about Leonard, there’s little reason to question the story’s veracity. I mean, how different is “apple time, apple time” from “board man gets paid”? Fake or not, it’s firmly in the Kawhi canon. You can even buy “apple time” T-shirts now. Like all great genres, these Kawhi Leonard stories follow a series of loosely plotted rules. Here’s how to write one of your own. Step 1: Kawhi does something astounding. College Kawhi was impossible to score against and Spurs Kawhi broke draconian weight machines. Your Kawhi should do something equally impressive, but it’s important that he does it effortlessly. Here are some examples: —”Kawhi played with 50-pound medicine balls until his third NBA season. (“I didn’t realize they made basket balls,” he told San Antonio shooting coach Chip Engelland.) —”Kawhi has never flown on a team plane but he’s always at the airport, waiting, when it lands.” —”Kawhi doesn’t have a cell phone. He uses a tin can with a string that just dangles there and he gets perfect reception, even in basements.” Step 2: An onlooker notes how odd and/or amazing he is. This may seem like a throwaway flourish, but it’s important as it represents the reader’s perspective. Feel free to use any of the following lines: —”Raptors coach Nick Nurse couldn’t believe his eyes. ‘I’ve never seen anyone sleep on moving treadmill,’ he said.” —”’Wow,’ Toronto guard Kyle Lowry whispered. ‘He’s really going to fill in for the entire philharmonic by himself.’” —”’We begged him to wear a spacesuit, but I guess it didn’t matter,’ added former San Antonio point guard Tony Parker.” Step 3: Kawhi acknowledges his feat with a brilliant catchphrase. Kawhi is quiet, but he chooses his words carefully. “Board man gets paid” and “bucket, bucket” are crystalline gems plucked from the sooty mine of language, so try and keep it simple when writing your own Kawhi dialogue. —”No one could defend Kawhi, even though he was wearing espadrilles. ‘Beach flats. Beach flats,’ he said as he drained his 50th point of the night.” —”When news filtered back to the kitchen that he had been awarded his third Michelin Star, all Kawhi said was, ‘Tall chef plates sides.’” —”Kawhi pulled the redwood from the ground and gazed upon its fully intact root system. ‘Tree toes,’ he said. ‘Tree toes.’” His legend grows, just like tree toes."
Several U.S. embassies are flying rainbow flags in defiance of Trump administration.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/several-embassies-flying-rainbow-flags-defiance-trump.html,"George Conway to Trump: “You Would Have Been Fired From Any Other Job by Now” Several U.S. embassies are defying the Trump administration and flying rainbow flags to celebrate LGBTQ Pride Month even though the State Department rejected all requests to hoist rainbow flags on official flagpoles, reports the Washington Post .

This year the State Department did not send out an official cable outlining how diplomatic outposts should commemorate Pride Month. The shift seems to have coincided with Mike Pompeo becoming secretary of state. Pompeo is an evangelical Christian who believes marriage is between a man and a woman. The New York Times reports that U.S. diplomats in Brazil wanted to show support for gay rights at a time when gays are facing a hostile climate following the election of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. The State Department denied the request and said that rainbow flags could not be displayed on a “public-facing flagpole.” The “curt rejection” by State Department officials “left gay personnel and their backers reeling,” notes the Times. “American diplomats who are gay described a prevailing mood of fear and angst.”"

Dealing with slacker co-workers? Here’s what to do.,slate.com,Alison Green,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/slacker-coworker-unequal-workload-unfair-office-culture.html,"“Can We Talk?” How to Survive When Your Boss Utters the Office’s Most Dreaded Phrase. Few people are as knee-deep in our work-related anxieties and sticky office politics as Alison Green, who has been fielding workplace questions for a decade now on her website Ask a Manager. In Direct Report , she spotlights themes from her inbox that help explain the modern workplace and how we could be navigating it better. If you’ve ever had a slacker co-worker—someone who goofs off all day, getting little done and often leaving other people covering more than their fair share of the work—welcome to the club. It’s a frustration that’s rampant in many workplaces. Even more infuriating is a manager who knows about the problem but won’t act. Slackers and the managers who enable them are a common theme in my inbox. Here’s a letter typical of many I receive:
About half [my co-worker’s] work day is spent online rather than working. Whether she is clothes shopping, looking at mansions on Zillow, looking at pictures of dogs or children available for adoption, corresponding on Facebook, browsing Reddit, or reading her news feed, she will toggle between working and surfing throughout the day. … My workload does not permit me the luxury of casual internet browsing, nor am I interested in it. When she talks to me or forwards her items of interest, it’s not just distracting, it causes me to feel resentment toward her for her lack of consideration of the time and effort that I put into my job. On an ethical level, I feel that collecting a paycheck for browsing the internet is, in essence, stealing from the nonprofit organization for which we work. While it can be counterproductive to closely monitor your colleagues’ monitors, feeling like you’re working hard when the person next to you isn’t is understandably discouraging. People frustrated by slacker co-workers often hesitate to bring the issue to their manager’s attention out of a fear that they’ll be seen as “tattling”—a concept from kindergarten that apparently still haunts some of us as adults:
I am fairly close with my CEO, Nancy. She has another full-time job, as this company is a start-up and not in a place yet to support her financially, so she is never present in person but always available via Slack. Our newest hire is our marketing director, Andy, and he is not very productive. He is on Facebook a lot, is messaging his friends back and forth on iMessage, and takes care of personal stuff like banking and taxes. He is part-time and we pay him by the hour.
Andy recently submitted a large project (that he only spent 30 minutes on), and when I asked what Nancy thought of it, she said there wasn’t enough detail and that she isn’t sure what he does all day. She has said this to me numerous times in reference to Andy. I’m not sure if I should say something or if I should keep my mouth shut. … If I should broach the subject, how would I do so without coming off as a tattletale or power hungry? It’s true that some complaints would be inappropriate to bring to a manager—petty things, like reporting that a colleague takes a few extra minutes at lunch or browses Facebook during conference calls. But it’s not inappropriate to flag a substantive issue that affects a team’s work, especially if your manager is asking for feedback. And even if she hasn’t asked, good managers will appreciate a discreet heads-up when something is having a serious impact. Of course, not all managers are good managers, and some of them are well aware of the slackers on their team and simply do nothing. Often that’s because they’re afraid of difficult conversations (a terrible, and frankly prohibitive, quality in a manager):
I work at a small printing company. There are only seven of us, including my manager. I am in charge of the newspaper; my coworker is in charge of the print jobs. … My coworker not only procrastinates, but screws around and gets behind in her work. I need to pick up the slack or we will have unhappy clients. If I don’t do her work, my manager does it.
I’ve approached my manager about this situation five times. He says he sees what my coworker is doing and things will change. Nothing has changed. My assistant manager has the same concerns as I do. I finally told the assistant manager I was frustrated and at the end of my rope. He said my manager knows what’s going on, but is not going to say anything about it because my coworker “knows too much.” She’s been there five years. I think my manager is just too nice and doesn’t want to cause conflict. The assistant manager agreed. So what can you do about slacker co-workers who aren’t pulling their weight? First, it’s smart to get clear in your head on how the slacker’s behavior affects your work. Are you having to step in to take care of work your co-worker should be doing, or is your own work delayed because the person misses deadlines? (If you realize you can’t point to any real impact the colleague’s behavior is having on you, that’s a sign it might not be worth escalating.) Then, describe the problem to your boss calmly and concisely, sticking to objective facts. Don’t rant or add judgment, tempting as it may be. For example: “I’m getting calls from Jane’s clients asking me to help with their accounts because she hasn’t returned their calls. I’ve talked to her about it, but her clients are still calling me when she doesn’t respond within a few days. I wanted to flag it for you, since the clients seem unhappy, and it’s taking me away from projects like X and Y.” In some cases, it can be easier to raise concerns about a co-worker if you frame it as asking for your boss’s advice rather than requesting a specific intervention. For example: “Since I’ve tried talking with Jane directly, but it hasn’t solved it, I’m not sure where to go from here, and I wondered if I could ask for some advice.” That way you’re not just reporting a co-worker’s wrongdoing but framing it as a problem you’re hoping to solve—and meanwhile getting your boss in the loop. That still might not solve it, given that lots of managers are conflict-averse and won’t deal with problems unless their hands are forced. But you won’t have to wonder how your boss is missing what’s happening (they’re not; they’re just too wimpy to do anything) or worry that there’s something more you could be doing about it. That probably won’t lessen your frustration … but at least you’ll know where the real source of the problem is. "
Mexican ambassador to U.S. appears to contradict Trump’s claim of agriculture deal.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/mexican-ambassador-appears-contradict-trump-agriculture-deal.html,"Trump Goes on Tirade to Deny Latest Assault Allegation: Women Are “Paid Money” to Make False Claims A day after Mexico and the United States released a joint statement announcing a series of steps on border security to stave off threatened tariffs on Mexican imports, President Donald Trump said the agreement included a promise by Mexico to buy more agricultural goods from the United States. “MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!” Trump wrote in an all-caps tweet on Saturday . He then retweeted the message on Sunday. But it doesn’t seem like Mexico really knows what he’s talking about. MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2019 In an interview with CBS’ Face the Nation , Mexico’s ambassador to the U.S., Martha Bárcena Coqui, took pains not to outright contradict Trump . But her answers made it pretty clear that no such deal was signed . “It is our understanding that without tariffs and with USMCA ratification, there will be an increased rate, both in agricultural products and manufacturing products,” she said. She was asked a total of three times to clarify whether there was a deal, and she demurred every time, choosing to change the focus away from a particular agreement to general talk about trade. Mexican ambassador tells @FaceTheNation that her earlier comments neither confirmed nor denied transaction. Here's the clip, you decide. pic.twitter.com/W2hqK2eOnD — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 9, 2019 CBS first wrote that the ambassador had contradicted the president, but Bárcena objected to that characterization. “I did not contradict the president of the USA @realDonaldTrump .I just explained that with no tariffs and the USMCA ratification the trade in agricultural products will increase dramatically,” she wrote on Twitter . “Mexico is already a big buyer of USA agricultural products and this trend will continue.” I did not contradict the president of the USA @realDonaldTrump .I just explained that with no tariffs and the USMCA ratification the trade in agricultural products will increase dramatically. Mexico is already a big buyer of USA agricultural products and this trend will continue — Martha Bárcena. (@Martha_Barcena) June 9, 2019 Parsing language aside, it isn’t exactly surprising that no one can point to a specific deal, considering that experts had raised questions about the supposed agreement from the beginning. Three Mexican officials had told Bloomberg that agricultural trade wasn’t even discussed during the three days of negotiations in Washington that led to the joint declaration that was published late Friday. Even the suggestion that Mexico could simply decide to increase purchases seems suspect considering the country “has no state-owned agricultural conglomerate to buy food products or handle distribution, or a government program that could buy farm equipment for delivery to producers,” notes Bloomberg ."
E3: Cyberpunk 2077 is just the latest in a long series of video games featuring Keanu Reeves.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/e3-cyberpunk-2077-keanu-reeves-in-games-bill-ted-constantine-matrix.html,"Keanu through the ages. Rocket Science Games / Shiny Entertainment / SCi Games / CD Projekt Red Microsoft held their E3 press conference today in Los Angeles, and the biggest gaming news of 2019 turned out to be the biggest gaming news of 1991: Keanu Reeves is in videogames now! Here’s the cinematic trailer for Cyberpunk 2077 , an Xbox One, PS4, and PC game coming out in April of 2020 that debuted at Microsoft’s event. Reeves was at the event, and took the stage after the trailer to talk about how excited he was to appear in the game. It’s an amazing Keanu Reeves moment, because he seems delighted by the copy he’s delivering, which is itself an exceptional example of gamer prose. The rules for this are pretty clear: A celebrity appearing in a game must profess ignorance of the field, thus flattering gamers’ superior knowledge, while simultaneously landing on key phrases like “vast open world” and “branching storyline,” as though they were things one might say in normal conversation, thus activating a carefully conditioned Pavlovian response in gamers’ brains that sends them racing off to pre-order. So you get things like this:
A while back, the guys from CD Projekt Red approached me and asked me to be a part of their new project: Cyberpunk 2077. They were going on and on about how they’d create this vast open world with a branching storyline, how you’d be able to customize your character with in-game choices. And it’s not something I knew before but I was excited by. The best part, however, is Reeves’ decision to land on the word “Cyberpunk” like it’s an outake from Johnny Mnemonic ’s room service monologue . Here’s Reeves genially goofing his way through a teleprompter’s worth of copy, visibly unable to believe that his own personal in-life choices led his branching storyline to a point where people pay him money to say things like “You play as an outlaw, an enhanced mercenary working in the sleazy underbelly of the city.” But although Reeves may profess ignorance of gaming on the E3 stage, Cyberpunk 2077 is far from the first time gamers have gotten the chance to exchange money for a digital Keanu. In fact, although recent years have been something of a Keanu game drought, he’s been starring in video games for nearly 30 years. The first video game to feature pure digital Keanu was the 1991 NES game Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure . Here is a full playthrough, which is more than an hour longer than the film version of Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure and much, much less interesting: That same year saw Keanu appear in full un-backlit LCD monochrome glory in Bill & Ted’s Excellent Game Boy Adventure: A Bogus Journey. Motion-capture technology was still in its infancy, so Reeves was depicted using then state-of-the-art amusement park caricature technology: 1992 was a banner year for virtual Keanu Reeveses: Bram Stoker’s Dracula spawned a number of terrible, terrible Castlevania- inspired video game adaptations, presumably from developers who had not yet seen Bram Stoker’s Dracula when they shelled out for the game rights. All of the games star Jonathan Harker, Reeves’ character in the film, but none of the virtual Harkers particularly look like Reeves. That’s not too surprising, given how little the games resemble Bram Stoker’s Dracula . Here’s the SNES version: Johnny Mnemonic: The Interactive Action Movie , a 1995 PC CD-ROM game, used full-motion video, and could have had the best digital Keanu of the decade, but cast Chris Gartin in Reeves’ role instead. (It did feature Isaac Hayes, however.) Most of the rest of Reeves’ work from the 1990s didn’t make the jump into video games, presumably because there wasn’t an obvious market for reliving the cinematic adventures of Little Buddha at home, but he ended the decade by appearing in The Matrix, which secured his place in the next generation of games, most of which were based on The Matrix , and a few of which were officially-licensed Matrix adaptations. Reeves barely appears in 2003’s Enter the Matrix , which included new 35mm footage of some of the franchise’s other characters, but he stars in 2005’s The Matrix: Path of Neo . Here’s six straight hours of 3-D Keanu: Although it’s not directly relevant to Keanu Reeves’ video game career, The Matrix: Path of Neo is also notable for featuring a cameo from the original films’ directors, who explain why the game ends with a giant boss fight. Here are the digital Wachowskis: Also in 2005, Constantine: The Video Game gave gamers another trip to the unKeanu Valley, with a solid five hours of playable Keanu content: Since that glorious year of low-polygon Keanu Reeveses, though, gamers have lived in a strange and frightening Keanu-free world, as the technology they once trusted to deliver them virtual Keanu Reeveses moved on to serve younger audiences who demanded virtual Ellen Pages and virtual 50 Centses instead. But now Fortuna’s wheel has turned again and video game Keanu is back, with more polygons than ever. Whoa ! Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Theo Wargo/Getty Images This year’s Tony Awards kicked off with a musical salute from host James Corden to live theater, that wonderful experience of being in the same room as actors, singers, and dancers as they bring dreams to life. It’s hard to argue with the case Corden’s song makes for live performance as an electric and irreplaceable art form:
The kind that’s live, the kind that’s live, the kind that real life people recreate for you,
Live, a show that’s live, a show where when you laugh the cast will wait for you,
Actual people in an actual space watching actors who are actually there,
It’s something unique to that time and that place, it’s something unique, it’s something you share,
It’s live, we do it live, and every single moment’s unrepeatable,
Live, we do it live, it can’t be hashtagged and it isn’t tweetable,
There is a visceral bliss you only get in a theater seeing people do this,
That’s the bliss for which performers strive,
And tonight you’re our guest as we honor the best of the best who do it live! But if you weren’t lucky enough to be in the room at Radio City Music Hall this evening, don’t despair—you can still see Corden’s song, sort of. Here is a tweet from CBS that includes embedded video from the live television broadcast of the Tony Awards (time-delayed on the west coast), which reproduces a digitally manipulated view from television cameras which were in the same room as Corden, accompanied by a carefully mixed version of the audio captured by a series of microphones placed throughout Radio City Music Hall: Now, that’s how you start The #TonyAwards !"

Why Lindsey Horan is the key to U.S. hopes at the Women’s World Cup.,slate.com,Eric Betts,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/lindsey-horan-uswnt-2019-womens-world-cup.html,"How to Watch the Women’s World Cup Online if You Don’t Have Cable If you had to pin the World Cup fortunes of the deepest , most talented American women’s soccer team in history on one player, you could do a lot worse than midfielder Lindsey Horan. Horan was named Most Valuable Player of the 2018 National Women’s Soccer League season by virtue of being at or near the top of the league leaders in a staggering breadth of statistical categories , both offensive and defensive. She was a goal scorer, a possession hub, an aggressive dribbler, and a midfield enforcer, a do-it-all dynamo the likes of which modern soccer rarely sees. Her role on this U.S. team is to serve as its fulcrum: As she slides up and down the pitch, she’ll tip the balance from defensive solidity to overwhelming attacking force. The default state for this U.S. team is certainly the latter. Coach Jill Ellis brought seven forwards on her roster even though the team typically plays only three at a time, meaning someone is doubly redundant. The American lineup is so forward-leaning that even the defense and midfield are packed with attacking talent. Left back Crystal Dunn was the NWSL’s top scorer in 2015. Right back Kelley O’Hara was named the nation’s top college player a decade ago as a forward at Stanford. Horan, who skipped college to sign with Paris Saint-Germain as a forward at age 18, scored 14 goals in 24 games from midfield for the Portland Thorns in 2018. The American team is designed as an overwhelming human wave, like from a scene in an old kung-fu movie in which 50 people with axes show up to threaten the protagonist. With so many people attacking from so many angles and depths, somebody’s going to get you eventually—it’d almost be harder for them not to. There’s a logic behind this imbalance. The U.S. suffered its earliest major tournament exit ever at the 2016 Olympics, losing on penalties in the quarterfinals to a Sweden team that was more than happy to defend with everyone behind the ball and turn the game into a prolonged siege. The U.S. is so loaded with attacking talent—it has scored 29 goals in 10 games in 2019—that Ellis is betting other teams are going to default to the Swedish strategy rather than go toe-to-toe with the U.S. and risk leaving gaps in their own defenses. The U.S. team’s attacking prowess has begotten the need for even more attacking prowess. To help her squad navigate a series of increasingly elaborate fortifications as it progresses through the tournament, Ellis has made sure to pack every piece of weaponry she could fit on the roster. Now she has to get the balance right. The U.S. struggled through much of the early goings of the 2015 tournament before Ellis sacrificed an attacker from her starting lineup to bring on midfielder Morgan Brian, who made the team sturdier in the center of the field and helped shuttle the ball from defense to attack. Brian’s introduction in the quarterfinal against China pushed Carli Lloyd up the field into a free role, from which she annihilated all comers, scoring five goals in the final three games. The hope is that Horan can do the work Brian did while also contributing more to the attack. She’s the one who will flip the switch between reasonable caution and ludicrous speed . When she pushes up into the attack, she makes it nigh unstoppable; to cover her and Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath and Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle and Dunn and O’Hara in the final third practically requires you to put every woman available back in your own box. But the world’s best teams can’t be held at bay forever. While the offense may have scored at will in 2019, the U.S. defense has also given up two or more goals in four of its five games against top 10 opponents this year, exactly the teams it will have to beat to win the World Cup. It lost 3–1 to France in January and drew 2–2 with both England and Japan later that winter (those two tie games without Horan, who has been dealing with nagging injuries for much of the year). Horan’s advances risk leaving the space in front of the American defense relatively unprotected. Defensive midfielder Julie Ertz’s instincts are to hunt the ball, not hold her position. If Horan gets caught upfield trying to strike the killer blow, it’s easy to imagine a nightmare scenario in which three opposing attackers are running at U.S. center backs Becky Sauerbrunn and Abby Dahlkemper with room to build up speed. That’s Horan’s dilemma. She’s both the haymaker that can knock opponents out of games and the team’s key protection against getting rope-a-doped by someone looking to absorb and break. It’s a delicate balance to strike, even if her role for the U.S. has tended toward the latter; she’s scored just eight times in 68 international appearances. With so many dangerous players on the field and on the bench, that’s how she can best help this U.S. team. It needs someone who can win the ball back quickly and keep defenses under pressure.

"NBA Finals: Mark Jackson keeps talking about how ""aggressive"" both teams are. Here's a list.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/mark-jackson-aggressiveness-counter-nba-finals.html,"Kawhi Leonard Killed the Warriors. Then Steph and Klay Brought the Golden State Dynasty Back to Life. Mark Jackson is, along with Jeff Van Gundy, one of ABC’s lead analysts on NBA Finals broadcasts. As a former pro point guard and head coach, Jackson presumably has extensive technical knowledge of the game, but his color commentary often fixates on vague ideas like effort, toughness, and, perhaps most often, aggression. In fact, in the four Finals games that have transpired this year, Jackson has mentioned the A-word or one of its variants 27 times. To him, it is truly a concept that can explain any and every development. Here are all 27. • Game 1, first quarter, regarding a basket by Toronto’s Pascal Siakam. “I like that aggressiveness. You get the matchup you like, put your foot on the gas and make a play.” • Game 1, third quarter, regarding a basket by Siakam. “I like how aggressive he was. Made the move on his terms. Did not settle and got all the way to the cup.” • Game 1, third quarter, regarding a replay of the same Siakam basket. “Can see how aggressive Siakam has been.” • Game 1, third quarter, regarding a 24-second violation by the Warriors. “The aggressiveness of this Toronto Raptor defense is frustrating and forcing the issue against this Warriors offense.” • Game 1, third quarter, regarding a basket by Toronto’s Marc Gasol. “It’s important for him to be aggressive, not just tonight, but all series long, on the offensive end.” • Game 1, third quarter, regarding a basket by Siakam. “You can just tell the confidence of Siakam. He is having his way. Aggressive with his foot on the gas pedal and making big-time offensive plays.” • Game 1, fourth quarter, regarding a basket by Siakam. “This guy’s been spectacular. Aggressive all night long.” • Game 1, fourth quarter, regarding an offensive foul committed by Golden State’s Klay Thompson. “It’s the [Raptor] aggressiveness frustrating the Warriors.” • Game 2, third quarter, regarding a drive to the basket by Golden State’s Andre Iguodala. “The Warriors being aggressive on the offensive end.” • Game 2, fourth quarter, regarding a basket by Siakam. “He’s got to be even more aggressive. That first game, he was very aggressive. Put his foot on the gas pedal all night long.” • Game 2, fourth quarter, regarding a foul drawn by Siakam. “I like the way he was aggressive.” • Game 2, fourth quarter, regarding Golden State’s Draymond Green and Iguodala needing to take advantage of opportunities on offense. “You have to be aggressive. They’re going to give you shots.” • Game 3, first quarter, regarding a post move by Gasol. “I’d like to see Marc Gasol do his work a little bit earlier. Get better position before the catch and then look to be aggressive.” • Game 3, first quarter, regarding a pass from Siakam to Gasol that led to a basket. “[As] we saw in Game 1, Siakam was aggressive offensively, Gasol was aggressive offensively.” • Game 3, second quarter, regarding a comment Draymond Green had made about needing to guard Siakam more effectively. “I like the mindset of Siakam tonight. … Somebody says that about me, I’m going to take it personal and be more aggressive.” • Game 3, second quarter, regarding a pass Toronto’s Kawhi Leonard made to Kyle Lowry after driving into the lane. “Kawhi Leonard being more aggressive, trying to make plays, forces the defense to collapse. Sets Kyle Lowry up with a wide open jump shot. And these are the times when Leonard looks up and sees that his team is in the bonus —he’s much more aggressive forcing the issue.” • Game 3, second quarter, regarding a Lowry 3-pointer. “He’s been big. Struggled in Game 2, [but] he’s come out aggressive.” • Game 3, third quarter, regarding a 3-pointer by Toronto’s Danny Green. “Danny Green stepping in rhythm, knocking down shots. We’ve seen him make big shots before. Feeling it, and he’s aggressive.” • Game 3, fourth quarter, regarding a rebound and basket by Toronto’s Serge Ibaka. “He’s made the difference by making the much more aggressive offensively and crashing the offensive boards.” • Game 3, fourth quarter, regarding the importance of excellent play by Toronto’s bench players going forward. “Coach, what I mean by that, you’re well aware of it, you can’t be tentative and passive one game and then all of a sudden you’re aggressive. If you’re going to win this thing, you need to be aggressive.” • Game 4, third quarter, regarding a missed opportunity by Lowry to score against Golden State’s Kevon Looney.* “He has to look to be aggressive and take advantage of that matchup.” • Game 4, fourth quarter, after Thompson came off a screen to receive a pass. “Klay Thompson—here’s where he gives his team life by looking to be aggressive offensively.” • Game 4, fourth quarter, regarding a pass from Lowry to Leonard. “This is aggressive basketball, again, off of that pick and roll.” In Jackson’s telling, if you’re playing well, you’re being aggressive. If you’re not playing well, you’re not. Take Danny Green, whose offensive role is mostly to take spot-up 3-pointers if his teammates attract defenders by driving the lane. During the Eastern Conference Finals against Milwaukee, Green suffered a shooting slump, but against the Warriors he’s had a hot streak on what have mostly been the same wide-open shots he was missing against the Bucks. Many would describe this as a reversion to Green’s (excellent) mean level of 3-point shooting accuracy, but Jackson called it Green being “aggressive.” Many observers would also argue that it’s possible to be too aggressive in basketball—taking contested shots, throwing wild passes, etc.—but as the example above involving a Klay Thompson offensive foul shows, Jackson’s mental model seems to reject that idea. Thompson got called for pushing a Raptors defender in an effort to get open—a seeming example of excessive pro-activeness which Jackson explained, rather, as a consequence of the Raptors’ aggression, on defense. It’s a Catch-22 in which the conclusion is always that the winning team is the aggressive one. What’s frustrating about this isn’t just that one of ESPN’s top announcers explains an intriguingly complicated game as if it’s arm wrestling but that the network has a better option available so closely at hand in Doris Burke—an analyst who is widely acclaimed within the game for her insight but is marginalized during finals games as a sideline interviewer. This year’s series looks to be on the verge of wrapping up as Toronto takes a 3–1 lead into Monday night’s Game 5, but moving forward a Burke-Jackson lineup swap might be the kind of aggressive move that really pays off.

NRA has been paying board members who oversee its spending: Washington Post report.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/nra-payments-board-members.html,"Daughter of Fierce Kavanaugh Defender Amy Chua to Clerk for … Brett Kavanaugh A quarter of the members of the National Rifle Association’s remarkably large board have received some form of payment from the organization in recent years, the Washington Post reported Sunday night. The high number of financial transactions, while not necessarily illegal or a violation of the NRA’s ethics rules, raises further questions about oversight by the 76-member board, which is in charge of the organization’s spending. The NRA has faced separate allegations of financial misconduct and is facing an investigation by the New York attorney general, who could strip the organization of its tax-exempt status if it is found to have violated the rules of nonprofit finances, potentially crippling the powerful organization reliant on funds from wealthy donors. The Post reviewed tax filings, state charitable reports, and NRA correspondence and found that 18 of the board members, who have no term limits, collected some payment from the NRA in the past three years. The payments were for as much as $3 million and for services such as firearms training, consulting, speeches, writing for NRA publications, and purchases of various firearm-related products. As long as the board members (and any family members who may have also received any money from the organization) received the payments at market value, the transactions would likely be considered legally acceptable. According to the Post, the NRA properly disclosed the payments, and under state and federal law, nonprofit board members can do business with their organizations if they follow certain guidelines. The NRA told the Post that the board members were chosen for certain tasks and business transactions in part because the firearm advocacy world is a small one, and the individuals fit their needs most appropriately. But given the NRA’s current scandals, the revelation does not look great. The large number of payments to NRA board members gives the appearance—and actual risk—of a conflict of interest. Already it had been revealed that NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre charged hundreds of thousands of dollars to the nonprofit for luxury clothes and foreign travel, as well as $13,800 for a summer intern’s rent. LaPierre said the expenses were justified by his public appearances for the organization. Oliver North, the former NRA president who was dramatically ousted in April after a standoff with LaPierre, reportedly also raised alarms of financial mismanagement, claiming that the organization was facing an “existential crisis” over exorbitant legal fees to a single attorney. In the leaked confidential memo dating to the week before his exit, North wrote that the NRA was being billed nearly $100,000 a day. North then pleaded for an audit of their payments to the attorney and alleged LaPierre had denied his requests for an independent review of the invoices. (The NRA has argued that these allegations of misspending amounted to a smear against LaPierre. North, who is best known for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, met his downfall when LaPierre accused him of trying to use allegations of financial impropriety to extort him into resigning. LaPierre, in his counter-accusations, has alleged that North was set to profit in a multimillion-dollar deal with the NRA’s former public relations agency. The NRA has also said its finances are in good condition.) The investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James is not the only scrutiny facing the organization: The Senate Finance Committee has been looking into the NRA’s ties to Russia, made suspect by the activities of alleged Russian operative Maria Butina, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for serving as a foreign agent and who has been accused of attempting to infiltrate the NRA. The Senate inquiry has grown to include the allegations of self-dealing. The NRA maintains that these allegations are being peddled by gun control advocates in an effort to attack the organization.

Wife guy definition: A handy guide to the many trend pieces about the wife guy.,slate.com,Heather Schwedel,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/wife-guy-definition-trend-piece-digest.html,"Enraged by a Co-Worker Who Slacks Off All Day? Here’s What to Do. A few weeks ago, the term “wife guy” was barely a glint in the internet’s eye—a recurring online character that did not yet really have a name, much less a whole discourse around him. Well, as of last week, there were at least five major pieces that dug into the subject, attempting to define it and diagnose what it means for society. Five! What’s responsible for this sudden explosion of wife guy content (aside from choreplay wife guy , who I think sent writers over the edge)? And what can we learn from it? Read on for some Cliff [Wife] Notes. Several of the articles about wife guys aimed to present us with a conclusive definition of the concept. “Wife Guys are the men who make themselves famous for things their wives did, or qualities their wives have or had,” New York magazine explained. Per the Outline, a wife guy is “a man who has become ridiculous through his involvement in something wife-related and has happened to become known online.” The New York Times went with “a man who has risen to prominence online by posting content about his wife.” Commonly cited examples from the pieces include curvy wife guy and elf wife guy . As some of the definitions take care to reflect, the wife guy’s relationship to the wife that he … is the wife guy of? … isn’t as clear-cut as it may initially sound. Things get ambiguous: It’s not actually required that the wife guy be married to the wife in any given scenario, just that there is a wife, and it’s also not certain whether the wife guy himself needs to have posted the original content to qualify as a bona fide wife guy. Is a wife guy born, or is wife guyness thrust upon him? The aforementioned curvy wife guy is quite clearly the one in the driver’s seat on his wife journey, posting Instagrams and even a music video about his wife, but other wife guys, like don’t-email-my-wife guy , named for the viral photo of a garage with the words “don’t email my wife” spray-painted on it, arise from the internet back alleys of social media and Reddit, their identities severed from the feats of legendary wife guyliness that they represent. These loopholes expand the pool of wife guys, and it is in the interests of the chronicler of the wife guy for the definition of the term to be looser, because the more wife guys there are, the more chances the writer has to prove that is a real category of guy worthy of discussion. Is a wife guy born or is wife guyness thrust upon him? The other two so-called wife guy articles, in Mel and the New Yorker, didn’t provide clear definitions of the wife guy because they aren’t even really about wife guys; they are about wives. It’s an important point: Whether study of this phenomenon should focus on the wife guy or the wife herself remains a central question. When you think about it, wife or wife guy is a philosophical debate on the level of chicken or the egg. Usually we don’t actually know anything about the wife other than that she is a wife, because the wife guy is speaking for her. But then, wife guy is only interesting because he got a wife, somehow. We could go back and forth on this forever. How does one illustrate the concept of a wife guy? The most straightforward way, chosen by New York magazine, is a still of a wife guy and his wife (here, Mr. and Mrs. Cliff Wife ). The Outline used the photo that constitutes the entirety of the don’t-email-my-wife guy’s persona. A picture of Borat gets the message across for the New Yorker. I confess I don’t know who is pictured in Mel’s art, but presumably they are wife guys? But anyway, they are covered in lava and melting. Perhaps photography is too literal a medium to communicate this abstract sort of guy: To go with its piece, the New York Times published an illustration of a colorful bride and groom kissing, where the groom is holding up a smartphone over the bride’s shoulder, capturing a photo of the two. It reminds me a lot of the famous photo of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez kissing at the Oscars , in which Ben Affleck’s eyes are clearly trained somewhere other than on Lopez. Was Bennifer-era Affleck the original wife guy? Some finer points: On capitalizing “wife guy”: The articles were also split on this. For capitalization: New York magazine, the Outline, the New Yorker. Against: the New York Times (and, I guess, Slate, I just decided). Did not actually use the term “wife guy” in its article: Mel. Number of these articles that cited @dril, the popular pseudonymous Twitter account known for its humor: three of the five. How @dril is introduced in each of them: “the prophet” (Mel); “Twitter bard and my nomination for the Nobel Prize” (the Outline); “weird Twitter account” (the New York Times). Why are all the wives and wife guys, and the articles about them, emerging now? Well, for one, writers have to post every day; you got anything better? But also because it’s always fun to discover that there is a new type of “guy,” and you can analyze what this means about “how we live now.” And when you can fit ideas about the state of gender and marriage in too? Chef’s kiss. You’re telling me a stupid online thing can reflect “a deeply ambivalent state of heterosexual coupling” (the New York Times) or that “commitment [is] barely necessary at this point in the Western history of sexual romance” (Mel)? That’s every culture writer’s dream. Honestly, all the wife and wife guy articles were good reads. Did the internet need five of them? Perhaps not, but it’s a fitting tribute to the wife guy, who is not known for his restraint. All that knowledge lets us build on the old adage that behind every great man is a great woman: It turns out that if that woman is a wife, there just might be a wife guy behind her . And then behind that wife guy? Another shrewd and informative article about wife guys."
"Hong Kong protests a proposed extradition law, but huge crowds may not be enough.",slate.com,Joshua Keating,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/hong-kong-protests-extradition-law-china.html,"Trump’s Lawyers Say Congress Can’t Subpoena His Finances Because Nancy Pelosi Refuses to Impeach Hong Kongers are back in the streets. As the South China Morning Post notes, protesting is in the semi-independent city-state’s “ DNA ”: Smaller demonstrations are nearly constant , and massive ones like this one—usually mounted to protect the city’s hard-won political independence—happen every few years. Still, the scale of the current outcry is unusual , with hundreds of thousands protesting a new extradition law on Sunday in what may have been the largest marches since the city’s handover to Chinese rule. On Monday, as riot police clashed with a small group of several hundred protesters outside Hong Kong’s legislature—Sunday’s much larger protests were mostly peaceful—Chief Executive Carrie Lam vowed to press on with the bill. It will be up for debate on Wednesday, and with pro-Beijing lawmakers enjoying a majority in the legislature, it is very likely to pass into law. Under the proposed law, Hong Kong’s chief executive would have the authority, on a case-by-case basis, to order the extradition of criminal suspects to countries not covered by its current extradition treaties—including mainland China. The former British colony has been part of China since 1997, but it maintains autonomy under the “ one country, two systems ” arrangement. This status has allowed Hong Kong to become a major global financial hub and maintain a degree of political freedom unknown elsewhere in China, including an elected legislature and a free and rambunctious media. But as China’s political and economic clout has grown, so has the pressure on Hong Kong. The city’s special status is due to end in 2047, by prior arrangement, but leaders in Beijing don’t seem to want to wait that long, creating several flashpoints in recent years. In 2012, Hong Kongers took to the streets to protest a new school curriculum that included a “patriotic education” requirement. In 2014, the Occupy Central movement , also known as the Umbrella Revolution, shut down the city’s financial center in response to a new election law that allows a Beijing-approved election committee to prescreen political candidates for the city’s chief executive office. Proponents of the new extradition law, including Lam, say it will only be used in specific cases and have pointed to a recent gruesome case of a Hong Kong man accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan, who can’t be sent to face trial there because Taiwan is also not currently covered by an extradition treaty. Supporters also argue that Hong Kongers could still challenge extraditions in court, that no one at risk of torture or the death penalty would be extradited, and that suspects would only be extradited for offenses that are also illegal in Hong Kong. The government also removed nine financial crimes from eligibility for extradition following backlash from the business community. But pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong fear the law will be used to further infringe on Hong Kong’s status as a haven for critics of Beijing’s policies. A few recent incidents suggest these fears are not overblown. In 2015, five people associated with a controversial Hong Kong bookstore known to sell materials critical of China’s central government went missing and eventually turned up in mainland custody. Beijing has also recently become bolder about detaining foreign nationals on political grounds. In December, the government arrested and charged two Canadians with espionage : Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat who worked in Beijing for the International Crisis Group, and Michael Spavor, a consultant who worked on the China–North Korea border. Their arrests came shortly after Canada’s detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant and are widely seen as retaliatory. Because of its more permissive political climate, Hong Kong is used as a base of operations for many nongovernmental organizations and journalists—both local and foreign—whose work would not be possible in the mainland. In theory, the extradition law is written in such a way that those workers would be protected from being sent to China on political charges, but with a fairly compliant Hong Kong government , it’s not hard to imagine those in power in the city concocting a pretext to allow China to arrest someone it sees as critical or otherwise threatening in Hong Kong territory. For its part, the mainland Chinese government has barely acknowledged the protests and has censored any mention of them in Chinese media. The state-run, English-language Global Times, which is aimed at an international audience , wrote in an editorial that the law is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a “heaven for criminals” and accused foreign governments of stirring up the protests, noting that both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have expressed concern about the law. The protests come a week after the 30 th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, an event that is marked with a candlelight vigil every year in Hong Kong but is barely remembered, much less observed, in mainland China. (This year, many activists expressed fears that the 2019 vigil could be one of the last.) China’s leaders often justify authoritarianism on cultural grounds, arguing that those who press for more democracy and civil liberties are attempting to impose Western values and political ideas on a place and a culture where they’re not suited. Hong Kong (along with Taiwan, which is also under increasing pressure from China) represents a refutation of that idea, as does the fact that young Hong Kongers are more critical of Beijing than their parents, despite China’s increasing prosperity and cultural influence. Hong Kong’s citizens are likely to continue to push back, and more flashpoints can be expected, but the city-state may not be able to resist the pressure from the superpower next door for much longer."
Trump and Macron’s “friendship tree” dies.,slate.com,Chip Brownlee,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-macron-friendship-tree-dead.html,"Alabama Governor Signs Into Law Chemical Castration Requirement for Some Sex Offenders When French President Emmanuel Macron came to Washington in April last year for his first state visit, he and President Donald Trump planted a European sessile oak tree on the South Lawn of the White House. It was meant to symbolize friendship between the two countries and the 100 th anniversary of when American troops fought in France during World War I. “This oak tree,” Macron said on Twitter, “will be a reminder at the White House of these ties that bind us.” During the tree-planting ceremony, Trump and Macron took turns shoveling dirt on top of the sapling uprooted from Belleau Wood in France, the site of one of the most gruesome battles in World War I. 100 years ago, American soldiers fought in France, in Belleau to defend our freedom. This oak tree (my gift to @realDonaldTrump ) will be a reminder at the White House of these ties that bind us. pic.twitter.com/AUdVncaKRN — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) April 24, 2018 Now it’s dead, and some are wondering if it’s a metaphor for the withering relationship between Macron and Trump—and the president’s relationship with European leaders more broadly. French media reported that the tree was removed a few days after the photo op for a standard two-year stint in quarantine. After the tree disappeared from the South Lawn, stirring a bit of mystery, former French Ambassador Gérard Araud confirmed the tree had been taken to quarantine. He said it would be replanted later, but it never was. It is in quarantine which is mandatory for any living organism imported to the US. It will be replanted afterwards. https://t.co/XyJRKTgPWW — Gérard Araud (@GerardAraud) April 29, 2018 The sapling didn’t survive the first year of the quarantine , which is required of all international imports of living plants and seedlings to prevent the spread of pests and disease. When Trump and Macron both assumed their offices in 2017, the two had a budding friendship. The Trumps visited the Macrons in France to attend Bastille Day festivities, and their friendly demeanor led to talk of a “ bromance ” between the two world leaders. That relationship has since cooled, as they clashed over the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords, and even traded blows on Twitter . During Trump’s visit last week to commemorate the 75 th anniversary of D-Day, Trump and Macron met briefly, downplaying their disagreements over Iran . Macron and Trump said they have the same objective—to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon—but ignored their differing opinions on how to get there. Macron also offered some veiled criticism of Trump’s isolationism and his distrust of international institutions, urging him instead to fulfill the “promises of Normandy” and support NATO and the U.N. With Trump and Macron’s bromance withering and their friendship tree deceased, the whole thing seems like a bleak, on-the-nose metaphor straight out of French cinema. Fin."
Daughter of Fierce Kavanaugh Defender Amy Chua to Clerk for … Brett Kavanaugh,slate.com,Jeremy Stahl,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/tiger-mom-amy-chua-daughter-clerkship-brett-kavanaugh.html,"Armed Neo-Nazis Get a Police Escort to Disrupt Detroit Pride In the summer of 2018, before the country knew who Christine Blasey Ford was, a simple case was being made for Brett Kavanaugh among a certain group of progressive elite: Judge Kavanaugh should become Justice Kavanaugh because he’s just such a darn swell guy. One of the most prominent figures to make that claim was Yale Law School professor and famed Tiger Mom Amy Chua, who wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in July 2018 titled “Kavanaugh Is a Mentor To Women: I can’t think of a better judge for my own daughter’s clerkship.” Chua’s qualifications for writing this op-ed came via the role she had played helping place judicial clerks as a member of Yale Law School’s clerkships committee. In the piece, she described several generic and anonymous accounts of Kavanaugh’s “incredible” mentorship, “legendary work ethic,” “commitment to excellence,” “humility,” and “decency.” As evidence of this decency, one anonymous clerk noted, “I’ve never seen him be rude to anyone in the building.” She also explained that her confidence in Kavanaugh was so great that her own daughter was scheduled to begin an appellate clerkship with him (one that likely would have to be postponed if the judge was confirmed to the Supreme Court). She concluded the piece by saying “for my own daughter, there is no judge I would trust more than Brett Kavanaugh to be, in one former clerk’s words, ‘a teacher, advocate, and friend.’ ” When the op-ed was published in July, Above the Law Executive Editor Elie Mystal correctly noted that Kavanaugh’s “ ‘extraordinary’ ability to hire [Chua’s] daughter” was less of a legal qualification and more just something personally great for Chua’s daughter and Chua herself. As Mystal further elucidated, if Kavanaugh was confirmed, “Chua’s daughter will be at the top of [Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court clerkship] list next year,” making the idea that Chua herself did not have something personal to gain from his appointment a little bit outlandish. As Mystal put it, “Chua is just counting on you people who haven’t been educated in her exceptional parenting style to be too stupid to notice that.” At that point, Chua’s daughter decided to speak up in defense of her mother, sending what appeared to be her first tweet ever to publicly respond to Mystal: Hi! Daughter here. Just to clarify your post: I was college ROTC, attended YLS on Army Ed Delay, and am joining Active Duty JAG after circuit clerkship (wherever that will be!). Won't be applying to SCOTUS anytime soon bc will be in the Army. Proud of my brave mom as always. -SCR — Sophia ChuaRubenfeld (@SChuaRubenfeld) July 13, 2018 So, no cause for concern over Chua’s conflict of interest—Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld would be serving her country in the military and wouldn’t have time for any Supreme Court clerkship. Again, this all happened in July. Christine Blasey Ford came forward with her accusations in late September. Soon after that, the Guardian and HuffPost reported that several of Chua’s law students alleged that Chua and her husband Jed Rubenfeld had advised them that Kavanaugh liked to hire clerks with a “certain look,” that Chua reportedly said that it was “no accident” that Kavanaugh’s clerks “looked like models,” and that applicants should dress in an “outgoing” fashion for interviews with the judge. Chua denied having made these comments and continued to defend Kavanaugh throughout the Christine Blasey Ford hearings. She further noted that “Kavanaugh’s first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence. He hires only the most qualified clerks, and they have been diverse as well as exceptionally talented and capable.” We all know what happened next—Kavanaugh repeatedly lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee about his experiences in high school relating to his alleged assault on Ford, demonstrated his rage at the idea that he should even have to answer questions about it , and was confirmed to the bench. Since his confirmation, 83 ethics complaints against him have gone without investigation because we don’t have a way to assess the conduct of Supreme Court justices. Cut to Monday: Hired by Justice Kavanaugh for October Term 2019:Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (Yale 2018 / Grant)Trenton Van Oss (Harvard 2017 / Grant)First two #SCOTUS feeds by Judge Grant, both to her former boss. Congrats, Your Honor! #SCOTUS #AppellateTwitter — Supreme Ambitions (@SCOTUSambitions) June 10, 2019 Super-duper. If Chua, or Chua-Rubenfeld, or those who came to their defense in this whole stupid, sordid affair had anything resembling shame, then they might apologize to Mystal, or turn down the clerkship, or recede from public life for a little while. That does not seem to be the approach they are taking. It’s worth ending here with a reminder that, as Slate’s Susan Matthews and Dahlia Lithwick reported last year, Rubenfeld is under investigation for allegedly inappropriate behavior with students. Some of those students told Matthews and Lithwick that they were afraid to report the abuse because of fear Chua would use her position on the Yale Law clerkship committee to retaliate. It’s unclear whether Chua is still on that committee or what the status of that investigation is—we’ve reached out to Yale for comment and will update if we hear back.

Of course there are people who still oppose this ’70s-era constitutional amendment, which asserts that “equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” On Last Week Tonight ,John Oliver explained the history of the amendment, the arguments made by opponents like the late Phyllis Schlafly, and how just one state’s ratification could get the ERA added to the U.S. Constitution. Oliver turned it into a competition of sorts, lining up all of the flags of the remaining states and challenging them individually to change history. “Somebody please do it before Florida,” he begged. “Because I do not want to give them credit for this."

"Trump Wanted Europeans to Spend More on Defense. Now They’re Doing It, so He Has a New Complaint.",slate.com,Fred Kaplan,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/europe-military-industrial-complex-nato-trump.html,"How Evangelicals Are Guiding Trump’s Foreign Policy America’s European allies are finally spending more on defense, but the Trump administration is raising hell about it because some of the allies want to spend the money on weapons made in their own countries. The irony is immense. Throughout his presidency, and even before, Trump has been browbeating the NATO allies to boost their defense budgets, even threatening to leave the alliance if they didn’t pony up. Now that they’re doing so in a politically viable way—by investing in their own companies—top U.S. officials are complaining. It would be funny if it weren’t so damaging. The whole episode bolsters suspicions that the United States is interested more in enriching its own military-industrial complex than in improving the common defense. As a result, trans-Atlantic tensions, which Trump has done much to brew, will likely thicken. The case for higher European defense budgets will lose legitimacy if it comes to be seen as a mere appendage to Trump’s “America First” campaign. The New York Times reported last week that Michael J. Murphy, a top official in the State Department’s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, “lectured” European Union ambassadors about their attempt to launch a new program that would exclude “third parties”—including the United States—from participating in cooperative military projects unless absolutely necessary. Defense policy has always been, to a certain degree, industrial policy. Murphy was so angry about the issue, the Times reports, that he left no time in the session for discussion after his remarks. A “similar but less aggressive meeting” took place at the Pentagon, where discussion was allowed. At his meeting with the ambassadors, Murphy accused the EU of “pursuing an industrial policy under the veneer of a security policy.” Two points should be made about this charge. First, it’s overstated. Even with the new policies, the NATO allies will still be buying lots of American weapons and supplies, including several—such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter—that were designed as multinational projects. Second, the charge is risible. Even within the United States, defense policy has always been, to a certain degree, industrial policy. Several years ago, when the U.S. Air Force was developing the F-22 stealth fighter plane, it deliberately spread the contracts and subcontracts to 46 states , giving a solid majority of senators—and a lot of House members—a financial and electoral stake in protecting the program. When Robert Gates, President Obama’s first defense secretary, killed the F-22, Congress allowed it only because the F-35s—which he not only preserved but expanded—had largely the same network of contractors.

In the late 1950s and early ’60s, the U.S. Army spread contracts for the Nike Zeus anti-ballistic missile system to 37 states , for the same reason. Ever since, the military services and their contractors have relied on their beneficiaries in Congress to make the arguments and deliver the votes to save their projects and budgets—sometimes for good, sometimes for ill. It’s part of the game, and for Murphy to harrumph about it bespeaks a degree of ignorance or arrogance fully deserving of the Europeans’ derision and scorn. In their meetings, Murphy and the Pentagon officials did cite one genuinely substantive concern. It is known as “interoperability”—the fear that, in a war, allied operations might be hampered if U.S. and European forces were using different weapons, supplies, ammunition, and so forth. NATO commanders worried about this issue during the Cold War, when massive garrisons of forces from 16 allied nations trained to stave off an invasion of Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces along narrow sectors across the East-West German border. However, the concerns are somewhat overblown. In the years since the Cold War, NATO allies have conducted joint military operations in several theaters—Afghanistan, Kosovo, Libya, Iraq, the Mediterranean, and elsewhere. Some of these operations have been hampered by differences in tactics, strategy, or rules of engagement—but not by some incompatibility among the allies’ weapons systems. On the occasions when problems of that sort emerged, they were solved by on-the-spot workarounds. Ivo Daalder, U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, told me in an email, “It’s true that, say, countries flying F-16s or F-35s can cooperate more closely—training together, pooling maintenance, sharing munitions, etc. But,” he went on, “non-U.S. planes (and ships, tanks, etc.) are perfectly interoperable with U.S. equipment and forces. And no one in Europe is arguing that there should be no interoperability with the U.S. We should welcome any effort by the Europeans to increase their defenses.” Murphy told the EU ambassadors that their plan to build up their own defense industries, even just a little, would “create a new irritant in trans-Atlantic relations.” This is, at best, baffling. The European plan amounts to fairly normal industrial policy; certainly, it’s a step toward the sort of European unity that most presidents have welcomed and that even Trump has said he wants. As usual, Trump’s sharp protest is the only irritant. Support our journalism

The study claiming Google made $4.7 billion from news is incredibly flimsy,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/business/2019/06/the-study-claiming-google-made-usd4-7-billion-from-news-is-incredibly-flimsy.html,"Trump Wanted Europeans to Spend More on Defense. Now They’re Doing It, so He Has a New Complaint. In the eyes of a lot of journalists and media executives, Google and Facebook are essentially two large and profitable parasites, feeding off the hard, much less profitable work of the news industry. Both companies send a large amount of readers to sites like, say, Slate, but don’t have to pay for the journalism that draws those readers in to begin with. More importantly, Facebook and Google have devoured most of the digital advertising market—combined, they control 59 percent of it —starving a lot of outlets in the process. Because companies can buy targeted ads on a Google search page, they have much less incentive to pay for banner ads on the websites of mid-size metro papers. The News Industry Alliance, a lobbying group, has an idea for addressing this market imbalance. It is urging Congress to give media companies an antitrust exemption that would let them band together and collectively bargain with the tech giants for a share of their news-driven profits. To back this idea, it produced a study , which was covered by the New York Times this weekend, claiming that Google alone generates about $4.7 billion worth of revenue from news searches alone. It’s a stunningly flimsy conclusion. The group arrives at its headline figure with little more than a back-of-the-envelope scribble based mostly on a number one-time Google exec Marissa Mayer mentioned offhandedly during a lunch in 2008. As much as I, a journalist who cares about journalism, want the big tech problem addressed,this effort is so amateurish that I’m guessing it will probably do more harm than good for the industry’s cause. At its heart, Google’s main business model is pretty simple: When people use Google to search for something, the company serves them ads related to that topic. If people click said ads, Google gets paid. The more ads people click, the more money it makes. Google does not actually run any ads against its Google News app, which means they don’t directly monetize it, and if you use its regular search bar to look up the news of the day, there’s a good chance you won’t get much if any advertising either. A search for “Elizabeth Warren” on Monday only brought up one ad, directing me to her official campaign website; a search for “Robert Mueller” brought up zilch (no, not even a single “ It’s Mueller Time ” T-shirt). When I searched for “computer science degree,” on the other hand, I got four ads for various boot camps and online degrees. This all illustrates a pretty basic reality of Google’s business, which is that it tends to earn money when people use it to search for things advertisers are selling. Still, all of those news readers are presumably worth something to the company. Back in 2008, Mayer, who was then a Google vice president, told a lunch crowd attending a Fortune conference that Google News was worth about $100 million to the company, basically because it got more people to use the company’s main search engine instead of, you know, Yahoo’s. Here’s how Fortune described her comments:
Google vice president Marissa Mayer, who heads search products and user experience, threw out during a Tuesday lunch session at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. How does she put a value on a product that doesn’t directly make money? The online giant figures that Google News funnels readers over to the main Google search engine, where they do searches that do produce ads. And that’s a nice business. Think of Google News as a $100 million search referral machine. Based on Fortune’s reporting, it is unclear whether there was anything behind this number, other than Google executives’ pure gut intuition. Nonetheless, the News Industry Alliance uses it as almost the entire basis of its analysis. Here’s how the Alliance does the math: • First , they note that $100 million amounted to about 0.7 percent of Google’s total revenue in 2008. They then assume, without much evidence, 1 that it is responsible for an equal share of the company’s revenue today. • Second , they attempt to estimate how much revenue Google gets from news-related searches on its main site. They do so by multiplying 0.7, a number they functionally pulled from nowhere, by six. Why six? Because publishers say they get six times more traffic referrals from normal Google searches than from the news app. This leads them to conclude that people typing “Mueller report” and such into the Google search bar is worth 4.2 percent of the company’s revenue. • Third , they do some addition: 4.2% + 0.7% = 4.9%. Multiply that by $96 billion in revenue, and you get a grand total $4.7 billion. Not one bit of this is remotely credible. The fact that Marissa Mayer said during a lunch more than 10 years ago that Google News was worth roughly 0.7 percent of the company’s revenue does not have much bearing on what it is worth to Google today. The fact that publishers get six times more traffic from regular Google search than from the news app does not have much bearing on how valuable that traffic is to Google. What’s a bit infuriating about all of this is that Google probably does benefit in significant ways from being a major news destination, and at this point, there’s an argument to be made for making it share some of those rewards with media organizations. It just may not be possible to quantify that benefit right now, at least without a lot of internal data from the company. Trying to paper over that reality by pushing out an easily debunkable stat makes it look like the news industry is grasping at straws in its argument. It makes its very real concerns about Silicon Valley less credible and easier to dismiss.
1 The brief points out that Google News traffic and ad revenue from Google’s websites grew at a similar pace from 2008 to 2018. They don’t provide any evidence of how one is related to the other. Nonetheless, it concludes: “This similar growth in Google News and Google properties suggests that the 2008 estimate of the value of Google News relative to Google properties can be applied to recent years.”"
Stephen Breyer is worried about the forever war’s permanent prisoners.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/stephen-breyer-aumf-dissent-gitmo-scotus.html,"Daughter of Fierce Kavanaugh Defender Amy Chua to Clerk for … Brett Kavanaugh In 2004, Justice Stephen Breyer cast the decisive vote in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld ,allowing the government to detain alleged terrorists indefinitely without trial. Hamdi interpreted the Authorization for Use of Military Force as a boundless grant of power to the president, permitting the executive to imprison anyone deemed an “enemy combatant” without bona fide due process. The Supreme Court’s sweeping decision allowed Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump to keep these “combatants” locked up at Guantanamo Bay, deprived of fundamental constitutional safeguards. Trump is eager to hold them there for years to come. On Monday, Breyer announced his desire to “confront the difficult question left open by Hamdi ”—and, implicitly, his growing discomfort with the decision’s impact.But it’s almost certainly too late. The Supreme Court has lost its swing votes and conservative skeptics of executive power. Until Congress and the president decide otherwise, the courts will permit this suspension of due process with no end in sight. Congress passed the AUMF in the week after 9/11, a hasty attempt to arm Bush with the necessary tools to protect the nation. It authorized the executive to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons” that “planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks” or “harbored such organizations or persons.” Crucially, the law allows the president to “determin[e]” who is subject to the AUMF. The Bush administration construed the law to permit, among other things, the detention of anyone the president labeled an enemy combatant—citizens and aliens alike. Hamdi involved a challenge to this alleged power. Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan, taken to Guantanamo, then transferred to a naval brig in the United States. Accused of joining the Taliban, Hamdi was deemed an enemy combatant, and the government asserted a right to hold him indefinitely without even bringing formal charges, let alone giving him a trial. The evidence against Hamdi rested entirely on a declaration by Michael Mobbs, the special adviser to the undersecretary of defense for policy. Mobbs stated that, upon his “review of relevant records and reports,” he believed Hamdi was associated with the Taliban. But the government refused to show these “records and reports” to the court. Instead, it asserted that because the president had “determin[ed]” that Hamdi was an enemy combatant, the military could use “appropriate force” against him—that is, detain him indefinitely—and the courts had no right to intervene. In a split decision, the Supreme Court handed the government a compromise. A plurality opinion by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Breyer, endorsed a key part of the Bush administration’s AUMF theory: It agreed that the law allowed the president to detain those he determines to be an enemy combatant. The plurality also agreed that these individuals are not owed full due process, even if they’re U.S. citizens. O’Connor, however, deployed a balancing test that let Hamdi “receive notice of the factual basis for his classification” and “rebut the Government’s factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.” She then stacked the deck against him, permitting hearsay (like Mobbs’ declaration) as evidence, granting “a presumption in favor of the Government’s evidence,” and allowing the hearing to take place before a military tribunal. In other words, Hamdi wouldn’t get a fair trial, as prescribed by the Constitution; he would receive scraps of due process, “a factfinding process” rigged against him. (Eventually, Hamdi renounced his U.S. citizenship and was deported to Saudi Arabia.) Justice Clarence Thomas would’ve let the government hold Hamdi indefinitely, without even a semblance of due process. On the other end of the spectrum, Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by the liberal Justice John Paul Stevens, railed against the plurality’s “Mr. Fix-it Mentality.” He noted that Congress had failed to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, which grants individuals the right to challenge their detention. Unless and until Congress suspends this right—which it can only do “in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety”—the president cannot revoke citizens’ due process. Moreover, Scalia noted, the AUMF does not actually confer the broad detention powers the government claimed. Thus, Hamdi should either have been given a fair trial or released. Scalia was right in Hamdi , and his dissent grew more prescient with time. He was, by no means, a champion of justice for enemy combatants; later, in the Guantanamo cases , he clarified that he believed noncitizens held abroad have no right to habeas corpus. But his dissent from the plurality’s radical interpretation of the AUMF has stood the test of time. By equating the power to use “necessary and appropriate force” with the power of indefinite detention, the Hamdi court handed the executive branch a blank check to keep alleged terrorists imprisoned without trial forever. And that is exactly what they have done. Today, there are about 40 men at Guantanamo, and the federal courts keep rejecting their efforts to leave. Why? Because of Hamdi. Now Breyer seems to have his regrets. In 2014, he raised the possibility that the government had stretched the AUMF too thin by applying the law to a succession of conflicts untethered from its original purpose. And on Monday, when the court refused to hear a new case involving another combatant, he voiced an even stronger objection to the AUMF’s continued rein. O’Connor’s Hamdi opinion, he wrote, warned that if “the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed” the AUMF, the court’s “understanding” of the law’s reach “may unravel.” Monday, Breyer wrote, it is “past time” to decide whether the basis of Hamdi had unraveled: After all, the government “does not state that any end is in sight” to the war on terror. Scalia was right in Hamdi , and his dissent grew more prescient with time. To drive home his point, Breyer noted that the detainee challenging his confinement in the case at hand, Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, has been held in Guantanamo for 17 years. “Al-Alwi,” he concluded, “faces the real prospect that he will spend the rest of his life in detention based on his status as an enemy combatant a generation ago, even though today’s conflict may differ substantially from the one Congress anticipated when it passed the AUMF.” Curiously, Breyer voted with his colleagues not to take al-Alwi’s appeal, instead preferring to wait for “an appropriate case” to revisit Hamdi. (Why isn’t al-Alwi’s case appropriate? Breyer didn’t say.) But if such a case ever arises, Breyer is unlikely to reverse Hamdi ’s damage. Scalia and Stevens, the strange bedfellows who defended habeas corpus, are gone. The court’s Guantanamo swing votes, O’Connor and Kennedy, have resigned, replaced by Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh. Both staunchly oppose rights for Guantanamo detainees. Indeed, while serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh played a leading role hobbling Kennedy’s efforts to bring constitutional protections to Guantanamo. Since Hamdi , in fact, the Supreme Court has allowed an expansion of indefinite detention beyond so-called enemy combatants. In two recent cases , the conservative majority has allowed the Trump administration to detain certain immigrants indefinitely—a development that Breyer decried as betrayal of “our basic values.” With the court’s assent, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is creating an archipelago of Guantanamos where due process has been suspended for immigrants. “I would find it alarming,” Breyer wrote in a 2018 dissent, “to believe that Congress” intended this result. There is a lesson to be gleaned from these awful cases: The power of indefinite detention is a weapon that presidents can wield recklessly and brutally. In Hamdi , the Supreme Court turned over this weapon to the executive branch, which continues to use it in a predictably appalling and arbitrary manner. Congress must repeal the AUMF, as well as any statute—particularly immigration laws—that can arguably be read to allow endless imprisonment. The Supreme Court can no longer be trusted to enforce due process, despite Breyer’s pleas. If Congress doesn’t put a stop to this unconstitutional cruelty, no one will. Support our journalism

Meryl Streep justifies Big Little Lies’ second season.,slate.com,Willa Paskin,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/big-little-lies-season-2-meryl-streep.html,"Jon Stewart Gets Choked Up Criticizing Congressional Inaction on 9/11 First Responders About 12 minutes into the new season of HBO’s Big Little Lies , Meryl Streep brushes her right eye and the most banal thought washed over me with the force of revelation: God damn, Meryl Streep is a great actress. I had initially considered the news of her casting on the show to be a kind of triumphant piece of PR, the TV equivalent of the Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue photo spread. Streep joining the already movie-star-flush cast of Big Little Lies for the former miniseries’ second season was like her taking a seat on a divan next to Reese and Nicole. Whatever work she actually did would presumably be very good—she’s Meryl Streep!—but the real dividends would come this fall, when La Streep was, as always, her impossibly charming self on the awards show circuit. But Streep is better than that—startlingly, arrestingly better—and her work exemplifies the delectable disconnect at the heart of Big Little Lies . Within the story, more is decidedly not more. The haves of Monterey, California—wealthy one percenters as attractive as famous actresses—are swimming in largesse, but while their wealth protects them from certain material hardships and bad interior design, it can’t protect them from abuse, heartbreak, deceptions, stress, whisper campaigns, guilt, or daughters who don’t want to go to college. Outside the story, however, the new Big Little Lies is a decidedly more-is-more proposition: more seasons, more storylines, more sumptuous landscape shots, more movie stars. Streep plays Mary Louise, the superficially mousy, inwardly seething and strange mother of Perry Wright, the abusive rapist whose death at the end of last season trapped the series’ five major characters in the big big lie that animates the second season. Mary Louise is in Monterey to help her daughter-in-law Celeste (Nicole Kidman) with her twin sons, and at home, the two women politely circle one another, their passive-aggressive rapport at odds with the graceful light fixtures. It’s only when Mary Louise bumps into Madeline (Reese Witherspoon) that she relaxes enough to be her genuine, strange self. “You’re very short,” she interrupts herself to observe about Madeline. “I don’t mean it in a negative way. Maybe I do. I find little people to be untrustworthy,” she elaborates, with a little head-shake, as though she’s letting Madeline in on a true secret of her personality. Streep is the real wonder in this scene, but I did also admire the finesse with which the show has worked out a Streep-time-sharing scheme. Presumably when she was cast, both Witherspoon and Kidman, producers on the show, wanted the chance to act with her. Kidman’s Celeste would obviously get time with someone playing her mother-in-law, but the actresses and the series’ writer David E. Kelley had to come up with something a little more creative for Witherspoon’s Madeline. The solution, like the entire second season, works better than it has any right to, a compromise—to create more content, to get Reese and Meryl acting together—that doesn’t feel compromised at all. Witherspoon and Streep’s spiky scenes are the early episodes’ most fun, a structurally and artistically satisfying answer to a power-sharing problem.

While these scenes do gift to the world with the definitional GIF of “active listening,” provided in the form of Witherspoon’s face, Streep steals them outright. With Madeline we see that Mary Louise is more than just the quiet, polite mother-in-law—she’s a weird, blunt, isolated woman whose mood see-saws back and forth like her line readings, regularly giving voice to her interior monologue like a space cadet, and then not apologizing for them, like a boss. Her character is so much more specifically odd —almost ferret like—than the haughty diva turn she could be mailing in with the exact same lines. This brings me back to the eye brush. As their conversation continues, Mary Louise goes on reading Madeline, who strikes her as a “wanter,” the type of person who is never satisfied. Madeline—who certainly is a wanter, and probably knows it—gets defensive. “You don’t have to take it personally,” Mary Louise replies, and swiftly wipes beneath her glasses, almost where the nose pads rest. “I’m a wanter myself.” The gesture is so naturalistic, but so uncommon—actresses do not often fidget with their faces on screen—that it stood out to me. Streep so fully embodies Mary Louise that she can be in her head and her body at the same time, talking and scratching like a real person. But Streep is one of the few actresses about whom you can safely assume her every intonation, her every move is a choice, and likely her choice, however informed by a director, writer, or editor. There’s verisimilitude to her touching her face, but there’s more too. When she says, “I’m a wanter myself. I want my son back” she isn’t just making any old gesture: she’s reaching for where the tears usually are. Just as she’s about to mention her dead son, she instinctively tries to wipe them way. God damn, Meryl Streep is a great actress. "

Pose’s Billy Porter deserves an Emmy: Here’s why.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/billy-porter-pose-emmy-nominations-2019.html,"All the People, Entities, and Cultural Mythologies That Might Be to Blame for Kevin Durant’s Apparent Achilles Tear Pose is far from the only TV show to underutilize its most seasoned or gifted performer, but it might be the first to give that actor so many alternatives to Elizabeth Gilbert’s mantra of “eat, pray, love.” “Live! Work! Pose!” commands Billy Porter, as ballroom emcee Pray Tell, in the opening credits of the FX drama. In one episode: “Dip! Pop! Vogue!” Later: “Pull up! Work hard! Triumph!” But while it’s hard not to notice how often he is relegated to announcing the next category and reading the judges’ scores, it’s equally hard not to notice how Porter manages to make every ball an event, how much energy he injects into every scene he’s in, and how crucial he is to Pose ’s most tragic and most celebratory moments. He may not be the star of this ball, but in episode after episode, he’s the cast member most capable of making the show’s arch dialogue sound not just naturalistic but inevitable. It’s a performance that deserves its own kind of trophy: an Emmy. It sure wouldn’t be lonely on the actor-singer’s mantle. A 25-year veteran of the stage, Porter won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical in 2013 for playing Lola in Kinky Boots as well as a Grammy the following year for the show’s cast album. That means an Emmy would make him only an O away from an EGOT, and the E seems within reach. Though Pose premiered last June, months before last year’s Emmys in September, the academy’s eligibility rules meant that the first season of the show wouldn’t be able to compete until this year’s Emmys. Now, voting for this year’s Emmy nominations begins Monday, with Pose returning Tuesday night to remind everyone just what Porter can do. Porter’s work in Pose includes acting, singing, emceeing, and literally wearing many different hats. There’s also precedent for at least a nomination. Pose was eligible for last year’s Golden Globes, andhe earned a nomination, though the Hollywood Foreign Press Association didn’t give him the win. Perhaps voters didn’t sufficiently appreciate how Porter made the most grounded character on a show also its most enigmatic, or how he was able to straddle the line between the practical and the apocalyptic as Pray Tell considered the devastation of the AIDS crisis in his own life. It’s also possible that Globes voters didn’t recognize the considerable charisma and humanism that Porter brings to his role, so Pray Tell’s haughty reads of the occasional unlucky contestant never feel personal, and hammy insults like “I don’t come to your job knocking dicks out of your mouth” feel like effervescent witticisms. Or maybe it was a category error. Pose doesn’t make the most of Porter, but it probably shouldn’t. Porter stated in a recent Rolling Stone interview that he would be the first queer black man to win Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series. “Awards matter for this little black gay boy,” he said. “If this black queen walks up to take a Best Lead Emmy? That’s the first time it will ever have been done.” And FX is pushing him as a lead , with many awards prognosticators expecting him to get a nod in that category. But Pose is an ensemble drama with trans women at its center. And for as much as Porter does—he acts, sings, emcees, and literally wears many different hats—it’s all in a supporting role. In some ways this is Porter’s fault for making so much of a role that’s often quite tiny, but he shouldn’t be punished for that. Pray Tell is a man who’s fascinatingly big and small. In the ballroom, he’s a godlike, infallible adjudicator of what’s fashionable and what’s not, overseeing the ballroom and the feuds between its houses without ever being a part of it. But in the straight, white world, he’s a cologne spritzer at Macy’s who failed to become the world-famous designer his close friend Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) is convinced he could’ve become, and could become still. (That Macy’s job impresses the hell out of Blanca’s adoptive “kids” anyway.) A lifetime of thoughts flits through Pray Tell’s eyes whenever Blanca mentions the calling he (as far as we know) never pursued, inadvertently salting his wounds. One also senses the ambivalence with which Pray Tell helps parent Blanca’s children. He’s certain he’s got the hard-earned wisdom to guide them, like when he takes three of her “sons” to get tested for HIV. But he also doesn’t have Blanca’s patience or pureness of soul, and he is all the more relatable for it. Even when other characters speak, it’s often Porter whom your eyes travel to, his silence (and physical performance) as expressive as others’ words. But it’s the AIDS storylines in which Porter does his best work: in Pray Tell’s initial fear of getting tested, his denial that his boyfriend, Costas (Johnny Sibilly), is literally on his deathbed, his determination to give Costas and the other patients in the AIDS ward a night of music, and, finally, his allowing himself to fall in love again. By 1988, when the series is set, Pray Tell has been watching loved ones die for years, and we mostly glimpse that terrifying history through Porter’s performance, through this proudly intelligent man’s understandable embrace of ignorance about the status of his own body and this determined fighter’s angry refusal to hope that the plague will ever be conquered. Porter often plays Pray Tell like he’s willing himself to express nothing, attempting to maintain a facade of poise and unflappability. But the actor always shows us all the hurt and thoughts within as well as the mild panic that the world is so much more unpredictable than we can possibly conceive. When he reveals, on top of all that, that he can also belt with the precision of a Broadway veteran , it’s like a second ham on Christmas.

Warriors beat Raptors: Golden State wins thrilling Game 5 but loses Durant.,slate.com,Nick Greene,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/warriors-beat-raptors-golden-state-durant-injury.html,"The 2019 Women’s World Cup Isn’t About Style Points The Golden State Warriors are a team of cockroaches riding Twinkies , and they were wearing full suits of armor as they beat the Toronto Raptors 106-105 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals on Monday night. The series is heading back to Oakland after the Warriors somehow—somehow—overcame a fourth-quarter deficit in Toronto to extend their season. They weren’t indestructible, as Kevin Durant suffered a potentially serious Achilles injury , but they managed to survive. Somehow. Cue the cliches about underestimating the hearts of champions and whatnot. Before that late run, the key moment of the game had occurred early in the second quarter when Durant re-injured his right leg. He hadn’t played since May 8, when he hurt his calf against the Houston Rockets in the second round, and his gutsy Finals return (11 points in 11 minutes) ended with him leaving the arena on crutches . The Warriors could have (should have?) let the game slip right then, but they managed to maintain a six-point lead heading into the half. Kevin Durant appears to aggravate his calf injury and heads to the locker room early in the second quarter. pic.twitter.com/VXu3SmTS8Y — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) June 11, 2019 For expediency’s sake, let’s flash-forward to the fourth quarter with 5:36 on the clock. That’s when Kawhi Leonard somehow avoided picking up a traveling call and dished to Norman Powell for a dunk that pulled Toronto within two. You make the call ... pic.twitter.com/OGNP4cUsTV Leonard then went full MJ (which stands for “ M y word, he’s doing a great J ob ”) and scored 10 straight points to put Toronto up 103-97 with 3:28 remaining. 10 straight points ... Kawhi is seizing the moment! pic.twitter.com/dVj9x4gS8u — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) June 11, 2019 The game was as good as over. Scotiabank Arena was shaking free from its foundation and the fans outside at Jurassic Park were popping celebratory Labatts. Somewhere, Ed Grimley was crying tears of joy. But then the Warriors remembered that they’re those Warriors, a team that can drain threes from Saskatchewan. (Did I mention the game was played in Canada?) Klay Thompson hit from deep, Steph Curry hit another, and then Thompson finished the 9-0 run with a side-step dagger that put the Warriors up for good. SEASON ON THE LINE.

"When His Father Died in a Coal Mine, This Twelve-Year-Old Went to Work in the Same Coal Mine.",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/andrew-chippie-heartwarming-markle-breaker-boy-debt.html,"Andrew Chippie, age 12. Henry Demarest Lloyd Andrew Chippie is only 12 years old, but it’s already clear that he’s a boy who puts family first! As he explained in sworn testimony before the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission in December of 1902, his family was thrown into crisis when an ill-tempered mule kicked out a support beam in a mine operated by the G.B. Markle Company, causing a platform to fall on top of his father and crush him to death. The Markle Company generously paid the Chippies $50 to cover the burial expenses in consideration of his service to the firm, although unfortunately his burial expenses came to more than $50. They also offered Mrs. Chippie, Andrew, and his three siblings six whole months of free rent in the company housing where they resided at the time, plus all the coal the family could eat, in exchange for waiving all rights to legal action or further investigation into the feasibility of mule-proof construction methods. But when Mrs. Chippie, a Hungarian immigrant who speaks very little English, refused to sign the waiver of liability, the family’s rent and coal bills quickly drove them deeply into debt to their father’s former employer and the family’s current landlord. That’s when Andrew sprang into action! Concerned about his family’s financial situation and the well-being of his younger siblings, little Andy dropped out of school after only a year’s education and took a job as a breaker boy at the Markle company’s Drifton colliery, working ten hour days picking impurities out of coal for wages of four cents an hour. The work was difficult, but Andrew never complained about his aching back or the cuts on his hands, out of sheer determination and a child’s love for his siblings, plus also the fact that his boss was in the habit of lifting him into the air by his ears and slamming him back into his seat whenever his work performance was unsatisfactory, and sometimes would throw rocks at him too. But Andrew’s long hard days bent over a conveyor belt dodging rocks and guarding his ears were all worth it when payday rolled around! In May of 1902, the Chippies owed the Markle company $60.09 for rent and coal. Just six months of backbreaking work later, Andy had earned so much that not only did he not receive any take-home pay, but his family owed the Markle Company $88.17, nearly thirty dollars more than they’d owed before the 12-year-old went to work. Just imagine how deeply they would have fallen in debt if not for little Andy’s initiative and stick-to-itiveness! Some commenters have suggested that the Chippies’ situation is more a symptom of systemic flaws than a heartwarming story of triumph over adversity. Clarence Darrow, for instance, placed blame with “the fiendish cruelty of John Markle,” instead of celebrating Andrew’s hard work and indomitable spirit. But Markle is the founder of the John and Mary R. Markle Foundation, which works “ to promote the general good of mankind ” and recently launched the Rework America Business Network in partnership with other general-good-of-mankind-promoters like Archer Daniels Midland , Boeing , Duke Energy , McKinsey & Company , and Walmart , so good luck selling the narrative that he’s the villain here. Plus, Markle is now distantly related to the British royal family , and coal-baron-to-royalty is the kind of Cinderella story Americans love, almost as much as they love the kinds of Cinderella stories where children are pressed into labor after the death of a parent . There’s no bad guy in this story of a brave little boy fighting to help his family: There are only heroes. Darrow also suggests that if the press were to report on the people and conditions that sent Andrew Chippie to the mines, instead of serving our readers whatever paltry comfort we can generate by hyping up individual acts of heroism in the face of systemic injustice, it might be possible to “rake up some muck” and help change those conditions. To that, we say, “Tell it to the judge!” Specifically, tell it to Judge George Gray , who was so moved by Andrew’s testimony that he did the only thing a well-respected political figure who also happened to be the chair of the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission could do: He sent Andy a box of Christmas presents, including a trumpet, a toy ice-wagon, a metallochord, and a new coat! The heartwarming story of Judge Gray saving Christmas was picked up by papers nationwide, as readers thrilled to the prospect of a happy ending for the long-suffering Chippie family. The first federal anti-child labor law was passed more than a decade later (and the first one that stuck, more than a decade after that) after a sustained campaign from activists and journalists alike, but it’d be hard to argue that pack of scolds did more good for children than the toy ice-wagon. Just ask Andrew, who was in tears as he expressed his deep gratitude to the gathered reporters. “I want you to thank Judge Gray for me,” he told them . “If I could write I would do it for myself.” "
Alabama Governor Signs Into Law Chemical Castration Requirement for Some Sex Offenders,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/alabama-governor-signs-law-chemical-castration-requiremen-sex-offender-parole.html,"Warren Passes Sanders in National Poll for First Time as Biden Tells 13-Year-Old to Watch Out for Boys Creeping On Her The state of Alabama has been busy of late fiddling individuals’ reproductive systems. This week, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law a bill that requires certain types of sex offenders to undergo a chemical castration procedure before they are able to be paroled from prison. The procedure will be a prerequisite for sex offenders that have been convicted of sex crimes with minors below the age of 13 years old. The chemical castration required by the new state law is not permanent, it involves receiving medication through injection or taken orally that suppresses the body’s production of testosterone, in theory, reducing one’s sex drive. The legislation defines the procedure as: “the receiving of medication, including, but not limited to, medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment or its chemical equivalent, that, among other things, reduces, inhibits, or blocks the production of testosterone, hormones, or other chemicals in a person’s body.” In most cases, the offender would be responsible for paying for the procedure and would be administered until a judge decides it is no longer necessary. Despite the heinousness of the crime in question, there are pretty serious ethical questions forced procedures, even temporary ones. “It’s not clear that this actually has any effect and whether it’s even medically proven,” Randall Marshall, executive director of the ALCU of Alabama, told AL.com. “When the state starts experimenting on people, I think it runs afoul of the Constitution.” It’s a slippery slope, but castration as a condition of release is one at least a half dozen other states have already bound down, according to NBC News, including California, Florida, Louisiana, Montana, Texas and Wisconsin. “If they’re going to mark these children for life, they need to be marked for life,” state Rep. Steve Hurst, a Republican who sponsored the bill, told NBC affiliate WSFA . “My preference would be if someone does a small infant child like that, they need to die… God’s going to deal with them one day.” Hurst has sponsored similar bills for the last decade, AL.com reports , but was able to get it passed this time around on the next-to-last day of the legislative session."

The Milumia maxi dress looks great for any occasion.,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/milumia-maxi-dress-amazon-summer.html,"Your Kids’ Favorite Authors Tell Them What to Read This Summer The Milumia Women’s Button-Up Split Floral Print Flowy Party Maxi Dress reads like a corny mouthful, a parody of overdescriptive yet somehow sterile ad speak. The women modeling the dozen-plus patterns in which the Milumia maxi is available seem to be going for a look between “ Blue Steel ” and European milkmaid, ending up somewhere in the region of constipated iciness. It’s sold on Amazon, which is something of a … mixed bag when it comes to the quality of clothing, and the reviews range from glowing endorsements like “[This dress] made want to frolic in a meadow” to screeds against the quality of material used and its inability to be washed—arguably a requirement for clothing. And yet, here I am to extoll the virtues of a dress that, as soon as it arrived on my doorstep, became an instant summer staple. The Amazon Dress, as I’ve taken to calling it, is so beautifully versatile that not only have I taken it on almost every trip I’ve taken since buying it, but I’ve ordered another and have my eye on acquiring a third. I was a senior at Northwestern counting down the weeks leading up to graduation when I first saw the Milumia dress on a BuzzFeed roundup of “maxi dresses you can get on Amazon that you’ll actually want to wear.” The issue of money—how much I needed and how much I didn’t have—was a permanent, worrying presence. I had a fellowship lined up in New York with no money to move there. I was staring down a year of trying to scrape by in one of the most expensive cities in the world while working a job that paid a hair under $15 an hour. I had no savings to pay for the myriad costs that come with the privilege of walking past piles of garbage and sitting next to pole-dancing rats on the train. My family still hadn’t finished paying tuition for my last quarter of school, and so I wouldn’t be receiving my diploma at the journalism school’s graduation ceremony—one of three that I had to attend, and none of which I had a dress for. All that is to say that when I saw this cornily marketed dress with mixed reviews, I was both desperate and wholeheartedly convinced that anything would be better than being surrounded by my wealthy classmates while wearing the same dress I graduated high school in. Reader, I completed the purchase. Because it wasn’t eligible for free two-day shipping, there was plenty of time between when I placed the order and when I received the Amazon Dress. Plenty of time for me to experience that intimately familiar regret and trepidation that comes after purchasing clothes online from a new store. But those feelings turned out to be entirely unnecessary. As soon as I shook the Amazon Dress out of its packaging, I knew I would end up buying it in a pattern different from the red-and-white floral one I had chosen. Not because I didn’t like it, but because for a dress so inexpensive, it was truly stunning. The material is thin—breezy but not insubstantial—and the wide skirt drapes elegantly when still. In movement, it does actually make you want to frolic in a meadow like a Disney princess. It’s impossible not to twirl in it, just to see the skirt flare out. The Milumia maxi is a chameleon, blending in perfectly to any situation from work to parties to the beach, and it’s also one of those items that receives boundless compliments in whatever scenario you chose to wear it to. Friends and co-workers whom I’ve inducted into the Order of the Dress have similarly glowing reviews, lauding its ability both to work as a fancy swimsuit cover-up and to gracefully tolerate amateur alterations like trimming the hem if it’s too long. (I’m 5-foot-4, and the medium is just long enough to work with both heels and sneakers.) Though the Milumia dress did shrink the tiniest bit when I first put it through the laundry, I fully chalk that up to the fact that I put it in a laundromat dryer instead of allowing it to air dry. Otherwise, it washes like a champ, and I’ve had plenty of opportunities to test that ability out. For example: I happened to be wearing the Amazon Dress when I, rather stupidly, wore platform sandals to a park and tripped badly enough to require eight stitches on my knee. Even while I was bleeding, a passerby who helped me limp my way to a bench commented on how beautiful the dress was. But importantly, the Amazon Dress ended up being the perfect thing to accidentally maim myself in, because the split front meant I didn’t have to disrobe for the X-ray or suturing process. I eventually healed, and as for the maxi, after a wash, no one was the wiser. If you need a dress this summer that can handle you at your worst while making you look your best, then this one might be worth taking for a spin."
Is Amash’s Resignation From the House Freedom Caucus a Sign He’s Leaving the GOP Entirely to Run Against Trump?,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/amash-impeach-trump-resignation-freedom-house-caucus-2020-presidential-campaign.html,"Warren Passes Sanders in National Poll for First Time as Biden Tells 13-Year-Old to Watch Out for Boys Creeping On Her Republican Rep. Justin Amash has, of late, emerged as his party’s most ardent critic of his party’s president, Donald Trump. In the absence of any GOP outrage to speak of, the 39-year-old Michigan congressman has been extraordinarily outspoken in his increasingly withering critiques of Trump’s behavior as detailed in the Mueller report. Put more simply, Amash is calling Trump’s actions impeachable. On Monday, Amash took another step away from his political base, leaving the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus that Amash himself helped found and that tracks its roots to the Tea Party movement. The decampment comes as Amash’s public rebukes of Trump have made his membership in the conservative group, created in 2015 specifically to push centrist Republican members further to the right, increasingly awkward. Some of the Trumpiest Republicans, like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, call the caucus home. “Justin Amash’s conclusions are poorly informed and fatally flawed and don’t represent the views of any of the Freedom Caucus members that I’m aware of,” Meadows told reporters last month following one of Amash’s critiques of Trump’s apparent obstruction of justice. Following Amash’s very public condemnation of Trump, the Freedom Caucus took an informal vote to exhibit its disagreement with one of its founders but didn’t move to take concrete action to expel him. This week, Amash made the break himself telling CNN, “I have the highest regard for them and they’re my close friends,” but that he “didn’t want to be a further distraction for the group.” Amash still maintains his chairmanship of the Ron Paul–inspired House Liberty Caucus, a far less influential group with libertarian underpinnings. Amash’s departure from the Freedom Caucus raises the question of whether it is the first step in Amash’s departure from the Republican Party altogether. The four-term congressman’s outspokenness has netted him a Trumpy primary challenger in his Grand Rapids district that Amash hasn’t yet committed himself to running for reelection in. Amash has, however, acknowledged mulling a third-party presidential bid, ostensibly as an anti-Trump candidate on the right, for the Libertarian Party."
"Vatican releases global guide to sexuality that calls non-binary gender ""fictitious.""",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/vatican-releases-global-guide-to-sexuality-that-calls-non-binary-gender-fictitious.html,"Warren Passes Sanders in National Poll for First Time as Biden Tells 13-Year-Old to Watch Out for Boys Creeping On Her The Vatican released the church’s 31-page guide to sexuality Monday—titled Male and Female He Created Them —designed to help Catholics and Catholic schools around the world teach and talk about individual sexuality. Sexuality is more and more a topic of open discussion across North America and western Europe, with increasing acceptance of more fluid definitions of individual identity. This development prompted the Vatican to release its first extensive paper on the topic, coinciding with Pride month, which finds that we, the world, are in the midst of an “educational crisis” surrounding sexuality. As you may have guessed from the title of the report, the Vatican is not big on nonbinary thinking. The report described the idea that a spectrum might exist on human sexuality as a fictitious construct and “nothing more than a confused concept of freedom in the realm of feelings and wants.”
The process of identifying sexual identity is made more difficult by the fictitious construct known as “gender neuter” or “third gender”, which has the effect of obscuring the fact that a person’s sex is a structural determinant of male or female identity. Efforts to go beyond the constitutive male-female sexual difference, such as the ideas of “intersex” or “transgender”, lead to a masculinity or feminity that is ambiguous, even though (in a self-contradictory way), these concepts themselves actually presuppose the very sexual difference that they propose to negate or supersede. …
An overall perspective on the situation of contemporary society must form a part of the educational process. The transformation of social and interpersonal relationships “has often waved ‘the flag of freedom’, but it has, in reality, brought spiritual and material devastation to countless human beings, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. “[F]or some Catholic advocates for a more inclusive and understanding approach to L.G.B.T. people, the Vatican document represented a significant step backward,” the New York Times reports . “They warned that the church was inviting discrimination, and that in delivering an anachronistic message on human sexuality, it had apparently decided to take on esoteric theories rather than the lived experiences of L.G.B.T. people.”"

Every month, host Willa Paskin, Slate’s TV critic, takes on a cultural question, object, idea, or habit and speaks with experts, historians, and obsessives to try and figure out where it comes from, what it means, and why it matters. In the late 1970s, a new and unusual concept for a restaurant chain emerged in California—video games plus bad pizza plus animatronic characters. The result was Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza Time Theatre, an immensely popular chain with a pizza rat for a mascot. But the strangeness only starts there. Decoder Ring dives into the formation of Chuck E.

Kevin Durant injury blame assignment.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/kevin-durant-injury-blame-assignment.html,"Kawhi Leonard Killed the Warriors. Then Steph and Klay Brought the Golden State Dynasty Back to Life. On May 8, Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant suffered a non-contact injury to his right leg during Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets. Durant’s body language—he pulled up suddenly while running, seemingly taken aback—called to mind how other basketball players have reacted to tearing an Achilles tendon. The Warriors, however, announced that Durant had strained his calf and could potentially play again before the end of the season. On Monday night, with the Warriors trailing the Toronto Raptors 3–1 in the NBA Finals, Durant returned to the court, scoring 11 points in 12 minutes on the floor. In the second quarter, though, he pulled up awkwardly, limped into a seated position, and then left the game, having sustained what the Warriors say is a (new) Achilles injury—reportedly a tear —to his right leg. Achilles tears can require up to a year of recovery time and have created permanent limitations for some older players. (Durant will be 31 in September.) In sum, this is the worst possible outcome for Durant. So whose fault is it? 1. The Warriors’ medical staff. After the 2018 season, the Warriors’ “head of physical performance and sports medicine” Chelsea Lane left the organization , reportedly because she wanted to be paid more than the team was willing to spend. Her replacement, Rick Celebrini, has an “ impressive resume ” and came recommended by team consultant Steve Nash, whom Celebrini worked with while Nash was becoming a two-time MVP in his 30s. But ESPN’s Rachel Nichols reported after Monday’s game that according to Warriors coach Steve Kerr, team doctors said that Durant “couldn’t get more hurt” by returning to action. Unless Durant’s right Achilles injury was completely unrelated to his right calf injury, it would appear that either the doctors were wrong or Kerr didn’t understand them correctly. (A doctor employed by another team told Bleacher Report’s Howard Beck that, as one might imagine, the calf injury could have made Durant more susceptible to hurting his Achilles. Incidentally, another Warriors forward, Kevon Looney, reaggravated an earlier injury on Monday.) 2. The Warriors’ management. Given the above, there has been speculation that nonmedical personnel in the Warriors organization knew that Durant’s May 8 injury put his Achilles in jeopardy but downplayed the danger in what was either a dishonest or delusional effort to convince themselves—and Durant—that it was reasonable for him to play again. Here’s what Warriors general manager Bob Myers said after Monday’s game: “The initial injury was a calf injury. This is not a calf injury. I’m not a doctor—I don’t know how those are related or not. But it’s a different injury.” Myers tearfully defended the “collaborative decision” to clear Durant to play, describing it as a “thorough” process conducted by “good people,” and said that he took ultimate responsibility for it though he did not believe that anyone was “to blame” for its outcome. Myers also attacked “the people who questioned whether [Durant] wanted to get back to this team,” which leads us to … 3. The press (and Draymond Green). Green was suspended by the Warriors earlier this season for reportedly calling Durant a “bitch.” On June 7, popular Bay Area sports writer Tim Kawakami likewise called Durant’s personal fortitude into question in an Athletic column about the calf injury. While Kawakami said that he did not have any inside information about the extent of Durant’s injury or Durant’s response thereto, he also wrote that it was “unclear” whether Durant had “fought to get back into action” and urged readers to “ask” whether the Warriors would “still be waiting” for the likes of Green, Looney, Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, or Andre Iguodala to return if they’d suffered the same calf problem. A different Athletic writer , meanwhile, cited “sources” in reporting that Durant’s teammates had felt “irritation” after he practiced before Game 4 but did not play. Durant is famously sensitive to criticism , and perhaps the swirling questions about his toughness motivated him to return prematurely. 4. You, the narrative-loving sports fan. It’s not just writers who celebrate athletes who play hurt. The Knicks’ Willis Reed—who played 27 minutes in Game 7 of the 1970 Finals with a badly torn thigh muscle—became immortal by putting his health at risk for the sake of his team. Durant knows who Willis Reed is, and he knows sports heroes don’t sit out Game 5 of the NBA Finals with a “strain.” (Jalen Rose had a good riff on this idea on ESPN, noting that the people who are now looking for a culprit to blame for Durant’s injury are in many cases the same ones who were excited to see him put his leg at risk for the sake of an inspirational storyline on Monday. Guilty!) 5. Durant and his personal representatives. No one forced Durant to play on Monday, and the people with the ultimate formal responsibility for protecting his health and career interests are Durant and his agent (Rich Kleiman). He could’ve told the team that, as the only person who knows what his own body feels like, he was not comfortable on the floor. (Of course, personally making the call to sit out would’ve invited even more pressure and criticism, as Durant no doubt knows from following the story of the lingering quadriceps injury that ultimately destroyed the relationship between Toronto star Kawhi Leonard and his previous team, the San Antonio Spurs.) 6. Nobody. This is Bob Myers’ position, and one that Deadspin has latched onto as well . Maybe Durant and the Warriors followed every guideline for diagnosing and rehabbing an injured calf, made an informed decision to assume a certain amount of risk of further injury in exchange for the increased likelihood of achieving a professional goal, and simply rolled the wrong number on the dice. Obviously I’m kidding about that last one. Someone needs to take the fall here, perhaps the venture capital jerk who pushed Kyle Lowry. Ban him again?"

Trump’s evangelical foreign policy doctrine.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-evangelical-foreign-policy-pence-pompeo.html,"Who Will Replace Theresa May as Prime Minister? The Trump administration’s foreign policy really isn’t consistent enough to be placed into any single ideological camp. The president is an isolationist critic of military engagement who has repeatedly let hawks like John Bolton and Marco Rubio drive policies that depend on the threat of military force. Administration surrogates use human rights rhetoric to criticize the governments of Venezuela, Iran, and China (including an unexpectedly strong statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre this week) while the president defends and praises the most brutal dictator in the world. The Pentagon warns of a world defined by “ great power competition ,” while the president seems convinced that Russia has nothing but good intentions . The administration hates multilateral security alliances except when it’s trying to create new ones . Its Mideast strategy is guided by a single-minded focus on countering Iran, except when it’s not . This incoherence makes it hard for foreign governments to make sense of the administration’s intentions, and it means that almost none of Washington’s foreign policy camps feel very happy right now. I say almost because there is one group that’s consistently and effectively—if quietly—pushing its foreign policy agenda in Donald Trump’s Washington: evangelical Christians. It’s not great for the long-term stability of the worldto have U.S. foreign policy become an extension of America’s culture wars. Politico reported late last month that the State Department is launching a new “Commission on Unalienable Rights” to advise Pompeo and provide “fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights.” Details about the panel are still sketchy—and there’s certainly room for “fresh thinking about human rights discourse”—but human rights activists fear that in this context, “natural” means “God-given” and could entail providing less support for programs promoting reproductive rights and protections for LGBTQ people. The concept note outlining the commission was written by Robert George , a Princeton professor and co-founder of the anti-gay National Organization for Marriage. The influence of evangelical priorities is already spreading through the Trump administration’s diplomacy. In April, the U.S. threatened to veto a U.N. resolution condemning the use of rape as a weapon of war because of its language on reproductive and sexual health, which Trump officials felt normalized sexual activity and condoned abortion. The administration succeeded in moving Germany, the resolution’s sponsor, to water down that language. According to reporting by Foreign Policy , American instruction to push back on the resolution came via a cable from Pompeo’s office. In his first week in office, Trump reauthorized the Mexico City Policy, also known as the global gag rule, a Reagan-era rule that blocks foreign nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion counseling or referrals from receiving U.S. funding. (American funds were already barred from being used to carry out abortions.) The rule was rescinded under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and restored under George W. Bush, and any Republican administration probably would have restored it, too, but Trump has dramatically expanded it . Originally applying to just family planning funds, the rule now applies to all U.S. health aid, affecting nearly $8.8 billion in funds. In March of this year, Pompeo announced a further expansion of the policy, withholding funding from NGOs that give money to othergroups that provide abortions. A recent report by the International Women’s Health Coalition looked at the impact of the policy on care, finding that in many countries it has led to the balkanization of health providers, with groups adhering to the gag rule wary of collaboration with those that are not. The rule is also overenforced; many health care providers don’t know exactly what it covers and have grown wary of providing any family planning services at all for fear of losing their funding. It’s not only traditional cultural issues where the evangelical influence can be felt. The Trump administration’s steadfast support for Israel, and in particular the controversial 2017 move to recognize Jerusalem as the country’s capital, is motivated at least in part by the political influence of American evangelicals, who these days are more enthusiastic and unified in their support of the Jewish state than Jews are. In a telling moment suggesting the policy’s intended audience, evangelical pastors Robert Jeffress and John Hagee were invited to the dedication of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem last year despite past statements suggesting, respectively, that Jews are destined for hell and that God sent Hitler to help Jews return to Israel. If this makes some American Jewish supporters of Israel nervous, it doesn’t seem to bother Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been cultivating U.S. evangelical support since the ’90s and still does so. In a recent interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Pompeo raised some eyebrows by agreeing with the interviewer’s premise that “President Trump right now has been sort of raised for such a time as this, just like Queen Esther, to help save the Jewish people from an Iranian menace.” Pompeo is often dismissed by the Trump administration’s critics as a mere yes man, carrying out the president’s erratic whims, in contrast to the more hard-headed and ideological John Bolton. But it seems shortsighted to ignore the role of faith —he became a devoted Christian while studying at West Point—in his priorities and decision-making. He has told interviewers that the Bible “informs everything I do” and has made religion a centerpiece of several of his most prominent speeches, including the address in Cairo in January that served as a rebuke of Obama’s famous 2009 speech on America and the Muslim world. From a human rights perspective, the evangelical influence in the Trump administration has at times been beneficial. American Christian activists and media highlighted the case of Andrew Brunson , the American pastor arrested on trumped-up charges as part of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, long before it got much coverage in the mainstream media. And evangelical leaders including Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. James Lankford helped to apply pressure that led to Brunson’s eventual release. And to its credit, the Trump administration’s emphasis on religious liberty has not been solely concerned with persecuted Christians. Pompeo has spoken out strongly and consistently against the persecution of the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myanmar and the mass detention of China’s Uighurs . But not all human rights get the same attention. Conveniently for the administration, polls show that white evangelical Protestants are the group least likely to think that the U.S. has a responsibility to welcome refugees. And while Trump did recently refer to a campaign launched by Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell—the highest ranking openly gay person in the administration—to combat the criminalization of homosexuality, the administration also quietly eliminated the position of LGBTQ envoy (created under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ) and this month denied the requests of embassies to fly rainbow flags for Pride Month . U.S. officials also have been pushing to strike the word gender ” from U.N. human rights documents, arguing that it suggests gender is a choice rather than a biological fact. To applause from religious-right leaders , the White House has enthusiastically embraced Brazil’s new president Jair Bolsonaro, a racist, homophobic, right-wing Christian ideologue who casts his enemies as agents of “ cultural Marxism .” Finally, it’s probably not beneficial to the long-term stability of the Middle East to have U.S. foreign policy in the hands of people who view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the threat from Iran in apocalyptic, biblical terms. Likewise, as I wrote recently , it’s not great for the long-term stability of the world to have U.S. foreign policy become an extension of America’s culture wars. But that’s a reality that other governments are going to have to adapt to. For all the apparent chaos of America’s actions around the world these days, and the venality of the man in the Oval Office, it’s still a country that strongly believes it has God on its side."
Congress Needs to Give Itself a Raise,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/business/2019/06/congress-cost-of-living-raise-democrats.html,"I Just Ended a Secret Affair. The Problem: He Was So Much Better in Bed Than My Husband. This week, Democrats in Congress are in a bit of turmoil over whether to give themselves, and their staffers, a raise. Salaries for senators, representatives, and top aides haven’t gone up in a decade, and this year, lawmakers from both parties made a quiet deal to finally allow a modest cost-of-living increase. But a group of freshman Democrats from competitive districts threw a fit, worried that giving themselves a pay hike would be politically unpopular back home, and the bill got pulled from committee . Hopefully, this is just a temporary hiccup, and the raise will eventually happen. By refusing to increase pay for themselves or their employees, members of Congress are making a shallow, self-destructive gesture that fuels the revolving door between Capitol Hill and the lobbying industry. Worse yet, it gives symbolic credence to the insidious conservative argument that government should be operated on the cheap. Skittish Democrats need to get over their fear of attack ads and treat themselves, and their army of underpaid aides, to better pay. In theory, congressional salaries are supposed to be automatically adjusted every year to keep up with the cost of living. But lawmakers voted to freeze their pay at the height of the Great Recession in 2009 and have continued to do so ever since. Currently, most senators and representatives earn $174,000 per year (members of leadership make more; the speaker of the House takes home the most, earning $223,000). Adjusted for inflation, that’s about 15 percent less than 10 years ago. For most Americans, this would still be a fine, upper-middle-class living. And for politicians who’ve already earned a fortune in their previous career, it doesn’t make much of a difference. But members who aren’t independently wealthy are stuck paying for housing in high-rent Washington while supporting their families back in their districts. It’s pretty rare for members of Congress to give up their seats explicitly so they can go cash in on their political experience (the one recent exception I can think of is former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz). For the most part, lawmakers tend to hang around until voters boot them out of office. But spending years earning a mere fraction of what they could as a partner at some law firm almost certainly motivates some of them to look for a lobbying (or lobbying-esque) gig once their political careers are finally over. You can pop over to OpenSecrets.org for a long list of former lawmakers who’ve whirled through the revolving door. Some, like former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, have been extremely successful at it. Others have been less so—former Cosmo centerfold and Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown only spent a hot second at the firm Nixon Peabody before moving on to other things. You know what list is much longer, though? The directory of ex- staffers who’ve done time on K Street. Congress is only as good as its aides, who research issues and write the legislation members vote on. And right now, those staffers are vastly underpaid compared with what they are worth in the private sector, which means those with a reasonable amount of experience have a massive incentive to turn lobbyist. The top salary for a congressional staffer has been wedged at $168,000 dollars since 2009. The median chief of staff made $155,637 last while, while the median office counsel earned just $72,333 last year, down from $75,502 in 2010. To put that pay in perspective, a first year attorney at a large law firm can currently bring home $190,000 . You could try and ban staffers from taking lobbying jobs, of course, but if that even works, that will simply reduce the incentive for talented people to go into government in the first place. In the end, if you want any hope whatsoever of slowing down the revolving door, you need to pay people what they’re worth, so they’ll stay in public service. Instead, by refusing to give people normal cost-of-living increases, Congress has ensured that it will continue to bleed talent. Low pay doesn’t only make it impossible to keep good staffers around. It also almost certainly keeps a lot of talented people from going to work on Capitol Hill in the first place. Right now, the minimum pay for a legislative correspondent—basically the first step on the career ladder for a lot of policy professionals—is $35,833. If you have student loans, or don’t have financial help from your family, it can be very, very hard to make that kind of salary work in Washington, and that pushes a lot of people toward opportunities elsewhere. The problem isn’t just that Congress doesn’t pay its people enough, though—it’s that Congress doesn’t pay enough people, period. Because it has consistently starved itself of financial resources, Congress had fewer staff in 2016 —the most recent report I could find—than at any time since 1979. Many of the personnel cuts happened in the mid-1990s, after Republicans swept into power on an anti-government platform. But Congress also passed major reductions to its staff budgets between 2010 and 2013 as well. All of this is part and parcel of an ideology that says government is inherently wasteful and should be run on the absolute least amount of money possible. It leads to a poisonous place where Congress doesn’t have the resources necessary to competently execute basic parts of its job like conduct oversight or writing bills, and lobbyists can effectively craft legislation because they’re the ones with the expertise. (This is something you see regularly on the state level, where legislators are sometimes part time and have to work with threadbare staffs.) And it’s not all that different from problems at agencies like the IRS or SEC, where relatively poorly paid civil servants don’t have the basic resources necessary to audit the rich or actually police the markets and end up toadying up to their future employers, which increases everybody’s cynicism in government as a whole. Giving into this dynamic makes precisely zero sense for Democrats, who in theory stand for the idea of active government. As Vox’s Matt Yglesias put it on Twitter: We’re trapped in a terrible cycle of underinvesting in Congress because Congress is unpopular so then congress gets worse. https://t.co/ybX26wFPjA — Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) June 11, 2019 The only answer is to break that cycle by standing up for the idea that it’s worth paying for good government and upping pay on Capitol Hill. If members of Congress are too timid to give themselves a raise, they should at least do it for their staffs."
