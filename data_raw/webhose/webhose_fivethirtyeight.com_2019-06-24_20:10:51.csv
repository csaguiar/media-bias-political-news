Are Blowout Presidential Elections A Thing Of The Past? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Geoffrey Skelley,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-blowout-presidential-elections-a-thing-of-the-past/,"Twitter
These days, Americans are pretty divided when it comes to politics. Opinions about President Trump are like night and day — Democrats loathe him, and Republicans love him. And political disagreements show up all over the place, including decisions about where to live . Naturally, these divides are reflected in elections, perhaps most noticeably in presidential contests, since voters turn out in greater numbers for them than any other races in the U.S.
If we look at the national popular vote margin of presidential elections since the end of the Civil War — the period in which the current two-party system largely took form (though the parties have certainly changed politically over the years) 1 — we are currently living in the most competitive era of presidential politics.
The 2016 contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was the eighth consecutive presidential race in which the national popular vote margin was smaller than 10 percentage points. That is, in every presidential election from 1988 to 2016, the difference between the vote shares of the Democratic and Republican nominees was in the single digits. That’s the longest stretch of such elections since the Civil War, surpassing a run of seven straight single-digit margins from 1876 to 1900.
In the recent string of close elections, there have been two in which the nominee who won the national popular vote didn’t win the Electoral College — 2000 and 2016 . Before 2000, the last time a candidate had won the popular vote but not the Electoral College was in 1888 .
Now, some might not consider a large single-digit margin — such as Barack Obama’s 7-point win in 2008 — to be “close.” But it’s worth noting that out of 21 presidential elections from 1904 to 1984 — or the time between these two competitive periods — only nine had margins in the single digits. The other 12 were double-digit blowouts.
What was behind the competitiveness of presidential elections in the late 19th century and our current time? Most obviously, both eras featured high levels of political polarization and partisanship. According to VoteView.com , the largest ideological gaps between the two parties in Congress occurred at the end of the 19th century and around our present time. And recent data from the Pew Research Center shows that the American public has been becoming more politically polarized. Other research has found twin peaks in partisanship in the late 19th century and the current era, with highly nationalized elections that exhibited consistent voting patterns from state to state. It’s no coincidence that Electoral College maps in both periods often looked very similar from election to election.
Whether you like it or not, we are living in the longest era of highly competitive elections since the Civil War. Partisanship is strong , and opinions of the president are deeply polarized. This might be a sign that the 2020 presidential election will be close — and that the streak of single-digit margins in recent elections will continue. Footnotes
Technically, Democrats and Republicans first faced off in a presidential election in 1856 , but the 1860 and 1864 elections are difficult to include in an electoral analysis. In 1860, the Democratic Party split in two over the issue of slavery; in 1864, the Civil War was happening, so 11 states that had seceded from the Union were not included.

The Movement To Skip The Electoral College Is Picking Up Steam | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Nathaniel Rakich,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-movement-to-skip-the-electoral-college-is-picking-up-steam/,"Twitter
UPDATE (May 30, 2019, 2:38 p.m.): Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak vetoed Nevada’s National Popular Vote bill on Thursday, saying it “could diminish the role of smaller states like Nevada in national electoral contests.” Unless the veto is overridden, Nevada will not join the National Popular Vote interstate compact this year.
The effort to bypass the Electoral College and choose the president via the national popular vote has historically seemed like a long shot. But after an impressive string of legislative victories this year, maybe it should be taken more seriously.
The National Popular Vote initiative aims to create an interstate compact to effectively “abolish” the Electoral College without amending the Constitution. States that join the compact agree to award their electoral votes not to the candidate who wins that state, but to the candidate who wins the national popular vote. (States can do this because there is no national law dictating how they should award their electoral votes; indeed, the Constitution explicitly leaves it to state legislatures to decide.) However, the compact will go into effect only when the states that have signed on are worth 270 electoral votes — enough to ensure that the popular vote winner wins the election.
In the 13 years since the initiative started, support for joining the compact has largely been limited to Democratic-leaning states, probably because the two times in recent history when the Electoral College winner lost the popular vote, the split benefited the Republican candidate. By the end of 2018, the compact had been joined by 12 jurisdictions (11 states and the District of Columbia) that were worth a combined 172 electoral votes. But all of them were safe Democratic jurisdictions, and supporters of the initiative had almost run out of blue states to sign up. There was little indication that they could conscript the purple or red states that the compact needs to take effect.
But then 2019 happened. The compact found three additional states willing to sign on, with three more seemingly on the cusp of doing so. And unlike previous years, the new and pending members include some hard-fought presidential swing states.
Already this year, Colorado (worth nine electoral votes), Delaware (three electoral votes) and New Mexico (five electoral votes) have joined the initiative, bringing it up to 15 signatories and 189 electoral votes. And three more have a good chance of signing on (which would bring the total to 18 signatories and 206 electoral votes): The state Senate in Oregon (seven electoral votes) gave its approval last month. The House seems likely to follow suit, considering that it passed similar legislation four times in the past decade , and Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s office has indicated that she supports it. The state Senate in Maine (four electoral votes) passed the compact on May 14, sending it to the Democratic-controlled state House. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has not publicly taken a position on the legislation, however. In Nevada (six electoral votes), the compact has passed both chambers of the legislature and is awaiting Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak’s signature. However, he has not said whether he will sign it.
If even one of those states signs on to the compact, 2019 will be the year with the highest number of states to join the movement since it began in 2006. But which states are joining is just as significant as how many. Colorado and Nevada demonstrate that even hotly contested presidential swing states might be willing to join. And that Delaware and Oregon, two Democratic-leaning states, 1 are signing on after years of inaction suggests that the pressure to pass the legislation is growing. For example, Oregon state Senate President Peter Courtney, who had blocked passage of a National Popular Vote bill in the state for years, relented this year.
But the compact has still only enlisted states where Democrats have had free rein to pass legislation. Democrats have full control of state government in all six states that either have passed or could realistically pass the compact this year. If the compact passes in Maine, Nevada and Oregon, every single state where the legislature and governorship are currently controlled by Democrats will have joined. And assuming that most Republican lawmakers continue to oppose the National Popular Vote movement, Democrats will have to sweep state elections in some tricky states in upcoming cycles for the compact to reach 270.
What states might those be?
Democrats control the governorship in Virginia, which is holding state legislative elections this fall . If they successfully flip the state Senate and House of Delegates, the compact could increase its electoral vote count by 13.
Then, in the 2020 elections, Democrats have a realistic shot at taking power in Minnesota (where they currently lack control of only the state Senate) and New Hampshire (the governorship), with Michigan and North Carolina as dark horses . That’s 45 more electoral votes. At that point, the compact would have amassed a total of 264 electoral votes, just shy of the 270 needed for the compact to (theoretically) go into effect. One snag here: It’s likely that some of the states that have passed the compact will lose some electoral votes after the 2020 census. Current estimates suggest that, under this scenario, reapportionment would leave the compact around 10 votes short heading into the 2022 elections.
So that year, supporters of the National Popular Vote campaign would need to capture just one more midsize state — in my view, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are the most plausible targets. The problem is that it’s unlikely that both the 2020 and 2022 elections will be good cycles for Democrats, so flipping all, or even most, of the states above is a tall order.
In the meantime, the compact could encounter other obstacles. Republicans could recapture full control of one (or more) of the states in the compact and repeal the National Popular Vote law. And if the compact began to look like it was really going to take effect, opponents would likely sue and claim that it is unconstitutional . So despite its successes in 2019, the National Popular Vote interstate compact remains a highly uncertain proposition in the long term. From ABC News: Footnotes
Delaware has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+14, and Oregon has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+9. FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric is the average difference between how a state votes and how the country votes overall, with 2016 presidential election results weighted at 50 percent, 2012 presidential election results weighted at 25 percent and results from elections for the state legislature weighted at 25 percent. Note that the partisan leans in this article were calculated before the 2018 elections; we haven’t calculated FiveThirtyEight partisan leans that incorporate the midterm results yet.

Why Democrats Struggle To Mobilize A ‘Religious Left’ | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Amelia Thomson-Deveaux,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-struggle-to-mobilize-a-religious-left/,"Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGES
For the past four decades , the notion that religious beliefs should guide voters’ decision-making has been largely monopolized by the Republican Party. But the partisan “God gap” hasn’t gone unnoticed by some religious Democrats , who have urged candidate after candidate to make appeals to religious values and beliefs in the hope of turning the “religious left” into a politically relevant force . And as the 2020 Democratic primary ramps up, there’s already speculation that the right candidate could tap a long-dormant reserve of religious energy among Democratic voters.
First Cory Booker — who was literally anointed by his pastor ahead of his presidential announcement — was touted as a possible candidate of the “religious left.” Then Pete Buttigieg stepped in to claim that mantle, telling reporters that the left “need to not be afraid to invoke arguments that are convincing on why Christian faith is going to point you in a progressive direction.” Meanwhile, several other presidential hopefuls, including Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand , are all talking openly about their religion on the campaign trail, even making arguments for why their policy positions — whether it’s abortion rights or income inequality — are linked to their faith.
And to some extent, forging connections between faith and politics makes sense for Democratic candidates — a majority of Democratic primary voters are religious. But there are several big hurdles facing any Democrat looking to use the language of faith to marshal voters in the primary. For one thing, the Democratic coalition isn’t dominated by a single religious group. And Democrats don’t prioritize religion the way Republicans do — in fact, the Democratic Party has been growing steadily less religious over the past 20 years. Certain groups of religious voters — in particular, black Protestants — will likely play an important role in the primary, and there may be some room for candidates to appeal to religious moderates. But in a diverse and increasingly secular party, religious rhetoric alone may not get the candidates very far. Democrats are religious, but religiously diverse
Religious Democrats may not get as much attention as their counterparts on the right, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. About 65 percent of Democratic primary voters in 2016 reported having some kind of religious affiliation, compared to 84 percent of Republican primary voters. But as the chart below shows, religious voters in each party may not have much else in common. Republicans are fairly racially and religiously homogeneous: In 2016, the vast majority (70 percent) of Republican primary voters were white Christians, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study . 1 Religious Democrats, by contrast, are much more diverse — 31 percent are white Christians, 22 percent are nonwhite Christians, and 12 percent belong to a non-Christian religious group (Jews, Muslims, Hindus, etc.) or say that their religious affiliation is “something else.”
The result is that Democratic candidates are trying to reach a smaller and more splintered religious audience than Republican candidates are targeting in their own primary. “Talking about religion is a much more complicated task when you’re trying to simultaneously address white Catholics and black Protestants and Muslim and Jewish Americans,” said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI, a research organization that studies religion and politics. “They may not have all that much in common, other than the fact that they identify as religious, which makes them harder to appeal to and organize.”
And while talking about religion can be a good strategy for gaining media attention , there’s little evidence that it’s translating into actual gains among religious voters — at least, not yet. A Morning Consult tracking poll conducted May 20-26 among Democratic primary voters found that Joe Biden, a Catholic , has a commanding lead among all major religious groups, followed in all but one case by Bernie Sanders, 2 who may be the only candidate in the race to say he doesn’t participate in organized religion .
“It’s hard to go up against Biden because he appeals to moderate Catholics and Protestants — he’s from their world,” said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University who studies religion and politics. And according to the 2016 CCES survey, moderate Democratic primary voters are more likely to be religious than their liberal counterparts, so if Biden is also appealing to moderates , that could compound the challenge for his opponents. “If Biden is capturing most of the moderates, there just aren’t that many religious voters left to scoop up,” Burge said. Democrats have gotten a lot less religious
And even though a substantial number of Democrats are religious, they have come to make up a smaller and smaller subset of the party. Over the past two decades, the share of people in the Democratic coalition who don’t identify with any religion doubled, from 14 percent in 1998 to 28 percent in 2018, according to the General Social Survey . 3 The result is that today’s Democratic Party is increasingly secular, which complicates and limits traditional forms of faith outreach. “This emerging group of secular Democrats coexists a little uneasily with the more religious wing of the party,” said David Campbell, a political science professor at Notre Dame and the coauthor of “ American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us .” “It’s a sizeable portion of the electorate to ignore, but I think the party has yet to figure out how to appeal to these people.”
Now to be clear, most of the religiously unaffiliated don’t reject religion outright, so candidates who focus on faith may not run any serious risk of alienating these voters. In fact, according to the 2016 CCES data, only 9 percent of Democratic primary voters said they were atheists, while 8 percent said they were agnostics and 18 percent identified as “nothing in particular.” And notably, voters who fell into this last category were still surprisingly connected to organized religion. About half of these Democrats said they still attend church occasionally, and 37 percent said that religion is at least somewhat important in their lives.
However, the fact that Democrats are becoming less religious does mean that religiously-based appeals might not take candidates very far in the primary, or at least not as far as they once might have. Plus, like so many other aspects of our personal identities, there is evidence that Americans’ religious selves are increasingly shaped by our partisan allegiances, with Republicans becoming more religious and Democrats less so. Michele Margolis, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “ From Politics to Pews: How Partisanship and the Political Environment Shape Religious Identity ,” found that white Democrats are drifting away from religion because of their politics, which means religion may not be as influential politically as it was in the past. “Religion hasn’t evolved to be a cue for religious voters on the left the way it has for religious voters on the right,” Margolis said. “If you live in a world where being a Democrat is equated with being less religious, and religion also isn’t central to your life, why should someone using religious rhetoric appeal to you?” Religion may not rule Democrats’ vote choice
If there remains an obvious opportunity for some version of the religious left to emerge, it would be among black and Hispanic 4 Democratic primary voters, who were significantly more likely than white Democrats to say that religion is somewhat or very important in their lives in the 2016 CCES survey.
And black Protestants are already quite powerful in the party. As FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver wrote earlier this year, black voters (who are overwhelmingly likely to be Christian ) constitute about one-fifth of the Democratic electorate and have a long and deep alliance with the Democratic establishment, making them a key constituency in the primary. According to the CCES, the vast majority of black Protestants and nearly three-quarters of Hispanic Catholics voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
And while it’s possible to imagine some kind of religious coalition emerging among Democrats of color, there aren’t any obvious issues that could unify black and Hispanic voters who are driven by their religious convictions, the way that abortion and same-sex marriage united white Protestants and Catholics on the right . Campbell also pointed out that many white Christian conservatives are motivated by a shared sense of religious embattlement or alienation — or the idea that their Christian values are being shoved to the margins or stamped out entirely by a rising tide of secularism. “They’re driven to get involved in politics because they see their Christian identity and Christianity’s place in American life as being under attack,” he said. “On the political left, certainly there’s a lot of talk of values being under attack, but it’s not framed in terms of an existential threat to your religious identity.”
But Democrats still ignore their party’s most religious voters at their peril, said Michael Wear, who directed faith outreach for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. He and other Democratic faith advisers have criticized Hillary Clinton’s campaign for failing to engage seriously with religious communities like white Midwestern Catholics or black Protestants. But he added that he’s waiting to see whether the 2020 candidates start building up an infrastructure for reaching religious leaders and groups. “Rhetoric can be powerful, but you also need relationships and outreach,” he said. “You can’t just talk about your religious identity on TV.” This outreach, Wear said, has to be careful and sincere. As even for highly religious Democrats, religion is still just one factor among many they’ll use to choose a candidate.
As the campaign continues, we’ll learn more about the candidates’ approach to faith — especially whether they prioritize outreach to religious voters in states like Iowa and South Carolina , where religion is likely to be a more important issue than in a relatively secular state like New Hampshire . But while mobilizing specific subgroups of religious Democrats will still be important, the dream of building a cohesive religious voting bloc on the left looks more distant by the year. Democrats may not have much to lose by talking about faith and values — but it may not offer them much of a reward among primary voters either.
CORRECTION: (May 29, 2019, 12:35 p.m.): An earlier version of the third chart in this story used incorrectly sized bars for the “White” and “Other” categories, though the numbers displayed were correct. The chart has been updated. Footnotes
The CCES is a poll of more than 50,000 voters conducted by YouGov in conjunction with Harvard University. We specifically looked at the nearly 40,000 voters in the CCES sample who voted in either the Republican or Democratic primaries in 2016.
Elizabeth Warren edged out Sanders among Jewish voters.
The GSS is run by NORC at the University of Chicago and has been polling Americans since 1972, which allowed us to chart how religious affiliation has changed in the Democratic Party over several decades. (The CCES only goes back to 2006). But because of how the GSS counts religiously unaffiliated people, the percentage of unaffiliated Democrats is slightly lower in the GSS data than in the CCES data. While the CCES offers respondents “Nothing in particular” as an option for describing their religious affiliation (in addition to “Atheist” and “Agnostic”), the GSS just offers various religions and “None.”
Data uses race categories from the CCES, which includes “Hispanic” as a race. But Hispanic is also an ethnicity that can include people of any race. We grouped respondents based only on what race they selected, which means people of Hispanic origin may be included in categories other than “Hispanic.”

This Is The First NBA Finals In 9 Years Without LeBron. A Lot Has Changed. | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Neil Paine,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-is-the-first-nba-finals-in-9-years-without-lebron-a-lot-has-changed/,"LeBron James is not in the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010. Yong Teck Lim / Getty Images
When Lamar Odom heaved the ball down-court to drain away what seconds remained between the 2010 Los Angeles Lakers and a championship, few realized that it marked the start of a new era. The period that followed was defined by who wasn’t in L.A. that June night: LeBron James. For each of the next eight seasons, a James-led team would make the NBA Finals — a streak of contesting the championship that won’t technically end until Thursday’s Game 1 between the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors.
As the confetti filled the Staples Center air, there was little sense of just how profoundly the game was about to change — some changes because of James himself, others just moving on a parallel track to the game’s biggest star. With the benefit of hindsight, then, let’s take a look at exactly how many huge developments have transpired across the league since the last time we had an NBA Finals without LeBron James.
From ABC News: LeBron’s GOAT turn
Going into the summer of 2010, James’s future was as uncertain as it would ever be. He had just suffered the most high-profile failure of his career , inexplicably struggling as his Cleveland Cavaliers were bounced from the second round of the playoffs by the Boston Celtics. He faced a looming free-agency “ decision ” — would he betray his hometown Cavs? — and persistent questions about whether he could lead a championship team. Statistically, James’s career was off to a stellar start, but by the NBA’s ring-obsessed standards , his path toward GOAT status was wobbling.
Nearly a decade later, James is still not universally hailed as the greatest ever. (Michael Jordan’s shadow looms large.) But he is generally placed right in the conversation with MJ. He answered postseason critics with eight straight conference titles and three rings, including one that involved: a) one of the greatest NBA Finals comebacks ever ; b) upsetting the winningest regular-season team in history; and c) ending Cleveland’s 52-year championship drought . At the same time, James has climbed up the all-time statistical mountain in countless categories, including passing Jordan on points in March. If James isn’t the GOAT, he has at least become the defining player of his generation — and in some ways, he even redefined the role of a superstar and the criteria we use to judge all-time greats. The rise of the Warriors
The 2009-10 Golden State Warriors won only 26 games and got their coach, Don Nelson, fired. (The team would go through two more coaches before finding current boss Steve Kerr.) Few vestiges of Nelson’s 2006-07 “We Believe” Warriors — the franchise’s high-water mark for postseason success since the early 1990s — were still on the roster anyway. Newcomer Stephen Curry finished second in Rookie of the Year voting but gave scarcely any clues that he’d eventually become a transformational player . Klay Thompson and Draymond Green were still 20-year-old college kids. From these not-so-promising beginnings, the single greatest dynasty in basketball history 1 would be formed.
Every dynasty requires a series of unlikely breaks to fall its way, but it’s difficult to overstate just how surprising it was that Golden State would barge into an NBA championship club that included just eight franchises (the Celtics, Bulls, Pistons, Rockets, Lakers, Heat, 76ers and Spurs) hoarding the 31 titles up for grabs from 1980 through 2010. Before they added Kevin Durant in free agency, the Warriors were a testament to the power of drafting home-grown stars and locking them up on team-friendly contract extensions . After inking Durant, they became the scariest collection of talent ever assembled. And it would all come completely out of the blue, from the perspective of a neutral observer in the summer of 2010. The superteam craze gets crazier
In conjunction with James’s emergence as arguably the best player ever (see above), he also helped usher in an era of star players dictating the direction of the league on their own terms. The Age of the Superteam had already gotten underway with the 2008 Boston Celtics’ title-winning team-up between Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen. But James pushed the trend even further when he joined forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to form a trio of prime-age superstars on the 2011 Miami Heat . Ever since, most of the game’s highest-profile moves have been designed to either counterbalance or mimic James’s original flight of fancy made good.
The league’s power balance, of course, has almost always been about an ever-escalating arms race between Big Twos and Threes. The difference this decade has been about who gets to choose both how and where those combinations form. Encouraged by a salary structure that prioritizes nonmonetary benefits and empowered by what strange quirks of the system do arise , superstars ( and their agents ) have become every bit as powerful in team-building as general managers. You can’t fault them for it, either: Rings are how players are judged , and star recruiting is the most sensible path to a title in the NBA . This was bound to happen eventually — and the past decade has only solidified the trend. Pacing and spacing
The Warriors didn’t just break the mold of dynasty-building — they helped redefine how a championship team plays the game. Before Curry and Co., the conventional wisdom was that a team who lives by the 3-pointer would eventually die by it before the playoffs ended. During the 2015 playoffs, former Lakers coach Phil Jackson famously tweeted a critique of jump-shooting teams during the 2015 playoffs; Charles Barkley voiced the same sentiment around the same time. The Warriors’ title that summer felt like a retort, invalidating any preconceived notions about what kind of great team could successfully win a title.
Although the rise of the 3-point shot was set in motion long before Golden State formed its dynasty, the Warriors became its symbolic standard-bearer — even after they shifted away from small-ball lineups a bit and were surpassed by many other teams in their actual use of the 3-pointer. Whether influenced by Golden State or not, the league’s obsession with speed, spacing and shooting has intensified greatly over the past decade. Pace factor is up 8 percent since 2010, and 3-pointers per game are up 78 percent . (Huge dinosaurs still roamed the paint back in 2010; today’s game looks very different .) Offenses are the most efficient they’ve ever been , and the range at which players can reliably make threes is expanding constantly. James’s own development even mirrored these changes: Once criticized for a lack of shooting touch, he improved to eventually become one of the game’s best deep 3-point bombers by the end of the decade. The evolution of tanking
In addition to the LeBron-influenced spate of superteams, one of the league’s other primary off-court concerns this decade has been how to prevent teams from tanking — deliberately building bad (and often dirt-cheap) rosters in order to get high picks in that summer’s draft. The tactic is nothing new , but back in 2010, it still hadn’t been fully explored to its cynical conclusion — that wouldn’t truly come until Sam Hinkie took over the Philadelphia 76ers in 2013. 2
Hinkie’s “Process” — designed specifically to acquire a franchise-altering talent like James — left a controversial legacy . It helped Philly eventually acquire many building blocks for their current contending squad, even after missing on a number of their high picks . It also produced some of the worst basketball ever along the way, and the results underscored the complete lack of certainty inherent in hitching a franchise’s fortunes to a randomized lottery system. Neither of this year’s NBA Finalists were built by tanking — in fact, Toronto methodically built a solid team until a superstar (Kawhi Leonard) fell into its lap . And the league readjusted its lottery odds this year anyway, flattening out the rewards for poor records and further discouraging intentionally bad roster construction. Unlike the dreadful 2002-03 Cavaliers team that drafted James, the next LeBron might not even enter the league with a team that lost on purpose to get him. The end of ‘Lakers exceptionalism’?
Perhaps the starkest contrast between 2010 and the present is in the state of James’s current club, the L.A. Lakers. With a core of Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Odom and young center Andrew Bynum, coached by Jackson, Los Angeles had just won its second consecutive title — and they appeared poised to contend for even more over the next few seasons. But Jackson retired from coaching in 2011; Bryant and Gasol got older; Bynum couldn’t stay healthy; Odom was traded; and the front office struggled to upgrade the supporting cast.
An attempted superteam of Dwight Howard, Steve Nash, Bryant and Gasol failed miserably. It also represented the last time the Lakers made the playoffs. Ever since, the team has tried desperately to replenish its once-endless supply of Hall of Famers , whether through the draft or in signing James , the game’s biggest star. But at the same time, L.A. has been hamstrung by ineffectual management , a story that extended to this week’s ESPN report about dysfunction between Magic Johnson, former president of basketball operations; general manager Rob Pelinka; James’s agent, Rich Paul; and the rest of the team and its staff. The Lakers still figure to aim for another huge star acquisition this offseason, but the era of what SB Nation’s Tom Ziller calls “ Lakers exceptionalism ” — the idea that L.A. is entitled to always dominate the NBA — is over, difficult as that would have been to believe in 2010.
In many ways, it’s fitting that these 2019 finals would pit two of James’s longtime foils — the Raptors (who could never beat him in the playoffs) and the Warriors (whom he could seldom beat) — against each other. James’s shadow hangs over the series in absentia, if not simply for what his vacancy signals. He may return to the championship stage again sooner than later, particularly if the Warriors’ hegemony is threatened this summer. But for now, this series marks the end of an era — and the culmination of all the many changes that have remade basketball since the last time we weren’t debating James’s chances of adding another ring to his collection.

Who Will Guard Kawhi? Who Can Handle Steph? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Chris Herring,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-will-guard-kawhi-who-can-handle-steph/,"3 Big Questions Heading Into The NBA Finals The storylines we’re watching in the NBA Finals. Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGES
TORONTO — We’re finally reaching the end of what’s been a long, somewhat bizarre, landscape-shifting NBA season. And somehow, it feels as if we’re still not fully realizing just how crazy these finals could potentially be.
The Warriors, in most people’s eyes , will enter as favorites — something that’s understandable given their talent, their history and the ease with which they reached this stage. The challengers, meanwhile, are the Raptors, who have home-court advantage and likely the most lethal two-way talent in the league . The Raptors also figure to benefit from the absence of reigning back-to-back finals MVP Kevin Durant — whom we still don’t know when to expect back , if he returns at all.
While TV executives may be less than thrilled about Toronto replacing a LeBron James-led club in the title round , there’s plenty to analyze that could swing the series in one direction or the other. Here are the three biggest things we’ll be watching as the NBA Finals kick off here Thursday night. Who’s guarding Kawhi? And how will Toronto deal with Steph?
We saw in the Eastern Conference finals how big a game-changer it can be when one superstar begins defending another . Kawhi Leonard began taking defensive responsibility of likely league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in Game 3 of the series against Milwaukee, limiting him in half-court scenarios while getting support from teammates, who helped wall off the paint.
But who’s going to answer that call against Leonard for the Warriors, particularly without Durant? Our guess would be versatile wing Andre Iguodala, who generally took the role of guarding James in previous installments of the finals .
The regular-season matchups between these two teams took place in November and December; lineup weirdness and roster changes since then make it hard to extrapolate those games to this series: Kawhi missed one of the games, while Stephen Curry missed the other, and Toronto made a trade-deadline deal for Marc Gasol. Golden State primarily used Durant to defend Leonard in the lone matchup the Toronto star suited up for, and Durant is of course out for at least Game 1. For what it’s worth, Kawhi dominated offensively that game, much like he always does in matchups against the Warriors, scoring 37 points on 14-of-24 shooting from the field.
Draymond Green, a former defensive player of the year, could end up being the best bet to stop Leonard. The numbers certainly suggest that: In his three head-to-head matchups with Leonard since the start of the 2016-17 season, Green has rendered Leonard inefficient, holding him to just 28 points per 100 possessions, on a whopping 39 shot attempts per 100 possessions, according to data from Second Spectrum. By contrast, Kawhi has scored about 35 points per 100 possessions against Iguodala and Klay Thompson and nearly 49 points per 100 possessions against Durant.
But Warriors coach Steve Kerr may treat that move as a “break in case of emergency” option. If Draymond takes that assignment for long stretches, it could leave the Warriors vulnerable at the rim, where Green does much of his best defensive work during the playoffs .
On the flip side, it’s also fair to wonder who will handle defending Curry for Toronto. While it wouldn’t be shocking to see Leonard end up defending him here and there because of an occasional switch, expect the Raptors to show plenty of faith in backup guard Fred VanVleet, who has fared very well against Curry in the past.
It’s almost certain that more attention will be given to VanVleet’s offense in this series. After all, he’s coming off arguably the greatest three-game perimeter-shooting stretch in postseason history — and all in the wake of the birth of his son. But his determination to stay glued to Curry while on defense — something the Cavaliers simply couldn’t do in last year’s finals — stands out on film. On several occasions, that resulted in the ball swinging to the other side of the floor: https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Curry.mp4
The numbers tell the story even more clearly: VanVleet limited the two-time MVP to a measly 10 points per 100 possessions during their matchup this season, per Second Spectrum.
No, it wouldn’t be wise to assume that he can keep Curry under wraps to that extent in the finals. But even when you increase the sample size and start with the 2016-17 season, VanVleet has still surrendered just 21 points per 100 plays to Curry. So there are indications that he may be able to slow Steph down. And that’s big. The less Toronto has to run a second defender at Curry, the better the Raptors can protect the rim against Green’s short rolls, which annihilated the Blazers because of how decisive the fiery forward was in that series. Can Toronto limit the Warriors in transition?
So many clubs have been overtaken by the Warriors’ debilitating runs over the years, and nothing fuels those infernos like a parade of missed shots and live-ball turnovers. But the Raptors are incredibly cautious about both, which figures to give them a decent chance in this series.
During the regular season, Toronto was the most efficient defense in the NBA after missing a shot on the offensive end, allowing just 105 points per 100 possessions after a misfire, according to the data site Inpredictable. The Raptors excelled in this regard during the conference finals: They abandoned efforts to crash the offensive glass at times, realizing the greater importance of thwarting Antetokounmpo’s transition opportunities .
Toronto also doesn’t turn the ball over much. The team’s 12.2 percent turnover rate this postseason would have ranked as the NBA’s best during the regular season. This is one area in which Kawhi’s elite one-on-one skills become even more useful: He can do so much on his own, without having to pass the ball, and those sorts of plays limit the likelihood of a turnover while also slowing the game down.
Playing at a controlled tempo can help a great deal against the Warriors, particularly in these first two games before Golden State returns to Oracle Arena, where they often play considerably faster . How will the series change if and when Durant returns?
Depending on the state of the series at the time, Durant’s return has the potential to be a sports talk radio host’s dream. If the Raptors play solidly at home, it wouldn’t be shocking for them to jump out to an early series lead. Should that happen, and then Durant comes back and helps the Warriors tie the series in Oakland, it would point to the obvious: that for however talented the Dubs are, they still need Durant — at least in certain spots, as a cushion — to get by certain opponents in tough situations.
There’s an alternate universe in which the Warriors could jump out to a 2-0 lead of their own in Toronto before heading home to Oakland. Perhaps the most fascinating development possible would be if Durant is then cleared, and Golden State struggles to reincorporate him on offense. (The first two games could also result in a split, in which case maybe more nuanced takes would emerge upon Durant’s return and offer less breathless hyperbole about his value to the team.)
In any case, there’s no doubt about what the Warriors’ preference is in all this. They view Durant as both a defensive option on Kawhi and as someone on whom Leonard would have to expend energy himself. (Durant had a season-high 51 points against Toronto earlier this year, and Leonard was his primary defender that night.) Not having someone in your lineup who can do both those things — especially given that Leonard is far and away the best player the Raptors have — could be incredibly costly in a series like this one.
Kerr has had to dig deep into his bench — using Alfonzo McKinnie and Jonas Jerebko for longer stretches — to fill in as the team coped with Durant’s absence (and an injury to Iguodala ). That worked well enough against Portland. But the Blazers weren’t as stingy or as adaptable as the Raptors, who have posted the league’s most efficient defense following a switch this postseason.
It may all end up being academic. Perhaps the Warriors’ original core is talented enough to make it where none of this — including Durant’s return — ultimately matters. But more likely than not, Toronto will at least hold its own by playing the sort of hard-nosed, challenging defense that the Warriors haven’t seen in a while. And if that happens, we may finally get an answer to how badly Golden State did, or didn’t, need Durant in order to win an NBA championship. From ABC News:

Silver Bulletpoints: Who’s In Danger Of Missing The Third Debate? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/silver-bulletpoints-whos-in-danger-of-missing-the-third-debate/,"Lots of work to do Moulton <65,000 Lots of work to do * Qualifying polls at 2%+ since Jan. 1. Only polls released from June 28 to August 28 count toward the third debate. This column reflects how many polls released since Jan 1. would have qualified under the rules that will be used for the third debate. † Barring further polling collapse
The eight candidates I mentioned in the previous sentence all look reasonably safe to qualify, although Klobuchar and Booker have some work to do on the fundraising side, and O’Rourke needs to avoid a further polling slump. After that, Yang and Julián Castro probably have the next-best chances, although they’re far from guaranteed of inclusion. If I were anyone else, I’d be feeling pretty nervous. Bulletpoint No. 2: The change helps the sorts of candidates that the DNC probably likes
There’s nothing better than being the last person in line to make the roller coaster before the amusement park shuts down for the day. The debate equivalent is being one of the last candidates who safely meets the qualification threshold. That probably means O’Rourke, Booker and Klobucahar, who are behind frontrunners such as Biden and Sanders, but nonetheless reasonably safe bets for inclusion. Polling surges often begin in debates, and there are usually only one or two of them at a time. With fewer opponents on stage, folks like Klobuchar will have better odds of being the flavor-of-the-month.
It may not be entirely coincidental that it’s candidates like these who benefit from the DNC’s decision. Booker and Klobuchar are traditionally well-credentialed candidates who have compiled a fair number of endorsements , signaling party support. O’Rourke isn’t as well-credentialed, but his ability to raise money from grassroots donors is something the party probably wants to reward.
Yang and Castro are somewhere in between, both in terms of whether the rules change helps them and how “party elites” probably feel about them. I’d imagine Democrats probably do want Castro, the only Latino candidate, at the debate — but if not then maybe he could turn around and run for Senate . Yang may be unorthodox, but brings a lot of policy substance and a different kind of voter to the table .
Who’s hurt? Well, everyone below Yang and Castro, but also any candidates such as Stacey Abrams who might seek to enter the race later on. Sanders, who has a high floor but perhaps a low ceiling , would probably want the field to remain as fragmented as possible for as long as possible , so any move to encourage winnowing hurts him too.

What Bills Get Passed In States Where Parties Share Power? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-bills-get-passed-in-states-where-parties-share-power/,"Marijuana for sale in Massachusetts, which legalized recreational use and sale of the drug. Scott Eisen / Bloomberg
Earlier this week, we looked at what the parties are doing in states where they have full control of the government — both houses of the legislature plus the governor’s mansion. The 22 totally GOP-controlled states 1 have focused on issues like limiting abortion access , making guns more accessible and banning so-called sanctuary cities. The 14 states where Democrats have a state-government “ trifecta ” have pursued goals like increasing the minimum wage, reducing or totally eliminating penalties for marijuana use and creating programs to make college more affordable.
So what’s happening in the 14 other states — the ones where the two parties share power? Have any of the policies from the trifecta states made their way to places where control is split? (Note: We’re looking at what types of laws are on the books in these states, whether they were passed decades ago or only went through in 2019 under the current state government.)
What do we see? Well, basically the entire agenda of blue-trifecta policy ideas has also been adopted in Maryland , Massachusetts and Vermont . That’s not surprising — while all three states have Republican governors, they’re all quite liberal. Democrats nearly always carry them in presidential elections, and the party controls both houses of the state legislature in all three. So GOP governors Charlie Baker (Massachusetts), Larry Hogan (Maryland) and Phil Scott (Vermont) are fairly liberal as far as Republicans go — they had to be to get elected — and have been willing to back some left-leaning ideas . And Democrats in both Massachusetts and Maryland have such large majorities in the state legislature that they can override their governors’ vetoes , as Maryland did earlier this year to adopt a $15 minimum wage . (A coalition of Democrats and Progressives have the power to override vetoes in Vermont’s state legislature too.)
This dynamic suggests that Baker, Hogan and Scott’s high approval ratings in blue states probably don’t say that much about their ability to sell a Republican vision to Democratic voters. In some ways, that trio is simply running state governments that are enacting liberal priorities — so of course Democratic voters are fine with them.
At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin have pursued at least three of the provisions we identified as red-trifecta policies. This is also unsurprising, since Kansas , Michigan and Wisconsin were run by GOP trifectas for nearly a decade until Democrats won gubernatorial elections in those states last November, and North Carolina had a GOP trifecta until Gov. Roy Cooper’s election in 2016.
Almost none of the issues on our list have been passed in Pennsylvania . That makes sense too — Pennsylvania is a more evenly divided state than, say, Maryland or Kansas, and it has had a longer run of divided rule than Michigan or Wisconsin. Democrats have held the governor’s office in recent years, but Republicans have controlled both houses of the state legislature, making it hard to pass any polarizing bills. So it’s logical that neither parties’ priorities are being advanced in the Keystone State. Similarly, these initiatives are not advancing in Montana, and which has also had a divided state government in recent years .
What policies have gained the most ground in these 14 states? Eight of the 14 have some kind of formal opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against the Israeli government. That’s an issue that doesn’t divide the parties super cleanly — Republican Party officials are broadly opposed to boycotts of Israel and so are more likely to support bills that punish boycotters, but Democratic officials are split on whether to back the boycotts , with more liberal figures in the party viewing the protests more favorably because of those Democrats’ frustrations with the Israeli government. So anti-BDS provisions can pass in a broad range of states.
Eight of these states have decriminalized or legalized marijuana, and seven have increased the minimum wage above the federal level of $7.25 per hour. On both issues, a clear majority of the public and a sizable number of Republican voters favor the position generally identified with the Democrats.
What issues are not moving? Only one of these 14 states (North Carolina) has put in place limits on sanctuary cities. It’s hard to prove this, but that may be an issue where Democrats, if they control either a governor’s office or a state legislature, truly hold the line — particularly as the two parties are increasingly divided on immigration policy and the questions around ethnicity and race that surround that issue. Banning a controversial practice designed to “convert” gay and lesbian children away from homosexuality (four of the 14 states) and ensuring that the winner of the popular vote becomes the president (three of the 14) likely aren’t popular with GOP state legislators and governors. The former could irritate conservative Christians , and the latter could annoy anyone who voted for President Trump, who of course won the presidency but not the popular vote.
This is not a comprehensive study of all laws being adopted in the states. Instead, we looked at a small set of issues that are closely associated with one party or the other. What’s the big takeaway? Well, trifectas obviously are a big advantage for a party in power. But Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont suggest that states where a single party has a huge majority in the legislature can function sort of like a trifecta too. And legal pot, a higher minimum wage, and limits on boycotts of the Israeli government may be coming to your state — no matter where you live. From ABC News:

Who Do Non-Religious Democrats Prefer? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-do-non-religious-democrats-prefer/,"Bernie Sanders currently polls well among religiously unaffiliated voters Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images
The Democratic Party has a broad and diverse religious coalition — which, as Laura Bronner and I wrote last week, can be challenging for any candidate hoping to use religious rhetoric to rally voters. But what, might you ask, about the Democrats who aren’t religious?
People who identify as atheists, agnostics or “nothing in particular” accounted for 35 percent of Democratic primary voters in 2016, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study , 1 and as we mentioned in our article, are a growing constituency within the Democratic Party. And according to crosstabs from Morning Consult’s weekly tracking poll for May 20-26, support for Sen. Bernie Sanders is higher among religiously unaffiliated voters than among religiously affiliated voters. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has an edge among religious Democrats.
Biden has a lead among most groups in the Democratic primary electorate, so Sanders’s relatively high levels of support among unaffiliated voters are worth probing. Yes, Sanders is a political rarity because of the openness with which he’s spoken about his lack of faith, but why are nonreligious voters more drawn to him? And could other Democratic candidates replicate his success? To better understand his appeal among the unaffiliated, I identified a couple of factors that could help explain it. None add up to a straightforward strategy for reaching these voters, since they’re disconnected from religious institutions and don’t have a clear set of shared political priorities. But they are worth watching because they make up a rapidly growing segment of the Democratic Party, and one that candidates might benefit from activating — if they can figure out how.
At this point in the primary, religiously unaffiliated Democrats seem more open to a candidate who isn’t Biden than their religious counterparts. And while there is some variation in the level of support for Biden, he’s the clear front-runner among several major religious groups. Among nonreligious Democrats, though, Biden is less of a clear favorite. Instead, a plurality (30 percent) of atheists prefer Sanders, while agnostics are split between Biden and Sanders. And although Biden is the favored candidate of 32 percent of Democrats who say they’re “nothing in particular,” nearly one-quarter support Sanders. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is also somewhat more popular among atheists and agnostics than she is among other religious groups.
The most obvious explanation for the split among religious and nonreligious voters is that religiously unaffiliated Democrats — in particular, atheists and agnostics, who together accounted for 17 percent of primary voters in the 2016 CCES study — are substantially more liberal than Democrats who are still part of organized religion. And very liberal voters are a key constituency for Sanders. “Many religiously unaffiliated voters overlap with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, so it’s not surprising you’d see higher support for Sanders,” said Ryan Burge , a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University. Religiously unaffiliated Democrats also tend to be younger overall — another group in which Sanders tends to be strong relative to Biden.
Although Sanders hasn’t really tried to hide his lack of religiosity, he also hasn’t used it to directly target unaffiliated voters. In interviews and debates , he has said he believes in God and is proud of his Jewish heritage, but he’s also said he’s “not actively involved with organized religion” and has mostly steered clear of the subject. So it’s possible that reaching these voters doesn’t require an appeal to their lack of a religious identity. Instead, like many other Americans whose religious beliefs and practices are increasingly shaped by partisan politics, their liberal identity — rather than a nonreligious or secular identity — may be the main characteristic many religiously unaffiliated people have in common.
But it’s possible that Sanders also may be drawing on a little-tapped well of secular enthusiasm on the left, particularly among atheists and agnostics. “Their nonreligion may not be the driving factor for their support for Sanders, but it’s very likely a contributing factor,” said David Campbell , a political science professor at Notre Dame University who studies religion and civic life. His research has found that a significant share of Democratic Party activists don’t just lack a religious affiliation, they have actively embraced a secular worldview — and political arguments rooted in socioeconomic justice might resonate especially with them. Nonreligious voters might, too, see their own identity reflected in Sanders’s lack of overt religiosity, which could add to his appeal. But there’s also room, Campbell said, for candidates to reach atheists and agnostics even more directly. “This is a big group of voters who usually get ignored,” he said. “One way to stand out from the pack is to try to explicitly address them in secular terms.”
Marshaling Democrats by invoking their secular identity, though, would be risky for Democratic politicians in a number of ways. Atheism, in particular, remains a fairly politically toxic brand. As FiveThirtyEight’s Perry Bacon Jr. noted recently , big segments of the electorate, including 28 percent of Democrats, say they wouldn’t vote for a well-qualified presidential candidate who was an atheist. So messages directed specifically at nonreligious voters could alienate the religious Democrats who make up the bulk of the party — not to mention voters in the general election. “The Democratic Party is very far from a universally secular party,” Campbell said. “It would take a very artful politician to be able to mobilize secular voters while also holding onto religious voters.”
So for the time being, the religiously unaffiliated may remain a largely invisible group within the Democratic Party. But it’s worth watching how this group’s allegiances shift over the course of the primary — because as the number of nonreligious Democrats continues to grow, candidates may need to start figuring out strategies for how to appeal to them more directly.

How A Depleted Warriors Team Stole Home-Court Advantage In The NBA Finals,fivethirtyeight.com,Chris Herring (chris.herring@fivethirtyeight.com),06-03-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/warriors-raptors-game-2-nba-finals/,"How A Depleted Warriors Team Stole Home-Court Advantage In The NBA Finals Toronto used a weird defensive scheme to stage a comeback, but Golden State survived. Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors during Game 2 of the 2019 NBA Finals. Gregory Shamus / Getty Images
TORONTO — Once upon a time in this series, there was a common question being thrown around about the two-time defending champions and their embarrassment of riches: Do they even really need Kevin Durant, who is rehabbing an injured right calf, to win another title?
Yet during Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Sunday, the team would have felt fortunate if Durant had been the only player sidelined. Stephen Curry’s shot was off the mark early, and he went back to the locker room in the early going after reportedly feeling lightheaded and dehydrated. Kevon Looney, the team’s best center the past two rounds, was forced to exit in the first half with a chest contusion. Former finals MVP Andre Iguodala had a scary collision with Marc Gasol in the second quarter, and he spent almost a minute lying facedown on the court. And most worth watching going forward: Klay Thompson — whose quick-trigger jump-shooting kept the team afloat in the first half — sustained a hamstring injury that forced him out with eight minutes left.
Still, the Warriors overcame a halftime deficit with one of their patented game-breaking runs , won a war of attrition and survived a somewhat bizarre Raptors’ comeback effort over the final five minutes to avoid a treacherous 2-0 hole and instead even the series at one game apiece as the finals head to Oakland for Games 3 and 4.
Trailing 59-54 at half, Golden State in the third period embarked on another one of those invincible Mario Star stretches , when it almost looked as if the Warriors were the only team allowed to score. They surged ahead by putting up 18 points in the quarter before Toronto got on the board. Incredible scoring runs like that from the Warriors are often fueled by the hot shooting of Thompson and Curry (or Durant), but this one was far more balanced.
Every single basket the Warriors scored during their run was assisted. In fact, all 22 buckets that Golden State got in the entire second half stemmed from an assist, making it the second team in NBA Finals history to assist every single basket over the course of a half, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. 1 Several were back-door lobs , a pretty clear sign that the Warriors were taking advantage of the Raptors paying too much defensive attention to Golden State’s sweet-shooting guards.
The Raptors fell behind by as much as 13 but managed to make things interesting in the closing minutes. Shortly after Thompson went down, the Raptors turned to a gimmicky, rarely used defensive scheme called a box-and-one , 2 which seeks to punish offenses perceived to have just one true scoring threat.
“I was feeling good because we stopped their scoring,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “We finally got something figured out to slow them down.”
While the plan might not work moving forward, the maneuver caught Curry and the Warriors off-guard with no other scoring star to lighten the load. They went five-and-a-half minutes without scoring, and Toronto trimmed its deficit from 12 down to just 2 points. And if it hadn’t been for a critical catch from Shaun Livingston with 10 seconds left — one Kawhi Leonard nearly intercepted after Curry threw a dangerous pass to escape a trap — we easily could have been looking at a tie game. Livingston secured the ball, surprising Raptors forward Pascal Siakam, who was headed the other way in anticipation of a fastbreak. Siakam’s haste left Iguodala all by himself, and Iggy made it count. https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Iguodala.mp4
The shot would have been big for anyone, but it was particularly sweet for Iguodala: Before Sunday, he hadn’t hit a triple since Game 6 of the conference semifinal series against the Rockets.
On the subject of that Houston series, this game in some ways felt like the latter stages of the Rockets-Warriors matchup in the sense that Toronto — like Houston — seemed to squander some golden opportunities. Thompson came out on fire early, but the Raptors limited Curry for the vast majority of the first half: Curry missed his first six shots and didn’t get his first basket until four minutes left in the half. (Klay was also fantastic in the first half of Game 6 against Houston, holding down the fort during a scoreless first half from Curry, who went off for 33 second-half points .) And Thompson’s late injury against Toronto gave the Raptors a window to defend far more aggressively, much like Durant’s injury against Houston figured to give the Rockets a better shot at advancing.
Though this may have been a missed opportunity for Toronto, 3 the Warriors deserve full credit for finding a way to hold on. A number of important factors stood out in their victory.
The defensive shifts — like pulling Draymond Green off of Siakam and putting him on Kyle Lowry instead, which allowed Green to roam as a disruptive help defender — were masterful in some cases. Siakam starred in Game 1 but didn’t do nearly as much against Iguodala. And Thompson defended Kawhi, who still saw plenty of defenders in his face but wasn’t hounded nearly as much as he was in the series opener. The Warriors dialed back their pressure in hopes of surrendering fewer wide-open looks to Toronto’s role players, and the decision paid off. (Leonard had 34 points still, but he had just three assists on Sunday — down considerably from the seven dimes per game he’d averaged over his three previous outings.)
And DeMarcus Cousins made a huge impact in just his second game back from injury. He logged 11 points, 10 boards and six assists in just 28 minutes, while registering a team-best +12 . 4
Sure, there’s plenty to wonder about still for this club — particularly if Thompson is hobbled and can’t play in Game 3 5 and if Durant is still another game or two away from returning. If the Warriors are down Thompson and Durant, Toronto could continue to use a once-unthinkable defensive strategy against Curry and his teammates.
But regardless of how shorthanded Golden State might be come Game 3 on Wednesday, the fact that the Warriors found a way to get Game 2 — despite everything that seemed to be going wrong — likely gave them all the confidence they need to take this series and retain the title.

The San Antonio Spurs did it in 2005. But they also made only nine baskets in that half, making the Warriors’ feat even more impressive.
A hybrid between a zone and a man-to-man defense, in which four players form a box and guard different zones. Two defenders stand near either low block, while two more stand higher up, near the elbows. The fifth defender guards the opposing team’s most dangerous scorer, while getting help from the other four defenders when that player enters their zone. This strategy is almost never used in the NBA because players and teams are generally too offensively skilled for it to work.
Aside from their blown lead after halftime, the Raptors came up with nothing on three straight possessions in the final four minutes of play despite having wide-open looks .

The women’s side of the French Open has seen plenty of upsets. Only three of the 10 top-ranked players made it through the third round, with high-profile competitors such as No. 1 Naomi Osaka and No. 10 Serena Williams among them. After her loss to 20-year-old American Sofia Kenin, Serena Williams, who has battled persistent injuries this season, was asked if she still would have entered the Open had she known the outcome. She said she would never have believed that she would be out in the third round. We’ll look at how Serena’s expectations fair against the growing parity in women’s tennis and how sharply this contrasts with the predictable cast of characters on the men’s side.

Rafael Nadal Is Playing Mind Games With You | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rafael-nadal-is-playing-mind-games-with-you/,"Rafael Nadal is on to the semifinals of the 2019 French Open. KENZO TRIBOUILLARD / AFP / Getty Images
When you think of Rafael Nadal, you might think of a player who hits balls with hellacious topspin and grinds out points on clay. His RPMs and his sweat grab the glory. But the 11-time French Open champion uses a few insidious tricks that go beyond the obvious strokes and traditional tactics.
All of Rafa’s ways and means traveled to Roland Garros in 2019 — the energy, the rituals, the patterns of play — it’s all been put to use in another run to the semifinals, this time at age 33. He’ll need every tactic at his disposal, the conspicuous and the cunning, as he takes on Roger Federer and potentially Novak Djokovic after that.
Here are three examples of the subtle mental maneuvers that Nadal makes against his opponents. He makes them wait
Strictly from a length-of-match standpoint, Nadal is one of the slowest tennis players of this era . And there are a host of things Nadal does to extend matches — and possibly distract and annoy his opponents in the process.
The ultimate creature of habit, Nadal starts managing time with his first step on court. When the chair umpire prepares to toss the coin and the presence of both players is required in the middle of the court before the start of the match, Nadal is typically the second to arrive — after a delay of several seconds while he goes through his routines with water bottles .
Once the match is underway, Nadal’s pre-point rituals have been fodder for everything from complaints to comedy routines . Even the typically chilled-out Roger Federer has been critical of the time that Nadal takes between points . By rule, players are limited to 25 seconds between points. Beginning this year at most events, the sport put in formal, visible shot clocks in an attempt to keep servers from abusing the rule.
According to an analysis by Melbourne, Australia-based Data Driven Sports Analytics of more than 140 matches each for Nadal, Federer and Djokovic from 2008 through this year, Rafa averaged 26.1 seconds between points when serving — the longest of the so-called “Big 3.” 1 Nadal’s average time between points is over the limit — and that’s just an average, which means that he regularly serves beyond the 25-second rule. Chair umpires can use their discretion in starting the clock, so, clearly, Nadal is getting some wiggle room.
Nadal finds a way to play on Rafa time when he’s returning as well, going through a catalog of rituals and often turning his back on the server or lifting his racquet until he’s ready to receive.
The overall effect is that Nadal asserts his own pace of play, which can be legitimately discomfiting for opponents . He conditions them like Pavlov
One of the hardest things to do in professional tennis is return serves . Speeds regularly top 125 mph, and then there’s the spin. Professional tennis players also excel at “spot serving” — landing serves in precise locations. They most often hit close to the lines of the service box, placing the serve at angles to inflict the most damage. Those most-visited, go-to spots are either up the T, which is the middle of the court, or out wide, which is on the outer edge of the service box. Servers work hard to place their serves effectively on both the deuce side (serving from the right side to the servers’ left and returners’ right), when the game score is usually tied, and on the ad side, when one player is always ahead.
Nadal has a curious modus operandi when serving on the deuce side. The effect is Pavlovian: It conditions his opponents for one thing and then kills them with another.
Because Nadal is a left-handed server, the natural play for him in this situation is to serve up the T. The ATP Tour has collected serve placement data from 2011 to 2019 for Masters 1000 events, which are just beneath Grand Slams and the Tour Finals in terms of stature, ranking points and prize money. According to that data set, on clay, Nadal’s first serve has been up the T 56.4 percent of the time on the deuce side. His success rate for this location — meaning how often he wins the point — is a healthy 68.5 percent. Much less often — 27 percent of the time — Nadal takes his first serve out wide from the deuce court on clay. And in that spot, his success rate is eye-popping, 74.8 percent. In 2019 alone, it’s up to 79.2 percent.
Why would Nadal use a serve that is statistically so successful for him so infrequently? It’s possible that the tactic is about mentally conditioning the returner, greasing the tracks as it were, and then flipping his pattern when he really needs it.
Indeed, data from that same set of ATP Masters tournaments reveals this morsel about Nadal on clay: He habitually hits his first serve from the deuce court up the T on nearly all scores. The most notable exception: when he’s down 15-40. When Nadal faces two break points against him, his primary service pattern switches to his secondary, “money” spot — the out wide. At 15-40, he goes T only 39.7 percent of the time, and his primary pattern becomes out-wide, at 44.9 percent.
How does the King of Clay perform with that deuce court, out-wide serve down two break points? Put simply, he crushes: 82.9 percent of the time he wins the point.
It’s a smart and subtle way to serve in the situation, and his success rate suggests that his opponent, potentially predisposed to Nadal’s T serve, does not see it coming.
Granted, it’s also a bit of a “tell” for anyone lucky enough to find himself with a pair of break points against Nadal — those guys should look for the out wide serve. But more than that, it reveals a mental game-within-the-game orchestrated by Nadal. He turns balls hit to his backhand side into forehand winners
Nadal’s forehand is his biggest weapon. Opponents try to dodge it at all costs, which means avoiding hitting the ball to the ad court as much as possible against the southpaw. A good way to understand the baseline is to divide it into four vertical zones — two in the deuce court and two in the ad court. In tennis, these zones are sometimes labeled A, B, C and D, with A being the out wide in the deuce court, all the way to the D zone, which is the out wide in the ad court.
If you’re Nadal’s opponent and you’re trying to avoid his forehand, you would hit to zones A and B (the ad court). And that’s where he gets you.
The King of Clay is also the King of Running Around His Backhand to Hit Forehand . He’s an expert at it . Indeed, he loves to run around his backhand to hit forehand so much that in some matches, he has hit about the same number of winners from what would be his natural backhand side of the court — zones A and B — than from his normal, left-handed forehand side of the court — zones C and D. Through five rounds at this year’s French Open, 54 percent of Nadal’s forehand winners (46/85) have been hit as run-around forehands from zones A and B, according to officially recorded statistics from Roland Garros.
By comparison, consider the right-handed Djokovic, the number one player in the world. Through the first four rounds at Roland Garros this year, 42 percent of Djokovic’s forehand winners have been run-around forehands (14/33).
Nadal is like a spider looking to snare a rally ball, and players would be ill-advised to hit toward Nadal’s backhand unless they can be sure he’ll only be able to use his backhand. At the same time, better not hit too far out wide or the errors will flow.
Just when you think you know Nadal, think again. He will bend your mind more than he bends the ball. Footnotes

So while Sanders might have a slightly higher floor than other candidates — about half of the voters who currently prefer Sanders are only considering Sanders — it’s still pretty low in the broader scheme of things. About two-thirds of Democratic voters are still up for grabs, and they’re probably going to take their time to make a decision. Bulletpoint No. 2: Actually, the candidates care about Iowa and New Hampshire just as much as ever
The New York Times’s Jonathan Martin recently made a claim that struck some of us in the office as dubious: that various factors “have created more of a national primary than ever before,” different from past campaigns when candidates would spend “the vast majority of their time in Iowa and New Hampshire.”
What’s Martin’s evidence? Democrats “have already combined to visit more than 30 states and territories … far more than in any past nominating contest,” he writes. But that doesn’t really prove the point. There are far more Democratic candidates than ever before, 23 by the Times’s count , and the campaign has gotten off to an earlier start than usual. It’s a lot easier to cover 50 states with that many candidates. And while there may have been a stray visit to Idaho or Mississippi, Democrats have already combined to hold around 800 events in Iowa and 500 in New Hampshire .
We don’t have a comprehensive list of candidate visits in every state, but we do have an extensive database of polls. The amount of polling in a state is generally a good proxy for the amount of attention that campaigns and the media are paying to it, since polling primary voters is expensive and organizations investing in polls want their results to be newsworthy.
So far, Iowa and New Hampshire are getting as much attention from pollsters as ever. They’ve combined for 40 percent of the state polls so far in our database , a slightly larger share than the long-term average of 35 percent in the year before the primary. Pollsters are focusing on Iowa and N.H. as much as usual Number of presidential polls in the year before the primary, by state Year"
Abortion Rights Haven’t Been A Priority In Blue States — Until Now,fivethirtyeight.com,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-rights-havent-been-a-priority-in-blue-states-until-now/,"Twitter Aurora Samperio / NurPhoto via Getty Images
Even before Alabama and Georgia approved laws that severely restrict abortions, it had not been a good year for abortion-rights advocates. Bills to protect abortion rights and access had stalled across the country — even in states like New Mexico and Illinois, where Democrats had newfound control of both the legislature and the governor’s mansions. In Virginia, an effort to lift restrictions went down in flames amid claims that its supporters were promoting infanticide.
But the new laws in Alabama and Georgia have helped push some blue states to protect and even expand their residents’ abortion rights. In late May, the bill in Illinois — which, among other things, established abortion as a fundamental right in the state — was released from legislative limbo and swiftly passed in both chambers. The Vermont legislature passed a bill along the same lines, and in Nevada , a new law removed some abortion restrictions, including a requirement that women be told about the “physical and emotional implications” of having the procedure.
This has been a rare flurry of legislative successes for abortion-rights advocates. About one-quarter of the state-level provisions that have protected and expanded abortion rights since 2011 have passed in the past two weeks, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports legal abortion. That dramatic increase isn’t a sign, though, that lots of states are moving to protect abortion — at least, not yet. For one thing, many of those provisions were bundled into a single bill, which the governor of Illinois is expected to sign soon. Moreover, the recent increase is mostly a testament to just how little state-level activity there’s been on this issue over the past eight years. Democrats have tried to protect abortion very differently than Republicans have tried to restrict it .
According to Guttmacher’s data, states have enacted 42 provisions protecting or expanding abortion rights since 2011. (This includes provisions from two laws in Illinois and Vermont that are awaiting the governor’s signature. In both cases, the governor is expected to enact the law.) That is far fewer than the hundreds of restrictions that states have passed in the same time span. These protective efforts fall into three basic categories: lifting preexisting restrictions on abortion, establishing the right to abortion in state law, and expanding access by making it easier or less expensive to get an abortion. 1
The policies in the first category, which axe restrictions without adding new protections, account for almost two-thirds of the provisions enacted since 2011. Some of the repealed restrictions were already not being enforced or had been blocked by the courts, said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, and removing them from the books amounted to a kind of cleanup effort. Last year, for example, Massachusetts repealed a ban on “procuring a miscarriage” that dated to 1845. Other states, like Idaho and Louisiana , were forced by courts to claw back restrictions, or made minor adjustments that abortion-rights advocates viewed as an improvement but didn’t have significantly affect abortion access in the state.
Overall, this data suggests Democrats have mostly been playing defense at the state level until now. The abortion protections that have made it through state legislatures have often had less of a direct impact than the restrictions that many states have passed, which make it significantly harder to get an abortion in certain parts of the country. More proactive measures — such as provisions that protect clinic access, expand insurance coverage for abortion, or widen the range of health care professionals who can perform abortions — have been passed less often. Until recently, blue states have mainly removed restrictions; now, more states are working to ensure that abortion will continue to be legal within their borders if Roe v. Wade is overturned.
So why have we seen so much protesting from pro-abortion-rights activists in the last few weeks, but so little pro-abortion-rights legislation in the last few years? Part of the issue was that some state legislators may not have wanted to risk a controversy when the right to an abortion seemed safer than it does now. “The attitude for a long time was that abortion was legal and it was going to stay legal, and there wasn’t really a need to do more,” Nash said. Joshua Wilson, a political science professor at the University of Denver, said that as long as Roe didn’t seem to be seriously threatened, abortion-rights activists mostly focused on fighting restrictions in court (which they’re continuing to do ) rather than pursuing new legislation. That said, some states — like Maryland and Maine — did pass laws affirming abortion rights in the early 1990s when it seemed like Roe was under threat .
In the past, Democratic politicians have been more tentative on abortion — perhaps because public opinion on the issue can be difficult to navigate. Over the years, Republicans’ and Democrats’ positions on the legality of abortion have become more polarized , but although Democratic support for allowing the procedure under any circumstances has grown, there’s still some disagreement about when in a pregnancy it should be permitted. A Pew poll conducted in 2018 found that more than three-quarters of Democrats believe abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, and a PRRI poll from the same year found that 73 percent of Democrats say Roe v. Wade was correctly decided by the Supreme Court and should be upheld. But according to a 2018 Gallup poll , less than half of Democrats support legal abortion in the second trimester. And this year, Democratic lawmakers in heavily Catholic states like New Mexico and Rhode Island have cited their faith as they voted against bills to repeal old abortion restrictions or protect abortion rights.
“Public opinion on abortion can be hard to pin down because Americans are supportive of abortion in some cases and not in others,” said Rebecca Kreitzer, a professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The recent near-total bans on abortion are a notable exception, but many abortion restrictions are framed as regulations to protect the health and safety of people seeking the procedure — a strategy, according to Kreitzer, that “made them more politically palatable.” Convincing Americans to expand access to a procedure that many were ambivalent about, meanwhile, remained a tall order — especially when the constitutional right to abortion didn’t seem to be threatened.
But abortion rights are clearly threatened now. Many observers believe the current Supreme Court could be willing to roll back longstanding precedents , which means challenges to Roe v. Wade may have a better chance of success now than they have in the past. And that threat could make it easier for Democrats to push for more protections or even try to expand abortion access. “Abortion rights groups tend to do better in state legislatures when there’s an existential threat to Roe,” said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian at Florida State University and the author of “After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate.”
There are already some signs that abortion may be mobilizing more Democrats than it did in the past. For example, as FiveThirtyEight contributor Daniel Cox wrote last year, Democrats are increasingly likely to say that abortion is an important voting issue , and they’re also more likely than they were even a few years ago to say that abortion is an important issue to them personally. These findings predate the most recent bans on abortion and Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, where he replaced Anthony Kennedy , the longtime swing justice on abortion — and those developments could galvanize even more Democrats around this issue. A CNN poll released last week found that 29 percent of Democrats say they would only vote for a candidate who shares their view on abortion.
Pushing too far in the other direction could still backfire. Ziad Munson, a sociologist at Lehigh University who studies the pro-choice and pro-life movements, called New York’s recent law loosening restrictions on abortions late in pregnancy a “cautionary tale.” Although the law passed , the conversation about its merits quickly became mired in a debate over the ethics of third-trimester abortion, even though the bill mostly just brought New York’s law in line with those already on the books in other states. And that debate may have contributed to the demise of a similar bill in Virginia.
Abortion-rights advocates could always take a page out of their opponents’ book and adopt a more incremental strategy. For example, although Illinois’s law was largely designed to preserve the status quo, it also required insurance companies to cover abortion under their plans — a seemingly small tweak that could make the procedure much more affordable. Similarly, Maine legislators are currently considering a law that would expand the range of medical professionals who are allowed to perform abortions, potentially making it easier for patients in rural areas to access the procedure. But it’s not a slam dunk — even in Hawaii, where Democrats have a legislative supermajority , a similar proposal was tabled earlier this year.
The biggest question for abortion-rights advocates — who are working with some momentum on their side but with Roe under threat — is how much of a risk they want to take. In terms of cold political calculus, working to protect the status quo could be the most expedient move, at least in the short term. “People might care about gaining some new rights,” Ziegler said. “But they’ll be much more worried about losing what they already have.” Footnotes
FiveThirtyEight obtained data on abortion protections and expansions from Guttmacher and worked with Guttmacher researcher Elizabeth Nash to categorize the provisions into three major types. Some provisions were excluded from the data set — including laws criminalizing coerced abortion and removing certain abortion data reporting requirements — because they didn’t focus on protecting abortion rights or expanding access to abortion.

How Mike Gravel Could Win The 2020 Democratic Primary | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mike-gravel-could-win-the-2020-democratic-primary/,"Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGES
Many things, most of them unlikely, would have to transpire for former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel to win the Democratic nomination for president.
A few possibilities: All the other candidates drop out, and no successful write-in campaign is waged. A capricious President Trump orders a catastrophic invasion of another nation, lending massive credibility to Gravel’s perennial anti-war stance (he helped put the Pentagon Papers into the public record). The Democratic primary electorate all of a sudden decides that it would prefer an octogenarian candidate to the current septuagenarian front-runners. (Gravel is 89 years of age; meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is a youthful 77 years old, and Joe Biden is a spring chicken, at 76.)
But last week, Gravel became the 23rd Democrat to count as a “major” presidential candidate by FiveThirtyEight criteria, pushed over the edge from minor to major candidacy by his inclusion in a majority of polls. And that means we have to imagine what we call the “theory of the case” — how can Gravel win the Democratic nomination?
It would be easy to laugh at Gravel’s campaign — while he has said he is running to win , he hasn’t campaigned, and he has turned his operation over to a handful of teenagers who voice his Twitter account with the dually earnest and sneering cadences of the internet. And his political performance art ads have certainly left him open to mockery. But while he’s not likely to win the nomination, Gravel is carrying on a grand American tradition: the protest candidate.
Gravel first ran for president in 2008. He made the debate stage and hit mostly the same note — the cost and senselessness of war and the hubris of American foreign policy. He took to task the major Democratic candidates for their bellicose posturing on Iran and their stances on the invasion of Iraq — Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Joe Biden had all voted to authorize the invasion. (Last week, Gravel announced an endorsement from “Man Who Threw Shoes At George W. Bush.” Google it.) This time around, Gravel has added to his repertoire, adopting the 2019 left’s fondness for a Green New Deal and the abolition of the Electoral College, along with more niche proposals like postal banking . He is a former two-term United States senator, and while his candidacy is not plausible, it is principled.
Protest candidates can sometimes be spoilers — there’s likely no love lost between Al Gore and Ralph Nader or Hillary Clinton and Jill Stein. Gravel’s protest candidacy is not that kind, but it does suit its age. It has the grassiest of grass roots beginnings, a tinge of absurdity and a devotion to promoting ideas that exist outside the realm of what is currently politically possible.
Gravel’s theory of the case might well be that Democratic voters somehow come to embrace this 89-year-old man with boyish helpmates as an embodiment of the political idiosyncrasies toward which quite a lot of Americans are inclined. (How else do we explain the popularity of Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996?) He’s certainly not making the same case as any other candidate.
At the very least, American politics loves a flame-thrower. Or in this case, a rock-dropper .

Why The Raptors’ Shots Always Seem To Get The Friendly Bounces At Home,fivethirtyeight.com,Chris Herring (chris.herring@fivethirtyeight.com),06-10-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-raptors-shots-always-seem-to-get-the-friendly-bounces-at-home/,"Rockets 0.181 On jump shots of 10 feet or more, among teams that advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs. Sources: STATS SportVU, SECOND SPECTRUM
Toronto’s made jumpers throughout the playoffs have been by far the most suspenseful of those of any of the final eight teams, taking an average of 0.117 seconds to fall into the basket. That hang time was 44 percent longer than the average of the other seven clubs. And looking at a larger sample size doesn’t change much about the result: At an average of 0.108 seconds, the Raptors’ successful regular-season jumpers at Scotiabank Arena took longer to fall through the basket than any other team’s makes on their home courts, too, according to the SportVU analysis. You might remember that Leonard hit a game-winner in March against Portland — a fadeaway from Scotiabank’s right baseline, with the shooter’s bounce and all — that looked almost identical to the one he would eventually make against Philadelphia. https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/KawhiBLAZERS.mp4
To be clear, even though the Raptors have the longest hang time at home, their numbers are far from an outlier in the data set. The arena did have an odd rim-related issue last season, when officials had to delay a game because one of the rims was slightly crooked and required an adjustment. But no one could look at the numbers presented here and realistically suggest that anything about them is crooked, or that the arena’s rims are fundamentally different from others in the NBA.
Still, there’s no doubting the fact that Toronto has gotten a couple of very friendly bounces over the course of the playoffs — not just from Leonard, but also from Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, who told me somewhat candidly, “I hate our rims.” (While that might sound odd, given his incredible hot streak lately , VanVleet had struggled mightily the last two postseasons from the perimeter.) https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BOUNCES.mp4
There are a number of potential factors to consider with unusual data like this. One counterintuitive example: A team with dead-eye shooters, for instance, often won’t get opportunities for much hang time on the rim because their jumpers will swish through the net, registering a minuscule amount of time around the basket as a result. At the same time, though, players and teams who use considerable arc might be better positioned to get a beneficial bounce or roll, regardless of how soft or tight the rims are. 2 And no team has put more air under its 3-pointers this postseason than Golden State.
In fact, while the Raptors’ shots have had the most hang time on the rim during home games, the Warriors have seen the league’s biggest home-road disparity in terms of how much longer the ball has teetered on the basket while playing in familiar confines. Golden State’s jumpers have stayed in the vicinity of the rim 0.02 seconds longer at Oracle Arena this postseason than on the road, by far the biggest gap of any playoff club. By contrast, Toronto’s shots actually hang near the rim slightly longer on the road than they do at home, so it’s hard to claim a soft-rim advantage at home for the Raptors.

The Blues Erase A Half Century Of Hockey Anguish In One Night,fivethirtyeight.com,Terrence Doyle,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-blues-erase-a-half-century-of-hockey-anguish-in-one-night/,"St. Louis waited longer than any franchise to win its first Stanley Cup. Brian Babineau / NHLI via Getty Images
It feels extremely weird to write this, but the St. Louis Blues are Stanley Cup champions. It took them more than half a century — in that time there were three failed Cup bids and a subsequent 25-year playoff streak that included zero Cup appearances — but this current group of Bluenotes will forever have their names engraved on the face of an ornate punch bowl.
We wrote Wednesday that Blues goalie Jordan Binnington was having one of the worst playoffs in recent memory among goalies who advanced to the Stanley Cup Final. In Game 7, however, Binnington was downright sublime, stopping 32 of the 33 shots the Boston Bruins directed at his goal in a performance for the ages. Binnington might have struggled at times during the playoffs, but no one will remember any of that — all anyone will remember are those 32 saves.
This is all a bit unbelievable when you consider the Blues’ position in the league standings just after the new year. In the first week of January, the Blues had the second-worst points total in the league, outperforming only the Ottawa Senators, who ended the season 34 points outside playoff contention. 1 It hardly looked like the Blues would win another dozen games, let alone qualify for the playoffs. And it most certainly didn’t look like they’d advance to the Stanley Cup Final.
Binnington’s playoff struggles notwithstanding, the Blues wouldn’t have gotten this far without their rookie goalie’s excellent regular-season performance. When he was given the starting job by interim head coach Craig Berube — and yes, he is still technically the interim head coach! — the Blues were in the basement of the Western Conference. He proceeded to record 24 wins in 30 starts, and the Blues easily qualified for the playoffs.
Still, no one expected much from the Blues once the playoffs began. During the regular season, only one of their skaters finished in the top 50 in points, their power play was solid but unremarkable, their penalty kill was solid but unremarkable, their Simple Rating System score 2 was middle-of-the-pack, their shooting percentage was middle-of-the-pack, and therefore their total goals tally was middle-of-the-pack, too.
An impressive second half of the season propelled the Blues to the playoffs, but they still didn’t appear to be particularly dangerous. If they were going to have a chance at winning some silverware, their postseason success would probably have to come from the same place as their regular-season success: Binnington.
Like we said, Binnington struggled for stretches of the playoffs, but his flashes of brilliance were perfectly timed (late in the Western Conference finals, and late in the Stanley Cup Final). Save percentage is the most important factor for a team’s success. That’s true over the course of a season, and it’s also true over the course of a one-game, winner-takes-all Game 7. Binnington stopped 97 percent of the Bruins shots on goal Wednesday night, and the Blues are champions as a result.
And then there was Ryan O’Reilly, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP. Before the 2018-19 season began, the Blues traded three players — Tage Thompson, Vladimir Sobotka and Patrik Berglund, which is a pretty solid haul — to the Buffalo Sabres to bring O’Reilly into the mix. All he did from then on was have the best season of his already excellent career in terms of points scored and position himself as a frontrunner for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the league’s best two-way forward. That brilliance carried over into the playoffs: O’Reilly finished in a tie with the Bruins’ left-winger Brad Marchand as the top scorer in points in the postseason, and finished alone atop the scoring list in the Stanley Cup Final.
Before they won on Wednesday, the Blues had waited longer than any franchise in NHL history to lift their first Cup. They made the playoffs every season from 1979-80 to 2003-04. Their average regular-season points percentage from 2011-12 to 2016-17 was an astonishing .648 — during that stretch, they were perennially considered among the favorites to win the Western Conference and the Stanley Cup Final. And yet somehow during each of those stretches of dominance, they never advanced to the final, let alone lifted the Cup.
Instead, it took an imperfect team led by an imperfect goalie to deliver St. Louis its first-ever Cup victory. Which is kind of perfect.
CORRECTION (JUNE 13, 2019, 11:06 a.m.): A previous version of this article said the Blues were outperforming the Philadelphia Flyers in early January. In fact, the two teams had the same number of points at that time. Also, the names of two players involved in a trade for Ryan O’Reilly were misspelled. They are Vladimir Sobotka, not Vladminir, and Patrik Berglund, not Patrick. Footnotes
The Blues had the same number points as the Philadelphia Flyers, who ended the season 16 points outside contention.

Playoff Kawhi Leonard Is The New Playoff LeBron James | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Owen Phillips,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kawhi-leonard-has-stepped-up-his-game-in-the-playoffs-like-few-others/,"Twitter Kawhi Leonard’s postseason numbers dwarf what he did in the regular season.
This year’s NBA postseason has been a striking reminder of the difference between regular season and playoff basketball, particularly with respect to individual performance. The three finalists for the MVP award — James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Paul George — all failed to match their production from the regular season in this year’s playoffs . On the other end of the spectrum is Kawhi Leonard, who after “ load-managing ” his way through the regular season, is now considered one of, if not the , best basketball players alive and has the Toronto Raptors one win away from their first NBA championship. (That win could come Thursday night in Game 6 in Oakland.)
Before this year, LeBron James was the often-cited case of the rare player who took his already outstanding game to an even higher level in the playoffs. But during this year’s postseason, it’s Leonard, the two-way force of nature, who has become the go-to example of a player who seemingly flips a switch and magically turns into a better version of himself once the playoffs start.
During the regular season, Leonard posted a +5.0 box plus/minus (BPM) , a catch-all stat designed to capture a player’s all-around impact. Leonard’s regular season BPM was 15th best in the league. But in the playoffs, Leonard’s BPM has risen to +9.0 , tied for second-best among all postseason players.
It’s rare to see a player of Leonard’s stature lift his BPM at all in the playoffs. Of the 15 players that had a regular season BPM of +5.0 or better, 1 only Leonard and Nikola Jokic increased their output in the playoffs. It’s even rarer to see someone as productive as Leonard lift his BPM by as much as he did.
Leonard’s BPM playoff bump — +4 — is tied for the 16th largest increase since the NBA-ABA merger among players that logged at least 2,000 regular season minutes and 500 playoff minutes in a single year. Some other players to increase their BPM by at least 4.0 points include Hakeem Olajuwon during the 1997 playoffs, Tim Duncan during his 2003 title run and LeBron James during his 2016 title run, to name a few.
And this isn’t anything new for Leonard: He’s been upping his game in the postseason ever since he came into the league as a role player with the San Antonio Spurs.
Below is a similar chart to the first, but this time we’re looking at career performance — comparing a player’s career average BPM in the regular season to their career average BPM in the playoffs since the merger in 1977. (In order to make sure our sample consists of players who played often in both the regular season and deep into the playoffs, each player’s career average BPM has been weighted by both their minutes played in the regular season and playoffs. 2 This gives us a better representative sample of players to compare Leonard’s career against.)
Most of the players that have a similar career BPM in the regular season to Leonard are right at or just below the dotted line, meaning they either get worse during the playoffs or at best they don’t improve. The few players who buck that trend include Michael Jordan, LeBron, Olajuwon and Leonard himself. Each of these players consistently dominated the league in the regular season and even more so in the playoffs.
The players with the biggest difference between their regular season and playoff career BPM tend to be toward the middle of the pack in regular season BPM for the simple reason that the lower a player’s regular season number, the more room they have to improve their playoff production. Still, despite having one of the higher career BPMs in the regular season, Leonard ranks sixth on the list. The players in front of him are Isiah Thomas (the Pistons legend , not the other more recent one ), Draymond Green, Rajon “Playoff” Rondo , Derek Fisher and Robert “Big Shot Bob” Horry. Those are the type of guys Green was referring to when he talked about the difference between 82-game players and 16-game players .

This NBA Offseason Was Already Going To Be Chaotic. Then Klay Tore His ACL. | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Neil Paine,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-nba-offseason-was-already-going-to-be-chaotic-then-klay-tore-his-acl/,"Klay Thompson tore his ACL during the third quarter of Game 6 of the NBA Finals. Lachlan Cunningham / Getty Images
The confetti had barely settled on the Toronto Raptors’ championship celebration before another stunning injury report hit their NBA Finals opponents, the Golden State Warriors, like a punch to the stomach: Golden State’s Klay Thompson has suffered a torn ACL in his left knee, his agent Greg Lawrence tells ESPN.
— Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) June 14, 2019
The news about Klay Thompson came mere days after the late-night revelation that teammate Kevin Durant would miss the entire 2019-20 NBA season with a ruptured Achilles tendon . Taken together, both injuries cast uncertainty over the Warriors’ long-term future — and further complicate a free-agency summer that already had promised to be one of the wildest ever.
One-half of the Splash Brothers (with Stephen Curry), Thompson has been a founding member of this Warriors dynasty. He was drafted just two years after Curry — we don’t talk about that Ekpe Udoh pick sandwiched in between — and a year ahead of Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes, part of the masterful series of selections that laid the foundation for Golden State’s subsequent dominance. Since the Warrior dynasty’s first championship in 2014-15, Thompson ranks fifth on the team in both Value Over Replacement Player and Win Shares in the playoffs (behind Curry, Green, Durant and Andre Iguodala).
Does that sound low? There’s a case to be made that the advanced metrics might perennially underrate Thompson on defense, where his reputation — he was named to the All-Defensive second team this season — vastly outstrips his statistical indicators . And although Thompson’s durability does factor into metrics such as VORP and Win Shares, he has played in 615 of 640 possible regular-season games (96 percent) in his career, providing a welcome sense of stability for a team all too familiar with injuries to stars.
Certainly Thompson should get credit for the way his contract has enabled the Warriors to build their superteam around him. Thompson has often spoken about his love for playing in the Bay Area, and he’s pondered taking pay cuts to stay with the franchise. He was paid a comparatively modest $69 million these past four seasons as the Warriors won four straight conference championships and two titles (years when our CARMELO projections pegged his actual worth at $117 million).
However, Thompson is due to become a free agent this summer, as part of a star-studded class that was also supposed to include his fellow Warrior Durant. 1 Because Thompson missed out on All-NBA recognition this season (it’s difficult to call it a “snub” given his good-but-not-great metrics), he won’t qualify for the NBA’s “supermax” category of extensions — which means the most he can make is about $190 million over five years if he re-signs with Golden State, or $141 over four years if he signs elsewhere. (By comparison, Curry re-signed for five years and $201 million two summers ago.)
The timetable on recovering from ACL tears starts as low as seven months, but it generally requires nine months to a year before returning to the court. So Thompson probably will miss most (if not all) of the 2019-20 season with his injury, just like Durant. But in the wake of Durant’s injury, we already have seen reports that teams wouldn’t hesitate to sign KD to a maximum deal despite the uncertainty around his health. Thompson isn’t at the same level of franchise-altering stardom as Durant, but he is one year younger, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see rival teams take a similar approach to his free agency this summer.
On the one hand, Thompson’s injury is a bad omen for a player whose game is built on a tremendous amount of high-stress activity. According to Second Spectrum data compiled by ESPN’s Stats & Information Group, no player in the NBA has run a greater distance over the past five seasons (including the playoffs) than the 1,267 miles Thompson covered. On the other hand, though, Thompson is a historically great shooter with one of the quickest releases the game has ever seen , so his skills figure to age well even if the injury costs him some athleticism.
If the Warriors do part ways with both Thompson and Durant this summer, it’s worth wondering where the losses will leave a team that, not very long ago, looked like the most dominating force in the history of the NBA . According to the Elias Sports Bureau, a Golden State team without Klay, KD and a few other notable players who may depart has the potential to become just the fifth defending NBA Finalist ever to return less than half of its scoring from the previous season. (Thompson and Durant combined to score 3,707 of Golden State’s 9,650 points this season, or 38.4 percent, but the Warriors also have eight other players who aren’t under contract for 2019-20.) What happened to the other teams on the list? 2 You don’t wanna know. 3
The Warriors probably won’t fall quite so far; before the Thompson news, betting markets opened with Golden State as favorites to win the 2019-20 NBA championship, as the defending-champ Raptors dropped into a tie with the Houston Rockets for the fifth-best odds (behind the Warriors, Lakers, Bucks and Clippers). But those numbers are already destined to change with the reports about Thompson, so it’s just a question of how far Golden State falls — particularly relative to its two Western Conference challengers in Los Angeles, both of whom have designs on the summer’s top trade and free-agent targets . Will the Warriors not even be favored to win the West next year? That remains to be seen. But the severity of Thompson’s injury tacked another depressing note onto the end of Golden State’s season, and it adds another layer of uncertainty to the team’s future as a dynasty. Footnotes
Assuming KD rejects his current contract’s option to remain with Golden State for the 2019-20 season.
Which were the 1998-99 Bulls, the 1948-49 Bullets, the 2004-05 Lakers and the 2018-19 Cavaliers.
All finished with a losing record.

The Citizenship Question Could Cost California And Texas A Seat In Congress | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Amelia Thomson-Deveaux,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-citizenship-question-could-cost-california-and-texas-a-seat-in-congress/,"Politics Podcast: Who Are The Swing Voters In 2020? The Citizenship Question Could Cost California And Texas A Seat In Congress The census could fail to count millions of people if the Supreme Court allows the new question to be added.

In a matter of days, the Supreme Court may dramatically change the census . The court is slated to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a question about citizenship to the 2020 form. When the case was argued back in April, many court-watchers predicted that the court’s five conservative justices were ready to side with the administration. The proposal sounds innocuous enough, but social scientists and civil rights advocates worry it will deter vulnerable populations — particularly undocumented people , other immigrants and their families — from answering the census. If that happens, many people from these groups will be at risk of not being counted and huge swaths of American life will be affected. The results of the count determine everything from where grocery stores are placed to how congressional representatives are distributed .
There are few things we care more about around here than political apportionment (although, if we’re being honest, we care an awful lot about groceries, too). So we went in search of researchers who had estimated the potential effect of the citizenship question. We found several, none of whom agreed on just how big an impact this would have. But they were all on the same page about one thing — if the Supreme Court rules that the new question can be included, it could alter our political future.
Every 10 years, the updated census numbers are used to determine how many U.S. House members each state will get. So figuring out who might be missed and where can tell us a lot about who stands to gain political representation and who stands to lose. Forecasting that amounts to sophisticated guesswork, since the question hasn’t yet been field-tested by the Census Bureau — a decision that many experts regard as a scientific cardinal sin. But that hasn’t stopped researchers from trying to fill the void.
I talked to three political scientists who all took a stab at quantifying how much each state’s population would change if some of the people who seem most likely to be affected by the question — immigrants, noncitizens and Latinos — simply went uncounted. All three used different assumptions about how people will feel when they’re confronted with the questionnaire — a kind of statistical choose-your-own-adventure game. You can see five estimates calculated by those researchers in the chart below:
These estimates make different assumptions about who will be missed by the census, which led to fairly substantial differences in how evenly the undercount was distributed and which states were most affected. Estimates for population loss in California alone ranged from almost 700,000 to over 1.8 million. Notably, the Census Bureau’s own estimate (Scenario 1) was by far the most conservative. Let’s take a closer look: Scenarios 1 through 3 come from George Washington University’s Christopher Warshaw, 1 a political scientist who ran two analyses based at least in part on the Census Bureau’s estimate of the question’s effect, and a third based on his own survey experiment. 2 Scenario 4 comes from Bryce Dietrich, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Dietrich worked with the Washington Post to estimate the impact that an undercount of about 6 million Hispanics would have on state populations. Scenario 5 comes from political scientist Eric McGhee of the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, who estimated what would happen if the census was poorly conducted — a distinct possibility, given that the Census Bureau is perpetually strapped for cash — and 10 percent of households that include undocumented immigrants were missed .
The question for many political observers, of course, is what all of this will mean for what happens after the census, when the states are assigned seats in the House of Representatives based on their new population count. Some clear winners and losers emerge here. California would lose seats in all five undercount scenarios Estimates of how an undercount would affect the apportionment of U.S. Representatives after the 2020 census, for states where any impact was estimated in five scenarios from researchers Difference in number of seats due to undercount undercount scenario 1. 5.8% of noncitizens undercounted 0 2. 5.8% of noncitizens and Hispanics undercounted +1 3. 5.9% of Hispanics and 11.3% of foreign-born non-Latinos undercounted +1 4. Poorly conducted census and 10% of households with undocumented immigrants undercounted 0 5. 6 million Hispanics undercounted +1 1. Based on Census Bureau estimates from Aug. 2018. 2. Partially based on Census Bureau estimates from Aug. 2018. 3. Based on a survey experiment that tested how much less likely respondents were to say they would return the census form if the citizenship question was included. 4. Partially based on the undercount in the 1990 census. 5. Based on a survey experiment that tested how much less likely respondents were to respond to individual questions on the form if the citizenship question was included. 2020 population projections were derived by the researchers and vary from scenario to scenario. Sources: Christopher Warshaw, Bryce Dietrich and The Washington Post, Public policy institute of California
California loses at least one seat in all five scenarios, while Montana stands to gain one. Ohio, Minnesota and Alabama are all potential winners, depending on the scenario, while Texas, Arizona and Florida come out on the losing side in at least one estimate. “This is a fairly significant impact, especially when you consider that some of these states would stand to gain seats if not for this question,” Warshaw said.
We can’t really tell you which scenario is most likely to play out (assuming the court opens the door to any of them). It all hinges on which groups are ultimately missed in the final count and by how much. The actual effect of the citizenship question could be much larger than any of these estimates, if other groups refuse to respond as well. Or it could be smaller, if the Census Bureau is able to track down some of the people who don’t respond to the first questionnaire they send out. Most of these estimates are based on the idea that every person who doesn’t initially respond to the census, or who skips a question or two, won’t be counted. In reality, at least some of those people will almost certainly be included in the count because armies of census workers will fan out across the country next year to find people who didn’t respond to the initial request for information.
As the lawsuits over the citizenship question unfolded, Census Bureau officials argued that they will be able to respond to some of the fears swirling around the question through community outreach and follow-up . In an email, a Census Bureau spokesperson told me that in response to concerns about an undercount, the agency is “developing a robust communications campaign and working with communities across the country to communicate that responding to the census is safe, easy, and important.” The agency is also about to begin a test of the question that it says will help determine how many census workers are needed to follow up with people who don’t respond at first. Rob Santos, a researcher at the nonpartisan Urban Institute and the co-author of a recent report on miscounts and the census , said that these efforts could make a difference, but added that the intense publicity surrounding the citizenship question has already created an “atmosphere of fear and mistrust” in immigrant, refugee and Latino communities.
Nancy Mathiowetz, an expert on survey research, was also skeptical that the census’s follow-up efforts could fully mitigate the effect of the question. She pointed out that Latino citizens and undocumented people are already likely to be undercounted , and it’s not clear if the Census Bureau has any new tricks up its sleeve for reaching them. Some of the impact may also depend on the type of undercount that occurs. Failing to fill out part of the questionnaire, she said, might be less of a problem than leaving household members off an otherwise complete form, since the Census Bureau has said that it will try to fill in certain types of missing information using statistical techniques and administrative records , but it has no way of knowing if family members have simply been omitted. Several experts noted that conjecturing about a respondent’s race and ethnicity could create other kinds of data accuracy problems that could resurface when congressional and state legislative districts are drawn, but the issue for state-level apportionments is simply whether everyone is included in the total count — not whether all the information on each person’s form is correct.
At the end of the day, all of this sparring is a poor substitute for the rigorous, lengthy testing process that a new census question would usually undergo. If the citizenship question ends up on the questionnaire, another test of sorts will unfold in real time, with the entire American population as its subjects. And it will have concrete consequences for who gets political representation. To many social scientists and civil rights advocates, this seems like a needlessly dangerous experiment, and one that runs counter to the cautious, scientific spirit of the federal government’s largest statistical agency. But the Supreme Court may allow it to happen anyway — and if it does, we will soon learn more about just how resilient one of our nation’s oldest civic traditions really is. Footnotes
In one of the lower court trials, Warshaw submitted an expert report on behalf of the challengers to the administration’s plan.
Warshaw used a forecasting model to estimate what the U.S. population will be in 2020. The other researchers used slightly different methods to estimate the 2020 population, with slightly different results.

"Sure, The Twins’ Hitting Is Great. But Their Pitching Is The Real Surprise. | FiveThirtyEight",fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sure-the-twins-hitting-is-great-but-their-pitching-is-the-real-surprise/,"Jake Odorizzi has enjoyed one of the greatest year-to-year improvements in baseball. Duane Burleson / Getty Images
When Derek Falvey, chief baseball officer of the Minnesota Twins, was in the Cleveland Indians’ front office in the early 2010s, he started attending college coaching clinics. He visited events like Pitch-A-Palooza and the coaching boot camp at the Texas Baseball Ranch. He would sit in the back of conference rooms and listen.
“On the pro side, we keep everything tight to the vest. We don’t want to share with the other pro teams — they are competition,” Falvey told FiveThirtyEight. “What was really interesting for me to see is a lot of coaches sharing ideas. … There were guys from very small programs that had to find a way, with very limited budgets, to compete with other D-1 programs.”
Falvey saw amateur coaches using weighted-ball training , high-speed cameras and biomechanics labs in player development before professional clubs ever did. He looked around and thought, “Why couldn’t any of these coaches be in professional or even Major League Baseball?”
“I’m probably a little naive,” Falvey said. “But if you’re coaching [basketball] at Kentucky and you go to the Chicago Bulls, no one blinks. … That’s pretty normal. In baseball, it hasn’t been.”
There are some exceptions. Derek Johnson — who made an impression on Falvey when he was at Vanderbilt — has advanced through the pro ranks and has helped Cincinnati to the third-lowest staff ERA in baseball in his first year as the Reds pitching coach. And Falvey hired former University of Washington assistant coach Tanner Swanson to be the Twins catching coordinator after the 2017 season. The Astros have increasingly turned to college coaches to fill minor league coaching roles . But no one had made a direct jump from the amateur ranks to a major league dugout in nearly 40 years before this season. That drought ended in November when Falvey hired Arkansas pitching coach Wes Johnson to the same role for the Twins.
Johnson — who served as the pitching coach at Mississippi State, Dallas Baptist and Central Arkansas before joining the Razorbacks staff — had been one of the innovators presenting at those events that Falvey attended. And now Johnson is translating his techniques from outside the professional game to the Minnesota Twins, who have been one of the best teams in the majors this season , exceeding expectations along the way .
These Twins were always supposed to hit. Eddie Rosario was becoming a quality bat before this season, and Max Kepler has also broken out. Hopes were high for Byron Buxton and Miguel Sano, elite prospects who struggled in 2018. The Twins added veteran free agent sluggers Nelson Cruz and C.J. Cron, too. And those efforts have paid off: The group leads the major leagues in homers.
What the Twins were thought to lack this season was pitching. Last year, their starting pitchers ranked 22nd in ERA . While Jose Berrios had emerged as a top arm, the rest of the staff was littered with question marks.
What the Twins set out to do this past offseason was to try to make their own pitchers better. And that started with Johnson, who had the Twins’ starting pitchers ranked third in ERA entering play Monday.
One of the most conspicuous characteristics of Johnson is his height: He stands at a modest 5-foot-7 . Because many pitching coaches are former MLB pitchers themselves, they’re typically tall. But when Johnson visits the mound, every Twins pitcher towers over him. This partially explains his willingness to adopt unorthodox practices.
“Look at me, man,” Johnson said to FiveThirtyEight. “I’m not a very big guy. I only played college baseball. For me as a player, I always had to look for things that could make me better.”
As a coach, he first tried weighted balls back in 2003. This is the practice of throwing heavier and lighter balls that can increase throwing velocity by adding shoulder strength and arm speed. He became known as “ the czar of velocity .” Dallas Baptist paid for him to study biomechanics in 2012. He brought high-speed cameras to Arkansas. So far, integrating approaches and tools — including streamlining mechanics to add velocity and training cameras on pitchers’ releases to help develop pitches — have made a smooth transition to the top level of baseball.
The Twins have improved not only their staff ERA but also their underlying metrics. The differential between their strikeout and walk rates has improved along with their fielding-independent pitching, a mark that attempts to isolate what pitchers can control for in preventing runs while removing factors like the quality of the defense behind them. The Twins have also added 0.6 mph in fastball velocity this season .

Turns Out The NL East Didn’t Have Four Good Teams,fivethirtyeight.com,Neil Paine (neil.paine@fivethirtyeight.com),06-18-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/turns-out-the-nl-east-didnt-have-four-good-teams/,"Turns Out The NL East Didn’t Have Four Good Teams It’s looking like a two-team race between the Braves and Phillies. The Phillies and Braves are a combined 53-36 since April 28. Kevin C. Cox / Getty Images
One of the most entertaining series in baseball last weekend pitted the Atlanta Braves against the Philadelphia Phillies, with the teams splitting a pair of late-game comeback wins before the Braves ran away with a 15-1 laugher in Sunday’s rubber match. We should get used to this. One of these two clubs is probably going to win the National League East, and both could figure significantly into the NL’s postseason picture. In what once looked like a crowded division battle, the Braves and Phillies have emerged as clear favorites, largely leaving their rivals in the dust.
Before the season, we called the NL East the “tightest division race in baseball,” and that did hold true … for about a month. On April 28, the division’s top four teams — the Phillies, Braves, New York Mets and Washington Nationals — sat within three games of each other , even if Washington and (to a lesser extent) Atlanta had scuffled some coming out of the gate. Things have changed since then, however. The Phillies and Braves are a combined 53-36 since April 28, while the Mets and Nats are 41-49. (The fifth-place Miami Marlins have been more competitive recently as well, but they never really stood a chance of vying for the division or the playoffs.)
Although the division is far from locked up, the two teams at the top now have a combined 86 percent chance of winning the East, according to the FiveThirtyEight model . Here’s how our model has judged the state of the division race over time:
Atlanta pulled into the division driver’s seat in part by virtue of this weekend’s series victory over Philadelphia (which included that landslide 15-1 win) and yet another blowout over the Mets on Monday night. That’s nothing new; the team has generally been on a tear all month. Since the start of June, no club has added more to its Elo rating than the Braves, who have won 13 of 16 contests and have boosted their rating by 14 points — from 1513 (16th in MLB) to 1527 (10th) — over that span.
Rookie Braves left fielder Austin Riley, who made his debut on May 15, has hit a remarkable 11 home runs in his first 31 MLB games, while Ronald Acuña Jr., Freddie Freeman, Ozzie Albies and Josh Donaldson continue to enjoy strong seasons. (Even shortstop Dansby Swanson has begun to live up to his top-prospect billing from several years ago .) Moreover, the Braves’ pitching — already highlighted by 21-year-old ace Mike Soroka (2.12 ERA) and a resurgent Julio Teheran (2.92) — figures to improve depth-wise with the addition of free agent Dallas Keuchel , who is set to debut for Atlanta soon.
All of this helps explain how Atlanta has built a 59 percent probability of winning the East and a 78 percent chance of returning to the playoffs after its breakout season last year . But before the Braves pulled ahead this week, the Phillies had led the NL East in division win probability in each of the previous eight weeks.
Philly has loads of top-level talent on its side, among Bryce Harper, Aaron Nola, Rhys Hoskins and company. Some of that talent has underachieved — Harper (on pace for 2.3 wins above replacement ) 1 hasn’t quite been a dominant force in his first Phillie season, 2 while Nola (4.89 ERA) has struggled to replicate last year’s near-Cy Young campaign . But others have stepped up: Hoskins is one of the game’s most underrated players , offseason pickups J.T. Realmuto and Jean Segura are performing well, and Nola’s downturn has been mostly offset in the rotation by Zach Eflin’s better-than-expected numbers (2.81 ERA). Even when future Hall of Fame outfielder Andrew McCutchen was lost for the season with an ACL tear in early June, new acquisition Jay Bruce started raking (1.085 OPS) in his place.
The Mets and Nationals — who sit in third and fourth place , respectively — are running short on time if they want to stage their own comebacks. Our Elo ratings think that Washington (1523) is effectively interchangeable with the Braves (1527) and Phillies (1520) on a talent basis. But even if every remaining game is a coin flip , the Nats’ nine-game deficit will be difficult to dig out of, particularly with three teams ahead of them in the division race and six teams running ahead for the second wild card. Meanwhile, New York’s roster is a cut below (1508 Elo) regardless of its many offseason moves — and that’s in spite of breakout performances from Pete Alonso (on pace for 5.5 WAR), Jeff McNeil (3.5) and Dominic Smith (2.9).
For some hope, perhaps the Nats and Mets can look to Philly’s beneficial early luck in both close games (worth three extra wins) and sequencing (worth another four wins) as a sign that the Phillies might fall off the pace set by their 39-32 record. But the Braves have few such holes to poke in their resume, and the gap between the East’s top two and next two (5½ games) looks daunting as the second half of the season approaches.
Maybe that means the 2019 National League could be shaping up to look a little like 1993 all over again , when the Braves and Phillies battled all season for NL supremacy. Atlanta was stocked with Hall of Famers and still relatively early in a dynasty that would ultimately span into the mid-2000s; Philadelphia had a motley group of mulleted upstarts who weren’t supposed to contend but ended up winning 97 games. This time, the roles could be recast with Soroka playing Greg Maddux, Harper as Lenny Dykstra (a stark contrast in conduct but not talent), Realmuto as Darren Daulton and Acuña as Ron Gant.
Back in ’93, a Braves-Phillies NLCS determined a spot in the World Series . This year, the ever-dominant Dodgers (to whom our model assigns a near-certain playoff probability and a 103-win projection) will probably have something to say about the pennant. But the East, at the very least, appears to run through Atlanta and Philadelphia again.

Even Blowouts Tell Us Something About The USWNT’s Chances,fivethirtyeight.com,Jake Lourim,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/even-blowouts-tell-us-something-about-the-uswnts-chances/,"+8 Source: FIFA
Wins like the Americans’ rout against Thailand, which ranked as the third-worst team entering the tournament according to the Soccer Power Index, 1 aren’t the kind of game they can expect in the knockout stage. While the USWNT has yet to face a real challenge, this draw, at least, has had its benefits. Lopsided scores in the first two games allowed Ellis to rotate her lineups, inserting seven new starters . Through two games, every American player besides the backup goalkeepers has appeared in a game , and no outfield player has played every minute of both. In addition to saving legs, those comfortable victories helped with confidence, creating a sense that the U.S. is playing its best at the right time. “First of all, it’s obviously for morale purposes and cohesion and team and all that, it’s fantastic,” Ellis said after the Chile match . “It’s a happy camp.”
Sweden, which also earned wins against Chile and Thailand , has tested the Americans as much as any team in the world over the past four years. Sweden beat the U.S. in the group stage of the 2011 World Cup, and in 2015 the sides battled to a scoreless draw in which possession was about even 2 and the U.S. managed just two shots on goal. The following summer, the Americans lost in the Olympic quarterfinals for the first time when Sweden beat them in a penalty kick shootout.
That Olympic loss to Sweden sparked a tweak in Ellis’s strategy in preparation for the next World Cup. Coming off a frustrating game in which Sweden’s solid defense made it difficult for the U.S. to generate opportunities, Ellis moved from a 4-4-2 formation to a 4-3-3 , pushing forward more to pressure opposing back lines. “Coming out of the Olympics, I said we’ve got to make sure we’re prepared for this new piece of evolution,” she told reporters before this World Cup.
The result is a star-studded lineup paced in the final third by veterans Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, Tobin Heath and Alex Morgan. The attack-focused Americans have bombarded their opponents with shots in their first two games — 65 in total, 30 on goal. They have shot more in each 2019 matchup than in any of their seven 2015 tests. (All seven 2015 opponents were also rated higher in ESPN’s SPI than Thailand and Chile are this year.)
The U.S. now leads the World Cup in expected goals , and that firepower is a good omen for the knockout stage. In hindsight, group-stage wins of 8-0, 2-0 and 7-0 prepared Norway in 1995 to take down the U.S. in the semifinals and Germany in the final. By contrast, the last time the U.S. didn’t win the World Cup (in 2011), it also lost a group-stage match for the first time — against Sweden.
With an advantage in goal differential, the U.S. needs only a draw Thursday to win Group F and set up a match with Spain in the round of 16. But if the team’s first 180 minutes are any indication, the Americans won’t be sitting back on defense. Ellis said after the Chile match that she feared “manipulating or planning or overthinking something,” and another strong showing would build more confidence. The early part of the group stage was an easy road for the U.S., but the knockout phase will not be. After she scored twice against Chile, Lloyd told reporters , “We are climbing up a mountain now, and it’s only going to get harder.”

It’s yet another demonstration of how partisanship is the dominant force in today’s politics; these days, people overwhelmingly vote for the same party up and down the ticket . Congressional vote preferences may not drive the results of the presidential race (it’s more likely the other way around), but the former still reflect the latter. And if early generic-ballot polls are, as they seem to be, mildly predictive, then the fact that Democrats currently lead them by 6.2 points is a bad sign for President Trump. It suggests that the national political environment is still blue, and given how closely the House and presidential popular votes have lined up this century, that’s an important thing to keep in mind for the 2020 presidential election.

The exact wording of the question varies by pollster: For example, ABC News/The Washington Post asks , “If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were being held today, would you vote for the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate in your congressional district?” And NBC News/The Wall Street Journal asks , “What is your preference for the outcome of the upcoming congressional elections — a Congress controlled by Republicans or a Congress controlled by Democrats?” Occasionally, a pollster will attempt to figure out what district a voter is in and provide them with the specific names of the candidates running in the district, but this is uncommon.
Democrats’ final margin of victory in the 2018 national House popular vote was 8.6 points.

We limited our analysis to the 1996-2016 cycles because generic ballot polls conducted in those years surveyed likely voters. In 1992 and previous presidential years, Gallup mostly surveyed all adults — a population that is very different from , and not very representative of, likely voters.
Harry’s analysis went back much further than 1994 — all the way to the 1946 midterm election — and found that the average error was even smaller: 2 percentage points.
Specifically, I took an average of the margins in each pollster’s surveys of the generic congressional ballot and then averaged those averages. That way, one pollster can’t skew the numbers if it released a disproportionate number of polls.

Political Confessional: The 75-Year-Old Woman Who Prefers To Vote For Men,fivethirtyeight.com,Clare Malone (clare.malone@fivethirtyeight.com),06-19-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/political-confessional-the-75-year-old-woman-who-prefers-to-vote-for-men/,"Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGES
Welcome to Political Confessional , a column about the views that Americans are scared to share with their friends and neighbors. In an increasingly polarized political climate, adherence to party or ideological orthodoxy on the issues of the day seems de rigueur. Social media serves only to amplify that perception at times. But Americans’ political views are often idiosyncratic and sometimes offensive, and they rarely adhere neatly to any particular party line. In this column, we want to dig into Americans’ messy opinions on politics, morality and social mores. We hope that this exercise gives readers a glimpse into the minds of those with whom they might disagree — or agree! If you have a political belief that you’re willing to share with us, fill out this form — we might get in touch.
This week, we talked to Patricia, a 75-year-old white woman from Ohio. Patricia wrote: “When given a choice between female & male Democratic candidates, I’ll choose the males, all things otherwise being equal.” She hasn’t shared the opinion much with friends because, as she put it, “I’m a relic from another era, knowingly biased, which embarrasses me.”
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Clare Malone: So, how did you get to this opinion?
Patricia: I would love to know. If I had to guess, I would say it’s because I was born in 1944, and coming up, I had male people in all the roles that I was apt to use. Like a doctor, my father was a CPA so he did my taxes, and you know, having handymen around the house — they were men not women, and I just came to believe in them and I have a prejudice. It’s just there.
CM: Do you think that men are more competent and capable?
Patricia: It’s just where my mind would go first, if given a choice. Like, I had a female doctor and she really wasn’t very good. I have an excellent doctor now and he’s male. And I think if two doctors are standing in front of me in the future — one male, one female — I would choose the male.
CM: When did you start noticing that about yourself?
Patricia: I think in the 1970s when I was working for a man who was talking about a colleague who had left the company and gone elsewhere. And he said, “Can you believe it, he’s working for a woman — what kind of man is that?” And I was instantly offended and I thought how wrong what he said was. But then came flooding through to my head was the acknowledgment that yeah, if I looked at my boss being a female, I wouldn’t have as much confidence in her as I would in a male. Because I’d always had male bosses and they were good. And I don’t want to say that I dislike women because I do like them and I do feel that there are women who are spectacular, but it’s that initial thing, seeing the two compared, that’s when it hits me, and I have to talk myself down from that ledge because I know that it’s nutty and I know that there’s no logic to what I’m doing so I know that I need to rethink a choice I might be making.
CM: Do you think that any of this has to do with your own self-confidence?
Patricia: No, I’ve been pretty self-confident all my life. It never occurred to me in some instances to even doubt that I could do what I set out to do. I wanted to be a disc jockey, so I became a disc jockey. I wanted to have a TV show, so I applied and I got that. I wanted to work in advertising, and I worked in that. I think I can do anything basically, except fly an airplane.
CM: Do you think sexism has been a big part of your life? Do you think people in those jobs you just talked about ever thought that you weren’t as competent because you were a woman?
Patricia: No. In fact, men have stood up for me and supported me in jobs for decades. I don’t know why I got here. I really do think it’s a function largely of the era when I was born.
CM: Have you talked to other women of your era about this, and do you know if they feel the same way?
Patricia: Well, since this is a thing I wouldn’t confess to my friends, no. I had a close friendship with two women who are extremely accomplished, and I just would not have brought it up with them.
CM: Do you feel lonely in this thought? Do you think other people have it?
Patricia: Well, I haven’t really discussed it with women, so I don’t know if others do. I have expressed this to is my daughter, and she just shakes her head and wonders where she went wrong.
CM: How did you talk to your daughter about gender bias, if you did?
Patricia: I didn’t when I was raising her. She’s almost 50 years old, and it’s only in recent times [that they talk about it]. For instance, this current run for president I told her that I support Joe Biden because he gives me the feeling that Daddy’s home and everything’s going to be OK again. We’re going to be sane for a change. And she’ll bring up, “Well what about Elizabeth Warren?” And I say, I just don’t want to be lectured by a school marm for four or eight years. But the fact is, I like a lot of what she stands for. And I feel like going with Joe Biden is a step backward but for me it’s a comfortable step. I think we need to regain some footing.
CM: How did you feel about Hillary Clinton in the last election?
Patricia: I voted for her, but I love Hillary. She’s just so competent. And I’ve admired her for decades. And I envied her being married to Bill Clinton.
CM: What do you think the difference is between Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren?
Patricia: One thing is how they come across when they’re speaking. I feel like Warren’s talking down to me. I think Hillary is up on a higher plane, and I just love her, and I think it was just being exposed for decades to her competence.
CM: Do you think your like of Hillary Clinton has to do with your like of her husband as well?
Patricia: I really didn’t pay much attention to Bill Clinton until the impeachment stuff. I’m really not someone who pays attention to extramarital sex. Some of my best lovers were married. Who worries about extramarital sex? I really liked the fact that Hillary stayed with him because I thought, “What better companion could you have after dinner when you sit down to talk?” That man is fascinating. And I would have hated to see her throw him away. A lot of people find fault with the fact that she stayed with him. I think it’s a plus after her name.
CM: Do you like any of the other women who are running this year?
Patricia: I like Kamala Harris. I think she has a lot of male characteristics. She seems solid when she’s not being giggly in interviews and she answers questions seriously. I admire her and I like what she’s saying. I did like Amy Klobuchar until it came out how she treated her staff. And my liking of her, by the way, was largely started because she didn’t ask Al Franken to resign.
CM: So I’m assuming you don’t like Kirsten Gillibrand?
Patricia: Oh my God, no. All she needs is horns and a tail and she’s the devil.
CM: Have you talked to men about your bias toward men over women?
Patricia: I don’t think so, but if someone looked at my whole life, they would see that most of my friends have been male.
CM: Why do you think that is?
Patricia: I don’t know! I guess I just like men. I worked for a corporation where I was the only woman in management. The men there, especially my boss, treated me very well, and the women treated me badly. I had a secretary who refused to answer my phone, refused to make copies for me, she was just hostile. I remember going to my boss, and I said, “What can I do about her?” And he had a good question for me. He said, “What would you do if you were a man?” I said, “Oh, I’d fire her.” And he said, “So there you are.”
I remember in that company they were having a retreat for all the managers, I remember my boss saying I was certainly invited, but he wondered if I wanted to go — it was at a lodge with all these men and they would go fishing and have mutual support kinds of exercises. And I chose not to go.
CM: Do you wish you could have been friends or friendlier with the women at your office? Would that have made things better for you?
Patricia: I would have liked to have them have a better sense of who I was. I didn’t really want to hang out.
CM: Do you think there’s ever a way you grow out of this way of thinking? Is it something you could change?
Patricia: I think that I at least pause and think now, versus how I would have been automatic in the past. But as far as changing — even sitting here right now, I know that my preference is for men.
CM: If I were a man asking you these questions, do you think you would think about this interview differently or answer questions differently?
Patricia: No. I kind of chuckled when I thought about a female calling me — we’ll find out just how much I trust men over women! But no, I don’t have that impression at all.
CM: Would you consider yourself a feminist?
Patricia: No, I wouldn’t. Not consciously. My daughter is. I am not. My granddaughter is. But no. And in fact, the MeToo era has really not registered with me. I like men, and I don’t want to see careers ruined over somebody making advances toward someone. There are the egregious examples that we’ve seen in the news that are assault — they’re horrible, they’re detrimental to a woman’s career. But overall, when I hear younger women, they seem to have set up men to a certain point as almost the enemy. And in all my years in business, I couldn’t even count how many times men made passes at me. I was never offended, and some were a little more than just a couple of words, you know. I had a boss who pulled me onto his lap. All I did was laugh and get off.
CM: You’re saying you learned how to deal with those things?
Patricia: It felt like I could deal with it and at times liked it, depending on the man.

When Trying To Save The World Also Trashes It,fivethirtyeight.com,Maggie Koerth-Baker (maggie.koerth-baker@fivethirtyeight.com),06-19-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-trying-to-save-the-world-also-trashes-it/,"Mauricio Urbina was trying to save the planet on the day he realized he was simultaneously destroying it. A biologist who studies the bodies of fish and other sea creatures, Urbina was working on a project to understand what happens to crabs that eat tiny particles of plastic waste thrown out by careless humans. But after one particularly long day in the lab, he looked down and noticed — he was a careless human. A lot of his tools were plastic and would be thrown out after a single use, contributing to the stream of waste packing landfills and polluting waterways. He was working on the solution, but he was part of the problem.
The process of doing scientific research — even the kind of research dedicated to environmental sustainability — isn’t always environmentally sustainable itself. But even as scientists try to make their profession more green, they’re finding themselves struggling with a problem that’s familiar far beyond the halls of academia: How do you live sustainably when the things you need to live are often, by their very nature, unsustainable?
Across the nation and around the world, scientific laboratories create an amazing amount of plastic waste , consume large amounts of water, create risks from hazardous chemicals and use significantly more energy than other buildings of the same size, said Star Scott, Green Lab Program coordinator for the University of Georgia.
The problem is big enough that it’s sometimes hard to wrap statistics around it. For instance, nobody knows exactly how much plastic waste is generated by labs. The experts I spoke to were unaware of any kind of comprehensive audit. But after his crab-induced revelation, Urbina tried to come up with an estimate. Extrapolating from the quantity of plastic thrown out by his own university’s biosciences department and the number of bioscience research facilities worldwide, he calculated that research could account for some 6 million tons of plastic waste every year — about 2 percent of all the plastics junked annually. And that’s just from biosciences and medical research alone.
Meanwhile, the physical building that a laboratory sits in consumes huge amounts of resources, including five to 10 times more energy than an office building. If half the labs in the U.S. reduced their energy use by 30 percent, it would be equivalent to more 840,000 households going dark, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That’s twice the number of households in the entire state of Delaware. That’s the scale we’re talking about. “[The scientists are] always blown away by their usage,” Scott said. “They can’t believe the energy, the water, the waste they’re generating.”
There are ways to reduce these impacts, of course. Scientists weren’t always reliant on plastics to do their research. Petri dishes, test tubes, the tiny suction droppers called pipettes — all of that stuff used to be routinely made from glass. After each use, these tools were washed or run through an autoclave, a box capable of sterilizing equipment with high heat. Urbina is an example of a researcher who has swung back toward using washable, reusable glass tools. He’s also training his grad students and undergrads in behaviors that seem obvious but that experts said aren’t done routinely in labs — like shutting off lights or closing air vents when they aren’t in use. Other sustainability programs promote the use of shelf-stable chemicals that allow scientists to store biological and genetic samples at room temperature, reducing the need for energy-sucking industrial freezers. Those changes matter, experts said.
At the same time, much of the waste creation and resource consumption in science happens for very good reasons. This isn’t a situation where you can trim the fat off and end up with a nice steak. The meat is too marbled for that.
Take the plastics problem, for example. While there are certainly labs like Urbina’s, where switching to glass is relatively easy to do, that shift gets harder the more crucial perfectly sterile equipment becomes to your process. Before she became the University of Georgia’s sustainability director, Scott worked in a plant ecology lab where her team threw out maybe 400 plastic test tubes every week. They wanted to reduce their waste but couldn’t get glass clean enough, reliably enough. Any impurity would alter the research.
Or think about the electricity use in labs, much of which comes from the energy-hogging freezers and the fume hoods that pull fresh air into labs and suck potentially toxic gases out. You could make the hoods smaller or use fewer of them, but when you make those choices, you’re making trade-offs with safety in an environment where toxic gases can be a real risk. As for freezers, there are some biological samples, like RNA, that basically have to stay extremely cold if they’re going to be useful. “The truth is that once you’re in the lab setting, there’s not a lot of choices,” said Ilyssa Gordon, a professor of pathology at the Cleveland Clinic and director of the medical center’s Office for a Healthy Environment.
In that way, science faces a microcosm of a larger problem. There really are some easy things we can do to save the Earth — turn off the lights in an empty room, eat a little less red meat, recycle. But those things don’t approach the full scale of the problem. And tackling that full scale, for real-real? Well, it becomes a mess, because the environmental damage we don’t like is deeply embedded in our lifestyles. Even simple-seeming changes like getting rid of plastic drinking straws turned out to be much more complicated when a series of attempted straw bans led to able-bodied Americans discovering that their disabled neighbors viewed the straws not as a waste, but as a necessity.
Scientists haven’t come up with a straightforward solution to this problem, but ongoing efforts to make science more sustainable have highlighted one key fact: Sustainability is an issue that affects the whole system of science — including the suppliers who make the tools and the scientists who use them. That means to fix the problem, scientists will have to work with manufacturers to encourage them to use more sustainable materials; they’ll have to coordinate with city recycling programs to make sure that the stuff they send to a recycling center is actually being recycled; they’ll have to rethink processes of research to see if there are other ways they could get the same results for less waste. You can’t make the lab sustainable without addressing all parts of the system outside the lab, Scott and Gordon told me, any more than you can save the world by changing how things work in only one household.

Which Democratic Candidates Are The Most Progressive On Criminal Justice Issues? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Perry Bacon Jr.,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democratic-candidates-are-the-most-progressive-on-criminal-justice-issues/,"Twitter
There are a lot of people running for president. That record-breaking field has made it hard to compare the candidates ideologically — overall and on individual issues.
The catch-all, macro metrics we usually rely on — the FiveThirtyEight trump score and DW-Nominate , for example — don’t work that well for the 2020 field. Those measures rely on congressional roll-call votes, and some of the candidates have never served in Congress (Pete Buttigieg and Andrew Yang, for example) or have not done so recently (Joe Biden and Jay Inslee). Also, some of the issues that the candidates are addressing on the trail, such as legalizing marijuana, haven’t really come up that much on Capitol Hill for votes, so those aren’t represented in the macro scores.
Another option for assessing the field is to go micro and look at each candidate’s current position on each issue. But that has problems, too. The 2020 Democratic primary has turned into something of a wonk-off — the candidates are releasing a seemingly endless string of policy papers . But these plans don’t necessarily tell you that much. You really need to be well-versed in a specific issue to suss out if a proposal is new — as opposed to merely what the Obama administration was already doing and any Democrat would do if elected — or different from another candidate’s positions.
So in the next few months, we’re going to try to bring a little clarity to the 2020 policy debates. The plan: ask every campaign a set of yes-or-no policy questions within a larger issue. To start, we asked the 23 most prominent Democratic presidential campaigns six questions about criminal justice policy. 1 The goal here is to reveal not only what the candidates might do if elected president, but also how that differs from the rest of the field — hence the decision to use yes-no questions, which will allow us (and you) to compare the candidates systematically.
How’d we choose the questions? There’s no formula for coming up with a manageable set of questions that adequately represent criminal justice (or any other issue). We picked policy issues that are already prominent in the news , as well as cribbing from the criminal justice platform of the Brennan Center for Justice , a left-leaning policy organization that has worked on these issues with both Democratic and Republican officials . We intentionally looked for questions that might illustrate differences between the candidates. For example, we assume that the field generally is in favor of steps to limit the number of people fined or sent to jail for marijuana use — basically all Democratic elected officials have that stance , as do many Republicans . Instead, we asked the candidates whether they support full legalization of marijuana, which lets us know which candidates want to go a step beyond the most politically safe position and which do not.
Here’s what we found:
Some takeaways: The field is way to the left of where the Democratic Party used to be on criminal justice issues
We got responses from 16 candidates. Thirteen of the 16 answered “yes” to at least four of the questions, indicating fairly liberal stands on criminal justice issues. In fact, 11 of the 16 support a criminal justice platform that I think would have been inconceivable even a decade ago for a presidential candidate who was actually trying to win (as opposed to running a more symbolic campaign). Those 11 all support abolishing the death penalty at the state and federal levels, legalizing marijuana at the state and federal levels, allowing people who are incarcerated to receive Pell Grants so that they can enroll in higher-education courses, and eliminating cash bail at all levels of government.
Two other candidates embraced at least four of the six ideas but with a slightly different mix. Tim Ryan doesn’t fully support getting rid of the death penalty; his campaign said he thinks there should be an exception for terrorists. But he favors an idea that some of the other candidates were hesitant to embrace: removing the Office of the Pardon Attorney from the Justice Department . (The Brennan Center argues that the department is run by prosecutors who may have an incentive to preserve conviction rates, creating potential conflicts of interest when it comes to issuing pardons. The center favors creating an independent board or commission that is outside the purview of the department to advise the president on pardons and commutations.) Inslee, meanwhile, also supports limiting the Justice Department’s role in pardons and commutations, but his aides did not give a clear “yes” or “no” to our question about cash bail.
It’s important to note that the candidates aligned with the Democrats’ most liberal wings (Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, for example) are not the only ones taking these stances. Cory Booker, Beto O’Rourke, Buttigieg and Ryan, who are all arguably more associated with the center-left of the party, were among the 13 taking clearly progressive stands on these issues. Another bloc of Democrats is more centrist
Not everyone was aligned on these issues, however. Michael Bennet , John Delaney and Amy Klobuchar were generally more cautious. That’s not too surprising — they seem to be positioning themselves as the more centrist candidates in this primary field.
These candidates do not reject the party’s shift left on criminal justice issues but didn’t go as far as many of the others in their responses. Delaney, for example, suggested that he supported legalization of marijuana at the federal level but said that states should be able to make their own decision. (Of course, it’s possible that if we had asked different criminal justice-related questions, the candidates might line up differently.) The field is mostly resistant to giving people who are incarcerated the ability to vote
Whether people who are incarcerated should be able to vote became an issue in the Democratic presidential contest a few months ago after Sanders answered a question at a town hall by saying that people shouldn’t lose their right to vote when they go to prison. In the aftermath, it became clear that many of the 2020 candidates were wary of that position. Of the 15 candidates who responded to our questions, only Sanders and long-shot hopeful Mike Gravel responded “yes” when asked if they supported “allowing at least some of those currently incarcerated to vote.” (Among the other candidates, O’Rourke came the closest to a “yes” — his campaign told us that he believes we should “rethink” the right to vote for “at least some” nonviolent offenders who are incarcerated.)

How A Supreme Court Ruling Could Supercharge Republicans’ Advantages In The States - FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-supreme-court-ruling-could-supercharge-republicans-advantages-in-the-states/,"Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGES
For months, Supreme Court obsessives (guilty as charged) have been waiting for the court to decide whether to permit the Trump administration to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. That decision could come down as soon as Thursday, but it might not be long before the topic is back in front of the high court. If the justices rule that the question can go on the form, the legal fallout from the ruling could get messy quickly.
[Related: The Citizenship Question Could Cost California And Texas A Seat In Congress ]
Much of the controversy around the question has focused on how it will affect the accuracy of the population count. There’s a reason for that — as I wrote earlier this week, census data helps guide countless decisions about American life, including how our congressional representatives are distributed . But there’s an additional fight brewing, and it has major implications for FiveThirtyEight’s other favorite topic: gerrymandering.
For years, some conservative advocates have been interested in using a census citizenship question to change how legislators draw their states’ electoral maps. The Constitution requires that the number of representatives each state gets be determined by its total population, but it’s not clear what the rules are for how states should draw the districts that elect those representatives, leaving the door open for states to argue for alternative ways of counting the population within districts. Specifically, conservatives have focused on drawing district boundaries based on the number of citizens , rather than the number of people . You can imagine the lawsuits that would come next.
The raw political stakes of the court’s decision were unexpectedly revealed last month, when a prominent Republican redistricting expert’s research was made public. In 2015, he had concluded in a study commissioned by a conservative news outlet that the citizenship question would provide lawmakers in Texas with the data they needed to draw maps that would be “advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.”
Our analysis of data from Andrew Beveridge, a sociologist and CEO of a data visualization firm called Social Explorer, confirms that removing noncitizens from the population count would likely help Republicans when redistricting season rolls around, by making it easier to shift the balance of political power from urban to rural areas. Using census data, Beveridge estimated how big each state’s congressional districts would need to be if only citizens of voting age were counted, then calculated how much each current district would need to grow or shrink to meet that threshold. 1
And it’s not just a matter of reshuffling a few people — several urban districts that are currently controlled by Democrats would have to gain well over a hundred thousand voters to meet the new population threshold in their state.
It might seem like growing in size would give a Democratic-leaning district more clout, but the opposite is much likelier to be true. Republican lawmakers could stuff more of their state’s Democratic-leaning voters into a smaller number of districts, giving the legislators more room to create districts where Democrats don’t have a majority. (This is the infamous “packing and cracking” that comes up all the time in gerrymandering articles.) According to one estimate by researchers at the Urban Institute, Republicans could stand to gain as many as two additional congressional seats if Texas was redistricted based on the number of citizens rather than the total population. And multiple redistricting experts told me that political power could be shifted away from diverse, growing cities like Houston and Dallas and toward rural areas of the state where fewer noncitizens (and fewer people in general) live.
While many congressional districts in Texas and Arizona would need double-digit population shifts to meet the new standard, the political benefits are less obvious in Missouri and Nebraska, at least in terms of congressional maps. But counting only citizens could lead to significant changes to state legislative districts, which are smaller than congressional districts and therefore likelier to be affected by changes in who’s counted for redistricting purposes. In 2016, when the Supreme Court heard a case about whether states should be required to draw their legislative districts using citizen-only populations , Beveridge estimated that if the country switched to the narrower population measure, every state would have to redraw at least some districts and found that the number of Republican-dominated maps would likely increase .
In that case, the justices ruled that states couldn’t be forced to draw maps using only citizens, which means the scenario predicted by Beveridge ultimately didn’t come to pass. But the justices didn’t weigh in on whether states could voluntarily adopt a different population measure — leaving the door open to future attempts.
If Texas or any other state tries to use data from the citizenship question for redistricting, the question will almost certainly end up back at the Supreme Court. If that happens, the justices will have to decide whether people who can’t vote still need to be counted for the purposes of political representation. Both sides say it’s a question of fairness. Conservatives argue that the votes of each person in a district with large numbers of noncitizens counts more than the vote of someone in a citizen-heavy district where there are more other voters to compete with, which skews political power toward the parts of the country with more immigrants. But advocates for including everyone point out that because noncitizens still pay taxes and use public services, they have just as much of a stake in politicians’ decisions as voters do.
Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles, said that in addition to any constitutional challenges, it’s also possible that redistricting using citizen-only data could be illegal under the Voting Rights Act if the state has a history of discrimination against racial minorities. But he added that the process of finding out could take a very long time. “It’s 2019, and we’re still litigating partisan gerrymandering cases from 2011,” he said. “And the legislators get to stay in power while all of this is being fought out.”
If the citizenship question does ultimately enable some states to use a different standard for who gets political representation — and the Supreme Court upholds it — the effect could be even broader than Republicans picking up more seats in Congress or state legislatures. Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice who works on voting rights cases, said that there are still some Republicans representing urban or suburban areas in states like Texas, particularly in the state legislature, whose seats might be jeopardized. “If you have more rural districts, that could mean it becomes even harder for moderate Republicans to get elected,” he said.
Meanwhile, noncitizens would still continue to pay taxes and use government-run institutions like schools, but the political center of gravity would shift away from the places where they live. “People in rural Texas are not going to have the same priorities as the people living in Houston or Dallas,” Li said. “It will be harder for urban areas to get their needs met.” Footnotes
The citizen voting-age population metric that Beveridge used excludes both noncitizens and children. Thomas Hofeller, the Republican redistricting expert who proposed the addition of the citizenship question, relied on this same metric in his 2015 study.

The USWNT Is On To The Next Challenge — With An Eye On France,fivethirtyeight.com,Terrence Doyle,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-uswnt-is-on-to-the-next-challenge-with-an-eye-on-france/,"Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / MARINA ESMERALDO / GETTY IMAGES
The U.S. women’s national team faced its most difficult test at this World Cup so far in its match Thursday against Sweden, and it wasn’t much of a test at all. The 2-0 scoreline doesn’t reflect it, but the Americans dominated the Swedes from the first whistle to the last. They possessed the ball 61 percent of the match and created 13 scoring chances. 1 Sweden, on the other hand, created just four chances and rarely looked threatening otherwise.
Judging the U.S. women’s probability of winning the World Cup after their first two matches was tricky. They obliterated newcomers Thailand 13-0 and then handily swept Chile to the side 3-0, but neither opponent was expected to advance beyond the group stage, let alone make a run. The Americans were always favored to win those matches with ease. But Sweden entered the tournament with a chance — albeit a small one — of winning the whole thing, and the team has been a thorn in the USWNT’s side in the past .
Blowouts in the first two matches didn’t say much about what the USWNT is capable of against top competition (although Norway, which won the World Cup in 1995, proved that blowout wins in the group stage can be a good omen ). But the assertive performance against Sweden proved that the USWNT is ready for all comers. 2
Having finished atop Group F, the Americans will play Group B second-place finishers Spain in the round of 16. The FiveThirtyEight model gives the Spanish a 22 percent chance of beating the Americans and advancing to the quarterfinals. Spain’s defense has been stingy — it has conceded just two goals in three group-stage matches — but the team has struggled to find the back of the net. The Spanish are scoring just one goal per 90 minutes — 1.2 goals fewer than their expected goals (xG) tally suggests they should be scoring.
The upside for the Spanish: They are creating chances. The downside: They’ll be going up against an American side that hasn’t given up a goal and has conceded exactly zero big chances in their first three matches, according to data from Opta Sports. If Spain hopes to pull off the upset of the tournament, Jennifer Hermoso will have to capitalize on whatever chances she gets. The forward scored twice in the group stage, but her mark of 0.67 goals per 90 minutes is below what xG suggests she should have. If Hermoso can’t cash in, the Americans will probably advance to the quarterfinals.
The USWNT’s likely opponent in the quarterfinals is host nation France. Les Bleues won all three of their group-stage matches — although one of those wins came as the result of a *cough* controversial VAR decision *cough* that gave star defender Wendie Renard two shots at scoring from the penalty spot against Nigeria — and the FiveThirtyEight model gives them a 77 percent chance of beating Brazil in the round of 16.
But France might have preferred an opponent that didn’t include Marta. At 33, the Seleção legend is decidedly past her prime. But she’s the all-time leading goal scorer in the history of the World Cup — men’s or women’s — for a reason, and she’s still capable of inspiring awe. And Magic Marta isn’t alone: Brazil forward Cristiane Roziera has four goals at this World Cup, which places her one behind Australia’s Sam Kerr and the U.S.’s Alex Morgan in the race for the Golden Boot . If Cristiane draws level with — or overtakes — Kerr and Morgan, the quarterfinal match everyone is anticipating might not even happen. That said, Brazil has to be the least happy of any team with its draw. According to our model, its odds of making the quarters dropped by 29 percentage points, the most of any team remaining.
The Americans and the French might be the two most likely teams to win the tournament, but that doesn’t mean anyone should sleep on Germany. The Germans won all of their group-stage matches with relative ease and, along with the Americans, conceded the third-fewest shots on goal per 90 minutes. Not coincidentally, the Germans, like the Americans, didn’t concede a goal in the group stage. Our model gives them a 91 percent chance of beating Nigeria to advance to the quarterfinals and the third-best chance of winning the tournament.
Indeed, the group stage didn’t end up telling us a whole lot that we didn’t know entering the World Cup. The top of our model looks a lot like it did before the tournament began. On June 7, it gave France the best chances of winning, the U.S. the second-best and Germany the third-best. France and the U.S. have since flip-flopped — the U.S. chances to win jumped from 18 percent to 24 percent, while the French chances to win fell to 19 percent from 20 percent. Germany’s chances to win jumped from 11 percent to 15 percent, but its chances to advance to the quarterfinals jumped by an astounding 19 percentage points to 91 percent.
