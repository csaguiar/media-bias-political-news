CONFIRMED: Jussie Smollett Will NOT Return To ‘Empire’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48045/confirmed-jussie-smollett-will-not-return-empire-hank-berrien,"CONFIRMED: Jussie Smollett Will NOT Return To ‘Empire’ Photo by Chicago Police Department via Getty Images June 5, 2019 views
On Tuesday, Lee Daniels, the co-creator of “Empire,” confirmed that actor Jussie Smollett will not be on the show for its sixth and last season.
Daniels was responding to an article in Variety which intimated that Smollett would be back for the last half of the sixth season. Daniels tweeted, “This is not factual. Jussie will NOT be returning to Empire.” @Variety @JoeOtterson This is not factual. Jussie will NOT be returning to Empire. -LD — lee daniels (@leedanielsent) June 4, 2019
In its updated report issued after Daniels’ tweet, Variety reported of the production sources who had indicated Smollett would return, “The same production sources also note tensions were ratcheted up on set between the show’s primarily black cast members, who still believe Smollett is innocent, and the mostly white below-the-line crew, many of whom believe Smollett is guilty.”
The on-again, off-again reports of Smollett’s possible return included Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox TV issuing a statement in April saying, “By mutual agreement, the studio has negotiated an extension to Jussie Smollett’s option for season six, but at this time there are no plans for the character of Jamal to return to Empire.”
Appearing on the Fox morning show “Good Day New York” in April after the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Smollett for damages associated with the investigation into his actions, Daniels was asked if the lawsuit created any difficulties in bringing Smollett back on the show. He answered, “It's causing a dilemma. We are in discussions about that right now.”
On April 19, members of the “Empire” cast wrote a letter to Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier, Disney TV Studios and ABC Entertainment chair Dana Walden, Fox Entertainment president Michael Thorn, “Empire” co-creators Daniels and Danny Strong, and other executive producers on the series, arguing, “Together, as a united front, we stand with Jussie Smollett and ask that our co-star, brother and friend be brought back for our sixth season of Empire.”
In May, Fox reiterated that there were no plans to revivify Jamal Lyon, the character Smollett played. At roughly the same time, a spokesperson for Smollett told Fox, “We've been told that Jussie will not be on Empire in the beginning of the season but he appreciates they have extended his contract to keep Jamal’s future open. Most importantly he is grateful to Fox and Empire leadership, cast, crew and fans for their unwavering support.”
In mid-May, Fox Entertainment announced that the upcoming season of ""Empire"" would be its last. Deadline reported, ""Just two weeks after the Charlie Collier-run Fox Entertainment renewed Lee Daniels and Danny Strong’s hip hop drama for a sixth season and showed controversy ladened Jussie Smollett towards the exit door, it was announced today on Fox’s Upfront call that the self described 'groundbreaking cultural phenomenon' of Empire will be canceled once Season 6 is done.""
The most recent developments in the Smollett case came in late May, when a Chicago judge ruled in favor of media outlets who requested court documents and investigation records related to Smollett's alleged fake hate crime. As The Daily Wire reported:
Smollett's case files were sealed in the same hearing where the Cook County States Attorney announced that they would drop 17 felony counts against the ""Empire"" actor in return for approximately 16 hours of community service and a $10,000 check — the ""down payment"" Smollett left with the court when he was let out on bond."
KLAVAN: David Brooks Is Wrong About The GOP Apocalypse | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48049/klavan-david-brooks-wrong-about-gop-apocalypse-daily-wire,"KLAVAN: David Brooks Is Wrong About The GOP Apocalypse Robert A Tobiansky/Getty Images for SXSW June 5, 2019 views
On Tuesday’s episode of “The Andrew Klavan Show,” the host discusses an absurd article from The New York Times, a “former newspaper,” claiming the GOP will soon face an apocalypse.
On the West Side of Manhattan — or as New Yorkers call it, the edge of the known world — there is a skyscraper that houses The New York Times, a former newspaper, and on the pages of that newspaper is an op-ed section that we like to call knucklehead row.
On that row of knuckleheads there writes a man named David Brooks, who today predicted the coming GOP apocalypse. Brooks notes that a 2002 book predicted the end of the Republicans but, in fact, that didn't happen because older white voters and assimilated Hispanics swung to the right. That made people think twice about predicting the end of Republicans — but not our man Brooks, no sir. Brooks says this time the Republican Party is really doomed because millennials hate us.
He says, ""Today's generation gap is based on concrete lived experience that is never going to go away. Unlike the Silent Generation and the Boomers, Millennials and Gen-Z voters live with a difference every single day. Only 16% of the Silent Generation is a minority, but 44% of the Millennial generation is. If you are a millennial in California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, or New Jersey, ethnic minorities make up more than half of your age cohort. In just over two decades, America will be a majority-minority country. Young voters approve of these trends.""
You see folks, what makes the knuckleheads on knucklehead row, knuckleheads is that they never talk to anyone but other knuckleheads. Knucklehead confers with knucklehead confirming their knuckleheaded knuckleheadedness until the whole world seems to them as knuckleheaded as themselves. Brooks thinks that we Republicans who are conservatives are sitting around wondering how we can hold off the great tide of minority majorities, and since everyone they know agrees that that's what Republicans think, they figure it must be true. They are, in short, knuckleheads. No one gives a rat's ass about diversity.
No one cares what color people are. No one cares about your lived experience with people of different colors. What we care about is that the values that made this country great continue to guide the changes the time, demographics, and technology are bound to bring. No one cares if you're brown or yellow or gay or anything else. We just care that you're educated enough, responsible enough, and self-reliant enough to be free yourself and not to endanger our freedom. Also, we want to make observations and jokes about you without getting fired or thrown off Twitter.
In short, we on the right don't care what color you are. As long as you’re colored American. We conservatives are the people who brought you the end of the Cold War, the rollback of the '70s and '80s crime wave, the prosperity of the '80s through '90s, the return to judicial constitutionalism, a welfare reform that really worked until Obama destroyed it, and the surge that ended the Iraq War. You, leftists, are the folks who brought us crime, homelessness, widespread sexual malfeasance, disease, renewed racial animosity, the appeasement of jihadism, and the death of American education.
Maybe if you knuckleheads stop talking to one another and started talking to us, you could stop obsessing over people's colors and micro-aggressions and other baloney and help us solve today's problems as we did the problems of the past while you were busy screwing stuff up in the name of diversity."
"No, A Teen Rape Victim Was Not Euthanized For Depression In The Netherlands. Here's What Happened. | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48047/no-teen-rape-victim-was-not-euthanized-depression-amanda-prestigiacomo,"No, A Teen Rape Victim Was Not Euthanized For Depression In The Netherlands. Here's What Happened. via Getty Images June 5, 2019 views
On Tuesday, reports flooded the Internet of a Dutch teenage rape victim being legally euthanized for depression. However, clarified reporting has revealed that although Noa Pothoven, 17, did request to be medically euthanized, she was refused the deadly ""treatment."" Tragically, Pothoven died of self-starvation on Sunday.
""Initial reports claimed Noa Pothoven chose to end her life Sunday with the assistance of an end of life clinic, which has been legal in the Netherlands since 2002,"" said a Fox News report. ""But it is unclear whether she died because doctors directly intervened, or if she refused to eat.""
A spokesman for Dutch parliament member Lisa Westerveld told DutchNews.nl that ""as far as we know, [Pothoven] died because she didn't eat any more."" Westerveld was allowed to say good-bye to the teen before she passed.
According to the U.K.-based outlet The Sun, Pothoven suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anorexia. She was reportedly molested as a child and raped by two men at the age of 14.
On Wednesday, POLITICO Europe correspondent Naomi O’Leary corrected the apparent misreporting from mainstream outlets, such as The Daily Beast and The Daily Mail (UK), regarding the teen’s death.
“I spoke to Paul Bolwerk, a reporter who has been covering the story for [De Gelderlander] since 2018,” posted O’Leary in a Twitter thread. “Noa Pothoven had been severely ill with anorexia and other conditions for some time. Without telling her parents, she sought and was refused euthanasia.”
“The family had tried many kinds of psychiatric treatment and Noa Pothoven was repeatedly hospitalised; she made a series of attempts to kill herself in recent months. In desperation the family sought electro shocktherapy, which was refused due to her young age,” explained the reporter. “After electroshock therapy was refused, Pothoven insisted she wanted no further treatment and a hospital bed was set up at home in the care of her parents. At the start of June she began refusing all fluids and food, and her parents and doctors agreed not to force feed her.”
“A decision to move to palliative care and not to force feed at the request of the patient is not euthanasia. Dutch media did not report Noa Pothoven's death as a case of euthanasia. This idea only appeared in English language pickups of Dutch reporting,” O’Leary added.
The death of Pothoven sparked commentary on the practice of euthanasia and assisted suicide. For example, Pope Francis weighed in via Twitter, writing, “Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all. We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope.” Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all. We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope. — Pope Francis (@Pontifex) June 5, 2019
In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalized since 2002. In August, an elderly woman was reportedly euthanized against her will upon the directive of her own family.
""[T]he 74-year-old unidentified woman had been suffering dementia for some time and previously told people she would undergo assisted suicide if ‘the time was right.’ As her dementia progressed, she never put in a request to die and had surpassed the point of giving her full consent. It was then that her doctor declared her to be ‘suffering intolerably’ and proceeded to euthanize her,” according to LiveAction, The Daily Wire reported .
At least 83 mentally ill people were killed by assisted suicide in the Netherlands in 2017, a LiveAction report said ."
Alabama Legislature Passes Bill Requiring Chemical Castration For Child Sex Offenders | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48046/alabama-legislature-passes-bill-requiring-chemical-hank-berrien,"Alabama Legislature Passes Bill Requiring Chemical Castration For Child Sex Offenders Photo by Guido Mieth/GettyImages June 5, 2019 views
On Tuesday, Alabama legislators passed a bill that would punish child sex offenders by requiring them to be chemically castrated before they are released from prison. HB 379 was introduced by GOP Rep. Steve Hurst, who told WIAT-TV :
They have marked this child for life and the punishment should fit the crime … I had people call me in the past when I introduced it and said, 'don't you think this is inhumane?' I asked them what's more inhumane than when you take a little infant child, and you sexually molest that infant child when the child cannot defend themselves or get away, and they have to go through all the things they have to go through. If you want to talk about inhumane —that's inhumane.
He added, “If we do something of this nature, it would deter something like this happening again in Alabama and maybe reduce the numbers.”
The Daily Mail notes, “Since the mid 1990s, eight states have permitted some form of either chemical or surgical castration of sex offenders, though in practice courts have rarely ordered the treatments to be carried out. California was the first state to allow chemical castration for certain sex offenders who would be required to receive medroxyprogesterone (MPA), an artificial female hormone used to treat symptoms of menopause.”
HB 379 states :
Under existing law, certain criminal offenses are classified as sex offenses. A conviction for a sex offense against a person under the age of 12 years is a sex offense involving a child. Under existing law, a person convicted of a sex offense involving a child which constitutes a Class A or B felony is not eligible for parole.
This bill would provide that a person convicted of a sex offense involving a person under the age of 13 years who is eligible for parole, as a condition of parole, shall be required to undergo chemical castration treatment in addition to any other penalty or condition prescribed by law.
It adds, “This bill would also provide that if a person is ordered to undergo chemical castration treatment as a condition of parole and the person refuses to undergo the treatment, his or her refusal would constitute a violation of parole and would result in the person being remanded to the custody of the Department of Corrections. … A person may not be denied parole based solely on his or her inability to pay for the costs associated with the treatment required under this act.”
KADN reported that State Rep. Juandalynn Givan said, “You have to deal with the mind of a predator. You don’t worry about the physical body parts. You have to deal with makes them do what they do.” State Rep. Allen Treadaway echoed, “Any action that we can take against a child molester that would prevent them from ever committing this type of crime again, I support, including chemical castration. I think this bill is one of those steps to ensure public safety.”
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey must sign the bill for it to become law."
House Dems Taunt Trump White House With Massive Amnesty Bill | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48058/house-dems-taunt-trump-white-house-massive-amnesty-emily-zanotti,"House Dems Taunt Trump White House With Massive Amnesty Bill Chip Somodevilla / Staff / Getty Images June 5, 2019 views
Dutifully avoiding addressing issues at the United States' southern border, House Democrats passed a massive immigration reform bill Tuesday, granting amnesty to approximately 2.5 million illegal aliens currently residing inside the United States.
The Washington Free Beacon reports that Democrats easily passed the American Dream and Promise Act along partisan lines, despite concerns that the bill did not contain any provision to improve or expand detention facilities along the United States' border with Mexico, nor any funding designed to address what officials from a number of agencies are calling a ""border crisis.""
Instead, the bill grants the opportunity to obtain green cards to illegal immigrants who fall under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or, DACA) act — about 600,000 individuals — as well as others who entered the United States illegally as minors, a group that adds up to around 2.1 million people. In addition, the bill grants ""conditional permanent residency"" to around 400,000 temporary workers and illegal aliens facing ""deferred enforcement"" or deportation.
Like most bills passed of late along party lines in the House, the Democrats' plan to handle the immigration crisis isn't likely to pass the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) doesn't seem interested in even bringing it to the floor for consideration. But the bill does demonstrate, as the White House said in a statement late Tuesday, that Democrats have little interest in handling actual issues related to the southern border.
""H.R. 6 would incentivize and reward illegal immigration while ignoring and undermining key administration immigration objectives and policy priorities, such as protecting our communities and defending our borders,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The administration has put forward proposals to address the status of the hundreds of thousands of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) recipients, but only in the context of actual solutions that would address the underlying problems in our immigration system.""
Indeed, the White House did propose a series of immigration reform ""starters"" just weeks ago, noting, ahead of any conversation on the issue, that the Trump administration would be willing to find ways to ""legalize"" DACA recipients and other temporary workers, provided that Democrats agreed to extend funding to the Customs and Border Protection Agency and the Department of Homeland Security specifically to address current issues with interdiction and detention.
Democrats also rejected, out of hand, two amendments to the bill which might have gained White House approval: one amendment that would have directed additional funding to border patrol efforts to house and care for the thousands of illegal immigrants showing up at the southern border declaring a need for amnesty, and a separate, $4.5 billion appropriation for ""crisis relief and border security funding.""
The White House has been adamant that even if Democrats don't support decreasing the flow of migrants across the southern border, and are, in fact, happy that Central Americans are declaring for asylum at official border checkpoints, they have a responsibility to help officials processing those claims and caring for those migrants receive the resources they need. So far, Democrats seem uninterested."
Alleged Antifa Member Tries Chaining College Conservatives Inside Room | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48063/alleged-antifa-member-tries-chaining-college-hank-berrien,"Alleged Antifa Member Tries Chaining College Conservatives Inside Room Photo by Nakhorn Yuangkratoke/EyeEm/GettyImages June 5, 2019 views
On Tuesday night, as the University of Washington College Republicans held their final meeting of the school year, a person who may have been a member of a local Antifa group attempted to chain the doors from the outside to lock the Republicans inside.
As My Northwest reported, Emerald City Antifa apparently discovered that the meeting would feature two guest speakers from a local YouTube channel, Operation Cold Front. Emerald City Antifa used their Facebook page to encourage members to disrupt the event. The group stated:
Just a reminder to people at the UW that the Operation Cold Front crew (who you might remember from such antics as ""It's ok to be White"" signs, transphobic harassment of students, posing as Black Lives Matter to ask for reparations, harassing people outside an abortion clinic, and more) will be having a speaking engagement at the UW June 3rd at 6pm in Thomson Hall rm 101 …
These people are Proud Boy chuds, and Proud Boy chud supporters, they have been caught on video yelling ""yt power!"" while harassing womxn, and have a history of harassing womxn (including one of the co-hosts who is an accused rapist). These people belong to the Him Too movement, an anti-MeToo, misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, ""traditionalist"" Men's Rights trash fire. They should not be on campus bothering students.
So, if you're able, show up to deplatform.
UWCR member Zach Wildfang told The Jason Rantz Show , “I saw a guy in black approach the door but there had been no protest outside or anything so antifa wasn’t necessarily on my radar. He crouched down and immediately slapped his chain around the door.”
UWCR president Chevy Swanson added, “We heard the rattling from inside. We looked to see through the window and see that someone was messing with the door. And it’s very clearly a chain being attached. So personally I ran up to the door and opened it on him, the chain fell to the ground, and he ran off, which is good because I much prefer not to be chained in a room with 30 other people indefinitely.”
Swanson said the suspect has appeared at other UWCR events, though this is the first time he’s been disruptive. My Northwest reported UW Police said the suspect is 18. Swanson said, “One of the other attendees of the event caught up to him and called the police and the police end up coming and arresting him.”
According to UW Police, the suspect will be “charged through investigation” for misdemeanor disorderly conduct.
In April 2018, a woman affiliated with Antifa was arrested and later released by police after flinging paint on members of the UW College Republicans. As The Daily reported, “Two UWCR members, director of outreach Diodato Boucsieguez and treasurer Alex Guerrero, were tabling outside the HUB for several hours before a college-aged woman approached the table at about 12:30 p.m. … the woman walked around the tent from his left. In a fluid motion, the woman flicked the paint from a plastic bottle onto the booth.”"
Democratic Congresswoman: Republican Pro-Lifers ‘Conflate Heartbeat With A Soul’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48070/democratic-congresswoman-republican-pro-lifers-josh-hammer,"June 5, 2019 views
It is uncontested, as a matter of basic biology and rudimentary embryology, that a new human being — a new member of the homo sapiens species — is formed at the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg in the womb. Removing morality or bioethics from the equation and focusing purely upon modern science, then, there is therefore no more obvious place in the gestational continuum to demarcate a new, discrete human life than there is at fertilization.
In 2018, The Daily Wire's Paul Bois quoted pro-life leader David Bereit's response to a tendentious Bill Nye video:
The predominance of human biological research confirms that human life begins at conception/fertilization. At fertilization, the human being emerges as a whole, genetically distinct, individuated zygotic living human organism, a member of the species homo sapiens , needing only the proper environment in which to grow and develop.
Similarly, a Princeton University web page helpfully cites many examples of medical/biological textbooks affirming this basic truth: ""Development of the embryo begins at Stage 1 when a sperm fertilizes an oocyte and together they form a zygote."" [England, Marjorie A. Life Before Birth . 2nd ed. England: Mosby-Wolfe, 1996, p.31] ""Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being."" [Moore, Keith L. Essentials of Human Embryology . Toronto: B.C. Decker Inc, 1988, p.2] ""Embryo: An organism in the earliest stage of development; in a man, from the time of conception to the end of the second month in the uterus."" [Dox, Ida G. et al. The Harper Collins Illustrated Medical Dictionary . New York: Harper Perennial, 1993, p. 146] ""The development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote."" [Langman, Jan. Medical Embryology . 3rd edition. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, 1975, p. 3]
Against this backdrop, many on the increasingly brazen pro-abortion Left are forced to argue not science, but ""ethics"" and ""morality."" Cue this bit of claptrap from Rep. Kim Schrier (D-WA), who, as reported by The Washington Free Beacon, recently argued that Republican pro-lifers ""conflate a heartbeat with a soul or with personhood"":
Congresswoman Kim Schrier (D., Wash.) complained Republicans ""conflate a heartbeat with a soul or with personhood"" during an interview with Hill.TV about the national conversations over abortion legislation.
""I can tell you about a single heart cell, a myocardial cell, in a petri dish in a lab at the University of Washington that will beat,"" Schrier said during the Tuesday interview.
Schrier, the only female doctor serving in the House, went on to describe the science cited by supporters of so-called ""heartbeat bills,"" which outlaw abortion once a heartbeat can be detected, as a ""gimmick"" pushed by pro-life advocates to increase support for the legislation.
Alas, as the old trial lawyer aphorism goes: ""If you have the facts on your side, pound the facts. If you have the law on your side, pound the law. If you have neither on your side, pound the table.""
Perhaps a similar principle applies here for the pro-abortion Left.

Los Angeles Homeless Crisis Worsens By 16% | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48073/los-angeles-homeless-crisis-worsens-16-paul-bois,"Los Angeles Homeless Crisis Worsens By 16% ""This is going to be a very long road"" FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images June 5, 2019 views
As Los Angeles officials were wasting taxpayer dollars to virtue-signal about Alabama's abortion ban, the homeless crisis in the city increased by 16% while the overall county saw an increase of 12%.
According to the Los Angeles Times , the number of people now living on the streets, in vehicles, or in shelters steadily increased throughout the past year, following a small decrease in the previous year.
""The annual point-in-time count, delivered to the Board of Supervisors, put the number of homeless people just shy of 59,000 countywide,"" reports the outlet. ""Within the city of Los Angeles, the number soared to more than 36,000, a 16% increase.""
""And as in past years, most — about 75% — were living outside, fueling speculation of a growing public health crisis of rats and trash near homeless encampments downtown,"" the report continued.
Officials largely blame the problem on the lack of affordable housing while vowing to pledge more taxpayer dollars into supposedly ""fixing"" the problem. So far, government programs have done little to help. For instance, the city's Measure H sales tax from 2017 barely scratched the surface of the problem by helping to get roughly 20,000 people off the streets only to be outpaced by the number of people that were becoming homeless.
""If we don't change the fundamentals of housing affordability, this is going to be a very long road,"" Peter Lynn, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, told the Times. ""If we don't get ahead of affordability, we're going to be very hard pressed to get ahead of homelessness.""
“Overall, the service portion of the effort on mental health, substance use, the issue of housing, rent subsidies, those are important and we should stay the course,"" County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas told the Times. ""Where we have to work much harder is in the area of affordable housing.""
Ridley-Thomas admitted that the numbers are deeply discouraging following the small downturn in homelessness that the previous year showed.
""At this point of unprecedented wealth in the county of Los Angeles, we are equally confronted with unprecedented poverty manifesting itself in the form of homelessness,"" County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas told the Times. ""Last year's count, we felt we were trimming in a way that would suggest we were getting our arms around this. And yet this year we are pretty well stunned by this data.""
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has already pledged another $42 million to invest in ""street-based services,"" though county supervisors are less-than-optimistic that the tide will be stemmed anytime soon.
""The residents are seeing more encampments, more people sleeping on the sidewalks in dirty, unhealthy and heartbreaking conditions,"" Board chair Janice Hahn told the Times. ""They are frustrated by this problem. We need to give people answers.""
Though Ridley-Thomas feels the problem has worsened, he also believes that government programs have not been entirely ineffective. ""Overall, the service portion of the effort on mental health, substance use, the issue of housing, rent subsidies, those are important and we should stay the course,"" he said. ""Where we have to work much harder is in the area of affordable housing.""
The demographics among the homeless have also shifted significantly, with city officials now reporting a full 24% increase among people 18 to 24 years old. Also, the city saw a 17% increase in the chronically homeless, meaning people who have been living on the street or shelter for more than a year. "
"Hillary Clinton Rebrands As 'Climate Change Expert,' Is Already Ruining The Climate | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48080/hillary-clinton-rebrands-climate-change-expert-emily-zanotti,"Hillary Clinton Rebrands As 'Climate Change Expert,' Is Already Ruining The Climate David Becker/Getty Images June 5, 2019 views
When Al Gore loss the presidency in 2000, he quickly rebranded as an expert on global warming and ""climate change."" The swift switchover likely saved him from a career in obscurity, and thanks to the profitability of carbon trading schemes, has made him a rich man.
Taking a cue from her husband's former Vice President, failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton appears to be rebranding herself in a similar way, as an expert on the issue of climate change (though she offered little in the way of policy solutions when she was actually in office). Over the weekend, Clinton flew to the U.S. Virgin Islands for a meeting of the ""climate elite,"" hosted by — who else — the Clinton Global Initiative.
""Glad to be in St. Thomas, USVI this morning speaking with leaders on the front lines of climate change. There are so many people working to create resilient communities and inspire climate-smart actions—tune in to hear from some of them at 11am ET,” Clinton posted on Twitter. Glad to be in St. Thomas, USVI this morning speaking with leaders on the front lines of climate change. There are so many people working to create resilient communities and inspire climate-smart actions—tune in to hear from some of them at 11am ET: https://t.co/P5Jemwrmyr — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 4, 2019
The benefit of being the ""Clinton"" of the ""Clinton Global Initiative"" is that you can make yourself the keynote speaker of an environmental event, despite having little to show in the way of environmental policy innovation.
In her speech Wednesday , Clinton promised to take the lead in handling the burgeoning environmental crisis and pledged to build ""climate resilience.
The change is innovative. Clinton has avoided climate change as an issue for decades, and in 2012, embraced it only so long as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders remained in the race. Once Sanders exited and gave his endorsement to Clinton, The Guardian observed , Clinton dropped discussion of environmental issues from her campaign stump speech. Sanders aides noted that Clinton felt the environment wasn't a central issue of her campaign, but more of an ""add-on.""
Her policy platform on the issue, from her 2012 website , shows that she mostly just planned on continuing President Obama's environmental efforts and using the Paris Climate Accords as a benchmark for meeting environmental goals within the United States — certainly no ""Green New Deal.""
The meeting is being held in St. Thomas because, Clinton said on social media, ""island nations and territories already bear the brunt of climate change,"" but like most high-profile climate conferences which almost always locate themselves in tony resort towns or in exclusive pricey locales, St. Thomas isn't exactly the easiest place to get to. Certainly, there are few ""climate friendly"" options for travel to St. Thomas, and Hillary Clinton isn't going to swim, sail, or float over the island paradise.
That means, of course, that Clinton and her collection of ""global climate elite"" will all fly in to the U.S. Virgin Islands on carbon-spewing jets, likely emitting more carbon dioxide in a single trip than most American households emit in a year. Which, of course, puts her right in line with other high-profile environmental activists, from Leonardo DiCaprio to her own husband, Bill Clinton, both of whom fly in to and out of the primary yearly global environmental conference in Davos on private jets.

The Democrats have continued their mission to root God out of the public square in the name of secularism by removing ""so help me God"" from the U.S. House of Representatives oath witnesses must take when testifying before several of the congressional committees, all of which are currently under Democratic control.
According to LifeSiteNews , the changes to the oaths have been slowly implemented ever since House Democrats announced the new policy in January, which immediately faced backlash.
""In January, a draft of a rules package from the Natural Resource Committee was leaked to the public showing 'so help me God' marked for deletion, replaced with the phrase 'under penalty of law,'"" reports the outlet.
Even Snopes admitted at the time that Democrats indeed had tried to take God out of the oaths. Here's what the original document stated before Democrats retracted it:
(e) Oaths. — The Chairman of the Committee, the Chairmen of the Subcommittees or any Member designated by the Chairman may administer oaths to any witness before the Committee. All witnesses appearing in hearings may be administered the following oath by the Chairman or his designee prior to receiving the testimony: ‘Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?'
Chairman Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) claimed the removal of God from the oaths was a simple ""mistake."" Despite that, the Democrats eventually went on to push God out of the oaths, which One America News pointed out in March when Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TX), chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, specifically omitted ""so help me God"" when swearing witnesses in at a hearing. When Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) tried to correct the oath, Cohen publicly rebuked him. Take a look:
Last month, The New York Times reported that Democrats have made ""so help me God"" a forgotten and buried tradition in the U.S. House, with Rep. Steve Cohen telling the outlet he finds the phrase inappropriate for Congress.
""I think God belongs in religious institutions: in temple, in church, in cathedral, in mosque — but not in Congress,"" said Cohen. ""And God doesn’t want to be used.""
Republicans have been fighting back. Rep. Mike Johnson argued before his colleagues that ""so help me God"" carries great weight in that it implies someone who bears false witness is subjected to a higher judge.
""The intention behind [‘so help me God’] was to express the idea that the truth of what was being said was important not just in the moment, but would go into eternity, and someone was watching and would ultimately be our judge,"" said Johnson. ""Some would call that mere symbolism, but to many of our founders, it was deeper than that.""
Though Democrats have long fought to remove religion from the public square, starting with the ousting of prayer in schools, the party's brazen hatred for God being involved in politics erupted at the 2012 DNC when delegates voted by a large margin to remove God from the party platform. "
WATCH: WWII Veteran Describes D-Day Landing At Normandy | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48093/watch-wwii-veteran-describes-d-day-landing-daily-wire,"June 6, 2019 views
On “The Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special,” Daily Wire editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro spoke with several veterans about their experiences on D-Day in preparation for the 75 th Anniversary of the landing at Normandy. George Ciampa served in the US Army 607th Graves Registration. He shares his experiences on that fateful day on June 6 th , 1944. Video and partial transcript below.
George Ciampa: When we got to the shores of Normandy, they say there are four or five thousand ships out there and I believe it. There were ships all around you, and the shelling above us, 88's, you could hear them screaming, we called them Screaming Mimi's. But we saw ships getting hit and I remember a tanker blowing up and there's bodies in the water and there's debris in the water, and you know I was 18 years old, 112 pounds; I was a skinny kid. I finally got down a rope ladder and with all the gear on and I get into an LCI landing craft, that's the smaller Higgins boats, and we're heading in… I could hear the 88's screaming over us, and I remember when we started heading in and we came back out, and we started heading in and we came back out. I thought it was because of the shelling and thinking we're going to get hit anytime, but I found out years later that the guy that's driving that thing, he's looking for place to land because the Germans had obstacles in the water to keep us from getting all the way in, so we had to wade in, you've probably seen pictures of that. I was so frightened. I mean I was blacked out momentarily, I don't remember getting off the LCI, and I talked to a buddy of mine years later, and I said, ""Hey Gus tell me what happened, did we really wade in the water?"" he said ""Don't you remember that?"" I said, ""No."" He said, ""We did; we waded in the water with our rifles over our heads and everything.""
So, our job was to gather the dead. They didn't want any dead on the beaches for the morale of other troops coming in, and so we picked up paratroopers that had landed in the channel there. I don't know what happened, but they dropped them in the wrong place and the parachutes came down over them. These paratroopers are loaded with the gear and they drowned and so we wrapped them in their parachutes and buried them. We were attached to the 1st Brigade Combat Engineers’ provisions and 4th Division landed on that beach, on Utah Beach. Two platoons landed at Omaha and two at Utah, and I was at Utah.
Ben Shapiro: So can you talk a little bit about how you ended up in graves registration: What was that like, and what were you doing in the lead-up to D-Day?
George Ciampa: Well you got to go back to when I was a kid because when I was five years old and again at seven years old, I had a few situations of family with deaths, and so I had a big fear of death as a little boy. They put me in Catholic school, and they had the ten funeral masses, and so I dropped out of school, couldn't handle it. When I turned 18, I tried to get in the Air Corps, I went down to take the exam and my eyes were 20/22, so I flunked. So, then I got drafted and got sent to Cheyenne, Wyoming and got put in a graves registration company. I said, ""What the hell is that?"" Graves, you know? And when I heard what I was gonna have to do, I thought I've got to get out of this. Well luckily, at least temporarily, there was an airbase next to us, Fort Warren, and they were looking for pilots -- this is March of '44, like three months before the invasion. My brother was in the Air Corps; he was a pilot, and my brother-in-law also. It looked like a glorious thing to be a part of. They walked with a swagger, hat's tipped, you know the girls loved them. Anyway, nobody knows this except me, they lowered the eye requirements to 20/30 with no glasses so I could pass that, so I took the tests, everything was great. They notified my company commander and you know he hit the roof and he was very upset. I didn't go to him first of all, guys were recruiting, and I said, ""Hey, here I am; let's go.""
So anyway, there was a company going overseas right away. They only needed one man, so I was the replacement. The guys were all older than I was; they were all killing me on the ship on our way overseas. ""Don't worry, Ciampa, they're gonna turn the ship around take you home. Roosevelt, our president, said no 18-year-old will set foot on foreign soil."" Nobody knows that either. So we shipped out, and on the way over there in the middle of the night, we're sleeping down in a hold and all of a sudden there's a big explosion and the ship was rocking, everybody's scurried up on the deck, and then found out that there was a torpedo plane that was dropping a torpedo and the Navy gunner shot him down, that was the big explosion. The Navy gunner I had met the day before, he was my age and he showed me his quarters and we got acquainted, his name was Dennis Reid from Cincinnati, Ohio. I never did get in touch with him after that, and I wish I had because he really saved our lives."
WALSH: When ‘Toxic Masculinity’ Saved The World | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48101/walsh-when-toxic-masculinity-saved-world-matt-walsh,"June 6, 2019 views
On this day 75 years ago, the Allied forces launched the largest amphibious assault in history. Over 24,000 troops stormed the coast of Normandy, France under intense German resistance from heavily fortified positions, dodging mines and gun fire as they made their way up the beach. Nearly 5,000 men would die in the ultimately successful mission.
It was one of the most impressive military campaigns the world has ever seen. The Allies, of course, did not win the war simply by taking Normandy, but they did turn the tide, forcing Hitler to fight on two fronts — against the Soviets in the east and the Americans and British in the west. Less than a year later, Hitler would shoot himself in a bunker in Berlin.
Put yourselves in the boots of these men, for a moment. Imagine crouching in one of those landing crafts, jostling up and down from the breaking waves, listening to the rapid pops and bangs of machine guns and grenade launchers, knowing that you will be charging into that Hell the moment the door opens and the whistle blows. Imagine jumping into that water and trudging through that sand as your friends get blown to bits all around you. Imagine fighting Nazis — real Nazis, not just someone whose opinion you find disagreeable. And real fighting — not an angry tweet or a hashtag campaign. Imagine sailing across an ocean to die for someone else's freedom.
There is much that can be said about the men who entered the war with a bang — with many bangs — on this day three-quarters of a century ago, but one thing we must surely say about them is that they were men . Real men. Men who did what men must do, and what only men can do. Men who showed us then, and still show us today, what it means to be a man.
We hear a lot about ""toxic masculinity"" in these times. I have never quite nailed down the definition of the term, which is probably because there is no definition. It is an ambiguous, catch-all phrase used by misandrists and self-loathing men to shame men simply for being men. If it were not meant to shame men, then you would expect to hear these same people sometimes warn against the dangers of ""toxic femininity."" But you never hear such a thing. The word ""toxic"" is only ever affixed to male traits, and that is not an accident.
So we are left to surmise a vague definition of the ambiguous term. It seems that ""toxically masculine"" men are those men who are aggressive, violent, hard, and tough. Men who do not talk much about their feelings or strive to ""get in touch"" with them. Men who might be known on occasion to spit and cuss and make crude jokes. Men who do the dirty work. Men who put action over feeling. Men who would not be considered enlightened or progressive by our modern standards. Well, 24,000 of those kinds of men went charging into a hurricane of bullets and blood on this day 75 years ago. They went all that way to die or kill — or both. These were violent men, rough men, toxic men — toxic, at least, to those who oppress the innocent and oppose freedom.
It seems we have decided that we no longer need those kinds of men, that their day has come and gone. I disagree. Rather than trying to domesticate and feminize our boys, hoping that they will grow into manly women or womanly men, we should point to those men on that beach and say, ""Be like them. Be a man. Be who you are."" Because as long as there is evil in this world, we will need men laden thick with toxic masculinity to rise up and meet it. That was the case in 1944 and it is still the case today."
CNN In Disbelief: Our Own Poll Shows Trump Winning Reelection! | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48111/cnn-disbelief-our-own-poll-shows-trump-winning-hank-berrien,"CNN In Disbelief: Our Own Poll Shows Trump Winning Reelection! Photo by John W. Adkisson/Getty Image June 6, 2019 views
A new CNN poll acknowledges something that must terribly bother the network: 54% of respondents in the poll believe that President Trump will win reelection, a huge eleven-point hike from last December, when that number was 43%.
Speaking on CNN on Wednesday, host John Berman said disbelievingly, “They believe the president, despite everything, will win reelection next year.” He added, shocked, “What’s more, that number is up double digits since December.”
Turning to his panel, Berman asked CNN political director David Chalian, “David, I want to start with you. This is always an interesting number to me ‘cause often it does go hand-in-hand with success; people end up knowing who’s going to win beforehand often. What do you attribute this shift to?”
Chalian noted that the rise in Trump’s numbers largely were responses from dispirited Democrats who reluctantly see the strength of Trump’s chances:
The psychology of the voters, right? People also like to be with a winner, so it gives that you sense. If you look under the numbers, John, one of the things that you can attribute the increase in that perception to is actually to Democrats, to people who disapprove of Donald Trump’s job performance. They did not think he was going to win re-election, but we should be clear, three-quarters of them still don’t think that, now a quarter of Democrats in this poll believe he is going to win re-election. That’s up when we tested this in December, that’s up from 14%. So even though they’re rooting against it, they seem, Democrats, to be a little more of the mind that he may actually come out victorious.
Hilariously, Berman than asked, “Is that good?”
Chalian himself is no fan of Trump. As Caleb Howe noted last November, Chalian ripped into President Trump after Trump alleged fraud and misconduct in the vote count and recount in Florida. Chalian stated, “I think that he is dismantling a fundamental pillar of our democracy, which is the sanctity of the vote. And he wants to discredit election results that he thinks aren’t in his favor. His dismantling of institutional pillars of our Democracy–It’s just so offensive to hear him talk this way.”
Howe pointed out that Chalian didn’t mention numerous Democrats or media personalities who had questioned the voting results of last November’s election, including CNN’s own Van Jones, writing of the Georgia gubernatorial race and failed Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams, “Her campaign was so good, and she is so compelling, that Abrams would almost certainly be governor-elect right now -- if the election had been fair. As the final votes are tallied, Kemp enjoys a razor-thin margin -- but it is the product of misconduct so brazen and unethical that UN monitors would likely declare a stolen election if the contest were held in another country.""
Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) ranted, “If Stacey Abrams (D) doesn’t win [the governor’s race] in Georgia, they stole it. It’s clear.” Brown added that Republicans “can’t win elections because there is way more of us than them. They can’t win elections fairly.”
Former DNC chairman and presidential candidate Howard Dean added, “This is a pattern in many places in Georgia. I am amazed that Kemp is so obvious about his efforts to steal the election. The failures of machines and personnel around the states are massive.” This is a pattern in many places in Georgia. I am amazed that Kemp is so obvious about his efforts to steal the election. The failures of machines and personnel around the states are massive. https://t.co/nbUWVqxMrd — Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) November 6, 2018
Add in Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: “ In a democracy, no one—not even the President—can prevent the lawful counting of votes. We will not allow him or anyone else to steal this election.” In a democracy, no one—not even the President—can prevent the lawful counting of votes.

Nancy Pelosi Wants To See Trump ‘In Prison’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48113/nancy-pelosi-wants-see-trump-prison-josh-hammer,"Nancy Pelosi Wants To See Trump ‘In Prison’ Mark Wilson/Getty Images June 6, 2019 views
Speaker of the House and leftist icon Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has performed a very careful dance on the issue of possible impeachment for President Donald Trump. Most recently, as The Daily Wire reported earlier this week, Pelosi found herself heckled by her fellow California Democrats for being insufficiently zealous about impeachment:
Local lawmaker Pelosi ... clearly anticipated a friendly audience, and took the stage Saturday afternoon to update California's progressive activists on a handful of ongoing Congressional investigations into President Donald Trump's personal finances and pre-presidential business dealings. When she got to the part of her speech focused on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on potential collusion between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russian officials, though, the crowd turned on her.
Pelosi began discussing Trump's potential ""obstruction of justice,"" a charge outlined in the Mueller report but subsequently dismissed by the Attorney General's office, and it wasn't long before members of the audience were drowning her out, yelling ""Impeach! Impeach!"" ...
Pelosi struggled for several minutes before launching back into her speech, looking very uncomfortable.
""Pelosi and other long-time Democrats have been the subject of progressive ire lately, after refusing to sign on to articles of impeachment, preferring instead that Democrats treat the 2020 presidential election as a referendum on Trump's actions, including potential obstruction of justice,"" The Daily Wire's Emily Zanotti added .
But this week, Pelosi reportedly went full Woke® in a private Capitol Hill exchange with House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). Specifically, as Politico reports , Pelosi actually called not for Trump's impeachment, but for his imprisonment :
Speaker Nancy Pelosi told senior Democrats that she’d like to see President Donald Trump ""in prison"" as she clashed with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler in a meeting on Tuesday night over whether to launch impeachment proceedings. ...
""I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,"" Pelosi said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. Instead of impeachment, Pelosi still prefers to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and then prosecuted for his alleged crimes, according to the sources.
They said she was expressing solidarity with pro-impeachment Democrats who want to hold the president accountable while disputing the idea that it is now time to take that step.
The leaked statement amounts to an interesting political calculation for Pelosi. The speaker, it seems, is attempting to thread a needle between mollifying the restive progressive base of her party and assuaging institutional Democratic establishment forces who are concerned about the possible political ramifications at the ballot box in 2020 of such an unjustified impeachment push. Whether Pelosi will come across as less ""radical"" for claiming that a sitting president of the United States deserves to be imprisoned is, at best, a shaky proposition.
Political prediction market PredictIt.org currently has Trump as an overwhelming favorite to successfully complete his first term as president — and to therefore not be impeached. Republicans, after all, retain control of the U.S. Senate — where two-thirds of members are required, in any event, to successfully convict upon the House's initial impeachment."
Washington Supreme Court Rules Against Florist Who Refused Same-Sex Wedding | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48135/washington-supreme-court-rules-against-florist-who-paul-bois,"Washington Supreme Court Rules Against Florist Who Refused Same-Sex Wedding ""Adjudicatory bodies that considered this case did not act with religious animus"" KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP/Getty Images June 6, 2019 views
Religious freedom suffered another setback this week when the Washington Supreme Court ruled on Thursday against a Christian florist who refused to service a same-sex wedding on religious grounds.
According to Fox News , the court ruled that Barronelle Stutzman, owner of Arlene's Flowers, ""violated the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) for refusing to make floral arrangements for a gay couple in 2013."" Similar to the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, Stutzman did not wish to make a custom arrangement for the wedding, which would have required her to lend her artistic creativity to an event that violated her religious beliefs. She did, however, offer to sell the couple whatever pre-made floral arrangement they wished.
In the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop, the U.S. Supreme Court only ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission acted with animus towards baker Jack Phillips' religious beliefs.
""The Commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion,"" the 2018 ruling said. ""Phillips was entitled to a neutral decisionmaker who would give full and fair consideration to his religious objection as he sought to assert it in all of the circumstances in which this case was presented, considered, and decided….The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the court.""
Essentially, the Washington Supreme ruled that the ""adjudicatory bodies"" treated Stutzman and Arlene's Flowers with no such animus.
""The adjudicatory bodies that considered this case did not act with religious animus when they ruled that the florist and her corporation violated the Washington Law Against Discrimination ... by declining to sell wedding flowers to a gay couple,"" the Washington Supreme Court's ruling said, ""and they did not act with religious animus when they ruled that such discrimination is not privileged or excused by the United States Constitution or the Washington Constitution.""
The ruling went on to say that the Washinton Supreme Court ""painstakingly reviewed the record for any sign of intolerance on behalf of this court or the Benton County Superior Court, the two adjudicatory bodies to consider this case,"" concluding that they ""are confident that the two courts gave full and fair consideration to this dispute and avoided animus toward religion.""
In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court kicked the Arlene's Flowers case back to Washington, demanding that the state not make the same mistake that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission did with Masterpiece Cakeshop. Indeed, multiple conservative commentators at the time lamented that SCOTUS made far too narrow of a ruling that would eventually lead to more religious persecution. Here's what The Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro said at the time of the ruling:
Presumably, if the Colorado commission had said nicely to Phillips, “Dear sir, we understand your honestly-felt moral quandary, but feel that times have moved beyond such discrimination, and thus your religious objections must take a back seat to civility,” they could tell him to do whatever they damn well pleased.
The fact that we have arrived at this point in Constitutional jurisprudence in the first place is an utter joke. You don’t have the freedom to speak, so long as the government labels your speech public accommodation; you don’t have the freedom to associate; you don’t have freedom of religion so long as the government speaks nicely while taking it away from you.
Of course, the Supreme Court ruled on Masterpiece Cakeshop prior to Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the bench, so it theoretically possible that Stutzman's case could provide a definitive ruling on whether or not religious Americans can be compelled to participate in events that violate their beliefs, depending on if the higher court chooses to hear her case."
WATCH: 13-Year-Old Girl Gets Publicly Shouted Down When She Compares Abortion To Slavery | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48134/watch-13-year-old-girl-gets-publicly-shouted-down-hank-berrien,"WATCH: 13-Year-Old Girl Gets Publicly Shouted Down When She Compares Abortion To Slavery Photo by Tatyana Tomsickova Photography/GettyImages June 6, 2019 views
On Tuesday night, at a Raleigh, North Carolina City Council public meeting, a 13-year-old girl pleaded for the city to make abortion illegal, comparing abortion to slavery, prompting some members of the audience to shout her down.
13-year-old Addison Woolsey began:
My name is Addison Woolsey. I strongly believe that abortion is murder. I also believe murder is wrong, so I’m here to ask you to make abortion illegal in Raleigh. Abortion should be illegal because it’s murder. The definition of murder is the killing of one human being by another without justification and acting with intended malice. When mothers choose to slaughter their innocent babies they already have fingerprints, noses; they can recognize their mom’s voice. They can hiccup and their heart is beating … On ultrasounds the baby tries to run away from the disturbing instruments that try to kill the baby. The baby’s mouth opens wide in a scream when being killed. These babies are alive. They feel being killed. It hurts them and there is nothing they can do about it. There is no way around it. Abortion is murder.
She continued, “There’s no way around it. Abortion is murder. So why is it if an infant is destroyed before birth there’s no problem but if killed after birth it’s considered a brutal murder. These babies aren’t ‘its’ or ‘fetuses'; they are human beings and they deserve to get the same human rights as any other person. As fetal doctors have said, a person’s a person no matter how small.”
Moments later, Woolsey read the part of her speech that prompted the outcry:
Abortion reminds me of slavery. Owners said that their slaves were their property and they could do whatever they wanted with them. Just how moms feel about their babies. My hope is that in a few years we’ll look back at abortion and think, “That was so cruel. I can’t believe we did that. Just how I look back at slavery. The question is, who will you be? The slave owner? … Rosa Parks ? Or Abraham Lincoln? Who are you going to be? Make a choice. My choice is made. I’m here today standing up for what’s right. I’m here today speaking for those who can’t speak for themselves. Are you choosing to be like the plantation owner flogging the little black child?
That set off some members of the audience, who began shouting her down.
She continued, “Or are you going to protest even if it is going to cost you your life like Martin Luther King Jr.? Who are you going to be? If you think abortion should be illegal, would you please stand up. We need to change the law —”
More shouting as calls for “order” were made.
Woolsey continued, “If you think abortion should be illegal, would you please stand up. We need to change the law so we can change the world. So let’s stand up and do it.”
The News & Observer reported, “Some of the anti-abortion speakers were shouting back at those interrupting Woosley. One man used his cell phone to film a woman sitting near the anti-abortion people. She flipped him off, saying ‘right here, pal’ and police officers took her out of the room. She was later allowed back in.”
The News & Observer added, “There were several children sitting with the anti-abortion speakers, and at least one boy was crying silently in his seat while people yelled at one another.”

WALSH: How The Left Is Normalizing Pedophilia Right In Front Of Our Eyes | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48150/walsh-how-left-normalizing-pedophilia-right-front-matt-walsh,"June 7, 2019 views
Twitter just announced that it has "" zero tolerance "" for child sexual exploitation, yet it has allowed this video from Vice, both portraying and glorifying child sexual exploitation, to remain on its platform. The Vice video is a fun and whimsical look at the ""community"" of young boys who dress in women's clothing and dance for the perverted entertainment of adults.
Vice proudly announced that these children are the ""next generation of drag queens."" But they are not really a part of the ""next"" generation; they are the current generation — or more like current crop — of a new type of ""drag performer."" New, that is, to the West. Over in places like Afghanistan, it has long been customary to have young boys in female attire dance for the pleasure of grown men. We have now adopted a similar custom, but under the guise of progressivism.
The Left has become increasingly obsessed with dressing boys up like girls and parading them around. Literally parading them around in some cases, like when the LA Pride Parade had a 7-year-old boy "" strutting "" in high heels at the head of the procession. Little attempt is made anymore to hide the sexual nature of the ""drag kid"" phenomenon. Remember, for instance, the ""drag kid"" who posed with a naked man , and the ""drag kid"" who danced at a gay bar while men tossed money at him.
This should put things into perspective for those still obtuse and oblivious enough to think that the ""drag queen story hours"" popping up at libraries across the country are just a bit of harmless fun. Hundreds of libraries have hosted events to bring children and cross-dressing men together. There is, of course, no practical or coherent reason why a man has to dress like a woman from a Tim Burton movie in order to read a book to children. The decision to add that macabre and grotesque element into the equation is purposeful, and the purpose is to get children — boys, especially — accustomed to the idea of cross-dressing. The sexual exploiters of children want to ensure that there will be a constantly refreshed supply of Bacha boys — or ""drag kids,"" as we call them in this country.
Follow the trajectory and it is not hard to see where we go next. Ten years ago, there was no such thing as ""drag kids"" or drag queen story hours. Leftists would have called you a paranoid lunatic had you predicted that such things would come to pass. Now both are utterly commonplace, yet leftists will insist that even though grown men in dresses like to hang out with little children at libraries, and adults like to go to gay bars to watch boys dance around in skirts and high heels, there is nothing sexual about any of it. Ten years from now, or maybe sooner, they will admit that it is sexual but insist that there is nothing wrong with a young boy and a grown man getting together, so long as it is consensual. You do not need to be Nostradamus to see this next step. It is right in front of us, clear as day.
Leftism is an active threat to our children. This is why we cannot compromise with it or seek common ground. What kind of common ground can a sane and moral person find with those who think it's acceptable to have a ten-year-old ""perform"" at a gay bar? It is an evil ideology, through and through. And we must defeat it, or else watch our children be destroyed by it. "

Apparently buckling from threats of tariffs from President Donald Trump, Mexico is ready to offer major concessions with regard to immigration, a report from The Washington Post outlined Thursday.
Trump has harshened his tone with regard to tariffs with Mexico in past weeks. As previously reported by The Daily Wire, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that the administration is ""deadly serious"" about an increasing tariff on Mexican goods — starting at 5% and increasing to 25% — if the Mexican government doesn't respond to Trump’s demands concerning illegal immigration.
""He is absolutely, deadly serious,"" Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday. ”I fully expect these tariffs to go on to at least the 5 percent level on June 10.""
The pressure on Mexico is apparently working in Trump’s favor. Chief negotiators for the neighboring country are offering “a deal that would dramatically increase Mexico’s immigration enforcement efforts and give the United States far more latitude to deport Central Americans seeking asylum,” two officials relayed to the Post. According to the outlet, the sources, one from the U.S. and one from Mexico, “cautioned that the accord is not final and that President Trump might not accept it.” The Daily Caller reported on the specifics, thusly:
Mexico, according to two officials who spoke with The Post, agreed to send up to 6,000 National Guard troops to its southern border with Guatemala, a major chokepoint for Central American migrants in their northbound journey to the U.S. That move is expected to immediately yield results in squashing the number of illegal immigrants.
Additionally, Mexican negotiators are prepared to revamp their asylum rules in the region. Under the proposal, Central Americans seeking asylum would have to remain in the first country they entered after leaving their homeland. For example, Guatemalans seeking asylum in the U.S. would be deported to Mexico, the first country they crossed in their U.S.-bound journey. The U.S. would be able to deport El Salvadorian and Honduran applicants to Guatemala — the first country they presumably crossed.
“The reason we're doing things people don't expect is that we're facing things at the border we never experienced before,"" Mulvaney reiterated on Sunday. ""We're using extraordinary tools because there is extraordinary circumstances that dictate those.""
The tariffs would reportedly increase by 5% each month if Trump is to find Mexico’s corporation insufficient, starting at 5% on Monday and working its way to 25% by October 1.
Trump gave optimistic signaling over a potential deal with Mexico on Friday, tweeting, “If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, & there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm & Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately.”
Trump also noted: “If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!” If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, & there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm & Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately. If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!"
Ocasio-Cortez Tries To Grandstand Top FBI Official.

It Doesn't Go Well. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images June 7, 2019 views
Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was shut down earlier this week during a House Oversight Committee hearing on white supremacy after she tried to grandstand a top FBI official.
During the hearing, Ocasio-Cortez asked Michael McGarrity, the assistant director of the Counterterrorism Division at the FBI, why the FBI did not classify the church shooting in Charleston and the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh as domestic terrorist attacks.
""That's not correct,"" McGarrity responded. ""I don't know who told you that we didn't but we certainly had cases open on them in both those cases and I wasn't here for the [Charleston] case but it's certainly in our own Department of Justice civil rights about 3-4 weeks ago in their testimony actually stated that it was a domestic terrorism event, charged through the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice for a hate crime. I was here for the tree of life, I will tell you I remember that days distinctly it was worked as both a domestic terrorism case and a hate crimes case and it still worked that way.""
Ocasio-Cortez then asked if the attacker in the Charleston church shooting was charged with domestic terrorism, to which McGarrity responded: ""So you're using the word charge, as I said before there's no domestic terrorism charge like 18 USC § 2339 ABCD for a foreign terrorist organization. So what we do both on the international terrorism side with the homegrown of on extremist and domestic terrorism, we'll use any tool in the toolkit to arrest them hopefully left of attack.""
After several moments of back and forth, Ocasio-Cortez again asked McGarrity, ""But the actual charge, was it, was the actual charge domestic terrorism?""
""You're not going to find an actual charge of domestic terrorism out there if you look at Title 18--"" McGarrity said before being cut off by Ocasio-Cortez.
""It says here that, but, at the San Bernardino shooting or the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting they were designated and charged as domestic terrorist incidents,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.
""They were, they were charged, I'd have to go back and look, they were charged likely with if there was a connection to a foreign terrorist organization, it would likely fall under 18 USC § 23 A or B,"" McGarrity responded.
Ocasio-Cortez then suggested that those perpetrators were unfairly charged with terrorism because they were Muslim.
WATCH:
Later, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) used his time to give Ocasio-Cortez an education on the subject.
""Is it safe to say there's a distinction when we're talking about foreign terrorist organizations and if you're talking about the concept of a domestic terrorist organization or entity that there are some constitutional questions that arise right that are distinct between our focusing on our intelligence gathering and our efforts and criminal activities more focusing on foreign terrorist organizations -- communications they have with American citizens, how we surveilled that information, what we do with that information -- versus targeting domestic only American citizens or at least those are permanent legal status, right?"" Roy said. ""There's a distinction there that complicates a bit how we would set up a criminal structure to target 'domestic terrorism,' is that a fair statement?""
""Yes,"" McGarrity responded.
WATCH:
Ocasio-Cortez, apparently embarrassed by the hearing, took to Twitter to make misleading and false statements, tweeting: ""This hearing was wild. First the FBI witness tried to say I was wrong. I tried to be generous + give benefit of doubt, but then we checked. I wasn’t. Violence by Muslims is routinely treated as 'terrorism,' White Supremacist violence isn’t. Neo-Nazis are getting off the hook.""
Ocasio-Cortez made her remarks in a quote tweet of a deceptively edited video from the far-left propaganda group NowThis. This hearing was wild. First the FBI witness tried to say I was wrong.

Neo-Nazis are getting off the hook. https://t.co/RCjp4687by — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 5, 2019
In March, The Intercept reported that the fact that domestic terrorists are not officially charged with domestic terrorism drives ""a false narrative that domestic terrorism is not punishable under existing anti-terrorism laws.""
""In fact, the government has ample room to go after domestic terrorism under existing laws,"" The Intercept added. ""The material support law has two parts. The first can be applied to anyone who commits or assists with a terrorist attack, including one rooted in a domestic ideology, so long as the crime involves one of about 50 proscribed offenses, including bombing government buildings, murdering government employees, using weapons of mass destruction, and hostage taking. The second and more controversial allows the Justice Department to prosecute anyone supporting or working with a State Department-designated foreign terrorist organization, however minor their role in an attack or plot, including even unwitting targets of FBI undercover stings who never were in contact with actual terrorists. Civil libertarians have for two decades criticized the material support law, but primarily for the abuses possible in the more expansive provision for international terrorists. The more limited provision for domestic terrorism is harder for prosecutors to abuse."" "
California Democratic Party: First Amendment ‘Limited To Exclude Hate Speech’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48156/california-democratic-party-first-amendment-josh-hammer,"June 7, 2019 views
As The Daily Wire reported earlier this week, the California Democratic Party's convention in San Francisco last weekend was ... interesting. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who positions himself as somewhat of a ""centrist"" within the increasingly far-left Democratic Party, came out in opposition to such statist tomfoolery as ""Medicare for All,"" the ""Green New Deal,"" and socialism itself. Amazingly, the California Democratic Party convention attendees had the audacity to boo Hickenlooper for his very brave stance against the most immoral and destructive economic worldview ever known to man. TheBlaze reported:
While speaking at the California Democratic Party convention, Hickenlooper told the San Francisco crowd that if Democrats want to defeat President Donald Trump in 2020, they will need traditional Democratic values in their corner — not socialism.
""If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer,"" Hickenlooper said.
The denunciation was met with immediate blowback, including a sea of boos lasting more than 30 seconds.
Well then.
Alas, The Daily Wire has dug a little more deeply into the California Democratic Party's resolutions produced as a result of the convention, and the Golden State's Democrats appear to have a wee bit of a free speech problem. Specifically, one of the recitals that opens California Democrats' Resolution 19-05.94 seems to state that the protection of the First Amendment, while generally ""critical,"" is nonetheless ""limited to exclude hate speech."" Yes, seriously. Here is the full text of the recital (with emphasis added):
WHEREAS, Protecting First Amendment rights is critical, but is also limited to exclude hate speech using the concept that offending statements first should be viewed through the lens of the party experiencing the hate, and that Jews, LatinX, African-American, Asian Pacific Islander, Muslims, Disabilities and LGBTI communities can be targets of oppression and hate speech for a variety of reasons.
This is, to put it mildly, utter and absolute legal tripe. Many leftists tendentiously cite the 1942 U.S. Supreme Court case of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire for the proposition that the First Amendment allegedly does not constitutionally protect the amorphous and indefinable concept of so-called ""hate speech"" (which is often a thinly veiled guise for mere speech that leftists dislike), but the reality is that Chaplinsky does no such thing. As Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief noted in a tweet exchange with Chris Cuomo back in 2015, Chaplinsky has to do with the (itself constitutionally dubious) ""fighting words"" doctrine — which is legally distinct from what modern leftists tend to call ""hate speech."" Seriously, @chriscuomo ? Can you please point to the portion of the Constitution suggesting that ""hate speech"" does not receive protection? — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) May 6, 2015 . @ChrisCuomo First off, Chaplinsky is not in the Constitution. Second, cartoons of Mohammed are not ""fighting words"" under any definition. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) May 6, 2015
The ""fighting words"" doctrine from Chaplinsky deals solely with scathingly insulting language that, merely by being uttered, tend to incite an immediate infliction of injury or other breaching of the peace.
Such attempts to limit the scope of the First Amendment are hardly new for those on the Left. Many leftists have excoriated in no uncertain language the landmark 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision of Citizens United v. FEC , which merely affirmed the longstanding constitutional principle that political speech is central to the original public meaning of the First Amendment. ""[I]t is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the Citizens United majority. Nonetheless, many Democrats have attempted to expressly overturn the Citizens United decision."
"TRUMP BREAKS MEXICO: New Deal Reached, Mexico To Take Action Against Illegal Immigration Into U.S. | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48172/trump-breaks-mexico-new-deal-reached-mexico-avoids-ryan-saavedra,"June 7, 2019 views
President Donald Trump announced late on Friday that the United States has reached a new agreement with Mexico in which Mexico is going to take ""strong measures"" to end the flow of illegal immigration into the United States and will thus avoid being hit with massive tariffs by the Trump administration.
""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,"" Trump tweeted. ""Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you!"" ....stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2019
Just last week, Trump announced: ""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow."" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019
In a message sent out by the White House, Trump explained last week that the 5% tariff on Mexico would have increased by 5% every month — maxing out at 25% — if Mexico did not stop the flow of illegal immigration coming into the U.S. through Mexico. Trump wrote :
To address the emergency at the Southern Border, I am invoking the authorities granted to me by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Accordingly, starting on June 10, 2019, the United States will impose a 5 percent Tariff on all goods imported from Mexico. If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed. If the crisis persists, however, the Tariffs will be raised to 10 percent on July 1, 2019. Similarly, if Mexico still has not taken action to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of illegal aliens crossing its territory into the United States, Tariffs will be increased to 15 percent on August 1, 2019, to 20 percent on September 1, 2019, and to 25 percent on October 1, 2019. Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory. Workers who come to our country through the legal admissions process, including those working on farms, ranches, and in other businesses, will be allowed easy passage. If Mexico fails to act, Tariffs will remain at the high level, and companies located in Mexico may start moving back to the United States to make their products and goods. Companies that relocate to the United States will not pay the Tariffs or be affected in any way.
Over the years, Mexico has made massive amounts of money in its dealings with the United States, and this includes the tremendous number of jobs leaving our country.
Should Mexico choose not to cooperate on reducing unlawful migration, the sustained imposition of Tariffs will produce a massive return of jobs back to American cities and towns. Remember, our great country has been the “piggy bank” from which everybody wants only to TAKE. The difference is that now we are firmly and forcefully standing up for America’s interests.

BOZELL & GRAHAM: Abortion Is Sacred In Hollywood | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,L. Brent Bozell Iii,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48176/bozell-graham-abortion-sacred-hollywood-l-brent-bozell-iii,"June 8, 2019 views
In recent years, generous tax credits have brought a wave of Hollywood productions to Georgia. Then the state legislature passed, and the governor signed a very protective pro-life bill. The reaction was furious. How can the will of the people stand?
Network reporters, all aligned with movie and TV studios, pronounced that their conscientious corporate overlords might forgo the tax breaks to show their support for untrammeled abortion, even though there is no demand from their shareholders — their owners — that they do any such thing.
None of these major media companies felt any anger or angst when the state of New York did just the opposite in January, passing a bill that would allow abortions up to birth — and allow non-doctors to perform them. These leftist networks barely noticed the bill was passed and signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo as legislators cheered ... because that's the kind of America they want, in all 50 states.
But now power players in Hollywood have rushed to the ramparts of Georgia. Peter Chernin, who worked for Rupert Murdoch for decades, announced a campaign to raise $15 million for the American Civil Liberties Union to fight any abortion restrictions in Georgia and other red states. ACLU boss Anthony Romero gushed to CNN, ""Peter Chernin's leadership in Hollywood has been critical to sounding the alarm among industry leaders.""
Chernin, like the typical self-interested Hollywood executive, wants the tax benefits and an overturned pro-life bill.
David Simon, the creator of ""The Wire"" and other TV shows, said he would boycott Georgia and that Hollywood ""must undertake production where the rights of all citizens remain intact."" In Tinseltown's utopia, unborn babies do not have the right to remain intact.
Miley Cyrus, so far removed from her teenage Disney Channel days, not to mention taste, was pictured licking a round white cake with the sides covered with rainbow sprinkles that read ""ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE.""
George Orwell, call your bakery. Perhaps there should have been a disclosure saying that ""no bakers were harmed in the creation of this cake.""
There were some terrific tweets about this picture. LifeNews.com was amazed, saying, ""The irony of @MileyCyrus using a birthday cake to promote abortions when abortions deny babies a birthday.""
Ben Sixsmith wrote, ""It's interesting how the right to kill the unborn is advertised with such neotenous aesthetics. Children get in the way of adults behaving like children."" (""Neotenous"" is a $10 Bill Buckley word for ""juvenile."")
A tweet from the fashion brand Marc Jacobs features Cyrus topless in jeans holding two grapefruits in front of her breasts. That was part of the design of a hooded sweatshirt by Marc Jacobs that says, ""Don't F—- With My Freedom."" It's a lyric in her new single called ... ""Mother's Daughter."" The lyrics that follow aren't on the shirt: ""I'm nasty, I'm evil / Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter.""
All proceeds from the hoodie sales go to Planned Parenthood. One hoodie costs $175.
Cyrus was a fervent backer of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016 and runs a nonprofit called the Happy Hippie Foundation, whose stated mission is ""to rally young people to fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations.""
Isn't it amazing that the left is so fixated on feminist ideology and consequence-free sex that it cannot see the unborn babies as the most ""vulnerable population"" in America? Unborn babies are not merely dehumanized in abortion activism. They are not even an afterthought. They are literally and metaphorically obliterated.

KLAVAN: Leftists Virtue Pose While Their Cities Die | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48152/klavan-leftists-virtue-pose-while-their-cities-die-andrew-klavan,"views
More and more, the left is spouting a rhetoric of high, moral-sounding fantasies to distract from the ruinous havoc their policies wreak on the real world.
You could hear the cognitive dissonance this week in the small kerfuffle between London’s utterly incompetent and self-righteous Mayor Sadiq Khan and America’s unruly but generally effectual president.
Khan, a virtue-signaling jackass, spent much of Trump’s UK visit excoriating the president for such crimes as pulling out of the useless Paris Climate Accord and failing to kowtow to the left’s inchoate ideas about “diversity.”
Trump responded trumpianly by calling Khan a “stone cold loser,” and pointing out that “he’s done a poor job, crime is up, a lot of problems.”
And, well, yes. Khan’s a mayor, after all. His job is running a city not forging the conscience of a nation. And his city — once the greatest on Earth — has become a cesspool of record homelessness, impossible traffic and a murder rate spiraling higher than it has for over a decade. Unwise immigration policies fashioned on misguided diversity theory are a huge contributor to the problems. So in a reasonable world, Khan would be prevented from making high moral declarations by the sock he’d stuck in his own mouth.
Which brings us home to America. Here, Trump’s deregulation and tax cut policies have helped ignite an economy that has brought unemployment among blacks to record lows.
And sure, that’s great in real life, but how is it playing in the left’s moralistic fantasies? When confronted with the triumphant results of Trump’s actions, Harvard Professor Cornel West complained about the way the president talks , “When you create an atmosphere, an ambience of xenophobia, it reinforces the polarization and therefore many black folk wouldn't even be able to connect the statistics that look good with the language.”
For one thing, so much of the president’s admittedly rough-hewn language has been purposely distorted and taken out of context by a news media desperate to prove every Republican racist. It’s an open question, therefore, whether it’s Trump or CNN who is at fault for the bad ambience around here. But laying that aside, West is essentially saying that Trump’s indifference to left-wing academic standards of racial sensitivity is more important than what he has actually accomplished for actual human beings.
Congressman Al Green of Texas says the same: “The president can be impeached for his racism and his bigotry. Unfortunately, however, he is a beneficial bigot. Meaning he benefits a good many people and I, unfortunately, have to tell you I'm so saddened when I see people who have built their reputations fighting bigotry allowing this to persist to the extent that it has.""
Run that around in your aching head a moment. The president is a “beneficial bigot” because his policies help “a good many people.” Is that the same as his being a not-bigot who simply doesn’t kowtow to the politically correct speech codes the left has imposed on us to keep us from criticizing their awful policies?
Because if you want to get a load of some non-beneficial non-bigotry all you have to do is visit one of America’s left-wing cities. “Rats at the police station, filth on L.A. streets — scenes from the collapse of a city that’s lost control,” reads a headline in the Los Angeles Times. The filth has gotten so bad in my town, officials are worried about the spread of flea-borne typhus and rodent-carried bubonic plague — that’s the Black Death that once wiped out a third of Europe, just so you know.
The local news station in Seattle — where left-wing governance has brought about the same sorry Angelino state of affairs — is running an hour-long documentary called “Is Seattle Dying?” and yes, it is. Nancy Pelosi’s San Francisco likewise. And in Chicago, after a single weekend in which over 50 people were shot, Jussie Smollett is now the only person in the city who hasn’t been attacked.
Meanwhile, the crisis at our border has become an emergency — a catastrophe for all concerned that could be ended with a few tweaks to our absurd asylum laws. But the “resistance” resists doing anything meaningful to stop it because they’re too busy displaying their compassion for illegals in front of any TV camera they can find.
The left spends an awful lot of energy trying to get conservatives to shut up. Political correctness, deplatforming, demonetizing, blacklisting, outrage mobs, boycotts — all dedicated to making sure that they alone get to do the talking.
But you know what? The right doesn’t even need words to make the point anymore. Just go to the Democrat-governed cities. Look out the window. Walk the streets.
Everything the left talks about is meaningless. Everything they touch turns to crap. "
REPORT: Alyssa Milano Persuaded Joe Biden On Taxpayer-Funded Abortions | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48174/alyssa-milano-persuaded-joe-biden-taxpayer-funded-paul-bois,"June 8, 2019 views
It turns out that Hollywood's favorite abortion cheerleader Alyssa Milano may have been instrumental in persuading former Vice President Joe Biden to completely flip on his position of taxpayer-funded abortion.
According to The Hill , Milano had a phone call with Biden's campaign manager Greg Schultz earlier this week, advising that the former vice president would be wise to change his stance on the Hyde Amendment. CNN even reported on Friday that Milano spoke with Biden directly. Take a look: Pressure from both inside and outside Joe Biden's campaign, including an appeal from Alyssa Milano, led Biden to conclude he had to reconsider his position on the Hyde Amendment, according to campaign officials with direct knowledge of the discussions. https://t.co/pnGHm67sTt pic.twitter.com/p6pHPMKxQe — The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) June 7, 2019
Whatever Milano told Biden, it appears to have worked. On Thursday, he immediately reversed his position after several 2020 Democrats began to unilaterally blast his support for the Hyde Amendment.
""We now see so many Republican governors denying healthcare for millions of the most poorest [sic] and most vulnerable Americans by refusing even Medicaid expansion, I can't justify leaving millions of women out of access to care they need and the ability to exercise their constitutionally protected right,"" Biden told a crowd supporters. ""If I believe healthcare is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's ZIP code.""
The former ""Charmed"" actress then celebrated Biden's flip-flop on Thursday, thanking him for ""listening to the American people,"" even though the Hyde Amendment enjoys broad support among the American people.
""@JoeBiden just came out saying, after listening to women in the last 24 hrs, he WILL repeal the Hyde Amendment. I repeat, Joe Biden just came out against the Hyde Amendment. Thanks, Joe. For listening to the American people. And thank you to the women who raised their voices,"" said Milano on Twitter. . @JoeBiden just came out saying, after listening to women in the last 24 hrs, he WILL repeal the Hyde Amendment. I repeat, Joe Biden just came out against the Hyde Amendment. Thanks, Joe. For listening to the American people. And thank you to the women who raised their voices. pic.twitter.com/O304t9cANV — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) June 7, 2019
According to Townhall , Biden's shift leftward can mean only one thing: the Democrats have taken up an extremist position on abortion with which most Americans do not agree.
""Biden has now walked away from a majority-supported viewpoint on the Hyde Amendment, even as he seems to have the ""moderate"" lane basically to himself. The playbook to drag him leftward is now established,"" said Guy Benson. ""By a double-digit margin , the American people oppose public funding of abortion. And the population for whom the Hyde Amendment would be jettisoned is even less likely to support the idea than wealthier Americans.""
Of course, Biden's flip on the issue, which apparently happened after a few phone calls with a B-list actress-turned-activist, could be politically costly in the long run, since it shows he has no principles whatsoever and will say anything for the sake of garnering progressive support. It also helps him little when several political commentators earlier this week were saying his support of the Hyde Amendment stemmed from his personal convictions.
""I am told explicitly that it is Joe Biden, himself, who says: 'this is my conviction and I’m not changing it. This is how I have felt and this is how I have voted for my four decades in public service, and I’m not changing,"" said Dana Bash on CNN.
""He is a deeply religious man...he is guided by his faith, his position on the Hyde Amendment has been consistent,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond, national co-chairman of the Biden campaign."

On May 29, author and professor Sandro Galea sent out a series of tweets regarding abortion in which he criticized states like Alabama and Missouri, which recently passed laws pertaining to the procedure: Thread – thoughts on the unfolding abortion crisis in the US, and its implications for health. @PPact @PPAdvocacyMA @PPMASS @DrLeanaWen @PublicHealth @wendydavis — Sandro Galea (@sandrogalea) May 29, 2019
Here’s the full thread (tags and hashtags omitted):
Thread – thoughts on the unfolding abortion crisis in the US, and its implications for health. Access to legal abortion is under threat in this country as never before in the post-Roe era. Recent anti-abortion laws passed in states like Alabama and Missouri have all but ended legal abortion access in these areas.
If legal challenges to these laws reach the Supreme Court, the Court’s new conservative majority raises the possibility that the precedent set by Roe will not be upheld. The end of Roe as we know it will have consequences for health. I have written about how threats to reproductive health are threats to population health.
To imagine what a future without Roe could be like, it is worth looking to the pre-Roe era, when women seeking abortions found themselves facing circumstances that could put their health in danger and lead to death. We cannot know for sure how many women died from illegal abortions. What data we have are old, much of it coming from a time when stigma, and the procedure’s then-illegality, could mean underreporting of maternal deaths caused by abortion.
The number of yearly deaths could well have been in the thousands. A [Guttmacher] report contains data indicating that in 1930 abortion was named as the cause of death for nearly 2,700 women. Other estimates place the number of annual deaths higher or lower, depending on the year and available data. Again, these numbers are hard to know given past conditions. What we can know are the many abortion-related deaths in countries where restrictive laws are currently making the practice less safe.
Each year, at least eight percent of global maternal deaths are estimated to have been caused by complications from an unsafe abortion, with as many as 22,800 women dying annually. Much has changed in the last 50 years, changes which have resulted in fewer maternal deaths due to illegal abortions. These changes include the passage of Roe and the work of [Planned Parenthood act].
The potential downstream consequences of a movement against legal abortion include attacks on reproductive health, ranging from contraception bans to new social norms based on misinformation and stigma. An abortion ban could also result in increased reluctance among women to seek medical care for other reasons.
In practice, a ban will likely do what bans have done globally – ensure that safe, legal abortion is available only to the well-off, and that dangerous, illicit abortions are the lot of the socioeconomically marginalized. This will kill women, particularly poor women of color.
The exact number of maternal deaths a US abortion ban will cause is unknowable. But the exact number ultimately should not matter to anyone for whom even one such death is unacceptable. Threats to undermine Roe should be unacceptable to anyone who cares about ensuring safe abortion access for women.
This piece isn’t about the number of deaths from illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade . However, for reference, Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen has tweeted on multiple occasions that ""thousands of women died every year pre-Roe."" In response to this, The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler conducted a fact-check . Citing estimates from multiple sources, Kessler noted that even by the late-1940s, abortion-related deaths were much lower than is suggested by Wen and company, who have cited statistics from before the advent of antibiotics.
He concluded by giving Wen’s claim ""Four Pinocchios,"" and writing:
Wen is a doctor, and the ACOG is made up of doctors. They should know better than to peddle statistics based on data that predates the advent of antibiotics. Even given the fuzzy nature of the data and estimates, there is no evidence that in the years immediately preceding the Supreme Court’s decision, thousands of women died every year in the United States from illegal abortions.
With that cleared up, let’s move on to the primary problem with Galea’s series of tweets.
Instead of addressing whether or not it’s morally acceptable to terminate a fetus at various stages of development, which is the primary driver of the recent spate of pro-life laws being passed in several states, Galea pivots to the possible physical impact that such legislation may have on women who want abortions.
This diversionary tactic is frequently used by abortion advocates to knock opponents off balance, and avoid arguing on the merits of actual abortion procedures.
Another variant of this tactic may include the statement, ""If you’re pro-life,"" followed by questions such as: Why aren’t you encouraging better sex-ed in schools? Why haven’t you adopted any children? Why not focus on fixing the foster care system? Why aren’t you promoting better access to contraception?
In the form of a question, Galea’s position can be articulated thusly: ""If you’re pro-life, why don’t you care about the women who will die getting back-alley abortions if Roe is overturned?""
These questions are posed as if no more than one thing can be true at the same time. If someone opposes abortion, they cannot also advocate for a better foster care system. If someone opposes abortion, they cannot also believe in affordable and widely-available contraception. If someone opposes abortion, they cannot also have empathy for pregnant women who find themselves in difficult situations.

REPORT: Trump Admin Says No To Flying Pride Flags On U.S. Embassy Flagpoles | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48185/report-trump-admin-says-no-flying-pride-flags-us-paul-bois,"June 8, 2019 views
It seems that the Trump administration is not treating LGBTQ pride as an extension of the United States and has barred several overseas embassies from waving the rainbow flag in concert with the American flag during Pride Month, reports NBC News .
Three American diplomats reportedly told the outlet that the Trump administration has expressly denied their request to wave the rainbow flag during the month of June.
""The U.S. embassies in Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia are among those that have requested permission from Trump's State Department to fly the pride flag on their flagpoles and have been denied, diplomats said,"" reports NBC News. ""Although the pride flag can and is being flown elsewhere on embassy grounds, including inside embassies and on exterior walls, the decision not to allow it on the official flagpole stands in contrast to President Donald Trump's claim to be a leader in supporting LGBTQ rights overseas.""
As to why the Trump administration has denied the request remains to be seen, though speculation is it sees LGBT rights and pride as two separate issues. For instance, the administration's recent call to decriminalize homosexuality in countries such as Iran stems from an ideological impulse to see individuals treated with dignity and respect, which makes it a U.S. diplomatic endeavor, not an LGBT endeavor. It would be as if the embassies were to suddenly put crucifixes on the front lawns to stand in solidarity with persecuted Christians.
That being said, the Trump administration has only barred the pride flag for being placed on the flagpole alongside the U.S. flag, not on embassy grounds. Openly gay ambassador Richard Grenell of Germany told NBC News in a statement that the rainbow flag will be present in the Berlin Embassy.
""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell said.
The U.S. Embassy in Seoul, South Korea, will also be displaying the rainbow flag on the side of the building, not in concert with the American flag on the flagpole.
President Trump also formally recognized Pride Month this year by reiterating his administration's position on decriminalizing homosexuality in other countries.
""As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals,"" the president tweeted earlier this week.
In 2018, the GOP even introduced a bill in the U.S. House seeking to bar the rainbow flag from being displayed in concert with the American flag on U.S. Embassies. Contrary to initial reports, the bill did not single out LGBT flags and simply banned any flag that was not Old Glory.
""The United States flag is the single greatest symbol of freedom the world has ever known, and there’s no reason for anything but Old Glory to be flying over our embassies and posts around the globe,"" Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said at the time. "
Dershowitz: 'Why Did Mueller Team Distort Trump Attorney's Voicemail?' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48189/dershowitz-why-did-mueller-team-distort-trump-james-barrett,"June 8, 2019 views
In an op-ed for The Hill published Friday, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz takes a closer look at the special counsel's problematic selective editing of a voicemail message from President Trump’s former attorney John Dowd which, as Dershowitz puts it, has ""added fuel to the arguments against the appointment of special counsels."" Robert Mueller's team's decision to ""distort"" the message, the esteemed legal analyst argues, is more evidence that it's time to ""abolish"" the special counsel.
The Mueller report says that after Gen. Michael Flynn withdrew from the joint defense agreement with President Trump, Dowd left a voicemail message for Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, asking for a ""heads up"" if ""there's information that implicates the president.""
""The report characterized the voicemail message as an attempt by the president’s counsel to obstruct Flynn’s cooperation with the Mueller probe, and that’s also how much of the press reported on it,"" Dershowitz notes.
Here's the passage that includes the selectively edited transcript of the voicemail provided in the Mueller report, as highlighted by Dershowitz:
On November 22, 2017, the President’s personal counsel left a voicemail for Flynn’s counsel that said: ""I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms … [I]t wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with … the government … [I]f … there’s information that implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue … so, you know … we need some kind of heads up. Umn, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can … [R]emember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains …""
On November 23, 2017, Flynn’s attorneys returned the call from the President’s personal counsel to acknowledge receipt of the voicemail. Flynn’s attorney reiterated that they were no longer in a position to share information under any sort of privilege. According to Flynn’s attorneys, the President’s personal counsel was indignant and vocal in his disagreement. The President’s personal counsel said that he interpreted what they said to him as a reflection of Flynn’s hostility towards the President and that he planned to inform his client of that interpretation. (Mueller Report, Vol. 2, p. 121-122)
While the report makes Dowd's message sound rather sinister, the full transcript reveals that Mueller's team distorted what the attorney actually said through key omissions. Here's the full, unedited message from Dowd, where the attorney stresses that he is not asking for ""any confidential information,"" begins by expressing sympathy for Flynn's decision not to join the joint defense, and cites the country's interests, not just the president's, as the reason the information matters:
Hey, Rob, uhm, this is John again. Uh, maybe, I-I-I-’m-I’m sympathetic; I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t … state it in … starker terms. If you have … and it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh … I understand that you can’t join the joint defense; so that’s one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there’s information that … implicates the president, then we’ve got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don’t know … some issue, we got to — we got to deal with, not only for the president, but for the country. So … uh … you know, then, then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of … protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any … confidential information. So, uhm, and if it’s the former, then, you know, remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains, but — Well, in any event, uhm, let me know, and, uh, I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, pal.
Citing Dowd's allegation that Mueller is attempting to ""smear and damage"" not only him but others and assertion that the special counsel never raised any questions about these allegations with Trump's legal team before releasing the report, Dershowitz writes that Dowd is ""rightly upset.""
""When read in full, the transcript shows that he is not trying to obstruct the probe,"" argues Dershowitz. ""To the contrary, he is respectful of resigned national security adviser Flynn’s decision to withdraw from the joint defense agreement and does not expect Flynn’s attorney, Kelner, to disclose confidential information. Furthermore, he is not only worried about what Flynn’s cooperation means for his client, the president, but also for the country.""
With the release of the full transcript, it's clear that Dowd's request of Kelner was not only ""entirely proper"" but ""obligatory"" for any competent defense attorney, Dershowitz argues. Read his full op-ed here . "
D.C. Author Who Lost Book Deal After Shaming Metro Worker Is Suing For MILLIONS | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48193/dc-author-who-lost-book-deal-after-shaming-metro-ashe-schow,"D.C. Author Who Lost Book Deal After Shaming Metro Worker Is Suing For MILLIONS AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais June 9, 2019 views
An author who lost her book deal after she posted a photo on Twitter of a Metro worker eating on the train is now suing her publishing house for $13 million.
On the morning of May 10, Washington, D.C.-based author Natasha Tynes tweeted a photo of a Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority employee who was eating on the train, something passengers are not allowed to do.
""When you’re on your morning commute & see @wmata employee in UNIFORM eating on the train,"" Tynes wrote in her now-deleted tweet. “I thought we were not allowed to eat on the train. This is unacceptable. Hope @wmata responds. When I asked the employee about this, her response was, ‘worry about yourself.'""
As The Daily Wire’s Emily Zanotti previously reported , WMATA arrested a teenager last year for “standing on a platform with a bag of chips and a lollipop.”
After Tynes sent her tweet, a backlash ensued. People criticized her for putting someone’s livelihood at risk. Author and activist Roxanne Gay wrote: “We all complain on social media but you... don’t identify the person you’re complaining about, in a photo no less, and try to get them fired. What on earth? For eating on the train?""
Tynes, who is Jordanian-American, was also accused of perpetuating racism, since the WMATA worker in the photograph is black – as if what she did would somehow be okay if the worker were white. Tynes apologized for her tweet and made her Twitter profile private, but the backlash was not over. Rare Bird, which was set to distribute her novel, “They Called Me Wyatt,” announced it was dropping her book :
Rare Bird is aware that an author distributed by us, Natasha Tynes, and published by an imprint that is sub-distributed by us, California Coldblood, did something truly horrible today in tweeting a picture of a metro worker eating her breakfast on the train this morning and drawing attention to her employer. Black women face a constant barrage of this kind of inappropriate behavior directed toward them and a constant policing of their bodies. We think this is unacceptable and have no desire to be involved with anyone who thinks it’s acceptable to jeopardize a person’s safety and employment in this way.
The distributor said it was looking into cancelling Tynes’ book. The sub-distributor then echoed Rare Bird’s statement and announced it was pulling Tynes’ book from publication.
The Washington Post reported that Tynes has now filed a lawsuit against Rare Bird alleging a breach of contract and defamation and demanding $13 million in damages for “extreme emotional distress” and the harm done to her reputation.
Tynes claimed in her lawsuit that Rare Bird defamed her when it accused her of perpetuating racism by “policing” a black woman’s body. Tynes said she did no such thing, “did not engage in any act of racism” and did nothing that put the woman’s safety at risk.
Tynes claimed she was hospitalized after the incident for “an acute anxiety reaction and suicidal ideations,” according to the lawsuit. She received online threats. Goodreads, a book review website, began receiving negative reviews for her book – which hadn’t even been published.
“What Rare Bird has done to Natasha Tynes is just beyond abhorrent,” her attorney, William Moran, told the Post. “I’ve never seen a publisher throw an author under the bus like this before.” "
"DC 'Dyke March' BANS Israeli And Jewish Pride Symbols, Refuse Entry To Marchers Carrying Star Of David Flag | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48196/dc-dyke-march-bans-israeli-and-jewish-pride-emily-zanotti,"Racism DailyWire.com DC 'Dyke March' BANS Israeli And Jewish Pride Symbols, Refuse Entry To Marchers Carrying Star Of David Flag NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images June 9, 2019 views
The Washington, D.C., ""Dyke March"" turned away Jewish marchers carrying LGBT pride flags emblazoned with the Star of David Saturday, making good on a threat to turn away anyone who showed up to the event with a Jewish pride of Israeli flag.
The D.C. Dyke March announced the policy last week, telling potential attendees of the event, billed as ""an all-inclusive celebration of underrepresented people,"" that symbols of ""Zionism"" would not be tolerated -- even though the event organizers explicitly said they would allow Palestinian flags, according to the Washington Times .
Last year, organizers at the Chicago Dyke March enforced a similar policy, ejecting anyone from the LGBT Pride event who openly expressed support for the Jewish state, even though Israel is one of the only gay-friendly Middle Eastern countries. Organizers issued the ban in support of ""intersectionality,"" and out of concern for ""Zionism"" within their ranks, which they consider akin to ""oppression.""
Yael Horowitz, one of the event's organizers, told the Washington Times that the D.C. ban was a “protest against 'nations that have specific oppressive tendencies,'” and that pride flags bearing a similarity to the American flag would be similarly unwelcome.
“If someone would show up with an American flag but with the stripes as a rainbow, we would treat it the same way,” Horowitz added. “I think what’s getting erased here is pro-Israel and pro-Jewish are very different things.”
“Jewish stars and other identifications and celebrations of Jewishness (yarmulkes, tallit, other expressions of Judaism or Jewishness) are welcome and encouraged,” Horowitz added in a Facebook post. “We do ask that participants not bring pro-Israel paraphernalia in solidarity with our queer Palestinian friends.”
Another organizer told the Washington Times that the mere presence of pro-Israel symbols turned the march into an ""unsafe space.""
“The issue [with the Jewish Pride flag] is where the Star of David is positioned in a way that looks like an Israeli flag, it creates an unsafe space,"" the organizer told The Forward . “It really is a shame that Israel took this symbol of Judaism and turned it into this nationalist symbol….I understand the Jewish pride flag is a symbol that a lot of Jews have come to embrace, but there are so many other Jewish symbols that we can use to express our Judaism, like a Star of David [on a necklace], like a yarmulke, a tallit.”
Organizers made good on their promise to block and eject anyone who showed up at Saturday's event with a Star of David on their pride flag. Israeli writer Hen Mazzig captured a confrontation between march organizers -- who are members of the ""anti-Zionist"" Jewish organization, If Not Now -- and pro-Israel march participants. “In order for pride flags not to be about Israel, all you have to do is remove the (Jewish) Star” - @IfNotNowOrg Jewish collaborator guard at the entrance to the @dcdykemarch separating good Jews from bad Jews — Hen Mazzig (@HenMazzig) June 8, 2019
Organizers can be seen in the video telling a Jewish marcher that she will be allowed to march with her pride flag -- provided she remove the Star of David from the flag before entering the event.
Apparently, ""intersectionality"" is fine until it comes to including supporters of the state of Israel. "
"SAD: Joe Biden Makes Friendship Bracelet For Barack Obama, Internet Mockery Ensues | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48198/sad-joe-biden-makes-friendship-bracelet-barack-emily-zanotti,"June 9, 2019 views
Former Vice President Joe Biden is banking on his connection to former President Barack Obama to propel him through the 2020 Democratic primary, but after an embarrassing misstep Saturday, drawing that line may be harder than Biden first thought.
Saturday was officially ""Best Friends Day"" on the internet, and Biden took advantage of the situation to reinforce his connection to Obama by posting a photo of a pair of friendship bracelets that read, ""Barack"" and ""Joe."" — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 9, 2019
The caption read, ""Happy #BestFriendsDay, to my friend, @BarackObama.""
The photo isn't new. In fact, it's from August 2016, when Joe Biden was still Vice President. The gag was originally meant as a joke birthday card for Obama, who was celebrating his 55th birthday. Happy 55th, Barack! A brother to me, a best friend forever. pic.twitter.com/uNsxouTKOO — VP Biden (Archived) (@VP44) August 4, 2016
At the time -- back when Obama was considered suitably progressive and the Democratic party was united in its effort to defeat then-Republican candidate Donald Trump -- the Tweet drew rave reviews. Accounts with blue check marks nodded approvingly, responding with heart-eyes emoji and pleas for Obama and Biden to stay in office forever. A few even made their own friendship bracelets, so that they could pretend to share in the Obama/Biden bromance.
Saturday's Tweet did not earn Biden the same unbridled admiration. Instead, it inspired a wave of mockery from all sides, and scorn even from Barack Obama's former campaign guru, David Axelrod. — David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) June 9, 2019
Social media responded by asking Biden if he was ""okay,"" and called the former Veep, ""clingy"" and ""really weird."" Others pointed out that although Joe Biden is staying close friends with Barack Obama, Obama has been less than friendly when it comes to supporting his former Vice President's bid for the White House.
When Biden finally announced his intent to run for president back in April, Obama didn't jump at the chance to see his heir apparent off on the campaign trail. In fact, although Obama publicly wished Biden well, he made no endorsement. A spokesperson for Obama called the pair's relationship a ""special bond,"" but stopped short of giving any indication of Obama's thoughts on whether Biden would be a good president.
“President Obama has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made. He relied on the Vice President’s knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today,"" the spokesperson said.
In a similar scene of sadness, Biden told reporters that he had explicitly asked Obama not to issue an endorsement (though Biden hinted that he knew Obama was in his court).
""I asked President Obama not to endorse,"" he said, per USA Today . ""Whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits.""
Rumor has it that Obama isn't really interested in seeing Biden ascend to the presidency, even if it would mean an era of Obama nostalgia follows a term of Trump. Obama has been meeting privately with a number of 2020 contenders, and seemed, at first, to prefer Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for the nomination.
That doesn't mean Biden is about to lose Obama's number, though, apparently.
Keep trying, buddy. "
Cory Booker Suggests Spending Money On Border Security Like Rejecting Jews Fleeing Holocaust | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48202/cory-booker-suggests-spending-money-border-ryan-saavedra,"Cory Booker Suggests Spending Money On Border Security Like Rejecting Jews Fleeing Holocaust Dustin Chambers/Getty Images June 9, 2019 views
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) appeared to suggest over the weekend that spending money on border security was like rejecting Jewish refugees during the Holocaust.
Booker made the comments in Iowa while appearing on the Political Party Live podcast on Saturday where he spoke on a wide variety of issues.
""Do you know how much billions of dollars we've done to increase the numbers of Customs and Border Patrol agents, of people involved in immigration..."" Booker began.
Booker continued by saying that it was important to know history and that President Donald Trump was trying to make people afraid of people coming across the southern border who have ""brown skin.""
""As much as he wants to make us afraid of people trying to come here escaping terror, not remembering like when we turned around other immigrants trying to escape terror,"" Booker continued. ""There was a ship that came here during World War II with a bunch of folks trying to escape the Holocaust and we turned it around where they got killed in the Holocaust.""

While Booker's comparison might be wildly inaccurate, his historical claims are accurate as former Democrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his administration rejected thousands of Jewish refugees during the Holocaust.
""In the summer of 1942, the SS Drottningholm set sail carrying hundreds of desperate Jewish refugees, en route to New York City from Sweden,"" Smithsonian Magazine reported . ""Among them was Herbert Karl Friedrich Bahr, a 28-year-old from Germany, who was also seeking entry to the United States. When he arrived, he told the same story as his fellow passengers: As a victim of persecution, he wanted asylum from Nazi violence.""
""But during a meticulous interview process that involved five separate government agencies, Bahr's story began to unravel. Days later, the FBI accused Bahr of being a Nazi spy,"" Smithsonian Magazine continued. ""What Bahr didn’t know, or perhaps didn’t mind, was that his story would be used as an excuse to deny visas to thousands of Jews fleeing the horrors of the Nazi regime.""
The article goes on to state that Roosevelt repeatedly promoted unproven claims that Jewish refugees had been coerced into spying for Nazi Germany.
Later in the war, government whistleblowers spoke out against what Roosevelt's administration was doing, and, in 1944, the Treasury Department released a damning report by lawyer Randolph Pau, which in part stated:
“I am convinced on the basis of the information which is available to me that certain officials in our State Department, which is charged with carrying out this policy, have been guilty not only of gross procrastination and willful failure to act, but even of willful attempts to prevent action from being taken to rescue Jews from Hitler.” "
Google CEO: YouTube Will Begin Targeting 'Content Which Doesn't Exactly Violate Policies' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48210/google-ceo-youtube-will-begin-targeting-content-james-barrett,"June 10, 2019 views
A day after acknowledging that his videos did not violate its policies, YouTube decided to demonetize all of conservative comedian and commentator Steven Crowder's videos in response to a left-wing Vox employee complaining that Crowder repeatedly made fun of him because of his identity. On the same day, YouTube announced a mass ban on all content promoting one group as superior to another ""in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.""
In an interview with Axios published Sunday but filmed before YouTube's unveling of its new policy last week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai signaled YouTube's crackdown and its plans to expand the ban to include ""borderline content.""
""Look, we aren't quite where we want to be,"" Pichai told ""Axios on HBO."" While YouTube is improving on eliminating content it deems problematic, he suggested, they are still working toward even more extensive content-controlling measures.
Google, said Pichai, ""rank[s] content based on quality."" They plan to apply that same approach to YouTube. ""And so we are bringing that same notion and approach to YouTube so that we can rank higher quality stuff better and really prevent borderline content,"" he said.
Pichai then offered a definition of what he means by ""borderline content."" ""Content which doesn't exactly violate policies, which need to be removed, but which can still cause harm,"" he said, in language echoing YouTube's statement to Crowder days later.
The issue is ""a hard computer science problem,"" said Pichai, but an even harder ""societal problem because we need better frameworks around what is hate speech, what’s not, and how do we as a company make those decisions at scale, and get it right without making mistakes.""
As The Daily Wire reported, amid the Crowder controversy last week, YouTube announced sweeping changes to how it handles content.
""YouTube has always had rules of the road, including a longstanding policy against hate speech,"" YouTube said Wednesday in a statement. ""Today, we're taking another step in our hate speech policy by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.""
""We will begin enforcing this updated policy today; however, it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up and we'll be gradually expanding coverage over the next several months,"" the platform explained. Earlier this year, YouTube said it was going to crack down on channels that ""repeatedly brush up against our hate speech policies"" by barring them from working with the YouTube Partner ad program.
The announcement came the same day YouTube told Crowder that it had decided to demonetize all of the videos of his popular channel — a decision that came less than 24 hours after the company admitted his videos ""don’t violate our policies.""
""Even if a creator's content doesn't violate our community guidelines, we will take a look at the broader context and impact, and if their behavior is egregious and harms the broader community, we may take action,"" YouTube said in a statement Wednesday. ""In the case of Crowder's channel, a thorough review over the weekend found that individually, the flagged videos did not violate our Community Guidelines. However, in the subsequent days, we saw the widespread harm to the YouTube community resulting from the ongoing pattern of egregious behavior, took a deeper look, and made the decision to suspend monetization. In order to be considered for reinstatement, all relevant issues with the channel need to be addressed, including any videos that violate our policies, as well as things like offensive merchandise.""

'Birth Strikers' Pledge Not To Have Kids Because Of 'Climate Crisis' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48201/birth-strikers-pledge-not-have-kids-because-emily-zanotti,"'Birth Strikers' Pledge Not To Have Kids Because Of 'Climate Crisis' Photo by Tatyana Tomsickova Photography/GettyImages June 9, 2019 views
A group of people who call themselves ""birth strikers"" are pledging not to to have children in order to save the Earth, according to CNN .
BirthStrike appears to be a small group -- no more than 330 people so far -- but the group's members say the trend is growing, and that at least 80% of their membership is female.
One member, a musician, told CNN that the purpose of ""BirthStrike"" is to prevent an ""ecological Armageddon"" by voluntarily reducing the global population, but also to protect a future generation of humans from having to endure the after-effects of that same ""ecological Armageddon,"" including harsher weather and food insecurity.
""The BirthStrikers have decided they can't bring children into a world where scientists predict climate change will bring bigger wildfires, more droughts, and food shortages for millions of people,"" CNN reports. The group claims ""climate change,"" which is happening at a nearly negligible rate, is responsible for everything from sea level rise to war.
""When climate change gets worse, it multiplies other things. It's like dominoes that are falling,"" one prominent member of BirthStrike told CNN. ""It goes beyond sea level rise and storms. It affects food production, migration, resources and war.""
Others claim it's ""unfair"" to bring children into a world where they may have to adapt to a changing environment, even though that's been a function of the human race for as long as it has roamed the Earth.
The group relies, of course, on the United Nations climate study that suggests denizens of this planet may only have around 11 quality years left ot address the ""climate crisis"" before an unspecified catastrophic event. They're largely convinced that humanity has only a little more than a decade to address the issue, and bringing children into the world would contribute to, rather than alleviate, the problem.
BirthStrike is hardly the only group looking to address ""the surplus population."" There are several, including a group called ""Voluntary Human Extinction,"" made up of activists who are choosing not to have children in order to ""save the planet."" The United Nations has, on occasion, even encouraged responsibility in ""population control"" to help alleviate the pressure on resources, especially in the third world (it's why Planned Parenthood is so popular and commands so much time in the global forum).
It's also not a new proposition. In the late 1990s, a group called ""Zero Population Growth"" tried to lobby for policies that rewarded limited reproduction in the name of preserving the environment.
But according to experts who spoke to CNN, BirthStrike and its fellow anti-child organizations may not be doing as much for the environment as they believe they are, because it's not necessarily how many people the Earth holds that makes the difference in whether climate activists will make -- it's how much those people consume. Those who do not reproduce also run the risk of their ideology dying with them.
In other words, voluntary extinction is its own form of social Darwinism, and the leftists who embrace it are actually doing themselves a disservice by ending their own lines. "
Masterpiece Cakeshop Was Just Sued For 'Discrimination' For A THIRD Time | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48225/masterpiece-cakeshop-was-just-sued-discrimination-emily-zanotti,"Masterpiece Cakeshop Was Just Sued For 'Discrimination' For A THIRD Time BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images June 10, 2019 views
Masterpiece Cakeshop is again under fire, now the subject of a third discrimination lawsuit alleging that owner Jack Phillips ""discriminated"" against a customer by refusing to make a cake for an unspecified event.
Phillips, of course, won at the United States Supreme Court after suing a Colorado ""human rights"" commission that punished him for refusing to provide a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding in Denver, a task Phillips said violated his religious conviction that true marriage is between one man and one woman. Phillips offered to sell the couple a pre-made cake or refer them to another baker — solutions that would have allowed Phillips to avoid material participation in the same-sex wedding — but the couple wasn't satisfied and leveled a complaint with Colorado authorities.
Ultimately, in a decisive Supreme Court victory, Phillips won against the Colorado human rights commission, but the victory hinged on the behavior of the commission itself, which SCOTUS found to be harassing and discriminatory. The Supreme Court refused to issue a verdict on whether the First Amendment's free exercise clause protects Christians from being forced to participate in same-sex weddings — or any event or action that violates their right of conscience.
But, intent on punishing Phillips for his ""crimes,"" leftists have hit the baker twice with lawsuits alleging further ""discrimination,"" once the day of the Supreme Court verdict — that was tossed out — and again last week, according to CBS's Denver affiliate .
""The latest lawsuit was filed Wednesday in Denver District Court on behalf of Autumn Scardina by attorneys Paula Greisen and John McHugh,"" the outlet reports.
Scardina is the same woman who filed the previous lawsuit alleging discrimination after Masterpiece Cakeshop denied her request — made the day Phillips won his case — for a cake celebrating her gender transition. Reports on this newest lawsuit are vague on the theme of the pastry in question — they have said, so far, only that Scardina requested a ""birthday cake"" — but previous filings indicate that Scardina has gone out of her way on several occasions to request cakes Masterpiece Cakeshop clearly will not make.
Newsweek reports that the baked goods at the center of Scardina's previous complaints to Colorado authorities included a ""cake to celebrate Satan's birthday,"" with ""cheesecake frosting"" that would feature ""a large figure of Satan, licking a 9” black Dildo...an actual working model, that can be turned on before we unveil the cake.""
Phillips said then that he believes Scardina regularly requests objectionable cakes from his bakery, including cakes with pentagrams and upside-down crosses.
Scardina's previous lawsuit, based on claims Phillips made during the original same-sex wedding cake litigation that he would make ""any"" cake for an LGBT customer except for a wedding cake, was dropped back in September of last year, after Phillips agreed to drop his own discrimination case against the state of Colorado, according to Colorado Public Radio .
But Scardina, apparently, felt no need to give up.
""A new lawsuit has been filed against Masterpiece Cakeshop that appears to largely rehash old claims. The State of Colorado abandoned similar ones just a few months ago. So this latest attack by Autumn Scardina looks like yet another desperate attempt to harass cake artist Jack Phillips.

Trump Tweets Support For Conservative Voices Banned From Twitter | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48211/trump-tweets-support-conservative-voices-banned-joseph-curl,"Trump Tweets Support For Conservative Voices Banned From Twitter NurPhoto / Contributor / Getty Images
President Trump on Sunday voiced his support for conservatives who have been banned from Twitter.
""Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform, without restriction,"" Trump wrote on the very same social media platform. ""It’s called Freedom of Speech, remember. You are making a Giant Mistake!"" Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform, without restriction. It’s called Freedom of Speech, remember. You are making a Giant Mistake! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2019
Twitter banned some high-profile conservative commentators in May. Actor James Woods, who has 2.1 million followers, was banned by Twitter in April. Trump responded then, too: ""How can it be possible that James Woods (and many others), a strong but responsible Conservative Voice, is banned from Twitter?"" he wrote in early May. ""Social Media & Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves. VERY UNFAIR!"" How can it be possible that James Woods (and many others), a strong but responsible Conservative Voice, is banned from Twitter? Social Media & Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves. VERY UNFAIR! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2019
Twitter also banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, activist Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos.
In May, Trump also tweeted support for Diamond and Silk, whose real names are Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson and have been longtime supporters of the president.
""The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook,"" the president wrote. ""They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad — and we’re looking into. It’s getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!""
Trump’s comments on Sunday came amid talk that his re-election campaign is considering creating a profile on a new conservative social media platform called Parler.
Politico reported that the president’s social media manager, Brad Parscale, is ""aware"" of the new site and is ""checking [it] out.""
Parler was created in 2018 after the founders became ""exhausted with a lack of transparency in big tech, ideological censorship and privacy abuse,"" they wrote on the site. It is similar to Twitter but has only 100,000 users; Twitter has more than 325 million users.
Trump has repeatedly bashed social media platforms for censoring conservatives. ""No wonder Congress wants to get involved — and they should. Must be more, and fairer, companies to get out the WORD!"" Trump tweeted in April. But should be much higher than that if Twitter wasn’t playing their political games. No wonder Congress wants to get involved - and they should. Must be more, and fairer, companies to get out the WORD! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
""When will the Radical Left Wing Media apologize to me for knowingly getting the Russia Collusion Delusion story so wrong?"" Trump wrote in May. ""The real story is about to happen! Why is @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN, @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter & Facebook. Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!""

Trump in 2018 also pointed out that Twitter allegedly ""shadow bans"" conservatives, restricting the visibility of their tweets in search results.
""Twitter 'SHADOW BANNING' prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints,"" he wrote in July.

Georgia-Boycotting Star's 'Dark Phoenix' Flames Out At Box Office Amid Brutal Reviews | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48206/georgia-boycotting-stars-dark-phoenix-flames-out-james-barrett,"Georgia-Boycotting Star's 'Dark Phoenix' Flames Out At Box Office Amid Brutal Reviews Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic June 10, 2019 views
The latest installment of the ""X-Men"" series, starring ""Game of Thrones"" star Sophie Turner, who recently made headlines for joining the boycott of Georgia over its ""heartbeat bill,"" is flaming out at the box office, managing a disappointing $33 million in its opening weekend amid ice-cold reviews. In fact, ""Dark Phoenix"" has earned the unwelcome dual distinction as the worst reviewed film in the X-Men series and the worst-performing in its opening weekend.
Despite being released in 3,721 theaters and a massive promotional push, ""Dark Phoenix"" brought in only an estimated $33 million over its first three days. According to Box Office Mojo , that's twelfth out of the twelve films in the ""X-Men"" franchise and $20 million less than the second-worst performing ""X-Men"" film, ""The Wolverine.""
Part of the reason for the sub-par box office performance appears to be the critical response to the Simon Kinberg-directed film. The film currently has a dismal 23% on the Tomatometer among critics and a tepid 64% audience score. That's the worst of any of the ""X-Men"" films.
""Dark Phoenix ends an era of the X-Men franchise by taking a second stab at adapting a classic comics arc -- with deeply disappointing results,"" reads Rotten Tomatoes' critics' summary. A few examples of the many box office-damaging reviews: ""It is a joyless, lifeless, boring affair that repeats ideas from better X-films and feels more like an obligatory reunion cash grab than a deeply considered goodbye to iconic characters,"" writes RogerEbert.com's Brian Tallerico. ""Despite the frequent verbal confrontation scenes in which characters lash out at one another, soap opera style, for lying or serving their selfish interests, Dark Phoenix doesn't come close to carrying the emotional impact of so many Marvel films..."" says Chicago Sun-Times Richard Roeper. ""It didn't have to end this way...It didn't have to end with so little emotion, so little meaning - with a sad little speech about evolving, for Phoenix's sake,"" laments San Diego Reader's Matthew Likona. ""Their performances are so cornball and their line-readings so hacky that one might be forgiven for confusing Dark Phoenix with some low-rent porno parody of itself,"" writes Globe and Mail's John Semley.
Rotten Tomatoes' impact on the box office has become a frequent topic of conversation in recent months, particularly when it comes to politically charged content and online campaigns. After the ""Want to See"" score for ""Captain Marvel"" nose-dived following star Brie Larson repeatedly turning promotional events for the film into opportunities to push a feminist agenda, Rotten Tomatoes took steps to protect films from similar blowback. First, the site announced its decision to drop the ""Want to See"" score altogether and disable the comments function prior to a film's release. The review site's attempts to block ""trolls"" from tanking film's scores added another step a few months later when it announced its revised criteria for comments with its new ""Verified Ratings and Reviews"" policy, which requires verification that a user actually purchased a ticket to the movie before they score it.

As The Daily Wire reported a couple of weeks ago, Turner along with her ""Dark Phoenix"" co-star Jessica Chastain announced in a recent interview with Sky News that they both signed a letter with dozens of their fellow Hollywood stars pledging to boycott states that enact strict abortion laws, particularly Georgia, the third-largest film production state in the country.
""There's a letter going around that I signed saying I'm not going to work in any state that denies rights for women, for the LGBTQ community, for anyone,"" Chastain told the outlet. ""I'm not going to work in a state that discriminates.""
""I signed it too,"" Turner added. ""I have yet to tell my agents I signed it. They're going to be like: 'What? You can't work in these states?' Yeah, I can't work in these states.""
When asked about the stringent anti-abortion laws of the primary filming location of ""Game of Thrones,"" Northern Ireland, Turner did not try to defend her decision to film there for years, saying only, ""There was a lot of work of 'Game Of Thrones' there, so luckily we're moving on.""
When outrage first erupted in response to Alabama's pro-life abortion bill, HuffPost provided a summary of Northern Ireland's laws, which are ""some of the most restrictive abortion laws of any developed nation"":
Under no circumstances except to preserve the woman’s physical and mental health are abortions legal in Northern Ireland. And while the Alabama law penalizes doctors who perform abortion, threatening them with up to 99 years or life behind bars, Northern Ireland penalizes both the doctors and the women who terminate their pregnancies. Both can face life in prison. "
Justice Department Agrees To Turn Over 'Most Important' Mueller Evidence To House | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48236/justice-department-agrees-turn-over-most-important-james-barrett,"Justice Department Agrees To Turn Over 'Most Important' Mueller Evidence To House Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images June 10, 2019 views
On Monday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) announced a deal with the Justice Department that will result in the committee obtaining ""the most important files"" from the Mueller report concerning potential obstruction of justice and may end a push to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt.
""I am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has agreed to begin complying with our committee's subpoena by opening Robert Mueller’s most important files to us, providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess whether the President and others obstructed justice or were engaged in other misconduct,"" Nadler said in a statement Monday. ""These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the President by the Special Counsel.""
Nadler said that both his fellow Democrats and Republicans would be given access to the documents, which he would begin sharing with committee members this evening.
""Given our conversations with the Department, I will hold the criminal contempt process in abeyance for now,"" said Nadler. ""We have agreed to allow the Department time to demonstrate compliance with this agreement. If the Department proceeds in good faith and we are able to obtain everything we need, then there will be no need to take further steps. If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.""
The New York Times , which first reported the story, notes that ""the exact scope of the material the Justice Department has agreed to provide was not immediately clear."" However, as the paper highlights, Nadler has cited in the past his request for access to passages related to ""certain incidents when the special counsel found ‘substantial evidence’ of obstruction of justice"":
Those incidences include Mr. Trump’s attempts to fire Mr. Mueller, the special counsel; his request that Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, create “a fraudulent record denying that incident;” and Mr. Trump’s efforts to get former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to undo his recusal and curtail the scope of the special counsel inquiry.

Though Nadler said they would pause a contempt resolution concerning the unredacted Mueller report documents, as Fox News notes, plans by the House Democrats to present a ""contempt-related resolution to enforce subpoenas against Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn"" are still in the works. That measure may be voted on as early as Tuesday.
Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed some relief about the break in the stalemate over the Mueller documents; Republican Doug Collins (GA), a ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, pointing to the development as evidence that the Justice Department isn't ""stonewalling"" Congress like Democrats allege.
""Today’s good faith provision from the administration further debunks claims that the White House is stonewalling Congress, which Chairman Schiff’s successful negotiations with the Justice Department already showed,"" said Collins, the Times reports. "

President Donald Trump blasted The New York Times and CNN on Sunday as being ""the enemy of the people"" in response to reporting that he said was false regarding the deal the administration just secured with Mexico.
In a series of tweets, Trump warned that if Mexico does not cooperate with the United States and does not honor the agreement it reached with the administration last week that he will reimpose his proposed tariffs on Mexico.
""The president and other key administration officials also sharply disputed a New York Times report claiming the Friday deal 'largely' had been negotiated months ago, and hinted that not all major details of the new arrangement have yet been made public,"" Fox News' Gregg Re reported. ""Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, speaking on 'Fox News Sunday,' insisted 'all of it is new,' including the agreement to dispatch around 6,000 National Guard troops — a move Mexico has described as an 'acceleration.'""
""Another false report in the Failing @nytimes. We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time, as have other administrations, but were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico,"" Trump tweeted. ""Additionally, and for many years, Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had, or didn’t have, and now I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done.""

""Importantly, some things not mentioned in yesterday's press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time,"" Trump continued. ""There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn’t exist for decades. However, if for some unknown reason there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs - But I don’t believe that will be necessary. The Failing @nytimes, & ratings-challenged @CNN, will do anything possible to see our Country fail!

The deal struck between the U.S. and Mexico came just a few days before the U.S. was set to impose a 5% tariff on Mexican goods coming into the U.S. until Mexico stopped the flow of illegal immigration that has been flooding the southern border.
The proposed tariffs would have increased 5% per month, maxing out at 25%, until Mexico brought the flow of illegal immigration to a stop. "
Michigan Hotel Owner Offers Free Rooms To Women Seeking Abortions | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48217/michigan-hotel-owner-offers-free-rooms-women-ashe-schow,"Michigan Hotel Owner Offers Free Rooms To Women Seeking Abortions PeopleImages June 10, 2019 views
A hotel manager in a conservative Michigan town has publicly announced that she will provide free rooms and transportation to and from clinics for women seeking abortions from states that have placed restrictions on the procedure.
Shelley O’Brien runs the Yale Hotel in Yale, MI, a city that, according to Detroit Free Press , voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. He received 65% of the vote in the city. O’Brien posted the following message on Facebook:
Dear sisters that live in Alabama, Ohio, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, or any of the other states that follow with similar laws restricting access,
We cannot do anything about the way you are being treated in your home-state.
But, if you can make it to Michigan, we will support you with several nights lodging, and transportation to and from your appointment.
She has updated the post several times since she originally put it up on May 16, as more states moved to restrict when during a pregnancy a woman could obtain an abortion. She also said she would donate 25% of her “receipts that are a direct result of the new policy to a fund” like Yellowhammer, which provides money to women in Alabama seeking an abortion. O’Brien wrote that she has already donated $100 so far due to the new policy.
“We've got some amazing people in our village... we've got your backs,” she wrote.
Her policy was directed toward states that have passed “fetal heartbeat” laws, which ban abortion after a heartbeat has been detected, usually around 6 weeks. The Press reported that five states – Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Ohio – have passed such a law. Alabama also passed a law that banned abortion except for when the life of the mother was at risk. Missouri’s new law bans the procedure after eight weeks of pregnancy.
While speaking to the Press, O’Brien compared her providing women free rooms so they could terminate their pregnancies to the work of those running the Underground Railroad, which led slaves to freedom in the North back in the early to mid-1800s.
“This is important,” she told the outlet. “This is my line. There’s no coming back from this. You start taking away the right for women to control their own bodies, and we’re done for as a civilization.”
""I can’t stop what’s happening, but I have the resources to maybe help someone in that position, and especially knowing that women are coming from other states already,"" she added.
She also said one man called to complain about what she was doing after hearing about her Facebook offer.
""I have had one person call to say that he thought it was wrong,"" she told the Press. ""He didn’t have Facebook, but he heard about it and he wanted to let me know that he thought what we are doing is wrong. And I’ve been called a baby killer. And it’s like, 'No, I’m not killing babies in the basement. I am just giving someone a place to stay or maybe a ride.'”
She also told the Press that she has not seen any protesters outside the hotel and has not been confronted personally. "
"WALSH: If A Straight Pride Parade Is Stupid, So Is A Gay Pride Parade | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48224/walsh-if-straight-pride-parade-stupid-so-gay-pride-matt-walsh,"June 10, 2019 views
Personally, I agree with the people who say that the upcoming ""straight pride parade"" in Boston is a silly stunt. It's not something that I would have any interest in attending, though I do appreciate the intentional irony of Milo Yiannopolous being named the parade's grand marshal.
I believe I am on stable intellectual ground in calling the parade silly, as I have also said the same about gay pride parades. In fact, I think parades, in general — festive traffic jams, as I call them — are kind of stupid. But there are at least some justifiable reasons to throw one. Winning a war would be one good reason. Winning a Super Bowl would be another. If we are going to have a parade to announce our pride in something, it ought to be a real achievement. Or else it should at least be some occasion for actual celebration, such as a holiday like Thanksgiving or Christmas. But your sexual orientation is neither an achievement nor a holiday. You have not accomplished anything simply by being attracted to one sex or another.
It is argued that the real purpose of a gay pride parade is to resist and protest the persecution of homosexuals. Heterosexuals are not persecuted for being heterosexuals, so the argument goes, and therefore a heterosexual pride parade is pointless. But if that's the point of a pride parade, then why do they call it a pride parade? If it's really a protest, then call it a protest, or a rally, or a demonstration. And in that case, why do they hold these ""protests"" in places like San Francisco and Los Angeles, rather than Tehran or Riyadh? It seems that these pride parades are held in precisely the places where gays are not persecuted.
All the evidence indicates that gay pride parades are indeed gay pride parades. That is, they are parades that give gay people the opportunity to announce their pride in being gay. Indeed, the New York City Pride Parade website calls its event a ""pride celebration."" Another LGBT website puts it plainly: Gay people should ""feel pride in being gay."" If you agree that gays should feel pride in their gayness, and that parades ought to be held across the country to celebrate that pride, and to "" create inclusive places for self-expression "" for homosexuals, then it would obviously be a ludicrous double standard to insist that heterosexuals are not entitled to a similar celebration for themselves.
The double standard becomes even more pronounced when you take into account the whole buffet of sexual orientations that have now attached themselves like barnacles to the broader LGBT ship. Gay men and lesbian women aren't the only ones celebrating pride at a pride parade. There are also bisexuals and transsexuals and pansexuals and asexuals and greysexuals and demisexuals and the genderfluid and the gender-questioning. Is it reasonable to say that all of these people can and should publicly declare their pride — but not heterosexuals?
By the way, when was the last time a pansexual was persecuted? I wouldn't know how to persecute one if I wanted to. No, again, this has nothing to do with persecution. This is about boasting of your sex life. Why, then, can't straight people boast?
As I said, I'm not in favor of anyone boasting about this sort of thing. But I'm even less in favor of arbitrary rules that allow some to boast while telling others to keep quiet. The Left is famous for such rules. Maybe, on second thought, the straight pride parade is a bit more than a silly stunt. Maybe the point is to defy the Left's rules just for the sake of defying them. Perhaps there could be some value in that, after all. "

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) ripped convicted felon and CNN contributor John Dean on Monday during a hearing in front of the House Judiciary Committee, suggesting that Dean has made a career and has financially benefited from accusing Republican presidents of committing crimes.
Gaetz opened his aggressive line of questioning by noting that Dean, who was convicted of obstruction of justice during the Watergate scandal, has written books since the scandal about how incidents in Republican administrations were ""worse than Watergate.""
""Mr. Dean, how many American presidents have you accused of being Richard Nixon?"" Gaetz asked.
""I actually wrote a book about Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, with the title 'Worse Than Watergate,'"" Dean responded.
""Did you make money on that book?"" Gaetz responded.
""It was a very successful book,"" Dean responded.
""How much money did you make?"" Gaetz pressed.
""I have no idea,"" Dean said.
""More than a million bucks?"" Gaetz asked.
""No,"" Dean replied.
""More than half a million bucks?"" Gaetz continued.
""I said I don't have any idea,"" Dean replied.
""How much money do you make from CNN?"" Gaetz asked.
""Eh--- I don’t really know exactly,"" Dean responded.
Democrat Chairman Jerry Nadler cut off Gaetz and refused to allow him to continue with his line of questioning.
""Mr. Dean has made a cottage industry out of accusing presidents of acting like Richard Nixon,"" Gaetz said to Nadler. ""I would like to know how much money he makes based on making these accusations and exploiting them for his own economic benefit and you're saying that's out of line?""
Dean was not the only contributor from a far-left network to appear at the hearing as MSNBC contributors and Obama donors Barbara McQuade and Joyce White Vance also were present and made multiple negative remarks about the president.

"CEOs From 180 Companies, Including Twitter And H&M, Pen Letter Opposing State Abortion Laws | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48241/ceos-180-companies-including-twitter-and-hm-pen-emily-zanotti,"CEOs From 180 Companies, Including Twitter And H&M, Pen Letter Opposing State Abortion Laws Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 10, 2019 views
CEOs from 180 companies signed on to a full-page ad in The New York Times released Monday, claiming recent restrictive abortion laws passed in states like Georgia, Alabama, and Missouri are ""bad for business.""
The list of CEO s includes Twitter's Jack Dorsey (though, after his name, he lists his other company, payment processor, Square) as well as the heads of Postmates, Slack, Yelp, H&M, and Tinder, as well as a handful of fashion designers and Ben and Jerry of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.
The letter claims that ""it's time for companies to stand up for reproductive health care,"" and that restricting abortion is ""bad for business,"" though the letter makes no real connection between the availability of abortion and the business climate of a particular state. Instead, they claim restricting ""reproductive freedom"" is ""against our values.""
States that threaten abortion, the CEOs say, threaten ""the health, independence, and economic stability of our employees and customers.""
""Equality in the workplace is one of the most important business issues of our time,” the ad goes on. “When everyone is empowered to succeed, our companies, our communities, and our economy are better for it.”
“Restricting access,"" it continues, ""to comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion, threatens the health, independence and economic stability of our employees and customers. Simply put, it goes against our values, and is bad for business.”
The ACLU and Planned Parenthood rounded up the CEOs for the ad and produced the content — but without apparent regard for what any of the businesses, helmed by their own signatories, actually do or where they operate.
For starters, the statement made — that without abortion, businesses will find the health, independence and economic stability of their employees threatened — seems to imply that work-life balance is outdated, and that the CEOs and their respective companies don't value the idea of employees having a family. The only way restricting the practice of abortion ultimately affects these CEOs' bottom lines is if they have to pay out benefits for employees who choose to have their children rather than kill their children.
It's convenient financially, but flies in the face of modern feminism's demand that companies be cognizant and respectful of their female employees' choices without regard for cost.
In a statement accompanying the ad, NARAL's president, Ilyse Hogue, applauded the CEOs for ""taking a stand on behalf of employees,"" but seemed to casually forget that employees have priorities other than the availability of a cruel ""healthcare"" practice.
""NARAL applauds the business leaders signing the #DontBanEquality letter for taking a stand on behalf of their employees, customers, and communities, and affirming the mainstream view that women deserve to be able to make private, personal medical decisions without politicians interfering,” her statement read.
There's also the more practical consideration of business climate. Although states like Georgia are restricting abortion, they're also extending deep credits to corporations who relocate to their state, making Georgia appealing despite its abortion laws. Certainly a handful of companies have said they're ""pulling out"" of Georgia over the law, but most companies made business decisions based on, well, business .
If abortion were the sole factor by which a company determined where to locate, Twitter and Postmates would be eyeing Illinois — the state with the most permissive abortion laws in the country. But they aren't relocating, because Illinois also has the most regressive taxation scheme.
Several of these companies also seem to ignore that they do a large part of their business in countries were social control is much heavier than it is in the United States, like China. "
"Oberlin College May End Up Paying Bakery MUCH More Than $11 Million After Insulting Jurors, Attorney Says | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48220/oberlin-college-may-end-paying-bakery-much-more-11-ashe-schow,"DailyWire.com Oberlin College May End Up Paying Bakery MUCH More Than $11 Million After Insulting Jurors, Attorney Says Larry Washburn June 10, 2019 views
Last week, Oberlin College was ordered to pay the owners of a small bakery near the college a combined $11.2 million in compensatory damages for defamation. Their response to the decision may cost them much, much more.
The Gibson family had owned and operated Gibson’s Bakery since 1885, The Daily Wire previously reported . On November 9, 2016, according to a lawsuit filed by the baker, three Oberlin students — Jonathan Aladin, Cecelia Whettstone, and Endia Lawrence — entered the store. Aladin attempted to purchase a bottle of wine with a fake ID. The owner, Allyn Gibson, refused. Gibson then noticed Aladin had two other bottles of wine under his shirt and told the student he was calling the police. The Chronicle-Telegram reported that Aladin attempted to leave, so Gibson snapped a picture of him on his phone. Aladin then knocked the phone from Gibson’s hand and ran from the store, dropping the wine bottles. Gibson chased after Aladin to stop him, and the other two students began hitting the store owner as police arrived.
This encounter was deemed racist by the Oberlin community, even though Aladin said in a statement during his sentencing hearing that racism wasn’t a factor:
""On November 9, 2016, I entered Gibson’s Market in Oberlin, Ohio, and attempted to purchase alcohol with a fake ID,” Aladin said in a written statement. “When the clerk recognized the fake ID, I struggled with the clerk to recover the fake ID. The clerk was within his legal rights to detain me, and I regret presenting a fake ID in an attempt to obtain alcohol. Thus unfortunate incident was triggered by my attempt to purchase alcohol. I believe the employees of Gibsons’ actions were not racially motivated. They were merely trying to prevent an underage sale.""
Despite what happened, Gibson attempted to get the charges against Aladin dropped from a felony to a second-degree misdemeanor.
After the incident, Oberlin staff, including interim vice president and dean of students Meredith Raimondo, began attacking the bakery as racist and said the college would no longer purchase goods from the store. Protesters demonstrated in front of the bakery. Raimondo joined them. Flyers were passed out that said the bakery “is a RACIST establishment with a LONG ACCOUNT of RACIAL PROFILING and DISCRIMINATION.”
The family, in their lawsuit, claimed Raimondo used a bullhorn to shout defamatory statements during the protests and that the college suspended classes so students could protest and provided those protesters with food and drinks.
After jurors awarded the Gibson’s $11.2 million in compensatory damages, Donica Thomas Varner, Oberlin’s vice president, general counsel and secretary for the college sent a community wide email criticizing the decision:
We are disappointed with the verdict and regret that the jury did not agree with the clear evidence our team presented. Neither Oberlin College nor Dean Meredith Raimondo defamed a local business or its owners, and they never endorsed statements made by others. Rather, the College and Dr. Raimondo worked to ensure that students’ freedom of speech was protected and that the student demonstrations were safe and lawful, and they attempted to help the plaintiffs repair any harm caused by the student protests.
As we have stated, colleges cannot be held liable for the independent actions of their students. Institutions of higher education are obligated to protect freedom of speech on their campuses and respect their students’ decision to peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights. Oberlin College acted in accordance with these obligations.
Over at Legal Insurrection, former attorney and current Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson wrote that Oberlin’s attack on the jurors could end up hurting them, as punitive damages have not been awarded:
Procedurally, the email is baffling because the trial is not over. The jury will hear more evidence and render a verdict on punitive damages that could add another $22 million to the $11 million compensatory. The objective of any communications at this sensitive stage must be to first do no harm. That’s how Scott Wargo, Oberlin’s spokesman, handled it when contacted by me and other media after the verdict, indicating the college had no comment on the jury verdict. Wargo’s statement was the professional response one would expect in this circumstance, so why are others at the college not heeding that basic corporate communications strategy?
Jacobson went on to write how “infuriating” the email sent to the Oberlin community was to those who followed the case. As he wrote, Oberlin and Raimondo were not, as the email claimed, “held liable for the independent actions of their students” — they were held accountable for their own actions and not those of Aladin or any student protesters.

Congress Plan To Give Themselves A Raise Derailed After Backlash; Ocasio-Cortez Not Happy | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48254/congress-plan-give-themselves-raise-derailed-after-james-barrett,"Congress Plan To Give Themselves A Raise Derailed After Backlash; Ocasio-Cortez Not Happy ""ALL workers deserve cost of living increases..."" Alex Wong/Getty Images June 11, 2019 views
As The Daily Wire noted Monday, many in Congress feel like it's finally time to give themselves a long overdue raise after suffering a decade-long pay freeze at just $174,000 — more than three times the median salary in America (about $47,000 in the first quarter of 2019). Their proposed new salary would be $178,700, a $4,700 raise. But that plan appears to have been rather quickly derailed amid internal backlash from Democrats who fear that giving themselves more taxpayer money might end up putting their reelection chances in jeopardy.
Though supporters of the pay raise stress that they had bipartisan support and insist that a ""modest"" bump in pay is a necessary ""cost of living"" adjustment, Politico reported Monday evening that the plan has been ""postponed.""
""Top Democrats agreed in a closed-door meeting Monday night to pull a key section of this week’s massive funding bill to avoid escalating a clash within their caucus over whether to hike salaries for lawmakers and staff for the first time in a decade, multiple lawmakers confirmed,"" Politico reports. ""At least 15 Democrats — mostly freshmen in competitive districts — had pushed to freeze pay after some Democratic and Republican leaders quietly agreed to the slight pay increase earlier this month.""
After ""intense"" debate over ""whether to force members to go on the record about a pay raise"" on Monday, Politico reports, the ""vulnerable"" Democrats appear to have won the argument. Voting for a pay increase, they maintained, would hurt them in 2020, when Democrats can't afford to lose any ground in the House. Politico cites ""several Democrats in battleground seats"" personally telling House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer that they would protest the vote.
As The Daily Wire's Emily Zanotti pointed out Monday, while the current Congressional salary doesn't quite qualify them for the much-maligned ""one-percenter"" label, they do make the ""five-percenter"" category. Despite her calls for equality in America, democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY) has repeatedly called for a raise for legislators.
""Members of Congress often vote to cut or keep their allowances low,"" she tweeted in March. ""It’s a superficial gesture, bc keeping Congressional pay low is what creates the desperation + impetus for good, experienced staff to flee to lobbyist jobs. Raising staffer pay helps get money out of politics. Same w/ member pay. Members are paid more than avg — but job reqs 2 residences + we can't take tax deductions for work costs. No one wants to be the one to bring up increases, so instead ppl take advantage of insider trading loopholes & don't close them for the extra cash."" Same w/ member pay. Members are paid more than avg - but job reqs 2 residences + we can’t take tax deductions for work costs. No one wants to be the one to bring up increases, so instead ppl take advantage of insider trading loopholes & don’t close them for the extra cash. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 13, 2019
Early Tuesday, she again defended Congress giving themselves a raise. ""Yep. Voting against cost of living increases for members of Congress may sound nice, but doing so only increases pressure on them to keep dark money loopholes open,"" she wrote in a series of tweets. ""This makes campaign finance reform *harder.* ALL workers deserve cost of living increases, incl min wage workers. What this does is punish members who rely on a straight salary, and reward those who rely on money loopholes and other forms of self-dealing. For example, it incentivizes the horrible kinds of legislative looting we saw in the GOP tax scam bill. It’s not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important. ALL workers should get cost of living increases. That’s why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation, too. Voting against cost of living increases is 1 reason why dark $ loopholes stay open.""

But those concerned about reelection appear to have won the day. As Global Strategy Group president Jeffrey Pollock told the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, giving themselves a raise ""feels like a potential ready-made attack ad,"" Politico reports. "
"WATCH: Whistleblower: Pinterest Censors Conservative, Pro-Life Content; Pinterest Reacts | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48249/watch-whistleblower-pinterest-censors-conservative-james-barrett,"June 11, 2019 views
A new report by Project Veritas presents a series of accusations of political and ideological bias against conservatives, Christians, and pro-lifers behind the scenes at Pinterest, a social media platform with some 300 million active monthly users. Since the report was first released, Pinterest reportedly has taken action concerning one of the allegations.
In a video that includes testimony from a whistleblower who works for Pinterest, and whose identity is concealed in the video, Project Veritas' James O'Keefe's presents internal documents provided by the whistleblower showing what appear to be various means of censoring content, including a ""porn site block list"" that includes pro-life site LiveAction.org. Among the conservatives whose content has been censored by the site is Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro and some content produced by conservative outlets, including PJ Media.
""Project Veritas has received and published documents from an insider at Pinterest,"" Project Veritas reported Monday. ""The documents, which include product code, Slack messages, and internal policies, reveal terms and websites that Pinterest apparently censors.""
Among the claims presented by the whistleblower is that Shapiro was censored in a ""zero tolerance moment,"" terms related to Christianity are blocked from auto-complete, a video series exposing Planned Parenthood was included in a censor list as a ""harmful"" ""conspiracy,"" and LiveAction.org was included on a list of porn sites blocked by the platform, meaning no links to its content could be produced by users.
The video shows ascreenshot from one of Pinterest's internal Slack channels on which the Public Policy and Social Impact Manager instructs employees ""to monitor the platform for 'white supremacist' content from individuals like conservative commentators Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens,"" Project Veritas reports. Three days after that message, ""ben shapiro muslim"" and ""ben shapiro islam"" were added to a ""Sensitive Terms List,"" a list shown in the video.
The whistleblower also discusses ways in which Pinterest allegedly quietly censors or ""hides"" content, including by ""silent removing,"" which is the removal of content without notifying the user. The intent of this practice is to hide problematic or ""harmful"" material, including pornographic content, but the report suggests that the function can be used to censor content for political or ideological reasons. Among the content deemed ""harmful"" and conspiratorial are reports by David Daleiden on Planned Parenthood's disturbing practices.
Since the report was initially published, O'Keefe says, Pinterest appears to have taken LiveAction.org off its porn list but has ""permanently suspended"" its account.
Asked why he's come forward, the whistleblower told O'Keefe, ""I think when public policies don’t match with how social media companies are actually implementing them, people have a right to know, people have a right to that transparency.""

Vatican Slams Gender Theory: Idea Of Gender Spectrum ‘Confused Concept Of Freedom’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48279/vatican-slams-gender-theory-idea-gender-spectrum-hank-berrien,"
On Monday, the Vatican rejected the notion of a ""gender spectrum.""
In a statement about the document titled ""Male and Female He Created Them,"" which is intended to instruct teachers and parents in Catholic education as to the standards expected of them, the Vatican explained that it was created to “support those engaged in the education of the younger generations to address ‘methodically,’ in light of the broader horizon of education in love, the issues most debated today on human sexuality.” The document states people's gender identities existing along a spectrum is ""nothing more than a confused concept of freedom in the realm of feelings and wants.""
The document itself adds , ""Efforts to go beyond the constitutive male-female sexual difference, such as the ideas of 'intersex' or 'transgender,' lead to a masculinity or femininity that is ambiguous … This oscillation between male and female becomes, at the end of the day, only a 'provocative' display against so-called 'traditional frameworks.’ … Gender theory … speaks of a gradual process of denaturalization, that is a move away from nature and towards an absolute option for the decision of the feelings of the human subject … In this understanding of things, the view of both sexuality identity and the family become subject to the same 'liquidity' and 'fluidity' that characterize other aspects of post-modern culture, often founded on nothing more than a confused concept of freedom in the realm of feelings and wants, or momentary desires provoked by emotional impulses and the will of the individual.”
The document was signed by The Congregation for Catholic Education’s leaders: Italians Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi and Archbishop Angelo Zani.
The statement from the Vatican continues:
The Congregation for Catholic Education, which prepared the text, speaks of “an educational crisis,” in particular on the themes of affectivity and sexuality, in the face of “challenges emerging from varying forms of an ideology that is given the general name ‘gender theory,’ which 'denies the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman,’” and considers them as “merely the product of historical and cultural conditioning.” Identity would then “become the choice of the individual, one which can also change over time.” The text speaks of an anthropological disorientation that characterizes the cultural climate of our time, contributing to “the destabilization of the family.” Quoting Amoris laetitia , the document says that, among other things, this ideology “leads to educational programmes and legislative enactments that promote a personal identity and emotional intimacy radically separated from the biological difference between male and female.”
The document also approves of “the need to educate children and young people to respect every person in their particularity and difference, so that no one should suffer bullying, violence, insults or unjust discrimination based on their specific characteristics (such as special needs, race, religion, sexual tendencies, etc.).”
But the document also states that “gender theory (especially in its most radical forms) speaks of a gradual process of denaturalization, that is a move away from nature,” adding that gender theory’s view of “sexual identity” and “family” are based on “a confused concept of freedom in the realm of feelings and wants.”
The document champions the “legitimate aspirations of Catholic schools to maintain their own vision of human sexuality,” positing that “a democratic state cannot reduce the range of education on offer to a single school of thought.” "
Rapper Common Praises NBA For Dropping ‘Owner’ Title: ‘Nobody Owns Us’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48234/rapper-common-praises-nba-dropping-owner-title-paul-bois,"June 10, 2019 views
The push by several NBA teams to remove the title ""owner"" from the person who purchases and manages the team has earned the praise of social justice warrior and the wokest of woke rapper, Common.
Speaking with TMZ Sports , the politically outspoken performer said the term owner ""never sat right with me.""
""I'm so pleased,"" Common told the outlet. ""The term owner — it didn't sit right with me. The history of what we have and we are as black people in this country ... it's just not really being considerate of the history.""
The new terms that some NBA teams have adopted are ""Managing Partner"" and ""Chairman.""
Common especially appreciated NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for referring to one team's majority investor as ""governor"" instead of ""owner.""
""Nobody owns us,"" Common said. ""These men are professionals.""
As The Daily Wire's Emily Zanotti reported , the term ""owner"" is actually colloquial and has never been an official term of the NBA, which officially refers to such men and women as governors.
""The term owner, TMZ says, is actually colloquial,"" Zanotti reported. ""The NBA, which says it isn't pressuring league executives to find a better way to describe themselves, refers to 'owners' as 'governors,' and the collection of NBA owners as the 'Board of Governors' of the National Basketball Association.""
Controversy over the use of the word ""owner"" erupted in 2018 when the Golden State Warriors' Draymond Green told the HBO sports show, ""The Shop,"" that he found the term racially insensitive, evoking images of plantation owners, given the predominance of black players in the NBA.
""You shouldn’t say owner,"" Green said. ""When you think of a basketball team, nobody thinks of the f***in' Golden State Warriors and think of that damn bridge. They think of the players that make that team ... you don't even know what the f*** [the bridge] is called.""
""When your product is purely the labor of people, then owner sounds like something that is of a feudal nature,"" added commentator Jon Stewart.
Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors made that claim while sitting on a net worth of $30 million , meaning he has fully enjoyed the fruits of his labors on behalf of the team's owner.
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban vehemently disagrees with the language change, noting that the owner actually does own the team beyond just managerial decisions.
""For him to try to turn it into something it's not is wrong,"" Cuban told ESPN. ""He owes the NBA an apology. I think he does, because to try to create some connotation that owning equity in a company that you busted your ass for is the equivalent of ownership in terms of people, that's just wrong. That's just wrong in every which way.""
Cuban continued: ""People who read that message and misinterpret it — make it seem like we don't do everything possible to help our players succeed and don't care about their families and don't care about their lives, like hopefully we do for all of our employees — that's just wrong."" "
Trump Campaign Looking To ‘Test The Waters’ In Oregon This Election | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48280/trump-campaign-looking-test-waters-oregon-election-ashe-schow,"Trump Campaign Looking To ‘Test The Waters’ In Oregon This Election Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images June 11, 2019 views
President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign apparently has so much money its looking to the Deep Blue state of Oregon to spend some resources.
An exclusive report from CNN showed Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio looking for ideas on “expanding the map” to get Trump past the 270 electoral votes needed to win re-election. Fabrizio, according to a memo obtained by CNN, suggested that New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Nevada – which voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 – are now “highly competitive.” As such, Trump 2020 is already spending resources to try and flip the states Red. Fabrizio also said the campaign would “keep an eye on” Minnesota, which also voted for Clinton in 2016.
“Oregon, however, is no-man's-land for the national GOP,” Reported CNN’s Dana Bash. “The last Republican to make an early play for Oregon was George W. Bush during his 2004 reelection bid, since he had come within 8,000 votes of Al Gore there in 2000. But Bush lost Oregon to John Kerry by 4 percentage points.”
It doesn’t appear as though the Trump campaign fully believes they can flip Oregon, which hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. A “senior Trump campaign source” told CNN they were looking to “test the waters” by hiring staff in Oregon. This senior adviser also told the outlet, “If we are a month out and a previous victory like Michigan is not possible, would be nice to know other states are options.”
As CNN reported, pundits in 2016 thought it was a “fool’s errand” for the Trump campaign to spend money in Wisconsin and Michigan, but they ended up winning those states. It helped that Clinton avoided Wisconsin, believing – incorrectly – that the state was locked up.
Assuming this, Clinton and her campaign went further; ignoring states where she needed to campaign and campaigning in states she wasn’t going to win just so she could get her popular vote totals up. She campaigned and spent resources in Arizona, Texas, and Utah. As I wrote previously at The New York Observer, she “didn’t just want to be the first female president—she wanted to be the first female president by a long shot,” an ambition that proved her undoing.
Clinton spent $618,000 on travel expenditures to Utah and got just half a percentage point more in votes that President Barack Obama got in 2012 (he spent just $1,500 in travel expenditures to the state that year). So, she spent far more money for barely any gains. This poor campaign strategy gave her more popular votes, but cost her the necessary electoral votes she needed to win.
At least the Trump campaign is keeping things in perspective. It remains to be seen how much money they may actually spend in Oregon or other Blue States that may flip this election cycle. They appear to be making their calculations based on multiple paths to 270 and an anticipated difficult re-election, rather than the Clinton campaign, who believed they were guaranteed to win the presidency and just wanted bragging rights.

Biden: Elect Me. I'll Cure Cancer. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48284/biden-elect-me-ill-cure-cancer-hank-berrien,"Biden: Elect Me. I'll Cure Cancer. Photo by Joshua Lott/Getty Images June 11, 2019 views
On Tuesday, speaking in Ottumwa, Iowa, former Vice president Joe Biden decided to endorse hyperbole in theatrical fashion, promising his audience that as president he would do something no human had ever done before: cure cancer.
Biden rhapsodized, ""I've worked so hard in my career that I promise you, if I'm elected president you're gonna see (the) single most important thing that changes America, we're gonna cure cancer,"" according to The Washington Examiner .
As vice president, Biden supervised the ""Cancer Moonshot"" initiative; after leaving office, Biden oversaw the Biden Cancer Initiative.
Biden’s bombastic rhetoric was reminiscent of Barack Obama’s famous “rise of the oceans began to slow “ 2008 nomination victory speech , in which he lauded himself like this:
The journey will be difficult. The road will be long. I face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations. But I also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the American people. Because if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and I believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth.
As Medical News Today explained in 2018, there are numerous methods that have being tried to combat cancer: chemotherapy; radiotherapy; tumor surgery and hormonal therapy. Newer techniques include immunotherapy, but the difficulty lies in cancer cells fooling the immune system into “ignoring them”; therapeutic viruses, but they are difficult to control; using nanoparticles to target cancer cells, and starving cancer cells of nutrients.
But according to the National Cancer Institute , there are over one hundred kinds of cancer: “There are more than 100 types of cancer. Types of cancer are usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancers form. For example, lung cancer starts in cells of the lung, and brain cancer starts in cells of the brain. Cancers also may be described by the type of cell that formed them, such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell.”
The plethora of cancers imply that dealing with them all likely defies the capacity of a “silver bullet” that can wipe them all out. As Live Science noted , “There are many different causes, ranging from radiation to chemicals to viruses; an individual has varying degrees of control over exposure to cancer-causing agents. Cancer cells, and how they grow, remain unpredictable and in some cases mysterious. Even after seemingly effective treatments, crafty cancer cells are able to hide out in some patients and resurface.”
This is not to gainsay Biden’s determination to see cancer wiped out, only to say that to promise a cure for cancer in order to win votes does seem to be rather self-aggrandizing. "
HAMMER: Trump Has The Unilateral Power To Stop This Migrant Influx. He Just Needs To Act. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48281/hammer-trump-has-unilateral-power-stop-migrant-josh-hammer,"June 11, 2019 views
One would be hard-pressed to utilize adjectival alarmism that could sufficiently describe the outright national crisis that is currently transpiring at our inundated southern border. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, over 144,000 aliens were apprehended between ports of entry or deemed admissible at points of entry in the month of May alone — thus representing a 32% month-over-month increase from the already-record-shattering April monthly tally. Looking solely at apprehensions between points of entry, May's total of 132,887 was more than double the number of apprehensions from just February — the month when Trump declared the situation at the border so dire that he declared a national emergency to help allocate funding to construct a wall and begin the slow process of ameliorating the influx.
Uncharted . Unprecedented. Unsustainable. Bonkers . Full-on emergency . System-wide emergency . One can insert any phrase of choice, but no phrase can truly account for the magnitude of the current problem. Over 1% of the entire nation of Guatemala has entered — legally or (usually) illegally — the U.S. since September and, even more amazingly, one-third of the entire impoverished nation plans to immigrate to the U.S. at some point in the future! Along with unvetted bogus asylees coming from fellow ""Northern Triangle"" nations El Salvador and Honduras, the summation of this mass migrant influx is social transformation without republican representation that massively enriches Mexican transnational cartel syndicates and leads to exacerbated narcotic and crime epidemics in our nation's interior.
Ideally, the Department of Homeland Security would begin by immediately acting to finish the job on its (inexplicably) aborted re-writing of the erroneous, sovereignty-infringing Flores consent decree that dominated so much of the immigration-related 2018 media cycle. But the reality is also that President Donald Trump has many unilateral, statutorily delegated, and/or constitutionally inherent powers at his disposal to quell, contain, and ultimately stop this influx. As Ryan Girdusky recently tweeted, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) tops the list: There's a long list of existing statute that gives @realDonaldTrump to power to fix this problem on his own: 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) and (b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV) 18 U.S.C. § 1001 — Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) May 21, 2019
If properly enforced, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) could single-handedly eliminate this Central American-originated, Mexican cartel-orchestrated, harrowingly physically dangerous assault on our nation's collective sovereignty. Here is the relevant statutory text (emphasis added):
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation , and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
It does not take a lawyer to read 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) and conclude that it is a wildly deferential statutory enactment. Indeed, pursuant to the text, the president can ""suspend the entry of ... any class of aliens "" by mere ""proclamation"" if he deems the entry of those aliens to be ""detrimental to the interests of the United States"" (itself a non-justiciable legal standard that is necessarily solely within the ambit and discretionary judgment of the president). Congress could not have possibly made its deference to the president more emphatic. Indeed, in the ""travel ban"" U.S. Supreme Court case last term of Trump v. Hawaii , Chief Justice John Roberts said that § 1182(f) ""exudes deference to the President in every clause."" Justice Clarence Thomas, furthermore, noted in a Hawaii concurrence that ""Section 1182(f) does not set forth any judicially enforceable limits that constrain the President. ... Nor could it, since the President has inherent authority to exclude aliens from the country.""
That inherent constitutional power on the part of the president referenced by Justice Thomas, furthermore, has long had a firm and indelible place throughout Supreme Court case law. In 1892's Nishimura Ekiu v. United States , Justice Horace Gray summarized well the plenary power doctrine of the political branches over immigration policy when he opined: ""It is not within the province of the judiciary to order that foreigners who have never been naturalized, nor acquired any domicile or residence within the United States, nor even been admitted into the country pursuant to law, shall be permitted to enter, in opposition to the constitutional and lawful measures of the legislative and executive branches of the national government "" (emphasis added). Furthermore, in 1950's Knauff v. Shaughnessy , Justice Sherman Minton observed: ""The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty. The right to do so stems not alone from legislative power but is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation"" (emphasis added). Justice Antonin Scalia echoed this sentiment in his epic dissent in 2012's Arizona v. United States , wherein he properly described ""the power to exclude from the sovereign’s territory people who have no right to be there"" as ""the defining characteristic of sovereignty.""
Mr. President, you have abundant power to stop this migrant influx on your own. All it takes is the proper unilateral invocation of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) and the issuance of a far-reaching proclamation pursuant thereto. You should not waste a minute's more time. "
WATCH: Google CEO Flatly Admits That YouTube Practices Censorship | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48272/watch-google-ceo-flatly-admits-youtube-practices-hank-berrien,"DailyWire.com WATCH: Google CEO Flatly Admits That YouTube Practices Censorship "" ... the thing we are trying to do is to bring more authoritative sources and fact checks on videos which may be controversial."" Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images June 11, 2019 views
Speaking with a journalist from Axios, Google CEO Sundar Pichai doubled down on recent statements made by Google’s YouTube, openly admitting that YouTube acts as a publisher, not a platform, as they censor what they deem to be too controversial to exist on their sites. By definition, “publishers” edit what is on their sites, which means they are responsible for the content, while platforms eschew censoring and are thus not responsible for the content on them.
As Adam Candeub, law professor & director of the Intellectual Property, Information & Communications Law Program at Michigan State University and anti-trust attorney Mark Epstein explained in The City-Journal in May, 2018:
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act immunizes online platforms for their users’ defamatory, fraudulent, or otherwise unlawful content. Congress granted this extraordinary benefit to facilitate “forum[s] for a true diversity of political discourse.” This exemption from standard libel law is extremely valuable to the companies that enjoy its protection, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, but they only got it because it was assumed that they would operate as impartial, open channels of communication—not curators of acceptable opinion.
Pichai was interviewed by Axios’ chief technology correspondent, Ina Fried, who stated, “I think maybe a good place to start is YouTube, and obviously it comes up a lot. What goes through your mind when you watch a video like the recent one, you had this teenager who had appeared to be donning Muslim garb, spewing a lot of anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, homophobic hate? What goes through your mind when you see a video like that and see that it’s gotten 350,000 views?”
Pichai answered:
You know, I don’t know all the details of this specific video, but in general, look, I mean, all of us, you know, none of us want harmful content on our platforms. I think last quarter alone we had more than nine million videos from the platform. More recently we have introduced, just like today we do this in search, we rank content based on quality, and so we’re bringing that same notion and approach to YouTube so that we can rank higher quality stuff better and really prevent borderline content. Content which doesn’t exactly violate policies which need to be removed but which can still cause harm … and so we are working hard; it’s a hard computer science problem; it’s also a hard societal problem because we need better frameworks on what is safe speech, what’s not, and how do we as a company make those decisions. Let’s scale and get it right without making mistakes.
Fried pressed: “You’ve talked about the progress that’s made, but I feel like every other week we’re talking about something really bad, whether it was with the Notre Dame fires and 9/11 footage showing up … It feels like there’s still a lot of problems. I mean, what sort of grade would you give YouTube for where it’s at right now?”
Pichai replied, “Look, we aren’t quite where we want to be, but I think it’s a generally hard problem of, how do you, YouTube has a scale of the entire internet and I think we are making a lot of progress … but the thing we are trying to do is to bring more authoritative sources and fact checks on videos which may be controversial. It’s a case where we got it wrong, but that’s what we are trying to do and we are working hard to improve.”
YouTube has come under fire for its censorious practices of late; on June 6 The Daily Wire reported:
On Wednesday, YouTube announced a sweeping ban on all content it deems ""hateful"" or ""supremacist,"" resulting in a reported ""thousands"" of channels being shut down … ""YouTube has always had rules of the road, including a longstanding policy against hate speech,"" the company announced Wednesday in a statement.

Biden Swing State Speech: Trump An ‘Existential Threat’ To America | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48288/biden-swing-state-speech-trump-existential-threat-paul-bois,"June 11, 2019 views
Joe Biden is the savior that will deliver us from the ""existential threat"" of President Trump, he claims in a prepared speech he will give on Tuesday evening in the swing state of Iowa.
According to Fox News , the Democratic frontrunner offered a glimpse of what's to come in 2020 should he go head-to-head with Trump, which will undoubtedly be a bloody knuckle fight to the death (politically speaking).
""I believe Trump is an existential threat to America,"" Biden says in the prepared remarks released by his campaign. “Everywhere you turn, Trump is tearing down the guardrails of democracy.”
The speech reportedly mentions Trump by name as many as 40 times, attacking the president on a range of policies, including his trade deals with China.
""We are in a competition with China. We need to get tough with China. They are a serious challenge to us, and in some areas a real threat. And every single step that Donald Trump is taking is only exacerbating the challenge,"" the speech claims. ""While Trump is tweeting, China is making massive investments in technologies of the future. While Trump is name-calling, China is building roads, bridges, and high-speed rail. While Trump is pursuing a damaging and erratic trade war, without any real strategy, China is positioning itself to lead the world in renewable energy. While Trump is attacking our friends, China is pressing its advantage all over the world. So you bet I’m worried about China ― if we keep following Trump’s path.""
Of course, Biden is basically playing the only card in his deck: bash Trump at every turn. In the same speech, he also plays the card that President Trump defends neo-Nazis. The only actual proposal he makes is to have a ""fairer tax code.""
""When I’m president we’re going to have a fairer tax code,"" the speech says. ""We’re going to get rid of hundreds of billions of dollars in tax loopholes that have no economic or societal rationale,” he plans to say. “We’re going to build an economy that doesn’t just reward wealth; we’re going to build an economy that rewards work. We’re going to build an economy that works for everyone.""
Since the news of Biden's proposed speech in Davenport went public, President Trump issued a blistering counter-attack, calling the former vice president ""the weakest mentally,"" noting that his speech has a bizarre obsession with him.
""It looks like he’s failing, it looks like his friends from the left are going to overtake him very soon,” Trump said. ""When a man has to mention my name 76 times in his speech, that means he’s in trouble. He’s a different guy. He acts different than he used to. He looks different than he used to.""
“I’d rather run against, I think, Biden than anybody,"" Trump added. ""I think he’s the weakest mentally and I think Joe is weak mentally. The others have much more energy.""
The former vice president's Iowa speech comes as he has slowly been slipping in the polls as opponents begin to surge. Biden has increasingly come across as an unprincipled man that will say anything to get a vote, such as when he reversed his position on taxpayer-funded abortion in the span of one week simply because leftist extremists were attacking him.

"Ocasio-Cortez, Who Makes $174,000, Wants $4,500 Raise: ‘It’s Not Even Like A Raise’ | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48269/ocasio-cortez-wants-4500-raise-its-not-even-raise-ryan-saavedra,"June 11, 2019 views
Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) whined on Monday about the possibility that she may not get a $4,500 pay raise — which she downplayed as only being a cost of living adjustment — as she compared members of Congress to minimum wage workers.
Fox News' Gregg Re reported that there has not been a cost of living adjustment for members of Congress for the past nine years and that Democrats in vulnerable states are worried about how a $4,500 pay increase will look during the next election.
Fox News' Chad Pergram caught up with Ocasio-Cortez — who makes $174,000 per year —on Monday and asked her about the possibility that Congress would not get the pay raise. Ocasio Cortez says efforts to hike Congressional pay “may not be politically popular to say but honestly this is why there's so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on member service after people leave because precisely of this issue.” — Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) June 11, 2019 Ocasio-Cortez says efforts to hike Congressional pay are “superficial. You can you can vote against pay increases all you want..it'll look good on its surface” & voting yea “may not be great optics..your opponents could use it as a political exploit as a political issue.“ — Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) June 11, 2019
""You know, it may not be politically popular to say, but honestly, this is why there's so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on members service after people leave because, because precisely of this issue,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""So it may be politically convenient and it may make you look good in the short term for saying, 'oh, we're not voting for pay increases,' but we should be fighting for pay increases for every American worker. We should be fighting for a $15 minimum wage pegged to inflation so that everybody in the United States with a salary, with a wage gets a cost of living increase.""
""Members of Congress, retail workers, everybody should get cost of living increases to accommodate for the changes in our economy and then when we don't do that it only increases the pressure on members to exploit loopholes like insider trading loopholes to make it on the backend,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""And that's my issue, is that it's superficial, you know, can vote against pay increases all you want, it's in my opinion voting against a pay, voting against a, it's not even like a raise, it's a cost of living adjustment.""
""So, you can vote against a cost of living adjustment all you want and it'll look good on its surface but it will, every cost-of-living adjustment that, that gets bypassed, is voting to increase the pressure to exploit loopholes and legal loopholes to kind of lean on other ways to enrich oneself through service,"" Ocasio-Cortez concluded. ""And so my whole side of it is like, it may not be optics, it may not be great optics, it may not like look the best in terms of your opponents could use it as a political, exploit as a political issue, but in substance, you might as well be transparent about a cost-of-living increase.""

National Parks Toss Signs Warning Of Melting Glaciers After Glaciers Fail To Melt | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48287/national-parks-toss-signs-warning-melting-glaciers-emily-zanotti,"National Parks Toss Signs Warning Of Melting Glaciers After Glaciers Fail To Melt Photo by George Frey/Getty Images June 11, 2019 views
The National Parks Service has quietly removed signs warning visitors to Glacier National Park that they should take their selfies with the glacier now, since it would be gone by 2020 — a victim of climate change.
The Daily Caller reports that NPS was trying to swap out the visitors center signs warning tourists of the park's impending doom without fanfare, but a blogger who writes specifically about environmental issues noticed the change almost immediately.
The signs, installed during the Obama administration, warned tourists that the glaciers ""will all be gone by the year 2020."" They've since been replaced by signs that claim climate change is still eroding the glaciers bit by bit, but that researchers can't make an accurate prediction about when, precisely, the glaciers of Glacier National Park will disappear.
“When they completely disappear, however, will depend on how and when we act,"" the sign now reads.
According to the United States Geological Survey, the Caller discovered, the size of the glaciers in any given year depend on the national park's microclimate and not on the climate as a whole. The glaciers melt and freeze at different rates every year depending on weather and snowfall, and while computer models might have once predicted that they'd all but melt away by 2020, heavier snowfall has been a boon, increasing the glaciers' overall size steadily since 2009.
In 2019, it seems, the glacier actually grew even more , thanks to a record-breaking Montana snowfall, stubbornly refusing to come into compliance with the Obama adminstration's dire predictions.
That's not to say the glaciers aren't in danger; they've been melting little by little since they formed in the last ice age. Since they formed, the glaciers have retreated around 70% and will continue to melt so long as the Earth doesn't cool, but the rate will be much slower than anticipated just eight years ago. Now, the USGS and the National Parks Service say the glaciers will still be around until at least 2030, if not until 2080.
Glacier melt isn't consistent, either. Year-to-year, glaciers can grow, just as the ones in Glacier National Park have done since 2009, even if the glaciers themselves shrink in size or disappear over the course of decades or centuries.
The environmental blogger, Roger Roots, though, says the Obama administration's boo-boo is a significant blow to leftist climate alarmism, since the computer models that predicted the massive glacier melt were believed, at the time, to be conclusive — much like recent claims that humans have only 11 or 12 years to reverse carbon consumption or risk an environmental doomsday — and found their way into stories in a number of ""reputable"" publications, including The New York Times and National Geographic.
When the models changed, the outlets didn't update their stories to reflect a delayed climate apocalypse.
“As recently as September 2018 the diorama displayed a sign saying GNP’s glaciers were expected to disappear completely by 2020,” Roots wrote on his blog, Watts Up With That . “The ‘gone by 2020’ claims were repeated in the New York Times, National Geographic, and other international news sources.”
“Almost everywhere, the Park’s specific claims of impending glacier disappearance have been replaced with more nuanced messaging indicating that everyone agrees that the glaciers are melting,” Roots added.
The National Parks Service does not have to make an announcement when it changes signage, but in this case, they probably wanted to avoid the spotlight regardless of policy. "

KNOWLES: Everything About The NYT 'Making Of A YouTube Radical' Piece Is Dishonest | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Michael J. Knowles,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48245/knowles-everything-about-nyt-making-youtube-michael-j-knowles,"June 11, 2019 views
On Saturday, The New York Times published a nearly 5,000-word article featured at the top of its website on “the making of a YouTube radical.” The fact-free and defamatory rant smeared some of the most mainstream voices in political commentary and in many cases proved precisely the opposite of the points it purported to make.
“Caleb Cain was a college dropout looking for direction,” writes Times columnist Kevin Roose. “He turned to YouTube. Soon, he was pulled into a far-right universe, watching thousands of videos filled with conspiracy theories, misogyny and racism.” Which YouTubers does the article identify as “far-right,” conspiratorial, misogynist, and racist? One photo featured the Daily Wire’s own Ben Shapiro, a nationally syndicated radio host and one of the most popular podcasters in the country. Another photo depicted Dave Rubin, a gay, self-described liberal whose centrist interview show offers a platform for voices on the Right and Left of the political aisle. Bewilderingly, the editors placed in the center of the cover photo montage an image of Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who spent much of the 1970s and ‘80s explaining basic economic concepts to live audiences on camera.
“I fell down the alt-right rabbit hole,” laments Caleb Cain, the subject of the Times investigation. But just about all of the personalities the Times cites eschew the “alt-right,” a racial ideology that defines itself as an “alternative"" to traditional conservative thought. In fact, the Anti-Defamation League identified Ben Shapiro as the primary journalistic recipient of anti-Semitic tweets from the “alt-right” in 2016.
So the radicals the Times cites aren’t radical, and most of the “alt-right” voices described explicitly condemn the alt-right. How then did Cain become radicalized? He didn’t. As the Times finally admits,
Mr. Cain never bought into the far right’s most extreme views, like Holocaust denial or the need for a white ethnostate, he said. Still, far-right ideology bled into his daily life. He began referring to himself as a “tradcon” — a traditional conservative, committed to old-fashioned gender norms. He dated an evangelical Christian woman, and he fought with his liberal friends.
Cain never embraced the “far-right” or the “alt-right,” no matter how many YouTube videos he watched. To the Times, even a “traditional conservative” is radical. The belief that men and women are different, the decision to date a Christian girl, and the audacity to disagree with one’s liberal friends suggest a radicalism so dangerous it merits a New York Times investigation.
And when did Cain hit rock bottom? The Times explains,
By the night of Nov. 8, 2016, Mr. Cain’s transformation was complete. He spent much of the night watching clips of Ms. Clinton’s supporters crying after the election was called in Mr. Trump’s favor. His YouTube viewing history shows that at 1:41 a.m., just before bed, he turned on a live stream hosted by Mr. Crowder, with the title “TRUMP WINS!”
What exactly is radical about watching a video titled “Trump wins!” on the night Trump won? Nothing, unless you, like The New York Times, believe there is no distinction between “alt-right,” “far right,” “traditional conservative,” and “Trump voter.” By watching a conservative comedian celebrate the Republican victory in 2016, the Times concludes, “Mr. Cain’s transformation was complete.” Except it wasn’t. As the Times reports,
In 2018, nearly four years after Mr. Cain had begun watching right-wing YouTube videos, a new kind of video began appearing in his recommendations. These videos were made by left-wing creators, but they mimicked the aesthetics of right-wing YouTube, down to the combative titles and the mocking use of words like “triggered” and “snowflake.”
Cain then started watching videos by left-wing YouTuber Natalie Wynn. He found the videos so persuasive that he eventually came to identify as a liberal, which presents a major problem for Roose’s argument. Roose writes, “The right-wing content Mr. Cain viewed in 2015 and 2016 often consisted of videos by Stefan Molyneux,” an anarcho-capitalist with dubious views on race. He then moved on to more mainstream conservative voices like Steven Crowder. By 2017, “Mr. Cain also watched many videos by members of the so-called intellectual dark web, like the popular [liberal] comedian Joe Rogan and the [liberal] political commentator Dave Rubin.” Finally, “during 2017, Mr. Cain began watching more videos from left-wing channels.”
Putting aside for a moment the internal inconsistency — did Cain begin watching left-wing videos in 2017 or 2018? — the author accidentally disproves his own thesis. Roose purports to show the rightward radicalization of a YouTube viewer. But if Cain was radicalized at all, he was radicalized to the left, not the right. He began near the fringes of right-wing YouTube and moved steadily to the Left.
The New York Times blames YouTube’s all-powerful “algorithm” for sending Cain down the “alt-right rabbit hole” that “brainwashed” him. In reality, Cain watched a bunch of different videos, rejected some opinions, considered others further, and over the course of a few years his opinions evolved. The free exchange of ideas opened his mind and made him think more critically. That process of exposure to diverse opinions isn’t “brainwashing” — it’s education.
Roose concludes his piece trying desperately to refute that very point. He quotes Cain warning, “I’ve learned now that you can’t go to YouTube and think that you’re getting some kind of education, because you’re not,” despite having just outlined three years’ of Cain’s self-education.
Roose contends that YouTube has been “a godsend for hyper-partisans on all sides…[and] allowed them to bypass traditional gatekeepers and broadcast their views to mainstream audiences.” But hyper-partisans on the Left have always been able to reach mainstream audiences because they themselves are the gatekeepers. What YouTube offered was an opportunity for conservatives and independents who questioned leftist orthodoxy to reach a mass audience, which is why left-wing partisans are so eager to take back control.
The Times insists that YouTube offers no educational value because even most left-wingers would resist consciously stifling education. But if YouTube videos provide mere entertainment or, worse, provocation, the case for censorship is simpler. The Left has made this argument for half a century. In the 1960s, the liberal writer Lionel Trilling argued, “Liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition” in the United States. According to Trilling, conservatives express themselves not in ideas but rather in “irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas” and which one must therefore dismiss.
As ever, the Left gets it exactly backward. The Times’ investigation into the making of a right-wing ""YouTube radical” follows a young man’s self-education through the free exchange of ideas as he shifted from the center-right to the center-left. In the end, the only radicals the Times piece reveals are the libelous liars who published it. "

A new report states that the most valuable brand in the world isn’t Apple and it isn’t Google, the two companies that held the top spot for the last 12 years.
It’s Amazon.
On Tuesday, WPP and data consultant Kantar released the BrandZ Top Most Valuable Global Brands , which estimated the value of the Amazon brand at $315.5 billion. As Fox Business reported, a , a news release about the study quoted Doreen Wang, Kantar’s Global Head of BrandZ, saying, “Amazon’s phenomenal brand value growth of almost $108 billion in the last year demonstrates how brands are now less anchored to individual categories and regions … The boundaries are blurring as technology fluency allow brands, such as Amazon, Google and Alibaba, to offer a range of services across multiple consumer touchpoints. Using their consumer experience and expertise, these brands are crossing over into the business services sector, creating new opportunities for brand growth.”
Apple, which finished second last year, saw its brand value estimated at $309.5 billion and Google, on top last year, was valued at $309 billion. Microsoft was valued at $251.2 billion; Visa at $177.9 billion; Facebook at $158.9 billion; Alibaba at $131.2 billion; Tencent at $130.8 billion; McDonald’s at $130.3 billion and AT&T at $108.3 billion.
David Roth, CEO of The Store WPP EMEA and Asia and Chairman of BrandZ, told Fox Business “We’re seeing a move from individual product and service brands to a new era of highly-disruptive ecosystems. Brands need to understand the value this type of model can create and should embrace its approach to be successful in the future.”
The BrandZ report advises :
The notion of purpose has moved on. Higher purpose is fine when it is relevant to the brand and feels genuine to the consumer, not bolted on. But people do not expect all brands to save the world. What people do expect is for a brand to do what it does well, and to do it responsibly and ethically. That means conducting all aspects of the business — production, supply chain, relationships with employees and customers — ethically and honestly.
In mid-May, the Associated Press reported that Amazon would offer employees up to $10,000 in startup costs who quit their jobs and started their own business helping the company deliver packages. The Daily Wire reported, “Amazon made the announcement Monday as the company is looking into how it can offer one-day delivery for Prime members, down from the current delivery time of two days.” AP nogted, “Amazon says it will cover up to $10,000 in startup costs for employees who are accepted into the program and leave their jobs. The company says it will also pay them three months' worth of their salary.” "

After Alec Baldwin announced that he was done playing President Trump on Saturday Night Live and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee celebrated the fact, Baldwin decided to respond by taking a cheap shot at Huckabee’s daughter, White House press spokesman Sarah Sanders, by labeling her a “mouthpiece for fascism.”
As MRCTV noted, the series of exchanges started with Baldwin telling USA Today :
Darrell Hammond did it and is a far better impressionist than I'll ever be. When Anthony Alamanuik (started impersonating Trump on Comedy Central's ""The President Show""), all these people were attacking me, saying, ""Oh, your impression sucks and you suck. Please go away."" It also was something I thought to myself: ""I really don't have a lot invested in my Trump impersonation, so please find someone and convince Lorne (Michaels) to replace me."" I'm completely down with that. Winning the Emmy for that show aside, it was not some career goal of mine.So if (Atamanuik) wants the job, it's his. He can have it. I've done that. I mean, I had a lot of fun with (the cast), and when Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider wrote (Trump sketches in 2016 and 2017), that was new, it was fresh and the ratings were good. But I feel like I'm done with that now. I'm so done with that.
Huckabee tweeted, “Alec Baldwin announced that he's 'so done' playing @realDonaldTrump on 'Saturday Night Live.' Good news for viewers who are 'so done' with 'SNL' & unfunny vicious Trump bashing instead of comedy. For refreshing variety, try my show instead tonight!” Alec Baldwin announced that he's “so done” playing @realDonaldTrump on “Saturday Night Live”.

Chicago's Field Museum Now Insists You Refer To Its T-Rex Skeleton Using Gender Neutral Pronouns | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48292/chicagos-field-museum-now-insists-you-refer-its-t-emily-zanotti,"Chicago's Field Museum Now Insists You Refer To Its T-Rex Skeleton Using Gender Neutral Pronouns Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images June 11, 2019 views
Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History is home to some of the world's most treasured artifacts — mummies, rare gemstones, the taxidermied corpses of a pair of man-eating lions — and now, one huge, gender-neutral dinosaur skeleton.
According to Arc Digital, ""Sue,"" Field Museum's Tyrannosaurus Rex — one of the most complete and largest T-Rex skeletons ever discovered — is working on becoming a ""gender neutral"" icon by adopting gender-neutral pronouns in her new private exhibit on the museum's second floor.
Sue is not, in fact, gender neutral or gender fluid. The T-Rex skeleton, discovered in South Dakota in the 1990s, was either male or female. The scientists who discovered Sue believed the skeleton belonged to a female because female T-Rexes are larger than male T-Rexes, and Sue was one of the largest dinosaur skeletons ever found; she's named ""Sue"" after Susan Hendrickson, who led the team that unearthed her.
But back in March 2017, Arc Digital reports, the museum decided to have a little fun, and in response to a question lobbed during a Twitter Q&A, Sue claimed that she was ""gender neutral"" because her sex was unknown, and that she preferred the pronouns they/their/them.
By May 2017, though, Sue, who had graced the museum's central rotunda for more than a decade, was due to move upstairs to make room for an even larger dinosaur skeleton, and when constructing her pernament home in the museum's dinosaur exhibit, museum officials adopted Sue's social media gender-neutral tendencies and made them official.
""In her new suite, some of the signage describing the fossil has adopted non-binary pronouns,"" Arc Digital says. ""One sign does make the distinction between SUE the museum ambassador/Twitter star and the fossil itself, noting that the fossil is properly referred to as 'it.' But some of the rest of the signage uses 'their' pronouns and seems more interested in teaching museum-goers about the trendy movement for acceptance of non-binary identity than it does about paleontology.""
In an interview with Them magazine, museum officials point out that docents and volunteers are asked to refer to Sue by her gender neutral pronouns, and that in Sue's online presence — mostly on Twitter — she is a ""gender-neutral"" persona.
In the grand scheme, one gender-neutral dinosaur probably isn't going to make much difference in how sex and gender are viewed by modern society, and the museum argues that the imaginary Sue the Dinosaur is entirely separate from the massive skeleton that serves as an example of T-Rex in the museum's gallery. But it is a little weird that it would matter — or that a reputable scientific establishment would dabble in trendy, unscientific gender theory.

She was not, but that doesn't conclusively rule out that Sue was a female, just that she wasn't currently fertile when she passed on. "
Supreme Court Rejects Atheists' Attempt To Remove 'In God We Trust' From U.S. Currency | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48251/supreme-court-rejects-atheists-attempt-remove-god-joseph-curl,"Supreme Court Rejects Atheists' Attempt To Remove 'In God We Trust' From U.S. Currency Adrienne Bresnahan / Getty Images June 11, 2019 views
The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected a case filed by atheists to remove the phrase ""In God We Trust"" from all currency issued by the Department of Treasury.
The phrase, which has become the national motto, was first stamped on a 2-cent U.S. coin in 1864 and was officially added to both coins and paper money in 1955 after Congress passed legislation.
The high court on Monday declined to take up the case, which means the finding from the last court to hear the case stands. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case in 2018.
The case was brought by Michael Newdow, an activist who also sought to scrub the phrase ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance. He had argued that Congress' decision to put the phrase ""In God We Trust"" on currency violated the First Amendment because it was tantamount to a government endorsement of religion.
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment says ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.""
""The lawsuit also argued that the phrase violated the Fifth Amendment's due process clause and the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act because it forces 'Petitioners (who are Atheists) to bear and proselytize that Montheistic message,'"" the Free Beacon reported.
Representing clients and groups that identify as atheist, Newdow said that ""by mandating the inscription of facially religious text on every coin and currency bill,"" the U.S. government turned his clients into ""political outsiders on the basis of their fundamental religious tenet.""
""Petitioners are Atheists,"" the suit said. ""As such, they fervidly disagree with the religious idea that people should trust in God. On the contrary, their sincere religious belief is that trusting in any God is misguided. Thus, by mandating the inscription of facially religious text (i.e., 'In God We Trust') on every coin and currency bill, Defendants have turned Petitioners – among whom are nine children – into 'political outsiders' on the basis of their most fundamental religious tenet.""
""Moreover, Defendants have conditioned receipt of the important benefit of using the nation’s sole 'legal tender' upon conduct proscribed by Petitioners’ Atheism (i.e., upon Petitioners’ personally bearing – and proselytizing – a religious message that is directly contrary to the central idea that underlies their religious belief system),"" the suit said.
The lawsuit was filed by the groups Atheists for Human Rights, the Saline Atheist & Skeptic Society, and 27 individuals, including nine children.
One child petitioner wrote this, the suit says: ""The government won’t give me money that doesn’t have god things on them, so I have to use their god money and say it is my money, that says things I don’t believe in, and forces me to give this message I don’t believe in to other people when I give them my money. The government is asking me to pretend that I believe it, they are asking me to lie just so I can use their god money and help them spread a message about a god I don’t believe in. The government shouldn’t make kids and grown ups says things they don’t mean and do bad things that are not right. That is not a good government to make kids like me lie when we are always supposed to tell the truth.""
But in its 2018 ruling, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the phrase ""does not compel citizens to engage in a religious observance."" The Supreme Court's rejection of the case means that ruling stands.
Newdow has brought numerous suits before, challenging what he says is the federal government’s unconstitutional endorsement of religion. His fight in 2004 to remove ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance failed before the Supreme Court.
He also sought to block Chief Justice John Roberts from using the phrase ""So help me God"" as he administered the presidential oath of office to President Obama in 2009 and 2013, and President Trump in 2017. All of those cases failed, too. "
Virginia Democrats Just Voted For A Man Previously Jailed For Sex With A Minor | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48312/virginia-democrats-just-voted-man-previously-ashe-schow,"Virginia Democrats Just Voted For A Man Previously Jailed For Sex With A Minor Parker Michels-Boyce for The Washington Post via Getty Images June 12, 2019 views
A former member of the Virginia House of Delegates won the Democrat primary for the state senate Tuesday night, even though he was jailed four years ago for having sex with a minor whom he later married.
Joe Morrissey defeated incumbent state Sen. Rosalyn Dance by 14 points Tuesday night. Morrissey, now 61, was in his 50's when he was accused of having sex with his 17-year-old secretary, to whom he is now married. He claimed he did nothing wrong, but pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in 2015 while admitting there was enough evidence to convict him. (This often happens to innocent and guilty defendants alike, they plead to a lesser crime to avoid worse consequences in front of a jury for a larger crime.) The girl and her mother also denied anything untoward was happening between the two, though he was initially indicted on charges of possessing and distributing child pornography (he had, according to prosecutors, a nude photograph of the girl and had sent it to a friend) and the electronic solicitation of a minor.
Morrissey, according to Fox News , spent six months in jail for “contributing to the delinquency of a minor” but continued serving as a state legislator during that time.
Morrissey had originally resigned from his House District seat after conviction but won it back in a special election and served as a delegate while in jail.
In addition to his former criminal conviction, he has also been disbarred twice, the second of which he appealed.
Morrissey cruised to victory Tuesday night thanks to support in Petersburg, described by The Richmond Times-Dispatch as “a majority-black city where Morrissey’s message of fixing schools and roads secured 3,354 votes of his district-wide total of 8,739 with 100% in, according to unofficial returns.”
Morrissey also campaigned against the Democrat establishment, including Gov. Ralph Northam, who had endorsed his opponent Dance. Northam faced his own political scandal earlier this year when a photograph of two men – one in black face and the other wearing a KKK hood – was discovered in his medical school yearbook. Northam initially apologized for appearing in the photo, but reversed course a day later, claiming he was not in that photo but had worn blackface at another time in college.
As local and national Democrats called on Northam to resign, it was reported that Virginia’s Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax had been accused of sexually assaulting a woman during the 2004 Democratic National Convention. The allegation remains a “he said, she said” situation. The accuser has not been able to offer any proof of her allegations.
As the top brass in Virginia Democrat politics looked poised to resign amid scandals, it was discovered that the second-in-line Democrat, Attorney General Mark Herring, also appeared in blackface in college. Once that came to light, and it was reported that the next in line to succeed to the governorship was a Republican (Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox), calls for resignations from other Democrats stopped.
Now there’s a fourth Democrat (that we know about) in Virginia with an unseemly scandal. "
WALSH: The Persecution Of Jack Phillips | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48270/walsh-persecution-jack-phillips-matt-walsh,"June 11, 2019 views
It has been seven years since Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, politely declined to make a cake for a gay wedding. Even though Phillips essentially secured a victory in the U.S. Supreme Court (his religious liberties were not explicitly affirmed, but the Court did admonish the Colorado Civil Rights Commission for its anti-Christian bias), the LGBT lobby has not let the matter go away. As the nearly decade-long backlash against Chick-fil-A has shown us, left-wing gay activists are perhaps the pettiest and most vengeful people in America. They will pursue their enemies for as long as it takes, using whatever tactics are necessary, gleefully destroying lives in the process. And Jack Phillips has now surpassed the chicken chain as their public enemy number one.
The Daily Wire reports that Phillips now faces his third ""discrimination"" lawsuit. This one is filed by Autumn Scardina, a man who identifies as a woman. Scardina is also responsible for the second lawsuit against Phillips. It appears that the new one stems from the same incident in 2017, wherein Phillips opted not to make a cake in celebration of Scardina's ""gender transition.""
It is obvious already that Scardina was trying to entrap Phillips and manufacture grounds for a lawsuit. I doubt that most people who get ""gender transitions"" feel the need to mark the occasion with a cake. And even if they do, there is no reason why you need to call the one baker in the country who is prominent and famous for his conservative Christian religious convictions. And even if you did want to make a cake, and you did innocently happen to call Jack Phillips of all people, there is no reason why you need to tell him that the cake is for a ""gender transition."" Scardina says that he simply wanted a cake with pink icing on the outside and blue on the inside. There probably wouldn't have been any problem had he not taken the time to unnecessarily explain the bizarre symbolism behind the color arrangement.
But we don't need to make assumptions based on any of that. We can make assumptions based on the fact that Scardina spent months harassing Phillips with orders for bizarre and offensive cake designs. Newsweek describes one of the more objectionable requests:
""I'm thinking a three-tiered white cake. Cheesecake frosting,"" the customer wrote in the June 4 email, according to Phillips' lawsuit filed in Denver's federal court on Tuesday. ""And the topper should be a large figure of Satan, licking a 9' black dildo. I would like the dildo to be an actual working model, that can be turned on before we unveil the cake.""
One can't help but feel a certain amount of pity for Scardina, who is clearly a pathetic and disturbed person. But he is also a bully and a harasser, and the only thing that should be filed in court with his name on it is a restraining order.
Seven years ago, Jack Phillips was just a baker, running his business, making his cakes, and not harming anyone. He did not go out looking for national attention. He did not want to be the face of the religious liberty movement in America. A series of coordinated and targeted harassment campaigns by LGBT activists changed all of that. His life has been upended, his business nearly ruined, and his formerly peaceful and normal existence ripped apart. The only reason for any of this — the only reason — is his Christian faith.
You hear a lot of phony persecution claims these days. It seems everyone is angling to be oppressed. Jack Phillips wasn't angling for it, but he found it. What's happening to Phillips is real, live persecution. And all decent, freedom-loving Americans should stand in opposition to it. "
The Media/Democrat Complex Strikes Big Tech | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ben Shapiro,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48309/mediademocrat-complex-strikes-big-tech-ben-shapiro,"The Media/Democrat Complex Strikes Big Tech Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images June 12, 2019 views
This week, The New York Times ran a massive piece detailing the supposed radicalization of one Caleb Cain. Cain moved from political liberalism toward self-ascribed ""tradcon"" status from watching YouTube videos. The New York Times charted this nefarious move by following those videos. The suggestion by The Times was simple: If you watch typical conservative content hosted by people like me, you will eventually end up watching material hosted by alt-right figures. The only solution, presumably, would be for YouTube to downgrade material The Times dislikes.
This attitude isn't only springing from The Times. Axios chief technology correspondent Ina Fried grilled Google CEO Sundar Pichai over the weekend, essentially demanding that YouTube do something to marginalize videos Fried dislikes. Vox ran a full-scale propaganda campaign last week to get conservative comedian Steven Crowder kicked off YouTube for the great sin of making offensive jokes about one of Vox's columnists. Taking their cues from Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, various media outlets have spent years suggesting that Facebook's unwillingness to censor political materials led to Hillary Clinton's unjustifiable 2016 presidential defeat.
And it's not just targeting big tech companies. The far-left organization Media Matters for America routinely leads boycott attempts against advertisers who deign to sponsor conservative programs — even if those advertisers sponsor a wide variety of political programming. Pseudojournalists from organizations like Vox and Huffington Post spend their days calling advertisers for comment on various controversial statements by right-wing hosts from Tucker Carlson to Laura Ingraham to Sean Hannity. Their goal isn't to follow the news but to generate a wave of advertiser-pullout announcements likely to do damage to those conservative hosts.
Such censoriousness is rarely, if ever, practiced on the political right. YouTube and Facebook and Twitter are never targeted by conservatives over their unwillingness to shut down opposing points of view; they're criticized for their willingness to kowtow to the political left and its demands for speech suppression. Advertisers on left-wing programming can speak freely, secure in the knowledge that conservatives won't be calling them up to rip them for sponsoring shows like Rachel Maddow's.
That's good. That's how it should be. But for members of the political left, it isn't.
There are two reasons for that. The first is obvious: Those on the political left long ago abandoned the traditional liberal notion that those who disagree have a right to speak. Instead, they must be deplatformed and their advertisers punished, lest their nefarious ideas spread and metastasize. ""Repressive tolerance,"" in the parlance of Herbert Marcuse, has become a mainstay of left-wing thinking.
The other reason is far more cynical: Many in the media want a regeneration of the monopolistic media control of the past. They long for the days when everyone consumed mainstream product to the exclusion of alternative sources. It's no coincidence that YouTube and Facebook have been touting their elevation of ""authoritative"" news in recent years — they're looking to appease a ravenous media eager to tear them down.
The media and Democrats have picked the right target: The lords of Big Tech are eager to please and frightened of blowback. They're political liberals who can be intimidated into censorship while being simultaneously assured that they're making the world a better place.
They aren't. All it would take for this censorious moment to end would be a little backbone: Facebook, YouTube and Twitter announcing that they won't censor people unless those people violate actual First Amendment principles like incitement and libel; advertisers announcing that they won't pull their dollars based on astroturfed pressure tactics. But backbone is in short supply. And the glut of intimidation won't relax anytime soon.

President Trump rails against “fake news.” But just what is this so-called fake news, exactly? Let’s take an in-depth look at one piece that — in my opinion — perfectly exemplifies fake news.
“Trump Needs a Target to Stay Interested in His Campaign. For Now, It’s Biden,” said a New York Times headline on Monday.
The story was right on the mark: The next day, both Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden lashed out at each other as they both stomped through Iowa, the first state in 2020 to vote on who will inhabit the White House.
But it was much of the content that was highly suspect: anonymous sources — or sometimes, no citation of a source at all; flat-out statements that were biased and steeped in opinion. Mind you, this was not a commentary or analysis piece. It was a news story written by esteemed news reporters, Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman, that ran on A16, in the news section of the paper.
“Late at night, using his old personal cellphone number, President Trump has been calling former advisers who have not heard from him in years, eager to discuss his standing in the polls against the top Democrats in the field — specifically Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom he describes in those conversations as ‘too old’ and ‘not as popular as people think,’” said the lead.
Interesting, but where did that info come from? Who told the reporters what Trump had said, and why did the writers put the president’s words in quotes without attributing a source?
But the next paragraph was even more interesting.
“After being briefed on a devastating 17-state poll conducted by his campaign pollster, Tony Fabrizio, Mr. Trump told aides to deny that his internal polling showed him trailing Mr. Biden in many of the states he needs to win, even though he is also trailing in public polls from key states like Texas, Michigan and Pennsylvania. And when top-line details of the polling leaked, including numbers showing the president lagging in a cluster of critical Rust Belt states, Mr. Trump instructed aides to say publicly that other data showed him doing well.”
Well. Fascinating, right? But why no source at all for the information — which, we’ll note, quickly spread across the internet. “Trump is reportedly in denial about his campaign’s bleak internal polling,” Vox wrote.
Like the Times, Vox also didn’t bother with attribution: “During campaign rallies since he’s become president, President Donald Trump has repeatedly dismissed polls that reflect poorly on him as somehow representing ‘suppression,’ or not including the 10 percent of people he thinks support him but refuse to say so publicly. But his denialism about bad polling now reportedly extends to polls conducted by his own campaign.”
Ah, they slipped in the new standby word, “reportedly.” Somebody said something, so we’re saying the same thing and fobbing it off on the first guys who said it. That’s good, right?
But I digress. Let’s go back to the big Times piece.
“In a recent overarching state-of-the-race briefing in Florida with Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, Mr. Trump was consistently distracted and wanted to discuss other things, according to people familiar with the meeting,” said the Times.
“People familiar with the meeting”? What does that mean?
In the next paragraph — citing no one, again — the writers say Trump doesn’t speak to aides “about what he hopes to accomplish” in a second term.
“Mr. Trump has griped about traveling too much, but then lashed out at aides, demanding to know, ‘Why am I not doing more rallies?’ He insists on having final approval over the songs on his campaign playlist, as well as the campaign merchandise, but he has never asked to see a budget for 2019.”
Again, a direct quote. Who said it? Someone “familiar with the things Trump says”? No clue. It’s just hanging there. Careful readers would no doubt wonder, but then, the readers of the Times mostly hate Trump, so they’ll swallow it hook, line and sinker.
The piece goes on and on, both with unsourced material and flat-out opinion that lacks any attribution. “But with a limited policy agenda and little interest in governing, Trump has been running for re-election virtually since the day he won.” Ouch.
That’s where journalism is today — and that’s why Trump complains about “fake news.” This is Journalism 101, people. As a reporter, say what you want, just back it up with sources — on the record, if you can. If you can’t, tell me why the reputed source knows anything.
“People familiar with the meeting”? That’s bush league, and you know it, New York Times.
So does President Trump.

Tim Allen Trending On Twitter: Branded 'Openly Racist' For Past Comment | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48302/tim-allen-trending-twitter-branded-openly-racist-james-barrett,"Tim Allen Trending On Twitter: Branded 'Openly Racist' For Past Comment Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Disney June 12, 2019 views
Just over a week out from the release of ""Toy Story 4,"" Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, is trending on Twitter, but not for the reason Disney would hope. The star of the conservative-leaning hit show ""Last Man Standing"" — now with Fox after ABC inexplicably dropped it — is being branded as a ""racist"" and ""bigot"" for a comment about the ""N-word"" from a 6-year-old interview.
As Twitchy explains, the whole thing started with Allen admitting that he doesn't know much about Spades in a promotional interview with Tom Hanks ahead of the film's release. ""Tom Hanks is so cool I tested his knowledge of black culture,"" tweeted media personality and ""self-taught"" journalist Xilla Valentine. Tom Hanks is so cool I tested his knowledge of black culture. pic.twitter.com/aGrJdD1Qjh — The All-Mighty Xilla Valentine (@BlogXilla) June 11, 2019
The post prompted one Twitterer to blast Allen as ""openly racist.""
""Tim Allen is openly racist now and I love seeing him squirm here,"" wrote Jeremy Bearimy, adding in a follow-up tweet that Allen wouldn't like the idea of having ""the black card."" Tim Allen is openly racist now and I love seeing him squirm here. https://t.co/yxeZXY0ozT — jeremy bearimy (@crissles) June 11, 2019 tim allen at the thought of having a black card. pic.twitter.com/dLKbPguuIc — jeremy bearimy (@crissles) June 11, 2019
The comment started to stir up some attention, and confusion, online with most blasting Bearimy for appearing to conclude that Allen was ""openly racist"" because of the interview. In response, Bearimy wrote, ""Normally I try not to call y'all stupid but the number of people here who think I'm calling Allen racist because of *this* video is truly alarming. America really gotta work on teaching reading comprehension."" normally I try not to call y'all stupid but the number of people here who think I'm calling Allen racist because of *this* video is truly alarming. America really gotta work on teaching reading comprehension. — jeremy bearimy (@crissles) June 12, 2019
So what exactly is the supposed evidence that Allen is ""openly racist""? The accusation appears to trace back to a comment Allen made about the ""N-word"" from six years ago. The Guardian reported in July 2013 (censored):
Comedian and actor Tim Allen is in a spot of bother this week. Specifically for telling the Tampa Bay Times that he should be able to say the n-word as much as he likes. ""If I have no intent, if I show no intent, if I clearly am not a racist, then how can 'n****r' be bad coming out of my mouth?"" asked Allen. The comic, who claimed to use the word regularly in his standup, added that ""[the phrase] 'the n-word' is worse to me than n****r."" African-American commentators politely but firmly disagreed. ""Here's a general rule of thumb to follow when using the n-word for white people,"" said sociologist, author and radio host Michael Eric Dyson on MSNBC: ""Never.""
While Allen's critics made clear that they believe this comment is certifiable ""proof"" that he's ""openly racist,"" others have come to the actor's defense. Some argued that ""context"" matters. ""I’m sorry but what he said maybe wrong, but the word isnt just racist, context is everything. You’d be racist for reading some uhh older books,"" wrote one Allen defender. ""Ok. And he’s racist how? When not used in a derogatory context, it’s not racist,"" said another. Others pointed out that the interview is 6 years old and that Allen's a comedian who works with ""edgy"" material. ""I mean, to be fair he said it in his act as far back as the 80s. Hell, the article above is over 6 years old and he'd been doing it forever at that point. Not saying it's a good thing, just saying edgy stuff has always been his thing,"" wrote one defender. Others suggested that Allen's being targeted because of his support for Trump. ""Why don't you just admit this is solely because he's a Trump supporter you nutjobs,"" blasted one defender.
Other Allen defenders have pointed to some of his recent actions, including philanthropic work with Disney, as evidence that he's not some ""hateful bigot"": This weekend, actors Tim Allen and Tom Hanks helped The Walt Disney Company kick off its annual Disney Toy Delivery—a part of the Disney Team of Heroes philanthropic initiative—at AdventHealth for Children in Orlando, Florida: https://t.co/mZRXHzqGXg pic.twitter.com/CK8wXK8qjS — Walt Disney Company (@WaltDisneyCo) June 10, 2019
In 2017, despite six highly successful seasons for the sitcom, ABC abruptly canceled ""Last Man Standing,"" a decision that Allen said ""stunned and blindsided"" him. ""At the time, ABC claimed that the surprise cancellation was due to costs and expensive licensing arrangements with the show's owner, 20th Century-Fox TV, including the matter of Allen's star salary which, after six seasons, would have to be re-negotiated,"" John Nolte reported. ""This explanation, however, made little sense"":
ABC was apparently in the exact same situation with another hit sitcom, Modern Family . Nevertheless, in this particular case, ABC worked out a deal with 20th Century-Fox TV and the sitcom's stars in order to renew the popular series for two additional seasons. For obvious reasons, the only difference Last Man Standing fans see between the two shows is that Modern Family proudly leans to the political left and Last Man Standing has the temerity to present a conservative, Christian main character who lives in Middle America, supports Donald Trump and sometimes ridicules leftists.
In an interview with Norm Macdonald later that year Allen said he had ""no idea"" why ABC canceled the show but suggested it had something to do with its conservative lead character, Mike Baxter. ""Archie Bunker pushed boundaries, but [actor] Carroll O’Connor was not that guy at all,"" Allen told Macdonald. Baxter is ""a version of that guy,"" said Allen. ""But there’s nothing more dangerous, especially in this climate, than a funny, likable conservative.""
The popular show was eventually revived by Fox. "

Last week, former Disney Channel star Miley Cyrus posted a photo of herself posing suggestively with a cake promoting abortion; nonsensically, the cake said ""Abortion is Healthcare"" in icing. The photo was used in a promotional campaign for Marc Jacobs sweatshirts; all the proceeds for the merchandise will apparently be funneled to taxpayer-funded abortion mill Planned Parenthood. — Miley Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) June 4, 2019
Responding to the 26-year-old’s promotional content for abortion, pro-life groups decided to recreate the image in more realistic terms. Students for Life, for example, posted a photo of a baby girl eating the icing off a cake that says ""Abortion Is Violence"" in icing.
""Mothers and their children deserve better than abortion!"" a caption from the group reads. ""Miley Cyrus and Planned Parenthood teamed up to perpetuate the lie that abortion is healthcare. But we know the truth, and we fixed their cake. Abortion betrays women."" A post shared by Students for Life of America (@studentsforlife) on Jun 6, 2019 at 1:22pm PDT
Save the Storks, another pro-life group, responded, too. Their photo showcases a baby digging into a cake that simply states, ""Celebrate Life.""
""Women's rights begin in the womb!"" the photo’s caption reads. ""Very special collab with moms who've chosen life. Like if you believe in healthcare for ALL — including the preborn."" A post shared by Save the Storks (@savethestorks) on Jun 7, 2019 at 1:52pm PDT
""Miley Cyrus posted a social media meme and message that blatantly steers women toward abortion,"" Save the Storks founder Joe Baker said in a statement, according to TheBlaze. ""We at Save the Storks want to shine a light on her insensitive post and obvious disregard for the truth about abortion.""
Another pro-life woman made her own Cyrus-style cake, reading, ""Pregnant Women Are Mothers.""
The phrase is a knock on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently arguing that pregnant women are somehow not mothers. ""[A] woman who exercises her constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy is not a 'mother,'"" Justice Ginsburg wrote in May.
""SO, my cake got a lil wonky ... I gotta admit it, [Miley Cyrus] has some rad baking skills but I'm pretty sure she spelled murder wrong,"" the caption on the photo reads. ""Anyway, this is my lil correction to her cake.""
""Abortion denies motherhood & I just won't stand for that,"" the post continues. ""Ps. I won't be licking this cake bc that's gross & my family wouldn't appreciate it."" "
Republican Gov. Signs Extreme Abortion-Till-Birth Bill Into Law | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48315/republican-gov-signs-extreme-abortion-till-birth-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Republican Gov. Signs Extreme Abortion-Till-Birth Bill Into Law Photo by Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images June 12, 2019 views
Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, signed an extreme pro-abortion bill into law on Monday, permitting abortions to be performed up until the moment of birth in the state for any reason whatsoever.
The legislation, H.57 , includes zero abortion restrictions. The unborn, who have detectable beating hearts at around six-weeks gestation and can feel pain as early as 20 weeks, can be legally killed at any time during a woman’s pregnancy for any reason at all. Notably, young girls of any age will not be required to seek parental consent before having an abortion.
""Like many Vermonters, I have consistently supported a woman’s right to choose,"" Scott said in a statement, reported by The Hill. “This legislation affirms what is already allowable in Vermont – protecting reproductive rights and ensuring those decisions remain between a woman and her health care provider.”
Gov. Scott added that he “appreciate[s] the respectful tone and civility from all sides throughout this discussion.""
“This bill proposes to recognize as a fundamental right the freedom of reproductive choice and to prohibit public entities from interfering with or restricting the right of an individual to terminate the individual’s pregnancy,” H.57 reads.
“A public entity … shall not, in the regulation or provision of benefits, facilities, services, or information, deny or interfere with an individual’s fundamental rights to choose or refuse contraception or sterilization or to choose to carry a pregnancy to term, to give birth to a child, or to obtain an abortion,” the bill continues. “No State or local law enforcement shall prosecute any individual for inducing, performing, or attempting to induce or perform the individual’s own abortion.”
The new law is similar to that of New York’s euphemistically-named Reproductive Health Act , which allows abortion until the moment of birth for essentially any reason, loosens restrictions on those who can perform abortions, and strips the unborn of any protections under the state’s penal code. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, celebrated the bill signing, as did New York Democrat lawmakers.
The move from Scott, who is notably serving in a liberal state, is out of step with other Republican governors. In May, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed the nation’s strictest abortion bill into law, outlawing all abortion, save an exception for the life of the mother. In a handful of other states with Republican governors, such as Ohio and Georgia, “heartbeat” bills have been signed into law, protecting the unborn with detectable heartbeats (around six-weeks gestation) from the fatal procedure.
The sweeping pro-life legislation made its way to Louisiana, when Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, signed a heartbeat bill into law.
According to Fox News, Edwards said his faith directs him in supporting life, but the position also holds “personal significance”: “Nearly three decades ago, he and his wife decided to have his daughter, diagnosed as a baby with spina bifida, against the doctor's advice to abort,” the outlet reported."
Major Firearms Company That Banked On Hillary Winning Files For Bankruptcy | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48318/major-firearms-company-banked-hillary-winning-hank-berrien,"Major Firearms Company That Banked On Hillary Winning Files For Bankruptcy Photo by Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images June 12, 2019 views
On Monday, a major American firearms dealer which staked its future on the election of Hillary Clinton in 2016 declared bankruptcy and its intention to liquidate.
United Sporting Companies Chief Executive Officer Bradley Johnson admitted in a court filing that USC, which was founded in 1933 as Ellett Brothers before merging with Jerry’s Sports, Inc. in 2009 and formally changing its name to United Sporting Companies, Inc. in 2010, hiked its inventory before the election of Donald Trump. They figured that once a Democrat was elected, gun sales would soar because of the Democrats’ typical hostility for guns and avowed determination to restrict gun sales.
The court filing stated:
In the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, the Debtors anticipated an uptick in firearms sales historically attributable to the election of a Democratic presidential nominee. The Debtors increased their inventory to account for anticipated sales increases. In the aftermath of the unexpected Republican victory, the Debtors realized lower than expected sales figures for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, with higher than expected carrying costs due to the Debtors’ increased inventory. These factors contributed to the Debtors tightening liquidity and an industry-wide glut of inventory.
An over-supply of firearms following the 2016 presidential election and the financial distress of certain market participants led to industry-wide sales discounts. The Debtors were forced to lower prices to remain competitive and maintain sales figures, which further eroded the Debtors’ slim margins and contributed to the Debtors’ tightening liquidity.
The Daily Mail reported of Johnson, “ … he said the Republican Trump's unexpected win over Democrat Hillary Clinton was a factor in net sales falling to $557 million in 2018 from an average $885.3 million from 2012 to 2016, with an accompanying glut of inventory.”
Other reasons cited by the company for its bankruptcy filing included Bass Pro Shops' merger with Cabela's, Gander Mountain's bankruptcy, and Dick’s Sporting Goods’ losses, all of which meant that USC had a harder time because vendors and manufacturers were less willing to extend credit to them.
The company stated it had between $100 million and $500 million of liabilities. USC’s stock included Remington, Ruger, Browning, Winchester, Smith & Wesson, Glock, Bushnell, Sig Sauer, Springfield Armory, Hornaday, Henry, Magpul, Armscor, MotorGuide, Minn Kota, Lowrance, Federal, CCI, Taurus, and Leupold. USC has 20,000 independent retailers covering all 50 states.
According to the Post and Courier :
The majority owner is Wellspring Capital Management, a New York private equity firm that’s bought the business in 2008 and is now facing a lawsuit over its handling of tens of millions of dollars in borrowed funds. Prospect Capital Corp. is alleging that the $160 million in financing to provided Ellett Brothers in 2012 and 2013 was never invested in the business, according to the complaint it filed May 23 in Lexington County.
At the end of March, The Daily Wire reported that according to Bloomberg , Dick’s Sporting Goods, the country’s largest sports retailer, lost $150 million in 2018 after the company decided to stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines."
REPORT: Rep. Ilhan Omar Filed Taxes With Her Now-Husband While Married To Someone Else | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48342/report-rep-ilhan-omar-filed-taxes-her-now-husband-emily-zanotti,"June 12, 2019 views
Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-MN) private life has been the subject of some scrutiny before (fairly or unfairly), but a new discovery about Omar's tax returns has shifted focus on to the Minnesota legislator's complicated family situation, and whether her relationships may have led her and her now-husband to violate federal law.
Last week, a Minnesota campaign finance review board released a report detailing a months-long investigation into whether Omar violated Minnesota ethics laws. But, according to The Hill , the report also speculated that Omar and her husband, Ahmed Hirsi, filed joint tax returns in 2014 and 2015 while Omar was still legally married to another man.
Omar's fundraising did land her in some hot water. She was ""ordered ... to repay her state House campaign committee nearly $3,500 in funds used in violation of law, as well as pay to the state a $500 civil penalty"" for misusing or miscategorizing money that was supposed to go toward her campaign for Congress (including, allegedly, a nearly $3,000 payment to a divorce attorney).
But it's no doubt the other potential problems that could mean real trouble. According to the Associated Press , the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board mentioned that Omar's financial disclosures contained some irregularities, and although they aren't the ones to ultimately investigate and punish her for them, the board felt they were worth mentioning.
For instance, ""Omar and her husband, Ahmed Abdisalan Hirsi, filed joint tax returns for 2014 and 2015 — before they were actually married and while Omar was legally wed to another man,"" a practice that runs afoul of both Minnesota state law and federal tax law.
The revelation also uncovered a bizarre back-and-forth relationship between Omar and Hirsi that goes back more than a decade. She and Hirsi, who Omar also claims is known as Ahmed Abdisalan Aden, applied for a marriage license in the state of Minnesota in 2002. It wasn't granted. The AP says the pair then went on to get married in the Muslim faith — just not by the state — and had two children together before breaking up in 2008.
After the pair split, Omar married a man named Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, whom conspiracy theorists claim is either a familial relation or a green card-seeker (which Omar and Elmi both deny). They did receive a marriage certificate from Minnesota and pursued a civil marriage, but when they divorced in 2011, they did not file paperwork with the state. Instead, Omar says, she and Elmi divorced in the Muslim faith and left it at that. Eventually, Omar filed for divorce from Elmi in 2017 — the same incident that affected her campaign finance situation.
Omar and Hirsi reunited, she says, sometime after she divorced Elmi, had a child together in 2012, and then legally married in 2018. But according to her IRS filings, it appears that Omar and Hirsi filed jointly as a married couple in 2014 and 2015, after she'd separated from her other husband, but before she'd filed for a legal divorce, and well before she legally married Hirsi in Minnesota.
The best way to describe the situation is, plainly, ""weird."" It's not clear, according to the Associated Press, that Omar or her non-husband saw any benefit from filing jointly, or that they purposefully intended to pay less in taxes by filling out the paperwork together. It's also not clear whether Omar is in trouble; the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board did not refer the matter to a state prosecutor, and the IRS does its own investigations and won't comment on any pending inquiries.
The discovery probably won't have much impact on Omar's re-election, but it does seem to fit in with a trend of problematic behavior that began well before she was elected to Congress."

Democrat Rep. Marcia Fudge (OH) read a letter from one of her constituents disparaging supporters of President Donald Trump and evangelical Christians on Tuesday during a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives.
""It is glaringly apparent that many who support the president’s administration are either racists, steeped in religious beliefs, ignorant, or as my mother used to say, just plain dumb,"" Fudge said as she read the letter on the House floor. ""I believe the crooked ascension of Trump to the Oval Office is a gauge that measures the declining patriotic and moral values of the many citizens of America as well as being the revelation of the hidden bigotry, judgmental attitudes that yet exist in many of those who call themselves evangelicals.""
""I believe that I can safely assume that the United States is no longer a democracy,"" Fudge continued reading.
Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX) told Fudge after she read the letter: ""Remarks and debate may not engage in personalities towards the president, including by repeating remarks made elsewhere that would be improper if spoken in the member’s own words.""

KNOWLES: President Trump Had A Huge Victory On Trade; Here's How The Media Covered It | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48307/knowles-president-trump-had-huge-victory-trade-daily-wire,"June 12, 2019 views
On Tuesday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,” the host discusses President Donald Trump’s successful trade tactics that brought the Mexican government to agree to help with immigration.
President Trump just secured a very good deal with Mexico over immigration and walking back the threat of tariffs. This has been in the news for three weeks, non-stop. The Trump trade war, it's going to destroy the whole world everything's going to hell in a handbasket. So on Friday, President Trump secures the deal with Mexico. I go to try to figure out the specifics of this deal. None of the mainstream media articles actually cover the specifics. I could not find the text of this deal anywhere, eventually, I just had to go to the White House website to read the joint statement from the United States and Mexico.
What were the headlines over this deal? Washington Post, ""The Dubious Art of Trump's Deal with Mexico."" It's ""dubious."" USA Today, ""Donald Trump claims there is more to migrant deal with Mexico than he announced but offers no specifics."" What did he announce? You haven't told me. CNN, ""Trump fights back against skeptics of his new Mexico deal."" Against the ""skeptics"": who are the skeptics? CNN, that's who. But that's the story. It's not that President Trump secures a good deal, and not what is in the actual deal. No, it's fighting back against the skeptics, by which they mean, of course, CNN.
What actually happened? President Trump has been threatening tariffs on Mexico if Mexico does not help us to stop illegal immigration into the United States. You have to remember, if you're going across the southern border into America you've got to cross into Mexico first. The vast majority of these illegal aliens coming into America are not Mexicans. They come from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, other places in Central and South America. Then they cross into Mexico, and then they come to America. President Trump said, listen Mexico, you've got to put some security along your southern border and stop this before it becomes a problem for us. Mexico hasn't done it because it's mostly a failed state and because Mexico has a huge economic incentive to continue to allow illegal immigration.
When these illegal aliens are pouring through Mexico's southern border on their way into America this brings a lot of money to Mexico's economy. Most of that money is going to the cartels, but then those cartels are spending all of that money within Mexico, in Mexico's economy. We're talking about over a billion dollars at least. Mexico has no normal economic incentive to stop illegal immigration and they have a lot of incentives to keep it going.
President Trump threatens tariffs, and everyone said this wasn't going to work. ""Oh no, the tariffs are going to hurt the American economy. Nobody takes Trump seriously. He doesn't really mean it."" Well, President Trump has slapped tariffs on our foes and on our allies. So he said, listen I'm not joking about this, I will do it. It goes down to the final hour when they could be negotiating this deal and what happens?
Mexico agrees to beef up its immigration protection. That's what happened. We were told the tariffs are going to destroy the economy; he's not really going to get any concessions because of the tariffs; the tariffs aren't even going to work. And all of those critics were proven totally wrong and President Trump's strategy totally worked. This is a major win. I mean this is a basically unqualified win for Trump and an unqualified loss for his critics who said that tariffs weren't going to work."
"Democrat Cummings Brings Wife’s Clients Before His Committee, Including AARP | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48296/democrat-elijah-cummings-brings-his-wifes-clients-ryan-saavedra,"Democrat Cummings Brings Wife’s Clients Before His Committee, Including AARP Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images June 12, 2019 views
Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings (MD), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, is facing accusations that he is using his position in Congress to financially benefit his wife, whose charity may have gained ""illegal private benefit"" from his committee activities.
Cummings' wife, Maya Rockeymoore, is the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party and she ""runs two entities, a nonprofit group called the Center for Global Policy Solutions and a for-profit consulting firm called Global Policy Solutions, LLC, whose operations appear to have overlapped, according to the IRS complaint filed by watchdog group the National Legal and Policy Center,"" The Washington Examiner reported , adding that Rockeymoore's charity ""received millions from special interest groups and corporations that had business before her husband’s committee and could have been used illegally.""
One of Global Policy Solutions' clients is AARP, which testified before Cummings' committee earlier this year on the prices of prescription drugs after Cummings cited an AARP analysis.
""Current prescription price trends are simply not sustainable,"" Catherine Alicia Georges, AARP’s national volunteer president told the House Oversight and Reform Committee in January. ""Drug companies are working hard to try to shift the blame to others in the health care system, leaving them free to set incredibly high prices and increase them with little restraint.""
AARP, which sells insurance, has launched a new campaign, ""Stop Rx Greed,"" that aims to drive down the cost of prescription drugs by pushing for artificial government price controls on prescription drug prices.
Forbes reported that Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW), a million-member and non-partisan organization, noted in a 2016 policy paper that government price controls do not work.
""Throughout history, governments around the world have tried to control the prices of goods and services. These efforts have disrupted the marketplace and created shortages or excesses,"" CAGW wrote. ""But just like zombies, price controls keep rising from the dead because politicians seem to think they can create a better methodology. They never learn that price controls do not work and end up hurting the economy, consumers, and taxpayers.""
The result of pushing for government price controls on prescription drugs could prove to be financially beneficial for AARP since they won't have to pay higher prices for the prescription drugs.
Peter Flaherty, Chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, told The Daily Wire: ""It's obvious what's going on here. Representative Cummings is using his position in Congress to drum up business for his wife, both for her non-profit and her limited liability corporation.""
""We still have not received a copy of her non-profit's 990 [form],"" Flaherty continued. ""Non-profit groups like my own are supposed to make them available upon request and we certainly do, but I asked her on April 29th; she hung up the phone on me, she still owes us the tax return.""
""That's a huge red flag,"" Flaherty concluded. ""A non-profit that will not release its tax return publicly as it's required to do is a huge red flag.""
Christopher Jacobs, founder and CEO of Juniper Research Group, wrote in The Federalist last year: ""A review of AARP’s financial statements shows that since 2010, AARP has made more than $4.5 billion in income from selling health insurance plans, and generating investment income from plan premiums.""
In his report, Jacobs alleged that AARP made those profits ""largely from denying care to vulnerable individuals with pre-existing conditions.""
A Republican operative who wished to remain anonymous told The Daily Wire: ""Since Rep. Cummings repeatedly chose not to recuse himself from involvement in hearings involving his wife’s paid clients, there needs to be an immediate ethics investigation into these obvious conflicts of interests. The American people need to know the truth about what appears to be a potentially corrupt self-enrichment scheme by the congressman and his wife.""
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, told Breitbart News earlier this year: ""There’s always room for improvement when it comes to compliance, and the tax-exempt sector is no exception. Oversight, especially in the tax-exempt sector, continues to be a top priority for me to identify and discourage improper behavior, but also to highlight best practices in this important sector.""
A former Trump White House official told Breitbart News regarding AARP: ""Why is the Trump administration funding President Trump’s political enemies to the tune of over $100 million? It boggles the mind why anyone in the administration would think it’s a good idea to line the pockets of the very people who publicly oppose and lobby against the president’s America First agenda. The administration should put an end to the AARP gravy train immediately."" Recommended For You "

On Wednesday, it was reported that Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) said her mother, whom she said has been a United States citizen for roughly 42 years, might not answer the 2020 census question asking whether she is a United States citizen: Dem MI Rep Tlaib at Census contempt markup: My mother has been a US citizen for almost 42 years. But you know what’s going to make her hesitate? Is when they ask her about that in her question. It’s going to make her hesitate, even though she’s been in this country four decades. — Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) June 12, 2019
The census, which is taken every ten years to determine how to apportion seats for Congress, again has the citizenship question on it; the question was on the census from 1820 through 1950. On Wednesday, the House Oversight and Reform Committee voted 24 to 15 to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for ignoring subpoenas for documents about the question that was reposted on the census. Democrats are complaining that the question discourages voters from participating in the census.
President Trump asserted executive privilege so documents listed in the subpoenas would not be released. Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, (D-MD), “By proceeding with today’s vote, you have abandoned the accommodation process with respect to your requests and subpoenas for documents concerning the secretary’s decision to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.”
When Trump was asked about the issue on Wednesday, he replied, ""That's really a legal matter. But I think when you have a census, and you're not allowed to talk about whether or not somebody is a citizen or not, that doesn’t sound so good to me. So I don’t want to get you into this battle, but it's ridiculous.
USA Today reported in April that the Supreme Court must decide in June whether the question will remain. In April, the court was divided; the conservative majority reasoned that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' plan to include the question was not illegal or unconstitutional. Chief Justice John Roberts stated, ""Citizen voting age population is the critical element in voting rights enforcement, and this is getting citizen information.”
In April, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee wrote :
Democrats do not want to know how many citizens there are in the United States. Although the Census Bureau solicits citizenship information from a portion of the population every year, Democrats now fear that a full survey of U.S. citizens will hurt their political fortunes for years to come. To prevent this outcome, Democrats in Congress—including Chairman Elijah E. Cummings—have initiated an aggressive investigation of the Commerce Department’s reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census. As the Committee Republicans have documented, Chairman Cummings’s investigation is designed to influence pending Supreme Court litigation by seeking documents from the Commerce Department that go directly to heart of the issue The Democrat fear-mongering about the citizenship question on the 2020 Census is disingenuous and wrong. Soliciting citizenship information from the people present in the United States is not new and should not be controversial."
Teen Vogue Advises 16-Year-Old On How To Obtain Abortion Without Parents' Permission | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48350/teen-vogue-advises-16-year-old-how-obtain-abortion-paul-bois,"Teen Vogue Advises 16-Year-Old On How To Obtain Abortion Without Parents' Permission ""Having access to abortion should be your right, regardless of your parents’ beliefs."" NurPhoto / Contributor / Getty Images June 12, 2019 views
The always wholesome magazine Teen Vogue is now advising minors on ways they can violate their parents' wishes and obtain an abortion without their permission.
According to LifeSiteNews , the magazine that once advised teens on the virtues of anal sex has now published an article in which columnist Nona Willis Aronowitz instructs a pregnant 16-year-old girl how to get her desired abortion without setting off her Christian conservative parents' pro-life radar.
""It’s only logical that if teens are mature enough to become parents, they are mature enough to decide whether or not they want to give birth,"" Arnowitz says in the article. ""Having access to abortion should be your right, regardless of your parents’ beliefs.""
As to what the 16-year-old should do if she lives in a state that does not permit minors to get an abortion without parental consent, Arnowitz advises that she tell her parents about the pregnancy outright in hope that it will scare them into going the abortion route. Arnowitz argues that pro-lifers often become proven hypocrites in these scenarios. She even quotes an Alabama abortionist who performed the procedure on a pro-life witness.
""One thing I’ve learned while researching and reporting on these issues is that supposedly anti-abortion Americans often get abortions,"" says Arnowitz. ""They often help their children procure abortions. You know those activists who stand outside clinics holding signs adorned with Bible verses and pictures of fetuses? Even they sometimes get abortions.""
If the girl's parents threaten to kick her out of the house, then Arnowitz suggests she employ the ""judicial bypass procedure,"" which she defines as ""a legal option in 36 states that would let you get an abortion without parental approval.""
In conclusion, Arnowitz advises the girl that she will simply be joining a solid number of women (one in four) who have obtained abortions.
The article highlights one more step that Teen Vogue has taken toward espousing extreme leftism. Just last year, the magazine even published an op-ed about the supposed hilarity of abortion. This past April, the magazine completely denied all science and basic reality when it featured a video of various left-wing activists telling teenagers that all biological binary sex is ""bulls***.""
""This idea that the body is either male or female is totally wrong,"" said one commentator in the video.
Another said: ""We all have characteristics that are typically male and typically female and it is really about political choices, social factors, ideological choices, that we assign meaning to different parts of our body. So the meaning may be that they meant, most of us are taught that if you have a vagina, you’re a girl; or if you have a penis, you’re a boy.""
""Over history, the location or the idea of what determined one’s true sex shifted,"" said another. ""A Hundred years ago it used to be whether you had ovaries or testes. Then it shifted to what kinds of chromosomes that you had. But the body doesn’t have just one place where we can sit there with a microscope or something else and say, ‘Hey, wait a second. This is really who you are; this is your true sex.’ In fact, who you are is who you say you are."" "
UNION BOSS: L.A. Mayor’s ‘Green New Deal’ Is Pushing Members Toward GOP And Trump | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Jeffrey Cawood,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48298/union-boss-la-mayors-green-new-deal-pushing-jeffrey-cawood,"UNION BOSS: L.A. Mayor’s ‘Green New Deal’ Is Pushing Members Toward GOP And Trump Organized labor launches ad campaign ripping Mayor Eric Garcetti Photo by Michael Tullberg/Getty Images June 11, 2019 views
Organized labor in Los Angeles recently launched an ad campaign blasting Democratic Mayor Eric Garcetti over his proposed ""Green New Deal,"" claiming the environmental plan would cost union jobs, increase energy bills, and erode the middle-class.
Television and radio spots supported by a seven-figure ad buy began permeating Southern California airwaves earlier this month. A TV commercial broadcast during primetime viewing hours references an unfulfilled, six-year-old Garcetti vow to eliminate homelessness in L.A. if elected mayor. A recent count showed 36,300 homeless people within the city limits, a 16% increase over last year.
Partial transcript as follows: Remember when Eric Garcetti pledged to end homelessness in L.A.? A billion of our tax dollars spent and the crisis is worse than ever. Now he wants green taxes on L.A. drivers and utility rate hikes on local families. Let’s pump the brakes on Garcetti’s new taxes. The only thing green will be money coming out of our wallets.
The drive is sponsored by the Working Californians Research Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization and front group for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 18. The union represents about 9,000 workers at the L.A. Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the United States.
Brian D’Arcy, who founded Working Californians and also serves as business manager of IBEW Local 18, said Garcetti’s proposal is one of several progressive environmental policies pushing union workers toward Donald Trump and the Republican Party.
“It’s already happening,” D’Arcy revealed.
Politico recently reported that D’Arcy “said he has heard from scores of members who are so angered about the issue they are considering sitting out the election – or even casting a ballot for Trump.”
“I’m getting hate mail and blowback from our workers, saying the Democratic Party is doing nothing for us,” D’Arcy claimed.
In April, IBEW members protested Garcetti’s decision to abandon plans to rebuild three coastal natural gas plants. The mayor unveiled his Green New Deal at a press conference later that month. According to Politico, “hundreds of jeans-wearing, tattooed union members outside of the event chanted ‘Garcetti’s gotta go’ and denounced the move as a betrayal.”
Garcetti’s aggressive goals include phasing out gas-fueled cars and call for 80% of electricity to be generated by the sun, wind, or water. They were sold as L.A.’s version of the Green New Deal climate change policies advocated by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).
Several energy workers’ unions spoke out against Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal earlier this year, calling her suggested reforms “threats to our members’ jobs and families’ standard of living.”
According to a Working Californians spokesman, Garcetti’s idea would result in “the loss of 1,800 jobs for electrical workers,” sacrificing highly-skilled organized labor for low-paying ‘green jobs.’ Occupational data indicates that many employment opportunities created by the green economy are for landscaping, maintenance, and areas that require a minimum amount of training.
The campaign also said Garcetti’s green deal would cause utility bills to “double or triple” in costs to ratepayers, which could lead to more homelessness. A radio commercial warns that the initiative would increase gas prices and worsen traffic congestion.
“This is a generational battle between the old way of doing business and a new way of doing business,” Garcetti said .
Working Californians told KFI Radio it would “ramp up” its efforts against Garcetti before the end of this year, with the next strategic phase expected to be “more of a call to action.”
In 2013, Working Californians ran a political action committee that collected more than $4 million in support of Garcetti’s mayoral opponent, Wendy Greuel. Its largest donor was IBEW Local 18, which along with its affiliates, spent $2 million in pursuit of defeating Garcetti in that race. Garcetti won the election, was re-elected in 2017, and will be termed out in 2022.

WATCH: Author Calls Abortion A Defensible ‘Form Of Killing’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48353/watch-author-calls-abortion-form-killing-we-need-frank-camp,"June 13, 2019 views
On June 4, various Verso Books social media accounts uploaded remarks from Sophie Lewis, author of ""Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against Family,"" regarding several topics, including abortion.
Lewis minces few words, painting the decision to terminate a fetus in the womb as ""a form of killing that"" pro-choice activists ""need to be able to defend.""
We’re facing a really terrifying attack on abortion – in the U.S., where I live in Northern Ireland, and elsewhere. In the past, the strategies that our side has tended to use have included a kind of ceding of ground to our enemies. We tend to say that ""Abortion is indeed very bad, but,"" or we say, ""Luckily it’s not killing; luckily it’s just a healthcare, right?"" We have very little to lose at the moment when it comes to abortion, and I’m interested in winning radically. I wonder if we could think about defending abortion as a right to stop doing gestational work.
Abortion is, in my opinion, and I recognize how controversial this is, a form of killing. It is a form of killing that we need to be able to defend. I am not interested in where a human life starts to exist. I see the forms of making and unmaking each other as continuous processes. The other end of the spectrum is the process of learning how to die well and hold each other and let each other go at the end of our lives, as well as at the beginning.
But looking at the biology of the hemochorial placentation helps me think about the violence that innocently a fetus metes out vis-a-vis a gestator. That violence is an unacceptable violence for someone that doesn’t want to do gestational work. The violence that that gestator metes out to essentially go on strike or exit that workplace is an acceptable violence.
In response to Lewis’ comments, Abra Singleton, Southwest Regional Director for the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform (CBR), an anti-abortion organization, told The Daily Wire:
In a way, Sophie Lewis' comments are refreshing. She is being honest about the fact that abortion is killing, although she makes it sound less horrid by vaguely calling it a ""form of killing."" She understands that it is illogical for abortion proponents to deny that fact any longer – that abortion does indeed end a life. She even admits that the fetus is innocent. What she does not admit, however, is that her argument, when followed to its logical conclusion, also excuses the killing of born children who require the parents to give of themselves in order to care for them.
Anyone our society views as an inconvenience or a burden can be declared to be less worthy of life in order to justify killing them. Lewis also uses terms like ""gestational work"" to distract from the truth – that there is nothing unnatural about pregnancy, and there is nothing moral about dismembering tiny human beings.
Lewis is willing to admit that abortion is the ""killing"" of a fetus, which is more intellectually honest than most pro-abortion activists, as Singleton noted, but she doesn’t extend her argument to its logical conclusion.
If it’s true that abortion is the killing of a living thing, and that a woman has the authority to terminate this living thing due to the fact that it is encased in and relies on her body for the purposes of development and survival, then it must also be true that a mother has the authority to terminate her children at other developmental stages during which they require her care.
This argument even stretches into other areas, as there are individuals (young children, the mentally and physically disabled, those who have fallen into comas or vegetative states) who rely on others to survive. Should individuals who fall into these categories also be terminated by their caregivers because they require life-sustaining treatment in order to develop and survive?

Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) slammed convicted felon and CNN contributor John Dean on Monday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing and later tacked on a swipe at MSNBC contributor Joyce White Vance.
Gohmert started by reading Dean's criminal record from an old New York Times article: ""They reported that in your case, John Sirica, the judge, read the formal charges regarding the conspiracy to thwart the investigation and he read as follows: that you were suborning perjury, giving false statements, and concealing evidence in the trial before Judge Sarika last winter.""
""Of the men arrested in the break-in, offering clemency to the defendants, paying to keep the arrested men silent, asking the Federal Bureau of Investigation for information, attempting to get the CIA to provide money for the payments,"" Gohmert continued reading. ""And furtherance of the conspiracy judge Sirica continued reading, Dean had committed six overt specific overt acts on or about June 27, 1972.""

Gohmert later took aim at MSNBC contributor Joyce White Vance, who had arrogantly stated earlier in the hearing that she could criminally prosecute the Russia case and win on appeal.
""I have amazing admiration,"" Gohmert began. ""I used to tell people that if you ever talk to a lawyer who says, ‘I’m going to win at court on this and I’ll win the appeal,’ you run from them because they’re either incompetent or corrupt, but you have such amazing ability, you know you could win at court on appeal, so I'm in admiration.""

Pompeo: Iran Is Responsible For Attacks On Oil Tankers,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-13-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48393/pompeo-iran-responsible-attacks-oil-tankers-hank-berrien,"June 13, 2019 views
On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid the blame for the attacks on two oil tankers near the Persian Gulf squarely on the government of Iran.
Speaking to reporters at the State Department, Pompeo stated:
It is the assessment of the United States government that the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the attacks that occurred in the Gulf of Oman today. This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to executive the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.
At a news conference later, Pompeo added, “Taken as a whole, these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security.”
Pompeo stated, ""On April 22nd, Iran promised the world it would interrupt the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz. It is now working to execute on that promise."" He revealed that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jonathan Cohen would bring up the issue at the Security Council on Thursday.
CBS News noted, “Benchmark Brent crude spiked at one point by as much 4% in trading after the reported attack to over $62 a barrel, highlighting how crucial the Strait of Hormuz is to global energy supplies. A third of all oil traded by sea passes through the strait, which is the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf.”
As The Daily Wire reported earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported:
The Front Altair, carrying petrochemical feedstock, was on fire in waters between Gulf Arab states and Iran after an explosion that a source blamed on a magnetic mine. The Norwegian owner said its crew were safe. A second Japanese-owned tanker was abandoned after being hit by a suspected torpedo, the firm that chartered the ship said. The crew were also picked up.
The Front Altair is Norwegian-owned; the Kokuka Courageous is the Japanese-owned tanker that was attacked. The Daily Mail reported, “Warning that the Gulf's waters are 'becoming unsafe', tanker industry chief Paolo d'Amico said that 'the oil supply to the entire Western world could be at risk' — as 30 per cent of the world's crude oil passes through the area.”
The Daily Mail noted, “The USS Bainbridge, which had been deployed to the area to offer assistance, reported that crew members saw an unexploded limpet mine on the side of one of the attacked ships. Magnetic limpet mines are suspected of being used in the May 12 attacks on four tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.”
In May, after the four tankers were hit near the Strait of Hormuz, Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton said Iran was responsible.
The New York Times reported on Thursday:
A United States Navy P-8 surveillance plane flying over the stricken tankers on Thursday spotted an unexploded mine attached to the hull of the Kokuka Courageous, one of the damaged ships, a Defense Department official said. The so-called limpet mine resembled the kind of explosive that investigators believe was used against the four ships in the attacks last month, the official said."

President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign fired back at Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday after Biden called out the president for remarks he made during an ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos.
During the interview, Stephanopoulos, who is a former Clinton administration official, asked Trump what he would do if he was presented with information from a foreign government on a political opponent.
Trump answered the question by saying that he would be willing to listen to what the information was because ""there’s nothing wrong with listening,"" and later said, ""If I thought there was something wrong, I’d go maybe to the FBI.""
Biden responded in a tweet, writing: ""President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy."" President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security.

The Trump campaign responded to Biden's swipe in a tweet of their own that featured a CNN video from this February when Biden visited Munich, Germany.
In the video, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian asked Biden if he was going to run for president in the upcoming 2020 election.
Biden responded by whispering to Sarkissian, who, in turn, whispered something back to Biden.
Moments later, Biden gave Sarkissian his business card so that Sarkissian could contact him.
""What did he give him?"" the Trump campaign tweeted. ""What did he say? Did Joe Biden report this to the FBI?""

The Department of Justice's Office of the Special Counsel issued a blistering memo Thursday accusing White Houes senior adviser Kellyanne Conway of being a ""repeat offender"" of the Hatch Act and suggesting she should be removed from the President's staff immediately. U.S. Office of Special Counsel finds Kellyanne Conway repeatedly violated the Hatch Act: ""Given that Ms. Conway is a repeat offender and has shown disregard for the law, OSC recommends that she be removed from federal service.” https://t.co/97JW3IKhMW pic.twitter.com/yF4a6t6c9Y — Dan Linden (@DanLinden) June 13, 2019
The Office of the Special Counsel, which has no relation to Special Counsel Robert Mueller (who has since left his job, anyway), issued the report Thursday morning as part of an ongoing, non-partisan watchdog investigation into members of the Executive Branch. In it, the OSC cites several instances where Kellyanne Conway appeared to go out of her way to engage in ""politicking"" -- that is, engaging in political activity or endorsing a political candidate, in violation of the Hatch Act of 1939.
Most notably, the report says, Conway made comments in favor of the then-Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, Roy Moore, and against Moore's opponent, Doug Jones, who went on to win the race.
""Doug Jones in Alabama, folks don’t be fooled,"" Conway reportedly said in one of her interviews on Fox News. ""He’ll be a vote against tax cuts. He’s weak on crime, weak on borders. He’s strong on raising your taxes. He’s terrible for property owners. And Doug Jones is a doctrinaire liberal, which is why he’s not saying anything and why the media are trying to boost him.""
The OSC also, ABC News reports , cited instances where Conway spoke out about former Vice President Joe Biden and socialist Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
""Ms. Conway's disregard for the restrictions the Hatch Act places on on executive branch employees in unacceptable,"" the report reads. ""If Ms. Conway were any other federal employee, her multiple violations of the law would almost certainly result in removal from her position by the Merit Systems Protection Board.""
""As a highly visible member of the administration, Ms. Conway's violations, if left unpunished, send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act's restrictions. Her actions erode the principal foundation of our democratic system - the rule of law,"" it continues.
Conway has been officially reprimanded but not severely punished for these kinds of statements before, so it's probably unlikely that she'll be severely punished -- or booted from the White House -- for these kinds of statements now. In response to the report, the White House called the entire OSC investigation ""deeply flawed.""
“The Office of Special Counsel’s (OSC) unprecedented actions against Kellyanne Conway are deeply flawed and violate her constitutional rights to free speech and due process,"" a spokesperson for the White House told reporters in a statement. ""Others, of all political views, have objected to the OSC’s unclear and unevenly applied rules which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees. Its decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations – and perhaps OSC should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, non-political manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act.""
The Hatch Act was developed and passed in 1939, but has been relatively unchallenged since the late 1970s, when te Supreme Court ruled that it did not violate the First Amendment rights of Executive Branch officials and others to bar them from openly politicking during their tenure. Although it does not appear Conway is about to suffer any consequences of her statements, if she did, she could challenge that ruling again, now decades later."
'Chernobyl' Producers: Please Stop Taking Half-Naked Instagram Selfies At Disaster Site,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-13-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48389/chernobyl-producers-please-stop-taking-half-naked-emily-zanotti,"June 13, 2019 views
The writers of HBO's hit miniseries, ""Chernobyl,"" are asking people to please stop taking half-naked, raunchy selfies at the actual Chernobyl site, in an effort to gain popularity on social media sites like Instagram.
Insider magazine reports that Instagram influencers have been flooding the Chernobyl nuclear site since the documentary premiered several weeks ago, seeking to capitalize on the popularity of the HBO series to boost their own brand profiles. As a result, Instagram is now peppered with photos of half-naked women and perfectly posed models, posing in front of burned out busses and melted buildings.
In one particularly egregious case, a female Instagram ""influencer"" even did a ""nuclear striptease"" for the camera at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine, unzipping a white cloth biohazard suit in front of an abandoned and burned out building to reveal a pair of skimpy thong underwear beneath. — Reel Review (@reelreviewnet) June 12, 2019
The problem began with the documentary itself, which spurred a wave of ""disaster tourism"" at the Chernobyl site in the Ukraine. Visits to the Chernobyl site — most of which is now available for tours, only decades after the nuclear reactor there melted down, destroying everything in its path — have spiked out of interest, with people flocking to the disaster zone to get a sense of the true story.
But, Insider reports, regular tourism is often accompanied, now, by Instagram tourism, and many of those visiting the Chernobyl site are anxious to get just the right 'gram to get them attention on social media.
As a result, producers and writers for the show have issued a warning to potential Chernobyl tourists: please be respectful.
""It's wonderful that #ChernobylHBO has inspired a wave of tourism to the Zone of Exclusion. But yes, I've seen the photos going around,"" producer Craig Mazin said in a statement on social media. ""If you visit, please remember that a terrible tragedy occurred there. Comport yourselves with respect for all who suffered and sacrificed.""
Chernobyl is, of course, the site of the famous nuclear meltdown in 1986 that took more than 30 lives immediately and countless more in the aftermath. More than 8 million people in Belarus, the Ukraine, and Russia were exposed to high levels of radiation as a result of the blast.
Most of the site is still considered radioactive, but a large portion of Chernobyl and the town of Pripyat are open to visitors. The World Nuclear Association declared the area ""safe"" in 2011, allowing those curious about the history to visit key sites, take tours, and snap photos. Pictures of Chernobyl's long-abandoned amusement park — complete with ghostly Ferris wheel — are the most popular.
But there's still danger for selfie-takers like the ""nuclear striptease."" Those who visit Chernobyl are required to don either a ""clean suit"" or to wear long sleeves, long pants, and shoes to cover any exposed skin, just in case of contamination. Visitors are also warned not to touch any buildings or items, and to stay away from Chernobyl's local flora and fauna out of an abundance of caution, since not all lingering effects are yet quantified.
Removing your clothes, for example, is a big no-no."

Speaking at Iowa’s America First Dinner, President Trump introduced Angel Mom Michelle Root, whose daughter was killed by an illegal immigrant the day after she graduated college with a 4.0 average. Root acknowledged Trump’s efforts to honor Angel Moms and Dada and triggered an ovation by stating, “This man gave us a voice, Angel families a voice. No other president would hear our stories.” This beautiful young girl named Sarah Root had her life taken by an ILLEGAL ALIEN hours after taking this photo, when she graduated college with a 4.0 grade point average. She had her whole life ahead of her. So much potential! We need the Wall! pic.twitter.com/ENMrk1EyDP — Students For Trump (@TrumpStudents) January 14, 2019
Before he introduced Root, Trump stated, “We want people to come into our country but they have to come in illegally and they have to come in through merit. We want people that can help us … We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. So we’re joined and honored tonight to be with a very special woman; an Angel Mom, I love Angel Moms; these are great people. Their lives have been so horribly hurt. But Michelle Root is this special woman whose precious beautiful daughter Sarah Root was killed by an illegal alien one day after graduating from college with a 4.0 GPA … That was the highest marks in her class.”
Turning to Root, Trump asked, “Please come up. Please come up. Please come up.”
Root took the stage, then stated:
This man gave us a voice, Angel families a voice. No other president would hear our stories. I was fortunate, if you want to say fortunate, enough to have him in the running to become our president. A lot of other Angel families did not have that voice until he came along. We’ve always had that voice for Sarah— she was killed January 31st 2016 within a day of graduating with a bachelor’s as the president has said; 4.0 in criminal investigations. Her killer was 16 years old when he came across the border, unaccompanied, illegally. He killed my daughter at age 19. He had a blood alcohol of .241. Streetracing, hit the back of my daughter’s SUV that was stopped at a stoplight, going 70-plus miles an hour.
My daughter never had a chance. I do not — and the reason I speak out — I don’t get Sarah back at the end of the day. I speak out because I don’t want this happening to any of you.
Our wonderful president stands by us and does everything in his power to help us because he doesn’t want to see another family have to go through what our family what we’ve gone through. And I thank him for that and I’m proud of him for standing as strong as he has against the opposition he has to face daily.
Turning to Trump, she continued, “I am so proud of you, and so is my family and my son.” Offering Trump a kiss on the cheek, she told him, “Love you.”
After she exited, Trump continued. “Your beautiful girl is looking down and she’s saying, ‘I’m so proud of my mom.” He added, “I’ve gotten to know a lot of Angel Moms and Dads and what they’ve gone through is incredible. It’s for no reason whatsoever.”

WATCH: Fleccas Tries To Get LA Pride Marchers To Agree 'Trump's Not That Bad',www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-13-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48348/watch-fleccas-tries-get-la-pride-marchers-agree-james-barrett,"June 13, 2019 views
In his latest man-on-the-street video, Austen Fletcher, or ""Fleccas,"" attended Los Angeles' Pride Parade to see if he could get anyone to agree that ""Trump's not that bad."" His effort was met overwhelmingly with declarations of ""F*** Trump!"" and the dismissal of any facts suggesting Trump was trying to help the LGTBQ community in any way, including his global effort to end the criminalization of homosexuality.
The video, the latest in his ""Trump's Not That Bad"" series, begins with Fletcher asking Pride paraders what Pride means to them.
""Pride is all about showing your inner-self, saying you love somebody without being judged,"" says one guy in a black leather speedo and black wings. ""It's about unity, diversity, and having love for your fellow man -- whatever they're into, you know,"" says one enthusiastic guy. ""Just loving each other no matter what,"" says one girl. ""Pride is all about love. Period ... You don't have to be anything except yourself this weekend,"" says one guy named Maxton.
But when Fleccas asks participants what they think about Donald Trump, the tone changes dramatically. ""F*** Donald Trump,"" says Maxton. When Fletcher asks the same question of a ""furry"" draped in a rainbow flag, he has a similar response: ""F*** Donald Trump! He can burn in hell! ... He can burn in hell for trying to get rid of trans!"" The furry's comment inspires a response from somebody in the crowd: ""F*** Donald Trump!""
In fact, the ""F*** Donald Trump!"" line was apparently the most popular response of the day; Fleccas shows participant after participant declaring it into the camera.
When Fleccas asks one guy what he'd do if he told him that there are some things Trump's done that are ""pretty good,"" he responds, ""I'm not going to listen to you."" When he provides some examples, the response doesn't get much better. Fletcher notes that Trump is putting pressure on governments that criminalize homosexuality, particularly in the Middle East, but even this pro-LGBTQ action is not celebrated by respondents, who make clear that, no matter what, Trump is not doing enough.
""Is he fixing all of the problems?"" one guy asks in response. ""Well, he's an idiot,"" says another in response to the decriminalization fact. ""He doesn't understand people. He undersands Donald Trump and that's it, so it's a personal vendetta.""
As NBC News reported in February, the Trump administration has launched ""a global campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality in dozens of nations where it's still illegal to be gay"":
U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality — mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean.
“It is concerning that, in the 21st century, some 70 countries continue to have laws that criminalize LGBTI status or conduct,” said a U.S. official involved in organizing the event.
Fletcher also speaks with a self-described ""gay conservative"" man, who describes being outcast by the LGBT community for failing to fall in line politically and ideologically.

Speaking on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Thursday, 2020 longshot Beto O'Rourke said that a Joe Biden victory would be a ""return to the past.""
""You cannot go back to the end of the Obama administration and think that that’s good enough,"" the failed senatorial candidate said on the show, according to HuffPost . ""We had real problems before Donald Trump became president.""
O'Rourke went to highlight issues like wealth disparity, gun violence, and immigration as problems that persisted under Obama.
""We cannot return to the past. We cannot simply be about defeating Donald Trump,"" he said. ""And that cannot be who we are going forward. We’ve got to be bigger, we’ve got to be bolder, we have to set a much higher mark and be relentless in pursuing that.""
Regardless of what O'Rourke or the rabid progressive base of the Democratic Party feels, Biden still continues to hold a commanding lead. In fact, a poll conducted by The Des Moines Register this week put the former vice president at 24% support, while O’Rourke stands at a meager 2%. O'Rourke, however, feels that the election is too far out to make any predictions.
""I don’t know that this many months out from the caucuses in Iowa these polls really indicate what our prospects are,"" O'Rourke told George Stephanopoulos, reports HuffPost. ""If I relied on polls, in any race I’ve run, I never would have served in the U.S. Congress, never would have taken on Ted Cruz. Never would have been able to lead the largest grassroots effort in the state of Texas.""
Despite Biden's lead in the polls, his authenticity among progressives took a major hit last week when he flip-flopped on taxpayer-funded abortions for the apparently straightforward reason that hard leftists began to criticize him for it. Former Obama campaign chief strategist David Axelrod said that Biden's flip-flop is a serious red flag , and he doubted whether the former vice president can ""go the distance.""
""I think that this was a parable about Biden that goes to question marks about his candidacy. His rollout was flawless, in my view, and he's had a very solid spring, but this underscores questions that people have had about whether he can go the distance,"" Axelrod told CNN. ""One, because the virtue of having a long record and comforting people and being a figure of stability has the flip side that you have to defend positions that you've had over the course of 45 years in politics, some of which may have been acceptable in the day and not acceptable now. We see that on this issue of the Hyde Amendment, but the other is the way this thing came down.""
Former DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile, however, believes that Biden's flip on the Hyde Amendment indicates that he is willing to ""evolve"" and should be commended for that. ""When they evolve, we should embrace their evolution,"" she said on Fox News . ""Perhaps this is not an evolution in his thoughts, but is he explaining it better now."""

Author and clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan B. Peterson confirmed the beta testing of an upcoming free speech-friendly platform he's created called Thinkspot, which he teased during a podcast last week.
“Per the Joe Rogan podcast this week, I'm backing a new platform called thinkspot, currently in Beta,” he announced via Twitter on Monday. “Get on the waitlist here, exciting announcements coming very soon.” Per the Joe Rogan podcast this week, I'm backing a new platform called thinkspot, currently in Beta. Get on the waitlist here, exciting announcements coming very soon. https://t.co/3xQ78Iqc0h — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) June 10, 2019
Thinkspot.com, the author revealed, will be a space where creators can monetize their work and users can engage in thoughtful debate without worrying about the ubiquitous Big Tech censorship plaguing conservative and right-of-center users on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.
Speaking to popular podcast host and comedian Joe Rogan last week, Peterson explained that Thinkspot’s terms of service will uphold free speech principles. “Once you’re on our platform, we wont take you down unless ordered to by a court of law,” he said.
The forthcoming platform, currently in beta testing, will be a subscription service where creators can monetize their work.
“We’re hoping we can really add dialogue to the podcast and YouTuber world,” explained Peterson. “We’re also gonna do the same things with books, so if you buy an e-book on the platform, you’ll be able to annotate publicly. ... We can do that with books that are in the public domain, too.”
“We’re hoping that we’ll be able to pull people who are interested in intelligent conversation, specifically, into this platform, maybe start pulling them away from YouTube and some of the less specialized channels — that, plus our anti-censorship stance,” he added.
The platform will start as “invitation-only” during beta testing to work out the kinks, Peterson said, naming “Rubin Report” host David Rubin, Skeptic magazine Editor-in-Chief Michael Shermer, and popular YouTuber Sargon of Akkad (real name: Carl Benjamin) as some of the first confirmed “beta testers.”
In effort to avoid “trolling,” Peterson said the platform will have a 50-word minimum on comments and force people to have to click on comments that receive more downvotes than upvotes (though this provision is still being tested).
“If minimum comment length is 50 words, you’re gonna have to put a little thought into it. Even if you’re being a troll, you’ll be a quasi-witty troll,” said Peterson, adding, “If your ratio of upvotes to downvotes falls below 50/50 then your comments will be hidden, people will still be able to see them, if they click, but you'll disappear ... We don't know if 50/50 is right.”
Voices outside of the far-left’s acceptable thought have been censored by Big Tech with increasing pace. In the most recent form of uncovered censorship, social media platform Pinterest has reportedly been cracking down on conservatives, Christians, and pro-lifers. Project Veritas' James O’Keefe showed internal documents provided by a whistleblower “showing what appear to be various means of censoring content, including a ‘porn site block list’ that includes pro-life site LiveAction.org,"" The Daily Wire reported this week. ""Among the conservatives whose content has been censored by the site is Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro and some content produced by conservative outlets, including PJ Media."""
KLAVAN: Democrats Holding Onto Their 'Empire Of Lies',www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-13-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48358/klavan-democrats-holding-their-empire-lies-daily-wire,"June 13, 2019 views
On Wednesday’s episode of “The Andrew Klavan Show,” the host discusses how the media is taking former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s side against President Donald Trump to enforce the Left’s ""empire of lies."" Video and partial transcript below.
Before Biden even spoke yesterday, CNN had a chyron that said, ""Biden to eviscerate Donald Trump."" Which sounded a little violent to me, I don't know. Just the idea that he was going to cut open Donald Trump and rip out his guts. You know, it's not the sort of thing you announce on CNN. It's the sort of thing like after it's done you might say, ""Wow, he really eviscerated."" But to announce that this is what's coming. I don't know, it just seems a little strange. But Biden did mention Trump again and again and again. I don't know how many times, I lost count. But he started it … but what got me about it is he's selling this completely sentimental idea of Barack Obama, which is built up over eight years of press, of supine press worship of Obama. Right?
I saw on Twitter the other day this woman said, ""I went to the National Gallery and saw Obama's portrait and I burst into tears. And I said to the guard, you know, 'Do you get a lot of criers?' And the guard said, 'Yes.' And I tell him, 'Don't cry, fight back.'"" And I thought, well you know I cried for all eight years of the Obama presidency, so I understand. But that is the lie that was created. The lie of this civil statesman-like man with no — remember he's scandal-free — we all know he's scandal-free. And Biden knows the press — that the press will do that for him. He knows the empire of lies exists.
He knows Stephen Colbert will back him up. He knows Netflix will make movies about it; they'll send movies in the theaters about it. And so, he's playing on that and depending on that to carry him through. So, listen to Biden talk about basically Obama vers - him, him is the new Obama. Biden is the new Obama and Trump as the evildoer who has ended all civility in government.
Biden: He's setting the standard. A standard of crude language and embarrassing behavior that is burying deep into our culture, for real, into our culture. It's gonna take some time to get rid of it but we must, we must. It's not who we are. And folks, thirdly, our democracy. Our democracy is at risk. I never thought I'd use those words in my lifetime. But it's true, everywhere you turn. Trump is tearing down the guardrails of democracy. Tearing down the things that prevent the abuse of power. Whether it's a man raising his hand to strike a woman or a child or an employer threatening workers and treating them like dirt, or an American president who has no respect for the rule of law. I can't stand it. Most Americans can't stand the abuse of power. 'Fake News,' 'Enemy of the people.' These aren't words to be laughed at or dismissed. Just look what's happening around the world. Think of the dictators and tyrants using the exact same language Trump uses to justify their abuses of power in their countries. Not a joke. Think about it. Trump's goal is simple. Discredit the news, discredit the free press, and run over the American people in terms of their safeguards roughshod.
So, Joe Biden representing himself from the Obama administration, and first of all, if I have to listen to another four years of, ""that's not who we are,"" I may actually get in a rowboat and start paddling for France myself. But he's talking about Trump's attacks on the press. No question. Enemy of the people. Fake news. Let's just think about ""the reality."" Ok? Just for a sec. I mean I hate to shatter the glass palace of the Democrats — that's the center of the Democrat Empire of Lies. But think about what Obama actually did."
KNOWLES: The Real Reason The Left Pushes Climate Change,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-13-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48361/knowles-real-reason-left-pushes-climate-change-daily-wire,"KNOWLES: The Real Reason The Left Pushes Climate Change Paul Yeung/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 13, 2019 views
On Wednesday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,” the host discusses the Left’s promotion of climate change paranoia and explains that it is a ploy to present socialism as a cure for all of the Earth’s woes. Video and partial transcript below.
The purpose of these predictions is not to warn you, it's not to predict what's actually going to happen. It is to create a panic and then get us socialism by the backdoor. This sounds almost conspiratorial. If I didn't have a video, I guess you wouldn't have to believe me, but it just keeps happening. All the predictions from the late 60s, to the 70s, to the 80s. The whole world is going to end in 10 years if you don't give us socialism and then what happens? Ten years go by and the world doesn't end and everything's perfectly fine and the predictions are all wrong. And they tell us, no, but it's really going to end in 10 years if you don't give us socialism. It's all about taking control of your property, of your liberty, of your government.
They say this environmental catastrophe that's going to destroy the world, just coincidentally, requires that you have to give the political left every single policy they've wanted for a hundred years. That's the only way to solve it and save the world.
There was a piece in The Wall Street Journal that came out today. It said, ""some Republican lawmakers break with their party on climate change."" So, the GOP has not taken climate change, or global warming, or global cooling, or whatever you want to call it today very seriously because they have understood, as I've just explained, that it is socialism by the backdoor. Now, some younger Republicans want to be super hip cool guys or something and say that we have to take global warming seriously. We don't. This is especially true of Matt Gaetz, he's a Republican lawmaker, I actually like the guy, I think generally he's pretty good. He's just dead wrong on this. Matt Gaetz a couple of months ago offered ""the green real deal,"" and he was going to have the Republican response to take on global warming. It's just a bad move.
This is not to say that Republicans shouldn't take the environment seriously. Of course, we should protect the environment. Every Republican I know wants to protect the environment, conserve the environment, have beautiful public spaces. Having beautiful spaces and preserving nature is a very conservative virtue. Conservatives, conserve. But, that's not the same thing as global warming. It's a very different thing than global warming. Because global warming is not about environmental protection. It's just about socialism.
The purpose of these predictions, whether it's this guy from the Obama administration or its AOC saying, the world is going to end in nine or ten years ... just give us all your money. The purpose of it is to demoralize people. The purpose of it is to convince people that everything is predetermined. It's no coincidence that right now so much of the left is denying free will. You see it in Sam Harris. You see it in the new atheists. You see it in a ton of the Left-wing Silicon Valley. It's in the pop culture. We're being told our free will is an illusion and really, we're just drawn by unconscious forces and our emotion is leading us. Anything but will.
The Left has always done this. This is nothing new. This is not some cool new futuristic idea out of Silicon Valley. The Left has said this forever. The early socialists and communists from one hundred to a hundred fifty years ago, they said that they had discovered the science of history. They used this phrase, ""the science of history."" This is the famous reporter, Lincoln Steffens, who visited the Soviet Union. He famously said, ""I've seen the future and it works."" There's the future. History is not moved by the individual choices of individuals. It's moved by great environmental, economic forces that we cannot control we're just brought along on the tides of history.
Actually, the modern conservative movement in the United States after World War 2, founded by William F. Buckley Jr. was set up exactly in opposition to this idea. So, you had Lincoln Steffens saying, ""I've seen the future and it works."" The Socialists saying this is the future. This is the science of history and ""get ready, get on board."" And then you have the conservative William F. Buckley Jr. who said, in the first issue of National Review, he said, “a conservative is one who stands athwart history yelling, 'Stop.'"" ""Oh, you socialists and communists, you think you have the science of history? You think there's no stopping it?"" I'm a conservative and I'm going to stand here, and I am going to say, ""stop.""
That's what we're doing. We're saying ""no"". Will does matter. Your predictions don't come true. You don't know the science of history. You don't know the future. Your predictions are bogus and you're not going to use those crazy fear mongering predictions to get us to give up our liberty and our property and our freedom."
Newly Uncovered Abortion Remarks From Biden May Seriously Damage Campaign,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,06-13-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48377/newly-uncovered-abortion-remarks-biden-may-ryan-saavedra,"Newly Uncovered Abortion Remarks From Biden May Seriously Damage Campaign Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 13, 2019 views
CNN's Andrew Kaczynski released newly uncovered comments from Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden about abortion that are likely to cause a significant headache for Biden's campaign.
""Biden made the comments ahead of his 2008 presidential bid in a March 2006 interview with Texas Monthly,"" Kaczynski reported . ""In the 2006 video, Biden called himself the 'odd man out' in the Democratic Party on the issue because of his votes to limit government funding for abortion and votes in support of bans on certain late-term abortions.""
The remarks that are likely to cause Biden the biggest problem came during a portion of the interview where he acknowledged that he would have a hard time in the Democratic presidential field in 2008 due to his views on abortion.
""It's going to be very difficult,"" Biden said. ""I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy, and I think that it should be rare and safe, and I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions. There ought to be able to have a common ground and consensus as to do that."" Biden noted that the problem with the debate on abortion is that candidates are forced into extremes on both sides, saying: ""Unfortunately, we're put in the position, you're either, 'eliminate abortions under all circumstance' or quote, 'abortion on demand.'""
When speaking about his record on abortion, Biden said: ""I do not vote for funding for abortion. I voted against partial-birth abortion — to limit it — and I vote for no restrictions on a woman's right to be able to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade . And, so I am — I made everybody angry. I made the right-to-life people angry because I won't support a constitutional amendment or limitations on a woman's right to exercise her constitutional right as defined by Roe v. Wade . And I've made the groups — the women's groups and others — very angry because I won't support public funding and I won't support partial-birth abortion.""
The newly uncovered remarks come after Biden flipped on his position on the Hyde Amendment last week after receiving intense pressure from the other Democratic candidates, most of whom are far-left in political orientation.
Biden ""announced his new opposition to blocking taxpayer money from funding abortion during an event in Atlanta [last] Thursday,"" The Daily Wire reported . ""The announcement came just one day after his campaign reaffirmed his decades-long support for the Hyde Amendment, which, as CNN put it, positioned him 'to the right of all other leading 2020 Democratic contenders, as well as Hillary Clinton and the party's platform in 2016.'""
In May, The Daily Wire reported :
A recent analysis from Politico specifically stated that no 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have come out against ""late-term"" abortions and that most of the candidates support no restrictions — which means they support allowing abortions all the way up until the moment of birth — even though they may try to avoid the issue by being too vague.
Recent polling has found that 55% of Americans support pro-life ""heartbeat"" bills — legislation that bans abortion once a heartbeat is detectable — and that only 13% support third-trimester, late-term abortions.
CDC statistics show that out of the 638,169 abortions that were performed in 2015, 1.3% of those abortions were performed at ≥21 weeks’ gestation — equivalent to 8,296 babies.

Donald Trump Jr. Makes An Offer. Aaron P. Bernstein/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 13, 2019 views
On Thursday, after hearing that a new poll showed Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), who has publicly called for President Trump’s impeachment, losing badly to primary opponent Michigan state representative Jim Lower (R-Greenville), Donald Trump Jr. indicated that he might travel to Michigan to help Lower in his campaign, tweeting, “See you soon Justin. I hear Michigan is beautiful during primary season.” — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 13, 2019
The new poll from Michigan Information & Research Service showed Lower garnering 49% of the votes of respondents while Amash polled only at 33%. Amash has served four terms as the representative for Michigan’s 3rd congressional district.
After Amash publicly called for the president’s impeachment, Lower announced he would challenge Amash for his seat, stating , ""Congressman Justin Amash tweets yesterday calling for President Trump’s impeachment show how out of touch he is with the truth and how out of touch he is with people he represents, He must be replaced and I am going to do it.” The Daily News reported that Lower said of Amash, “I helped with his campaign. Hell, I voted for Amash in ’10, ’12 and ’14. At the time, I believed in what he was doing, but now I don’t. I’ve just been very disenchanted … I was like, I can’t let this go by without commenting on it. It’s not every day your Congressman says your president should be impeached.”
In July 2018, Amash was the only Republican to vote against a resolution supporting the officers and personnel of ICE. He tweeted, “The House voted today on an inane resolution regarding ICE. The resolution makes several dubious claims and denounces calls to abolish ICE. I wouldn’t abolish ICE without an alternative, but there’s no reason to treat a federal agency as though it’s beyond reproach and reform.” The House voted today on an inane resolution regarding ICE.

I wouldn’t abolish ICE without an alternative, but there’s no reason to treat a federal agency as though it’s beyond reproach and reform. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2018
In February 2019 Amash joined House Democrats, co-sponsoring a resolution blocking President Trump’s emergency declaration to obtain funds for a wall at the southern border. He tweeted, ""A national emergency declaration for a non-emergency is void. A prerequisite for declaring an emergency is that the situation requires immediate action and Congress does not have an opportunity to act. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is attempting to circumvent our constitutional system.” A national emergency declaration for a non-emergency is void. A prerequisite for declaring an emergency is that the situation requires immediate action and Congress does not have an opportunity to act. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is attempting to circumvent our constitutional system. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) February 15, 2019
In 2014, during the war Israel fought with Hamas in Gaza, Amash voted against additional funding for Israel’s Iron Dome system, which was trying to intercept rockets launched against it by Hamas. In January 2019, when New Jersey Republican Chris Smith put forth a bill titled the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act (HR 221) that urged expediting the appointment of a new Anti-Semitism Special Envoy at the State Department, Amash was the only representative from either party to vote against it.
When he announced his campaign against Amash, Lower noted Amash’s votes against cutting funds to Planned Parenthood, the Iron Dome funding, funding the Department of Defense, the resolution supporting the Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency and Amash’s vote permitting illegal immigrants to vote in local elections, commenting, “His voting record shows how out of touch he is with his constituents. Had I been the congressman from the 3rd District, I would have voted the exact opposite of Amash on each and every one of these votes.”"
WALSH: Feminists Say It's Sexist To Criticize Female Athletes For Excessive Celebration. That's Insanely Stupid.,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,06-13-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48376/walsh-feminists-say-its-sexist-criticize-female-matt-walsh,"June 13, 2019 views
The U.S. women's soccer team beat 34th ranked Thailand by a score of 13 to zero on Tuesday. It was the most lopsided victory in the history of the World Cup. Kirsten Gillibrand and some other feminists have suggested that their rout of a low-ranked opponent should earn them the right to be paid as much as male soccer stars. That's nonsense, of course.
Male soccer players, just like male basketball players, get paid more than their female counterparts because there is a lot more fan interest in the men's version, and thus also more revenue. Why is there more interest and more revenue? Because male athletes are simply better — faster, stronger, more athletic. I don't bring this up in a mocking way, but just to make the point: The women's team lost to a group of adolescent high school boys a couple of years ago. Those boys, who can already beat female professionals, will be paid more than female professionals once they become professionals. That makes sense to me.
But the pay disparity isn't the only phony sexism controversy brewing around the women's team. It seems that some of the ladies on the team felt the need to theatrically celebrate each goal they scored against a vastly inferior opponent, even when the game had become mathematically out of reach for Thailand. These unsportsmanlike antics prompted criticism from some quarters. And that criticism prompted a much louder, more shrill round of criticism of the criticism. Feminists insisted that it is sexist to accuse women of unsportsmanlike conduct. Incredibly, entire articles have been written around the patently insane premise that only women are subjected to criticism of this sort.
An article on the website PopSugar puts it this way:
...similar criticisms have yet to be lodged against men's athletic teams for ruthless, high-margin victories and repeated celebrations. The 1992 US men's basketball team defeated opponents by an average of 44 points during the Olympic Games and is still affectionately known as the Dream Team. The annual NFL Honors ceremony includes a category for Celebration of the Year.
The critical reaction to the USWNT's victory may have come in response to one game, but it speaks to a much broader issue of everyday sexism. Women are taught that they must diminish, downplay, and not take credit for or ownership of their achievements. They're taught that the measure of their character is modesty and that expression and pride are unladylike. And when they have the audacity to break out of this mold, as the women's soccer team did this week, they're promptly scolded. They're told to apologize for their greatness — something we've simply never seen asked of men.
Yahoo! features a barely coherent temper tantrum disguised as an op-ed:
For those who are hand-wringing about Alex Morgan‘s five goals, and her audacity at celebrating each one like it was her first: F**k you! People who accuse the team of running up the score: F**k you! And those who lambast the women for daring to continue blasting balls into the net when their victory was more apparent than Trump’s ethical fouls: F**k you some more. ...
Imagine, for a moment, telling Tiger Woods to just take a beat, and maybe hug second place Masters finisher Xander Schauffele, because losing hurts. Or wait. How’s about that little upstart Tom Brady, who, after helping the New England Patriots win yet another Super Bowl 13-3, maybe instead of basking in his achievement, he should have had a cup of organic decaf chamomile tea with Rams QB Jared Goff. ...
It would never happen. Because dudes are conditioned to win.
Abby Wambach claimed that the criticism is ""patriarchal"" and that these same critics ""would never say this about a men's team.""
This is all just completely wrong and ridiculous on every conceivable level. Male athletes are criticized all the time for excessive celebration and unsportsmanlike conduct. Men who gloat and taunt and rub their victories in the faces of defeated opponents are roundly condemned. Male athletes have been penalized, fined, and tossed out of games for unsportsmanlike behavior. One of the most common debates among NFL fans is whether touchdown celebrations — which were completely banned for many years — are excessive and boorish. Lots of people answer affirmatively to that question, and nobody is afraid to say so publicly.
Would Tom Brady be criticized for this kind of thing? Yes. That's one of the main things Tom Brady is criticized for. Would Tiger Wood be criticized? Yes, and he has been. Would Michael Jordan or LeBron James or any other male star? Yes, and they all have been.
One of the most common cliches in sports — male sports — is to ""act like you've been there before."" In other words, don't run around the field beating your chest every time you score a point or catch a touchdown pass. Act like it's routine for you — business as usual. The ""act like you've been there before"" mantra is an admonition of athletes who, on the contrary, act like every pass they catch or basket they make is a game winner. Nobody hesitates to scold male athletes for these kinds of antics. We do it all the time. With one simple Google search, you could find literally thousands of articles on the subject.
Once again, the truth is revealed: Feminists don't want to be treated equally to men. These female athletes are being treated exactly like men in this case and that fact has sent feminists into a fit of blind, f-bomb-spewing rage. No, equality is the last thing they want. What they want is special treatment. They want us to tolerate boorish and stupid behavior from female athletes even if we wouldn't, and don't, tolerate it from men."
Sweden Is Experiencing A Sharp Rise In Explosions Thanks To Criminal Gang Activity,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-13-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48378/sweden-experiencing-sharp-rise-explosions-thanks-ashe-schow,"Sweden Is Experiencing A Sharp Rise In Explosions Thanks To Criminal Gang Activity Nihayet Marof / EyeEm June 13, 2019 views
Americans tend to look at the Nordic countries as peaceful, pleasant countries, but Sweden is currently facing a sharp rise in explosions.
Paulina Neuding wrote about the issue at Quillette, pointing out that the increase in explosions is something not typically seen “in the world for a state not at war.”
Sweden has experienced a sharp rise in explosions in recent years, predominantly related to conflicts between warring criminal gangs. The use of explosives in the Nordic country is now at a level that is unique in the world for a state not at war , according to police. In response, the government issued a first-ever ” amnesty for explosives ” in the fall of 2018, allowing people in possession of such weapons to hand them over to police with immunity. But this didn’t stem the tide: some 50 explosions were reported in the first three months of 2019 alone—an average of more than one every other day and an increase over the same period in 2018, a year that saw a record number of more than three blasts per week .
The most recent attack, according to Neuding, occurred last Friday, around 9 a.m. in Gothenburg. Twenty-five people received minor injuries in the explosion, which heavily damaged 250 apartments in two buildings.
“A nearby kindergarten was evacuated. Hospitals jumped into disaster mode. Photos from the scene show rows of demolished balconies and shattered windows. It was ‘absolutely incredible’ that no one was severely injured, a police spokesperson said,” Neuding wrote.
Neuding also said there had been three reported attacks since Tuesday, but no arrests.
Shootings in the country are also on the rise, with 45 deadly shootings in 2018, compared to just three in Norway.
Much of the issue has been the result of immigration into a previously homogenous country. The Swedish government — famous for being ""feminist"" — refuses to acknowledge the situation, instead insisting the problems are caused by socio-economic issues even though the country, according to Neuding, “is one of Europe’s most generous welfare states.”
A chart from Swedish Public Service TV showed the increase in detonated hand grenades since 2011. In that year, just 2 hand grenades were detonated in the entire country, one in Malmo and the other in Gothenburg. The record was set in 2016, with 39 total detonations. There were 21 and 18 detonations in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In total, since 2011, there have been 116 detonated hand grenades in Sweden — 27 in Malmo, 13 in Gothenburg, and 46 in Stockholm."
BIG TECH CRACKDOWN: YouTube DELETES Project Veritas Video On Pinterest Censorship,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48387/big-tech-crackdown-youtube-deletes-project-veritas-james-barrett,"June 13, 2019 views
In a chilling move that suggests Big Tech is coordinating to censor conservative voices, YouTube deleted a video produced by Project Veritas exposing alleged censorship of conservative and Christian content by Pinterest. Along with YouTube's removal of the video, Pinterest put the whistleblower who provided the documents featured in the report on administrative leave and permanently banned pro-life group Live Action, which was listed on its ""porn domain block list,"" as shown in the video. Twitter also appears to have joined with the other platforms in targeting Project Veritas, hitting founder James O'Keefe for supposedly violating someone's personal privacy through his journalistic investigation and blocking content involving Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro.
As The Daily Wire reported, Project Veritas released an exposé video on Pinterest featuring testimony from an employee of the company and internal documents he presented to O'Keefe indicating that the popular social media platform was quietly censoring some conservative content and voices. Among those that appear to have been targeted by the platform is Shapiro, who was censored in a ""zero tolerance moment,"" Live Action, links to which were blocked on the platform, and a video series exposing Planned Parenthood, which was included in a censor list as a ""harmful"" ""conspiracy.""
Since the release of the report, Pinterest has placed the whistleblower, Eric Cochran, on administrative leave and permanently suspended Live Action's account.
But it's not only Pinterest who is cracking down on those involved in the exposé; on Wednesday, YouTube deleted Project Veritas' video report, citing ""privacy"" violations and informing the organization that it could not show the name of the employee at Pinterest who placed Live Action on the block list or the documentation of that action.

In a statement to The Daily Wire, Project Veritas said that while YouTube outlines the content supposedly in violation in the video, the platform ""does not give us any recourse by which to make the requested 'blur' since they've taken down the video."" Doing so would be ""anathema to presenting information the public has a right to know,"" the organization argues.
""The established media and technology are so afraid of investigative journalism they need to censor it,"" O'Keefe tweeted Wednesday. ""YouTube calls REPORTING on someone by showing their face and name, and how they added a pro-life group to a porn blacklist, a 'privacy complaint.' Would they do this to NYT?"" The established media and technology are so afraid of investigative journalism they need to censor it.

Would they do this to NYT? — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) June 12, 2019
As reported by Town Hall , Twitter has also hit O'Keefe for the Pinterest exposé, specifically evidence that Shapiro was targeted by the platform, which was censored for exposing ""other people’s private information,"" according to a Twitter insider.
""Twitter has decided that investigative journalism is in violation of their terms of service - @Project_Veritas has been temporarily suspended from posting for tweeting internal communications from @Pinterest which show them calling @benshapiro a 'white supremacist,'"" O'Keefe tweeted Thursday. ""What does this mean for journalists around the world? For their sources in government, tech, education, etc? Is Twitter your newspaper's editor?"" What does this mean for journalists around the world? For their sources in government, tech, education, etc? Is Twitter your newspaper's editor? — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) June 12, 2019
In an interview with The Daily Wire Thursday, O'Keefe called the situation a ""watershed moment"" for both free speech and Big Tech. ""I think that this is a watershed moment in the history of the First Amendment and Big Tech,"" he said. ""What we have seen here is one brave individual come forward, risking everything, in order to combat the collusion that we're witnessing among these powerful companies. What Eric wants is for twelve more people in the industry who are likewise concerned about free speech and transparency to come forward. If they do, we will see real change.""
Pinterest has responded to some of the allegations presented in the YouTube-blocked video: ""Religious content is allowed on Pinterest, and many people use our service to search for and save Pins inspired by their beliefs,"" the company said in a statement to Project Veritas . ""To protect our users from being targeted based on personal characteristics such as their religion, we have policies in place so that ads and recommendations don’t appear alongside certain terms."""

GOOD NEWS: New Vaccine Might Prevent Development Of Alzheimer's,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48396/good-news-new-vaccine-might-prevent-development-hank-berrien,"June 13, 2019 views
According to the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Department, researchers at the university have created a vaccine that could prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease.
The department’s newsroom website stated that the vaccine uses virus-like particles (VLPs) to eliminate the tangling of the tau protein, which when accumulated in the brain can interrupt neurons in the brain from communicating. Alzheimer’s, which is expected to strike triple the number of people by 2050, cripples the brain as human beings age, as beta-amyloid proteins in the brain get stuck together and tau proteins start to tangle, both of which inhibit neural connections.
Nicole Maphis, a PhD candidate who was working in the lab of Kiran Bhaskar, PhD, an associate professor in UNM’s Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, stated, “We’re excited by these findings, because they seem to suggest that we can use the body’s own immune system to make antibodies against these tangles, and that these antibodies actually bind and clear these tau tangles.”
Maphis tested the vaccine in mice and they showed a marked improvement in their capacity to deal with mazes. The UNM Health Department site stated, “MRI scans showed that the vaccinated animals had less brain shrinkage, suggesting that the vaccine prevented neurons from dying. Maphis also found significantly fewer tangles in both the cortex and the hippocampus – areas in the brain that are important for learning and memory, and which are destroyed in Alzheimer’s.”
UNM scientists David Peabody and Bryce Chackerian also aided in the process; they were instrumental in starting to use VLPs to create vaccines targeting dengue virus, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus and amyloid beta protein.
In November 2018, a study published in Alzheimer's Research & Therapy touted a new Alzheimer's vaccine developed by scientists at the University of Texas Southwestern that could conceivably cut the number of dementia cases in half. The research team tested four groups of mice; the vaccinated mice experienced as much as 40% of their beta-amyloid plaques reduced and as much as 50% of their tau tangles diminished. No adverse immune response was observed.
The study stated:
We report, for the first time in an AD mouse model, that active DNA Aβ 42 immunization into the skin targets two pathologies: amyloid-containing plaques and tau. DNA vaccination, in which not the antigen (peptide or protein) but the DNA encoding this peptide is administered, is an alternative route of vaccination. Genes encoded by the DNA are expressed within the skin, and the peptides are taken up by dendritic cells traveling to the regional lymph nodes and presenting the antigen to B and T cells. Immune responses to DNA or peptide immunization differ qualitatively.
We have shown previously that full-length DNA Aβ 42 trimer immunization is noninflammatory and induces a regulatory immune response. DNA Aβ 42 trimer immunization has been shown to be effective in removing amyloid from the brain in immunized double-transgenic mice. In the present study, we used a triple-transgenic AD mouse model that exhibits Aβ and tau pathologies characteristic of human AD. We found that immunotherapy with DNA Aβ 42 trimer leads to reduction of Aβ 40 /Aβ 42 peptides and amyloid plaques, and we show for the first time that DNA Aβ 42 trimer immunization leads also to significant reduction of tau from the mouse brain.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders is reportedly considering running for governor in her home state of Arkansas after she departs from her position in the Trump administration at the end of the month.
""In private conversations in recent weeks, Sanders has floated running for governor in her home state of Arkansas, according to two people familiar with the talks,"" CNN reported . ""Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson was re-elected just last year, so unless he steps down early — or is appointed to something -- the governor's office in Little Rock isn't open until January 2023. She has told colleagues and friends that she thinks running for office would be a good next move for her, instead of taking a television job upon her departure.""
At a White House press conference, Trump took a moment to recognize Sanders and added that he wants her to run for governor in Arkansas, saying: ""If we can get her to run for the Governor of Arkansas I think she'll do very well and I'm trying to get her to do that.""

Pompeo: Iran Is Responsible For Attacks On Oil Tankers,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48393/pompeo-iran-responsible-attacks-oil-tankers-hank-berrien,"June 13, 2019 views
On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid the blame for the attacks on two oil tankers near the Persian Gulf squarely on the government of Iran.
Speaking to reporters at the State Department, Pompeo stated:
It is the assessment of the United States government that the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the attacks that occurred in the Gulf of Oman today. This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to executive the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.
At a news conference later, Pompeo added, “Taken as a whole, these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security.”
Pompeo stated, ""On April 22nd, Iran promised the world it would interrupt the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz. It is now working to execute on that promise."" He revealed that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jonathan Cohen would bring up the issue at the Security Council on Thursday.
CBS News noted, “Benchmark Brent crude spiked at one point by as much 4% in trading after the reported attack to over $62 a barrel, highlighting how crucial the Strait of Hormuz is to global energy supplies. A third of all oil traded by sea passes through the strait, which is the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf.”
As The Daily Wire reported earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported:
The Front Altair, carrying petrochemical feedstock, was on fire in waters between Gulf Arab states and Iran after an explosion that a source blamed on a magnetic mine. The Norwegian owner said its crew were safe. A second Japanese-owned tanker was abandoned after being hit by a suspected torpedo, the firm that chartered the ship said. The crew were also picked up.
The Front Altair is Norwegian-owned; the Kokuka Courageous is the Japanese-owned tanker that was attacked. The Daily Mail reported, “Warning that the Gulf's waters are 'becoming unsafe', tanker industry chief Paolo d'Amico said that 'the oil supply to the entire Western world could be at risk' — as 30 per cent of the world's crude oil passes through the area.”
The Daily Mail noted, “The USS Bainbridge, which had been deployed to the area to offer assistance, reported that crew members saw an unexploded limpet mine on the side of one of the attacked ships. Magnetic limpet mines are suspected of being used in the May 12 attacks on four tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.”
In May, after the four tankers were hit near the Strait of Hormuz, Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton said Iran was responsible.
The New York Times reported on Thursday:
A United States Navy P-8 surveillance plane flying over the stricken tankers on Thursday spotted an unexploded mine attached to the hull of the Kokuka Courageous, one of the damaged ships, a Defense Department official said. The so-called limpet mine resembled the kind of explosive that investigators believe was used against the four ships in the attacks last month, the official said. "

President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign fired back at Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday after Biden called out the president for remarks he made during an ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos.
During the interview, Stephanopoulos, who is a former Clinton administration official, asked Trump what he would do if he was presented with information from a foreign government on a political opponent.
Trump answered the question by saying that he would be willing to listen to what the information was because ""there’s nothing wrong with listening,"" and later said, ""If I thought there was something wrong, I’d go maybe to the FBI.""
Biden responded in a tweet, writing: ""President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy."" President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security.

The Trump campaign responded to Biden's swipe in a tweet of their own that featured a CNN video from this February when Biden visited Munich, Germany.
In the video, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian asked Biden if he was going to run for president in the upcoming 2020 election.
Biden responded by whispering to Sarkissian, who, in turn, whispered something back to Biden.
Moments later, Biden gave Sarkissian his business card so that Sarkissian could contact him.
""What did he give him?"" the Trump campaign tweeted. ""What did he say? Did Joe Biden report this to the FBI?""
