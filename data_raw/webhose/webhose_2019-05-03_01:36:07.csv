-
""Despite the heavy precipitation, state and local authorities continue to plan for the next drought."" No they do not. They are planning to manage a drought, not to prepare for one. California goes through a 12 year cycle on rain. Every 12 years on average there is a 2-year drought. The timing and duration vary but the averages hold. And despite the drought years and the heavy rains that follow, California still maintains its rainfall average. The problem we have is water storage. The State population has increased drastically, but little to no additional water storage has been created, even though the voters have enacted several bond issues over the decades to do just that. California has a water problem that is 100% political, not meteorological."
