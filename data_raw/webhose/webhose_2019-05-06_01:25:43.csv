Georgia’s passage of an anti-abortion bill has ignited calls for a film industry boycott of the state – a measure that would could be costly. But never fear, Fox &; Friends is giving Georgia a helping hand.
On Wednesday’s Fox & Friends , cohost Steve Doocy opened up the “pro-life” propaganda piece by reporting that Georgia's governor is prepared to sign Georgia’s anti-abortion “heartbeat” bill – a law which would prohibit abortion when a fetal “heartbeat” is detected. He noted that some, in Hollywood, are proposing a boycott of film and TV production in Georgia and introduced the freshman lawmaker who was a sponsor of the bill.
Doocy asked GOP State Rep. Ginny Ehrhart (who is so virulently anti-LGBT she once compared transgender people to moose ) to describe the bill. She claimed that it would “provide protections for unborn children at the point when a human heartbeat is discovered” and pontificated that Georgia recognizes those “unborn babies to be distinct, individual, living human beings worthy of protection.” She happily proclaimed that the bill “recognizes the personhood of that child” and that, in Georgia, “we place great value on human life.” She continued to preach about how Georgia wants to protect “all those unborn children.”
Doocy informed us that this new law shortens the time for a legal abortion, from 20 to 6 weeks, and that’s why celebrities are threatening to boycott Georgia. He didn’t mention that Roe’s viability standard is way more than six weeks or that many women don’t even know they’re pregnant at six weeks.
Ehrhart sounded like she was giving a Chamber of Commerce speech as she bragged about Georgia’s fabulous business climate and how they just love the film industry. She said that she didn’t think the vocal opposition represents the entirety of the film industry. However, she mentioned that she had seen some ""activism” around the capitol.
In attempting to whitewash the drastic aspects of the legislation, Doocy urged Ehrhart to talk about its exceptions. Ehrhart made the ludicrous claim that the bill is a “compromise” because it doesn’t overturn Roe. ( It does , however, effectively ban most abortions in Georgia). She continued the crazy talk with a statement that the bill “balances the rights and interests of the mother with the rights of that unborn child.” ↓ Story continues below ↓
Ehrhart spoke about the exceptions for rape or incest or health of the mother, but didn’t mention that “medical professionals argue that developing tissue of a fetus at six weeks may be mistaken as a heartbeat and that the fetus would not be able to survive outside of the mother’s womb.” She also didn’t tell viewers that the rape exception is only valid with a police report .
Doocy continued to encourage Ehrhart to speak about the awesomeness of this draconian bill by saying that, according to the bill, the six-week benchmark is the beginning of personhood.
Ehrhart argued, “For centuries, the heartbeat has been a discernible and tangible indication of life"" which is, she said, “personhood.” She urged folks to come to Georgia because “it’s a wonderful place to work.” She hoped that Hollywood would respect Georgia’s “political interests and moral direction.”
Despite Ehrhart’s cheerleading, neither Doocy nor Ehrhart mentioned that not all Georgians are happy with this law. A representative from the state Ob-Gyn Society is concerned that the law “would deter obstetricians from practicing in a state that has a shortage of OB-GYNs.” Nobody said anything about how none of the other (red) state “heartbeat bills” are being enforced because of litigation nor that the Georgia ACLU is set to challenge this law as soon as Governor Brian Kemp signs it.
Sure, Fox & Friends cares about fetuses - facts, not so much.
Watch Doocy and Ehrhart try to sell the repressive bill above, from the April 3, 2019 Fox & Friends.

Tragic Mass Slaughter of Nigerian Christians by Muslims,westernfreepress.com,Janet Levy,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://westernfreepress.com/tragic-mass-slaughter-of-nigerian-christians-by-muslims/,"Tragic Mass Slaughter of Nigerian Christians by Muslims By Janet Levy 0 0 Heart-breaking plea from Nigerian pastor: “America, please stand for us. We are dying.” “I’m begging you….” Watch the 2 minute video (link below) and read the short article.
When Muslims slaughter, as they have done 34,795* times worldwide since 9/11, their religion must NOT be mentioned and, of course, the murders have “nothing to do with Islam,” although jihadists typically quote the Koran in the process of slaughtering.
If a non-Muslim kills (and, at some point, all non-Muslims are going to HAVE TO defend themselves and their communities against the carnage), the deed is bruited worldwide as indicative of our “racist” fear of Islam (we would be stupid NOT to fear Islam and Islamists) and something is always conveniently added about Trump’s “fueling the hatred.”
*From www.thereligionofpeace.com – a website that has chronicled all of the DEADLY Islamists attacks worldwide since 9/11. Attacks that were thwarted or those attacks in which people were injured, often seriously, are NOT included in the total. Of course, there WERE many jihadist attacks across the globe BEFORE 9/11.

Secrecy behind Saudi nuclear talks infuriates Congress,thehill.com,Rebecca Kheel,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/international/437649-secrecy-behind-saudi-nuclear-talks-infuriates-congress,"Secrecy behind Saudi nuclear talks infuriates Congress By Rebecca Kheel - 04/07/19 10:30 AM EDT
Congressional anger is growing over President Trump
Lawmakers first became wary of the plans when the Saudis refused to accept limits preventing them from developing a nuclear weapon. ADVERTISEMENT
But that skepticism quickly turned to fury when it was revealed that the Trump administration gave approval for companies to share certain nuclear energy technology with the kingdom without a broader nuclear deal in place.
Lawmakers are now demanding answers. They particularly want to know whether any of the approvals came after the October murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
“First we want the information from [the Department of Energy], and we’re demanding it. We should get it,” said Sen. Bob Menendez Robert (Bob) Menendez The Hill's 12:30 Report: Manafort sentenced to total of 7.5 years in prison Acting Defense chief calls Graham an 'ally' after tense exchange William Barr is right man for the times MORE (D-N.J.), the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “And I think it’s critical to know exactly how this happened, when it happened and particularly were you doing this after Khashoggi?”
Congress has been re-evaluating the U.S.-Saudi relationship since Khashoggi’s death, with lawmakers blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing.
Propelled in part by anger over Khashoggi’s death, Congress last week sent Trump a resolution that would end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s civil war.
Trump is expected to veto the resolution, making it the second veto of his presidency, and lawmakers are plotting their next steps to confront him for supporting the Saudis. ADVERTISEMENT
One potential avenue for expressing that anger is the administration’s nuclear talks with Riyadh.
House Democrats began investigating the administration’s nuclear talks with Saudi Arabia after the Oversight and Reform Committee announced in February it was launching a probe to “determine whether the actions being pursued by the Trump administration are in the national security interests of the United States or, rather, serve those who stand to gain financially as a result of this potential change in U.S. foreign policy.”
The investigation was launched in conjunction with the release of an interim report that included detailed allegations by unnamed whistleblowers that senior White House officials ignored warnings from legal and ethics advisers to stop pursuing the plan to sell nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia.
The administration has been negotiating what’s known as a 123 agreement with Saudi Arabia that would allow U.S. companies to sell nuclear reactors to the kingdom.
Riyadh has resisted an agreement that includes prohibitions on enriching uranium and reprocessing spent fuel to produce plutonium — essential steps in producing nuclear weapons.
Crown Prince Mohammed has also vowed his country would obtain a nuclear weapon if rival Iran does.
Satellite images first reported by Bloomberg News this past week show Saudi Arabia is nearing completion of its first nuclear facility.
The administration argues a nuclear energy deal with Saudi Arabia is necessary because the kingdom will otherwise take its business to other countries, leaving U.S. companies in the lurch while doing nothing to prevent nuclear proliferation.
Michael (Mike) Richard Pompeo The Taiwan-U.S. enduring partnership forging ahead Dem rep presses Trump officials on civilian casualties in Yemen The Hill's Morning Report - The fallout after Trump ousts top DHS officials MORE on Friday was asked about the state of negotiations with Saudi Arabia but responded by criticizing the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran in 2015.
“I can’t tell you where the negotiations sit because they’re still ongoing. But make no mistake about it: We only wish that the previous administration had taken that threat seriously with respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said in an interview with Norah O'Donnell on “CBS This Morning.”
Pressed on whether that makes it acceptable for Saudi Arabia to be a nuclear power, Pompeo said, “We will not permit that to happen.”
Congress has statutory review powers over 123 agreements and can block them once they are submitted to Capitol Hill.
But even as the agreement remains in the negotiation stage, Energy Secretary Rick Perry James (Rick) Richard Perry Who will Trump pick to succeed Nielsen at DHS? Nielsen's departure raises questions about cyber plans Trump moves to install loyalists MORE approved seven authorizations that let U.S. companies share certain nuclear energy technology with Saudi Arabia. Such authorizations typically allow for sharing unclassified nuclear technology and services such as nuclear fuel fabrication, reactor designs and training for operating a nuclear facility, according to the Congressional Research Service.
The Daily Beast first reported the approvals, which Perry later confirmed to the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Perry told senators the Saudi-related approvals were among 37 authorizations granted since 2017, including two for Jordan, and that it’s “something that goes on every day.”
He said details of the approvals were not shared publicly because the companies involved determined that doing so would divulge proprietary business information.
In a statement following Perry's testimony, the Department of Energy stressed that 810 authorizations and 123 agreements are ""are two distinct and different processes based on two separate sections of the Atomic Energy Act.""
But lawmakers were outraged when they found out they were not told about the approvals, saying the secrecy violates the Atomic Energy Act, which requires that Congress be kept “fully and currently informed” of 123 agreement negotiations.

Where We Went Wrong,theglitteringeye.com,Dave Schuler,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://theglitteringeye.com/where-we-went-wrong/,"Dave Schuler April 7, 2019
I encourage you to read this piece at Atlantic from retired U. S. diplomat William Burns on where we went wrong in managing our relationship with Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Here’s a telling snippet:
In December 1994, on the eve of a visit by Vice President Al Gore to Moscow, I had tried to capture Russia’s domestic predicament in a cable to Washington. “Winter in Russia is not a time for optimists, and in some respects the popular mood here mirrors the descending gloom. Born of a mood of national regret over the loss of superpower status and an equally acute sense that the West is taking advantage of Russia’s weakness,” I wrote, assertive policies abroad had become one of the few themes that united Russians. Yeltsin wished to reaffirm Russia’s great-power status, and its interests in the neighboring post-Soviet republics.
President Bill Clinton tried hard to manage Russia’s post-traumatic stress disorder, but his push for the eastward expansion of NATO reinforced Russian resentments. When I left Moscow after my first tour, in early 1996, I worried about the eventual resurgence of a Russia stewing in its own grievances and insecurities. I just had no idea that this would happen so quickly, or that Vladimir Putin—then an obscure bureaucrat—would emerge as the embodiment of that peculiarly Russian combination of qualities.
That was precisely why I was so outraged that Russia was not invited to participate in the 50th anniversary celebration of D-Day. It would have cost us nothing and not inviting them demeaned the Russians and their contributions to the “Great Patriotic War” (which they believe they won). Over the course of decades we have routinely ignored, diminished, or opposed Russian interests. How in the world would we expect them to react?"
