Boeing's Homicide Will Give Way to Safety Reforms if Flyers Organize,www.opednews.com,Ralph Nader,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Boeing-s-Homicide-Will-Giv-by-Ralph-Nader-Boeing_Homicide_Murder-By-Corporation-190405-809.html,". - Advertisement - This put Boeing's management in a quandary. Their sales pitch to the airlines was that the 737 Max only received an ""amended"" certification from the FAA. That it did not have to be included in more pilot training, simulators, and detailed in the flight manuals. The airlines could save money and would be more likely to buy the Boeing 737 Max.
Boeing engineers were worried. They knew better. But the managers ordered software to address the stall problem without even telling the pilots or most of the airlines. Using only one operating sensor (Airbus A320neo has three sensors), an optional warning light and indicator, Boeing set the stage for misfiring sensors that overcame pilot efforts to control the planes from their nose-down death dive.
These fixes or patches would not have been used were the new 737's aerodynamics the same as the previous 737 models. Step by step, Boeing's criminal negligence, driven by a race to make profits, worsened. Before and after the fatal crashes, Boeing did not reveal, did not warn, did not train, and did not address the basic defective aerodynamic design. It gagged everyone that it could. Boeing still insists that the 737 Max is safe and is building two a day, while pushing to end the grounding. - Advertisement -
Reacting to all these documented derelictions, a flurry of investigations is underway. The Department of Transportation's Inspector General, Calvin L. Scovel III, is investigating the hapless, captive FAA that has delegated to Boeing important FAA statutory and regulatory duties. The Justice Department and FBI have opened a criminal probe, with an active grand jury. The National Transportation Safety Board, long the hair shirt of the FAA, is investigating. As are two Senate and House Committees. Foreign governments are investigating, as surely are the giant insurance companies who are on the hook. This all sounds encouraging, but we've seen such initiatives pull back before.
This time, however, the outrageous corner-cutting and suppression of engineering dissent, within both Boeing and the FAA (there were reported ""heated discussions"") produced a worst case scenario. So, Boeing is working overtime with its legions of Washington lobbyists, its New York P.R. firm, its continued campaign contributions to some 330 Members of Congress. The airlines and pilots' union chiefs (but not some angry pilots) are staying mum, scared into silence due to contracts and jobs, waiting for the Boeing 737 Max planes to fly again.
BUT THE BOEING 737 MAX MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO FLY AGAIN. Pushing new software that will allow Boeing to blame the pilots is a dangerous maneuver. Saying that U.S. pilots, many of whom are ex-Air Force, are more experienced in reacting to a sudden wildly gyrating aircraft (consider the F-16 diving and swooping) than many foreign airline pilots only trained by civil aviation, opens a can of worms from cancellation of 737 Max orders to indignation from foreign airlines and pilots. It also displays an aversion to human-factors engineering with a vast number of avoidable failure modes not properly envisioned by Boeing's software patches.
The overriding problem is the basic unstable design of the 737 Max. An aircraft has to be stall proof not stall prone. An aircraft manufacturer like Boeing, notwithstanding its past safety record, is not entitled to more aircraft disasters that are preventable by following long-established aeronautical engineering practices and standards.
With 5,000 Max orders at stake, the unfolding criminal investigation may move the case from criminal negligence to evidence of knowing and willful behavior amounting to corporate homicide involving Boeing officials. Boeing better cut its losses by going back to the drawing boards. That would mean scrapping the 737 Max 8 designs, with its risk of more software time bombs, safely upgrading the existing 737-800 with amenities and discounts for its airline carrier customers and moving ahead with its early decision to design a new plane to compete with Airbus's model, which does not have the 737 Max's design problem.
Meanwhile, airline passengers should pay attention to Senator Richard Blumenthal's interest in forthcoming legislation to bring the regulatory power back into the FAA. Senator Blumenthal also intends to reintroduce his legislation to criminalize business concealment of imminent risks that their products and services pose to innocent consumers and workers (the ""Hide No Harm Act""). - Advertisement -
What of the near future? Airline passengers should organize a consumer boycott of the Boeing 737 Max 8 to avoid having to fly on these planes in the coming decade. Once Boeing realizes that this brand has a deep marketing stigma, it may move more quickly to the drawing boards, so as to not alienate airline carriers.
Much more information will come out in the coming months. Much more. The NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), which receives incident reports from pilots, air traffic controllers, dispatchers, cabin crew, maintenance technicians, and others, is buzzing, as is the FlyersRights.org website. Other countries, such as France, have tougher criminal statutes for such corporate crime than the U.S. does. The increasing emergence of whistle-blowers from Boeing, the FAA and, other institutions is inevitable.
Not to mention, the information that will come out of the civil litigation against this killer mass tort disaster. And of course the relentless reporting of newspapers such as the Seattle Times, the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, the Washington Post, and AP, among others will continue to shed light on Boeings misdeeds and the FAA's deficiencies.
Boeing executives should reject the advice from the reassuring, monetized minds of Wall Street stock analysts saying you can easily absorb the $2 billion cost and move on. Boeing, let your engineers and scientists be free to exert their ""professional options for revisions"" to save your company from the ruinous road you are presently upon.
Respect those who perished at your hand and their grieving families."
The media smoothed the path to British soldiers using Corbyn as target practice,www.opednews.com,Jonathan Cook,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/The-media-smoothed-the-pat-by-Jonathan-Cook-Assault_British-Politics_Jeremy-Corbyn_Media-Bias-190405-227.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
It is time to stop believing these infantile narratives the British political and media establishments have crafted for us. Like the one in which they tell us they care deeply about the state of political life, and that they lie awake at night worrying about the threat posed by populism to our democratic institutions.
How do they persuade us of the depth of their concern? They express their horror at at the murder of an MP -- Jo Cox -- and their outrage at the abuse of another -- Anna Soubry -- both victims of the frenzied passions unleashed by Brexit.
But the political and media elites don't really care whether politicians are assaulted, vilified or threatened -- at least, not if it is the kind of politician who threatens their power. They aren't seriously worried about attacks on democracy, or about political violence, or about the rottenness at the core of state institutions. Their outrage is selective. It is rooted not in principle, but in self-interest.
Is that too cynical? Ponder this. - Advertisement -
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hasn't faced just shouted insults from afar, like Soubry. He was recently physically assaulted, hit on the head by a man holding an egg in his fist. But unlike Soubry, our media expressed no real concern. In fact, they could barely hide their sniggers at his "" egging "", an attack they presented as little more than a prank. They even hinted that Corbyn deserved it.
""Kill vampire Jezza""
The media have been only happy too to vilify Corbyn as a Kremlin stooge and a former Soviet spy. Senior Tory Iain Duncan Smith this week called Corbyn ""a Marxist whose sole purpose in life is to do real damage to the country,"" a remark that, as ever went, entirely unchallenged by the BBC interviewer giving him a platform. Just imagine a Labour MP being allowed to accuse Theresa May of being a fascist whose only goal is to destroy the country. - Advertisement -
But the BBC has never bothered to conceal its intense dislike of Corbyn. Its news shows have even photo-shopped the Labour leader to make him look ""Russian"" or ""more Russian,"" as the BBC and the rest of the media mischievously phrased it. Those who protested were told they were reading too much into it. They needed to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously.
Senior Conservatives, including the former defense secretary Michael Fallon, have regularly portrayed Corbyn as a threat to national security, especially over concerns about the Trident nuclear missile system. Many senior members of Corbyn's own party have echoed such smears -- all amplified, of course, by the media.
Those who suggested that the government and media needed to engage with Corbyn's well-grounded doubts about the safety of nuclear weapons, or the economics and practicalities of the Trident program, were derided like Corbyn as ""pacifists"" and ""traitors.""
And the mood music to these political clashes was the quite literal demonization of Corbyn by the red-top dailies. Most famously, the Daily Mail photo-shopped him as Dracula, above the headline: ""Labour must KILL vampire Jezza.""
Degraded political culture
Then Corbyn became the target of another sustained smear campaign. It was claimed that this lifelong, very public anti-racism activist who over decades had forged strong ties to sections of the British Jewish community, despite being a steadfast critic of Israel was a secret anti-Semite, or at best providing succor to anti-Semites as they overran the Labour party. - Advertisement -
Was there any factual basis or evidence for these claims? No. But the British public was assured by right-wing Jews like the Board of Deputies and by ""left-wing"" Jewish supporters of Israel like Jonathan Freedland, that evidence wasn't necessary, that they had a sixth sense for these things.
Corbyn's supporters were told that they should not question the wildly inflammatory and evidence-free denunciations of Corbyn and the wider Labour membership for a supposed ""institutional antisemitism"" and, with a satisfyingly circular logic, that to do so was itself proof of antisemitism.
The weaponization of antisemitism through political spin by Corbyn's political enemies, including the Blairite faction of the parliamentary Labour party, was and is a dangerous assault on public life, one that has very obviously degraded Britain's political culture."
Be Ready To Act: WikiLeaks Source Says They're Coming For Assange,www.opednews.com,Caitlin Johnstone,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Be-Ready-To-Act-WikiLeaks-by-Caitlin-Johnstone-Assange_Asylum_Expelled_Politics-190405-453.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
The WikiLeaks Twitter account has announced that it has high level information that the organization's founder Julian Assange could have his political asylum the Ecuadorian embassy revoked for him to be arrested by the British government within hours. We need to be ready to shake the earth should this happen. We need all hands on deck for this one.
""BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within 'hours to days' using the #INApapers offshore scandal as a pretext -- and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest,"" the leak publishing outlet tweeted , with a link to a story about the INA Papers leak.
The pretext that is being used is almost irrelevant. Assange has been a target of the US-centralized power establishment ever since WikiLeaks began publishing authentic documents exposing the malfeasance of its leaders a decade ago, and strings are being pulled around the world to funnel him into its jaws. That's all that this is, but it should surprise no one that the pretext is bogus as well. Journalist Elizabeth Vos wrote an article for Consortium News the other day summarizing the false narrative being spun by the Ecuadorian government that the conditions of asylum have been violated by the WikiLeaks account (not Assange) tweeting about a scandal that has rocked Ecuador's president Lenin Moreno. - Advertisement -
WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 4, 2019
To be clear, it is a known fact that the US government is working to arrest and imprison Assange, not for the Russia stuff that has had establishment loyalists so excited over the last couple of years, but for the 2010 leaks exposing US war crimes. The US has an extradition treaty with the UK, and the British government has refused to comment on whether or not it has received an extradition request for the Assange arrest that we absolutely know for a fact is an existing US government agenda. This would be the same US government which tortured Chelsea Manning after refusing her a fair trial . - Advertisement -
If Assange is arrested and prosecuted under the Patriot Act, it will be a devastating blow to press freedoms and constitute a greater leap in the direction of Orwellian dystopia than the Patriot Act did. The US government exercising the ability to imprison journalists for simply publishing facts about it, not just in America but anywhere in the world, will be a poisoned dagger in the heart of the world population's ability to bring any transparency or accountability to that titanic power structure.
""WikiLeaks reports that Julian Assange is on the verge of being expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London,"" tweeted the legendary journalist John Pilger in response to today's news. ""Please fill the street outside the embassy and protect him, and show solidarity with a courageous man, whose struggle ought to touch us all.""
Yes please. WikiLeaks reports that Julian Assange is on the verge of being expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Please fill the street outside the embassy and protect him, and show solidarity with a courageous man, whose struggle ought to touch us all. https://t.co/xzZKroYJL9
John Pilger (@johnpilger) April 4, 2019 We are about to find out if this is the part of the movie where the empire rips off the mask of freedom and democracy and reveals its true tyranny. Assange is a soft target, a controversial figure who has been on the receiving end of wildly successful smear campaigns marketed to every major political faction across the western world. He is the logical place to begin a crackdown on press freedoms and make a public example of what happens to those who shine the light of truth upon Big Brother. - Advertisement - If we allow them to imprison Julian Assange for practicing journalism, that's it. It's over. We might as well all stop caring what happens to the world and sit on our hands while the oligarchs drive us to ecological disaster, nuclear annihilation or Orwellian dystopia. If we, the many, don't have the spine to stand up against the few and say ""No, we get to find out facts about you bastards and use it to inform our worldview, you don't get to criminalize that,"" then we certainly don't have the spine it will take to wrest control of this world away from the hands of sociopathic plutocrats and take our fate into our own hands. The arrest of Julian Assange would be the fork in the road. It would be where we collectively decide as a species whether we want to survive into the future, and if we deserve to."

So why aren't they being charged for a crime, if this is a crime?
""They know it was wrong....""
I""m not so sure they felt that way when they did it. They never covered up their email tracks, and they held the meeting right there in Trump Tower instead of meeting in some clandestine place that could not be associated with Trump. It's a busy place.
""They lied about it.""
It was a half-truth. The meeting WAS about ""Russian Adoption"" because all the Lawyer talked about was the Magnitsky Act, which does concern Russian Adoption. Now that's not why they WENT to the meeting, but that's all they got once they were at the meeting.
Everyone claims to know what the law is, but they don't know the details of the law regarding this. Clearly a crime wasn't committed - why? - maybe because no transaction ever took place maybe because it didn't involve money (as some have suggested).
For instance - it's not a crime to talk to a prostitute. But once you have made a deal for the service, you can be arrested."

Dershowitz said it wasn't. Even Manfort, who attended the meeting, wasn't charged with this on top of his other charges.

No. Everything they ever said came from the ""Clinton Cash"" book, which Conservative pundits were already talking about. Trump had nothing NEW to say about Hillary.
If they went through the trouble of attending the meeting, and got the goods, but didn't use them why bother?
The meeting was such a big disappointment that Jared texted someone to call and interrupt the meeting so he could have an excuse to get out of the room. Don't you think Mueller looked at his phone records to verify this?

If you were to meet with someone to talk about doing a hit on another person, and the ""hitman"" was actually an undercover detective, you wouldn't be charged with a crime if you backed out of it even though you met him somewhere to discuss the crime.
If you discussed services with a hooker but never agreed to it - and she was an undercover cop - you wouldn't be charged with a crime. There has to be an agreement for a transaction.

Wisconsin finished 19th in a ranking of the taxes and fees that states place on gasoline, according to the Washington-based Tax Foundation.
Drivers in the state pay 32.9 cents per gallon in state-imposed taxes and fees as of July 2018, the foundation reports. These levies may include excise taxes, fees related to environmental issues, storage tank levies and general sales taxes.
Only seven states apply sales taxes to gasoline, a practice that effectively layers levies onto one another. The seven states are California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and New York.
The gas taxes studied do not include an 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal excise levy on gasoline.
The foundation deems gas taxes a sensible way for states to fund road repairs, maintenance and highway expansion since those who use the public roads the most pay the most via gas taxes. But some states don’t index the taxes for inflation, meaning that revenues generated through the taxes can lag behind state infrastructure needs over time, according to the analysis.

An Early Run-In With Censors Led Rod Serling to 'The Twilight Zone',azspot.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://azspot.net/post/183991800995/an-early-run-in-with-censors-led-rod-serling-to,"azspot :
In August of 1955, Emmett Till, an African-American boy from Chicago was abducted, beaten, and shot while visiting family in Mississippi. A nation divided by race dug in its feet in the aftermath. While Jet magazine disseminated photographs from the open-casket funeral, showing the full mutilation of the 14-year-old’s corpse, another story played out in the courtroom. That fall, an all-white jury acquitted the two killers, both white, of all charges.
The miscarriage of justice proved a galvanizing point in the Civil Rights Movement. Rod Serling, a 30-year-old rising star in a golden age of dramatic television, watched the events play out in the news. He believed firmly in the burgeoning medium’s power for social justice. “The writer’s role is to be a menacer of the public’s conscience,” Serling later said. “He must have a position, a point of view. He must see the arts as a vehicle of social criticism and he must focus the issues of his time.”
Soon after the trial concluded, Serling, riding off the success of his most well-received teleplay to date, felt compelled write a teleplay around the racism that led to Till’s murder. But the censorship that followed by advertisers and networks, fearful of blowback from white, Southern audiences, forced Serling to rethink his approach. His response, ultimately, was “The Twilight Zone,” the iconic anthology series that spoke truth to the era’s social ills and tackled themes of prejudice, bigotry, nuclear fears, war, among so many others."

While taking audience questions about the frustration that comes with lack of change, Obama expressed concern about a lack of compromise in Washington, and said he specifically worries progressive politicians could be alienating potential allies. “One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States — maybe it’s true here as well — is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Oh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be,’” Obama said. “And then we start sometimes creating what’s called a ‘circular firing squad’ where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.” The former president said he believes this approach “weakens” movements, and that those that would like to see a progressive agenda “have to recognize that the way we’ve structured democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you.” Obama ended his speech by advocating for patience and incremental change: “We have to be careful in balancing big dreams and bold ideas with also recognizing that typically change happens in steps. And if you want to skip steps, you can. Historically what’s ended up happening is sometimes if you skip too many steps you end up having bad outcomes.” What else did Obama talk about? Obama took several audience questions, and used them to speak at length about issues facing Europe and the United States. While the former president did not directly address President Trump’s recent meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg or Trump’s criticisms of the organization (the current president has said “ NATO is as bad as NAFTA ,” for example), Obama explained why he believes NATO is important. “I can’t say exactly what the United States and NATO are doing right now,” Obama said. “I recognize that there are some strains. ... I think it’s important not to separate military alliances — the strength of Europe over the last 20, 30 years has not been because there were a bunch of missiles fired. It was because — thankfully — it was because ideas won.” Speaking about immigration in Sweden, Obama said, “We can’t label everybody who is disturbed by immigration as racist. You know, that’s a self-defeating tactic. You push away potential allies, people who maybe just haven’t thought about it ... but if they’re exposed to new information and they’re meeting people from other countries and they understand the nature of these different traditions and they see that others are eager to work with you, then suddenly they go, ‘Ah, okay.’” Obama also encouraged people to take a more active role in government, arguing citizens with new ideas should reach out to politicians who are open to them. “Sometimes we think of the government as this ‘thing’ that is separate from us,” Obama said. “But if we’re active citizens, then part of our job is not just to get government to respond to you — it’s also to improve the government.” He added, “The point I’m making is, in addition to electing good people, one of the things that you can do, I think, is encourage and work with governments to identify where are bottlenecks, where are inefficiencies that could potentially be solved and then finding allies to help improve processes inside of government.” Obama has called for “new blood” in the past — and some of that new blood is at tension with the establishment over ideological purity In an Obama Foundation event earlier this year, Obama called for “new blood” in the political ranks, but new, progressive House Democrats have at times found themselves at odds with more established party figures over issues from refusing to take corporate PAC money to big ideas like Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal . For the most part, however, Democrats have been following Obama’s lead and been careful to maintain unity in public. As Vox’s Ella Nilsen notes, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to a question about the Green New Deal championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) by saying, “It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive. The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it right?” Ocasio-Cortez didn’t take it as a slight. Instead, the freshman Congresswoman said, “I think it is a green dream. I don’t consider to be that a dismissive term.” Similarly, policy divides between Democratic 2020 candidates on issues like trade , reparations , and even eliminating the filibuster have not led to open hostilities — at least not yet. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) clearly stated “ we should get rid of the filibuster ,” Friday, she did not impugn any of her fellow Democrats, instead arguing, “For generations, the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice. And in recent years, it’s been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything.”"

The Joe Biden Crisis: Has Society Become More Or Less Huggy?,www.vdare.com,Steve Sailer,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vdare.com/posts/the-joe-biden-crisis-has-society-become-more-or-less-huggy,"April 06, 2019, 12:03 PM A+ | a- Hillary should have made this video into a campaign commercial in 2016: the way she keeps tapping Joe Biden on the elbow to try to communicate to him that he can stop hugging her now makes her seem more relatable. From the New York Times : Psychologists have studied personal space and physical contact for decades. Here’s why people get so uncomfortable. By Benedict CareyApril 4, 2019 On Wednesday, the former vice president and potential presidential candidate Joe Biden released a video in which he discussed the importance of personal space. “Social norms have begun to change,” he said. “They’ve shifted, and boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset — and I get it.” Is that true? Has society gotten more standoffish? My impression was that over my lifetime society has instead moved in Biden’s direction by getting huggier. A decade ago, when I was more sociable, it seemed like grown-up ladies at, say, school parent events were trying to hug me all the time. I would stand several feet away and lean over for a brief shoulder-to-shoulder embrace, which wasn’t too bad. But of course I’m not exactly Vice Presidential material. Similarly, the Fast & Furious movies usually begin with the franchise’s Random Family all hugging each other for about five minutes. Has that changed since then? Thinking about it some more, I see we probably need a distinction between huggy and handsy. One explanation for Biden’s tendency could be that he’s a less sloppy version of the often tired and emotional EU supremo Jean-Claude Juncker who is huggy and kissy and does odd things: But by all accounts, Biden is like Trump: somebody who decided at an early age, after observing relatives’ struggles with the bottle, to never drink. So, I dunno … Is there some other drug Biden could be on?"

Why Are People Paying Bribes to Get Their Kids Into USC?,www.vdare.com,Steve Sailer,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vdare.com/posts/why-are-people-paying-bribes-to-get-their-kids-into-usc,"International (student visa holders) 13%Multiple Ethnicities 7%Native American or Pacific Islander <1% Most Represented Public High SchoolsArcadia HS; Arcadia, CA 21Foshay Learning Center; Los Angeles, CA 19Mira Costa HS; Manhattan Beach, CA 18PV Peninsula HS; Rolling Hills Estates, CA 16South Pasadena HS; South Pasadena, CA 15Troy HS; Fullerton, CA 14 Most Represented Independent & Parochial SchoolsLoyola HS; Los Angeles, CA 22Harvard-Westlake; North Hollywood, CA 12Flintridge Prep; La Cañada, CA 12Mater Dei HS; Santa Ana, CA 12Punahou School; Honolulu, HI 12Oaks Christian School, Thousand Oaks, CA 11 One question is why USC is so fashionable nowadays that rich people are paying bribes and hiring ringers to take tests for their kids to get their kids in? Downtown L.A. is bustling these days and they’ve relocated Skid Row from the south side down toward USC to the giant homeless encampment in the northeast side of downtown. But, still, DTLA does not yet go all the way down to USC. I imagine having a film school is excellent advertising. Movie people get interviewed all the time, so USC gets a lot of publicity from, say, George Lucas being associated with it (besides Lucas giving $175 million to the film school). NYU’s reputation hasn’t suffered from its association with Martin Scorsese. But USC also has a famous football team. In the Atlantic , Caitlin Flanagan writes about what it was like to be a college counselor at a certain unnamed private high school that was my high school’s arch-rival in debate. The parents indicted in the college-admissions scandal were responding to a changing America, with rage at being robbed of what they believed was rightfully theirs. APR 4, 2019 by Caitlin Flanagan Thirty years ago, having tapped out of a Ph.D. program, I moved to Los Angeles (long story) and got hired at the top boys’ school in the city, which would soon become co-educational. For the first four years, I taught English. Best job I’ve ever had. For the next three, I was a college counselor. Worst job I’ve ever had. … I did not know—even after four years at the institution—that the school’s impressive matriculation list was not the simple by-product of excellent teaching, but was in fact the end result of parental campaigns undertaken with the same level of whimsy with which the Japanese Navy bombed Pearl Harbor. … I will now add as a very truthful disclaimer that the horrible parents constituted at most 25 percent of the total, that the rest weren’t just unobjectionable, but many—perhaps most—were lovely people who were so wise about parenting that when I had children of my own, I often remembered things they had told me. But that 25 percent was a lesson that a lifetime of reading novels hadn’t yet taught me. … In the recent past—the past in which this generation of parents grew up—a white student from a professional-class or wealthy family who attended either a private high school or a public one in a prosperous school district was all but assured admission at a “good” college. It wasn’t necessarily going to be Harvard or Yale, but it certainly might be Bowdoin or Northwestern. That was the way the system worked. But today, there’s a squeeze on those kids. The very strong but not spectacular white student from a good high school is now trying to gain access to an ever-shrinking pool of available spots at the top places. He’s not the inherently attractive prospect he once was. These parents—many of them avowed Trump haters—are furious that what once belonged to them has been taken away, and they are driven mad with the need to reclaim it for their children. The changed admissions landscape at the elite colleges is the aspect of American life that doesn’t feel right to them; it’s the lost thing, the arcadia that disappeared so slowly they didn’t even realize it was happening until it was gone. They can’t believe it—they truly can’t believe it—when they realize that even the colleges they had assumed would be their child’s back-up, emergency plan probably won’t accept them. P.S., on an obscure golf course history note, Caitlin writes: … I would drive though the exotic air of early-morning Los Angeles to the school, which was on a street with a beautiful name, Coldwater Canyon, in a part of the city originally designated the Central Motion Picture District. It sat on a plot of land that in the 1920s composed part of the Hollywood Hills Country Club, an institution that has a Narnia-like aspect, in that not even the California historian Kevin Starr knew whether it ever really existed, or if it was merely a fiction promoted by real-estate developers trying to entice new homeowners to the Edenic San Fernando Valley. … I can’t seem to get the page break working, so I’ll just put this all in one post, but feel free to skip up over the rest unless you find the subject of the Lost Golf Courses of the San Fernando Valley as interesting as I do: This combination of the possibly imaginary country club and the assumption behind the building of the chapel—get the set right, and you can make the whole production work—seemed to me like something from an Evelyn Waugh novel. I can confirm there was a Hollywood Country Club at the corner of Coldwater Canyon and Ventura Blvd in the 1920s according to this aerial photo: The Hollywood Country Club went bankrupt during the Depression and the school bought the upper right part of the golf course in 1937. (In case you are wondering, the vanished Hollywood Country Club was different from lavish but never-completed Beverly Hills Country Club project just over the crest of the Hollywood Hills. That one was headed by Dean Martin and it went bankrupt at the end of the 1960s because the Teamsters Pension Fund in Jimmy Hoffa’s day wasn’t totally on the up and up.) A slightly paranoid blog post wonders if anybody ever played this putative golf course or whether it was all just a real estate hoax. This picture, which a friend of mine gave me to hang on my wall 15 years ago, looks legit rather than the equivalent of a 1920s Photoshop job. But this golf course sure is obscure, even though the history of lost golf courses in Los Angeles is otherwise pretty well documented by amateur golf historians over the last 15 years. And generally Los Angeles history is well documented since a few movie stars could be induced to add some glamor to any project. For example, the bizarre Pine Needles ski hill behind Universal Studios sounds more like a dream I had than a once real enterprise. But we know it existed in the summer of 1939 because the promoter made sure to have Ginger Rodgers and Jimmy Stewart ski down its pine needle covered slope to get some press coverage. Okay, I’ve found a more detailed article : Finally in 1919, plans to build a Hollywood Country Club actually led to completion. A new group, with Douglas Fairbanks and Sydney Chaplin serving on the board of directors, secured a $200,000 option on 140 acres in the area near North Hollywood, with half a mile frontage on Ventura Boulevard and heading up to the top of the canyon, adjoining what is now Coldwater Canyon Boulevard. This seems to be based on this 1919 newspaper article . [By 1921] Membership already totaled more than 650, with a 700 limit. Only eight film members belonged, one of which was Wallace Reid. Okay, that may explain the historical obscurity: even though the Hollywood Country Club had some movie star names attached to its founding, and it was up and running all through the 1920s, it did not catch on with movie folk, so it’s lost to historical obscurity. My guess is that the golf course architecture by an otherwise unknown designer named F.A. Peebles wasn’t very good and couldn’t compete with the Westside courses by George C. Thomas, like Bel-Air and Riviera. Most of the holes run straight uphill or downhill and the canyon on the left appears too narrow to get out of, apparently requiring golfers to walk back down. The Hollywood Hills are a tilted block mountain range, with the south side along Wilshire Boulevard having gentler foothills ideal for golf, while the north side falls abruptly down into the flat San Fernando Valley. But the north slope of the hills has a lot of trees because it’s as blasted by midday sun as the south slope of the hills. They finally got the north slope of the Santa Monica mountains golf course right at Sherwood in Thousand Oaks in the 1980."
Bazelon Dynasty Still Working to Raise the Murder Rate,www.vdare.com,Steve Sailer,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vdare.com/posts/bazelon-dynasty-still-working-to-raise-the-murder-rate,"The Democratic presidential candidates should look at what a growing number of prosecutors are doing to end mass incarceration. By Emily Bazelon, April 5, 2019 The United States spends far too much money locking up far too many people for far too long. A few years ago, a politician had to be brave to say anything like that out loud. Now it’s a mainstream and bipartisan view. … That presents a major opportunity for Democratic presidential candidates. But for all the energy behind reform, no presidential candidate has articulated a big, comprehensive vision for transformational change. There’s a consensus that the system is broken, but no agreement on how to fix it. The presidential candidate looking to distinguish herself might start by looking at a new wave of reform-minded district attorneys who are challenging conventional law-and-order approaches in red states and blue ones. Like Kim Foxx! …To end mass incarceration, however, exempting nonviolent offenses from jail time isn’t enough. People convicted of violent crimes make up more than half of the country’s state prison population. But the image of prisons overflowing with murderers and rapists is wrong. In many states, “violent felonies” include offenses like breaking into an empty house or snatching a purse or iPhone on the street. Reducing sentences for these offenses — and changing what counts as a violent felony to begin with — is a good way to start lowering this share of the prison population. Breaking into your home — a mere technicality. Somebody mugging your mom — that’s not really so bad, now is it? I mean, Donald Trump was sore about his mother being mugged in 1991 , so that just shows you how racist it is to object to a little purse-snatching. Ms. Bazelon is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and author of the forthcoming “Charged: The New Movement to Transform Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration.” Interestingly, Emily Bazelon, whom you are going to be hearing even more from shortly because of her upcoming book, is a hereditary legal pundit. Her grandfather David Bazelon was one of the major architects of the horrific crime wave of the 1960s into the 1990s that destroyed so many once great American cities. As we can see in my old graph, the homicide rate doubled from roughly 1964-1975, while the imprisonment rate dropped slightly (i.e., the chance of being in prison per crime committed dropped sharply in the liberal 1960s and early 1970s). But who can remember these days that liberals like David Bazelon took over the American criminal justice system in the 1960s with catastrophic consequences? Emily Bazelon doesn’t appear to remember that. As head judge of the D.C. circuit court in the 1960s, David Bazelon was the most powerful judge in the country not on the Supreme Court. And as the best friend of the most influential Warren Court justice, William Brennan, Grampa Bazelon often worked behind the scenes with Brennan to set up various cases to get in front of the Warren Court for pre-planned decisions. So, what could possibly go wrong when you take advice from a Bazelon on how to reform the criminal justice system? From Wikipedia’s entry on David Bazelon : Influencing the United States Supreme CourtBazelon was for decades the senior judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and a close associate of Justice William J. Brennan Jr., whom he had met in 1956.[6] Justice William O. Douglas and President Lyndon B. Johnson would be their sometime companions on trips to baseball games.[7] Bazelon served with Warren E. Burger on the D.C. Circuit for over a decade, and the two grew to be not just professional rivals, but personal enemies as well.[8] The Washington Post would note in 1981 that during the Warren Court era, lawyers who wanted a Bazelon opinion upheld would do well to mention the judge’s name as many times as possible in their briefs… “One mention of this name was worth 100 pages of legal research.”[7] Bazelon became a primary source of Justice Brennan’s law clerks.[9] Judicial careerBazelon had a broad view of the reach of the Constitution.[8] Conservatives viewed the judge as dangerous for his tendency to rule in favor of the lower class, the mentally ill, and defendants.[8] Bazelon authored many far-reaching decisions on topics as diverse as the environment, the eighteen-year-old vote, discrimination, and the insanity defense.[8] Many of his “radical” rulings were upheld by the Supreme Court.[7] … Bazelon was the nemesis of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger beginning from the time both served on the Court of Appeals.[11] Bazelon was a nationally recognized advocate for the rights of the mentally ill, and his opinion in 1954’s Durham v. United States (which adopted a new criminal insanity test) set off a long clash between the two judges.[11] Under Bazelon’s Durham rule, a defendant would be excused from criminal responsibility if a jury found that the unlawful act was “the product of mental disease or mental defect,” rather than the product of an “irresistible impulse” (which was the old test).[11] Bazelon’s innovations helped lead to various terrible and hilarious trial outcomes in the 1970s, such as Dan White’s Twinkie Defense helping him get off with a light verdict for murdering San Francisco’s mayor George Moscone and supervisor Harvey Milk. Bazelon’s Durham Rule turned out to be such a disaster in practice that he had already given up on it after 18 years. Back in the 1970s, due to Judge Bazelon’s efforts, Temporary Insanity was a big deal as a Get Out of Jail Free card. I’m reminded of the only bit of the mock-soap opera Soap (1977-81) I watched. The father tells his daughter: Dad: “You can’t marry him. He’s a murderer!” Daughter: “But, dad, you’re a murderer too.” Dad: “That’s different. The jury found me temporarily insane.” From David Bazelon’s NYT obit: David Bazelon Dies at 83; Jurist Had Wide Influence By MARILYN BERGER FEB. 21, 1993 David L. Bazelon, who as a Federal appeals court judge for three decades wrote landmark opinions extending the rights of the individual and expanding the rights of criminal defendants, died on Friday at his home in Washington…. As Chief Judge of the appeals court from 1962 to 1978, Judge Bazelon presided as the court was breaking ground in criminal law … His court’s broad reach resulted from its jurisdiction over Federal regulatory agencies and its role as the appellate court for the nation’s capital. As the Federal Government grew, so did the influence of Judge Bazelon’s court. Next to the Supreme Court, his was considered the most influential court in the country. As its Chief Judge, he was one of the most influential jurists in the land. He was also the focus of sharp debate among admirers and detractors. In a career spanning eight Presidential administrations, Judge Bazelon (pronounced BAA-zeh-lawn) became a familiar figure in Washington society, a welcome guest with a warm sense of humor, who stayed trim by jogging regularly. … Rather than follow precedent set in a simpler time, he questioned the status quo and sought to apply new findings in the social sciences and psychiatry to issues the court faced. …. Judge Bazelon, who believed that the judiciary should reach beyond the bench and speak out on social issues, was assailed by conservatives as being soft on crime and by some legal scholars for bringing the judiciary into the regulatory process. There was a spirited and bitter antagonism between Judge Bazelon and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who had served with him on the appellate court. In a scathing Supreme Court opinion in 1978, Justice William H. Rehnquist, reflecting the views of the Burger Court, accused the Bazelon court of “judicial intervention run riot.” … But Judge Bazelon was a heroic figure to many liberals. Joseph L. Rauh Jr., the Washington lawyer who served as a clerk to Justices Benjamin Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter, wrote to Judge Bazelon in 1979, “I have worked for great judges and have known many more great judges, but I believe you have had the most socially useful judicial career in my lifetime.” Former Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the Supreme Court, long a close friend of Judge Bazelon, said his major contribution was in extending the Bill of Rights to restrict state power. Justice Brennan said in an interview in 1989 that Judge Bazelon was particularly instrumental in expanding the right of defendants in criminal cases to be represented in court and in extending to the states, through a series of rulings during his years on the appellate court, the right to prohibit evidence that was improperly acquired. It was not enough, in Judge Bazelon’s view, for a defendant to have legal representation. He believed that the Constitution required the court to look at the quality of that representation. When he saw a lawyer who did not put enough effort into a case, he would often point at the lawyer and say, “There goes a walking violation of the Sixth Amendment.” Redefining Criminal Insanity In 1954, applying modern psychiatric theories, Judge Bazelon established a new definition of insanity as a defense in criminal cases. Previously, for almost a century, the test was whether the defendant knew right from wrong. Judge Bazelon wrote in his decision in Durham v. United States that “an accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect.” In 1972 Judge Bazelon concurred in his three-judge court’s decision to establish a more restrictive test, but his opinion in the Durham case generated new consideration of the insanity rule. Much of his activity on and off the bench was aimed at removing the causes of criminal behavior, making prisons less brutal and assuring greater fairness in sentencing. He vigorously opposed mandated prison sentences that did not give a judge flexibility to set the term. He also urged that society deal with injustices that he believed bred crime: poverty, broken families, racial discrimination and lack of educational opportunity. In an article in The New York Times in 1977, Judge Bazelon wrote: “It is always easy to concede the inevitability of social injustice and find the serenity to accept it. The far harder task is to feel its intolerability and seek the strength to change it.” As the youngest of nine children, David Lionel Bazelon once said he came by his feelings for the underdog almost as a birthright. He was born in Superior, Wis., on Sept. 3, 1909, to Israel and Lena Bazelon."
Patriots Draft Preview: Team looks set at LB — for now,www.providencejournal.com,Mark Daniels,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/sports/20190406/patriots-draft-preview-team-looks-set-at-lb---for-now,"Patriots Draft Preview: Team looks set at LB — for now Mark Daniels Journal Sports Writer MarkDanielsPJ Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 7:04 PM Apr 6, 2019 at 7:04 PM
A continuing series looking at how the Patriots could fill positions in the NFL Draft, April 25-27.
The Patriots are in a good spot at the linebacker position for the 2019 season. The team returns Dont’a Hightower, Kyle Van Noy and Elandon Roberts. They also get Ja’Whaun Bentley back from IR to go along with Christian Sam and Calvin Munson. So, the depth is great. Long-term depth, however, has some question marks.
That’s why the Patriots could add a linebacker in the upcoming draft. Although it would be a surprise to see the Patriots draft one in the first round, don’t discount them taking someone in the later rounds.
Van Noy and Roberts are scheduled to be unrestricted free agents next year. Van Noy should be a priority for the Pats, but considering teams are willing to spend big bucks for productive defensive players, there’s always the risk that he moves on. Losing Van Noy, who plays both on the edge and in the middle, would be tough.
Then there’s Roberts. Last season was the middle linebacker’s best. He’s stout against the run and among the Patriots' hardest hitters. If they lose Roberts, they will need more inside linebacker depth.
Hightower is signed for the next two seasons but his cap hit rises to $11.375 million in 2020.
The Patriots currently hold 12 draft picks, in every round expect the fifth. Here’s a look at some candidates:
First round: Mack Wilson, Alabama
Wilson made an immediate impact at Alabama, playing as a true freshman. He turned into a vital piece for the Crimson Tide’s defense. Last season, he totaled 71 tackles, two interceptions and five pass breakups. At 6-foot-1, 240 pounds, he’s an inside linebacker who can also help in pass coverage. Wilson also has special-teams experience. Bill Belichick was at Alabama’s Pro Day.
Second round: D’Andre Walker, Georgia
Walker qualifies as an edge rusher. He’s 6-2, 251 pounds with a solid wingspan. His senior season was his first as a starter. He made 45 tackles, including a team-leading 11 tackles for loss, 14 quarterback pressures and 7.5 sacks. Walker has good athleticism and profiles as a pass-rusher in the NFL. Belichick was also at Georgia’s Pro Day.
Third round: Justin Hollins, Oregon
A team captain, Hollins is a gifted athlete with great size. He stands 6-5 and weighs 248 pounds and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds. Over the last two seasons, he forced eight fumbles, most in the nation. He earned Pac-12 All-Conference first team after finishing last season with 64 tackles, 6.5 sacks, five forced fumbles and seven pass breakups.
Fourth round: Ben Banogu, TCU
At 6-3, 250 pounds, Banogu is an edge rusher with great athletic skills. His 134-inch broad jump led all edge rushers and linebackers at the NFL Combine. He earned First-Team All-Big 12 honors the last two years in a row. Last season, he led TCU with 18 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks and two forced fumbles. Banogu met with the Patriots at the Senior Bowl.
Sixth round: Bobby Okereke, Stanford
Okereke has all the intangibles. He’s an Eagle Scout, a team captain and a hard worker. A 6-1 middle linebacker, Okereke led Stanford with 96 tackles last season to go with 4.5 sacks and five pass breakups. That earned him All-Pac-12 honorable mention honors. He’s also a core special-teamer. Nick Caserio worked out Okereke after Stanford’s Pro Day.
Seventh round: Blake Cashman, Minnesota
Cashman is an undersized weak-side linebacker at 6-1, 237 pounds, but is athletic (4.5 40-yard dash). Cashman went from being a walk-on to a captain at Minnesota. He led the Gophers with 104 tackles last season, 15 for a loss, and 2.5 sacks. He profiles as a core special-teamer.

Interrogating Beckyness,www.vdare.com,Steve Sailer,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vdare.com/posts/interrogating-beckyness,"Education researchers seem far more interested in “ interrogating whiteness” than in developing methodologies to help black students improve their skills.Max EdenApril 5, 2019 This weekend, more than 14,000 academics will gather in Toronto to share their research for the American Education Research Association’s annual conference. … A keyword search of the conference program reveals 422 hits for whiteness… A symposium called “The Interrogation of Whiteness in Progressive Public Schools” promises to explore “the experience of teachers and education leaders who work to undo whiteness in public schools.” A featured paper in that session is “Trust, Community, and Dismantling White Dominance.” Another, “Critical-Race Elementary Schooling: Teacher Change Agents are Undoing Whiteness in Elementary Schools,” celebrates teachers who “actively resist elements of Whiteness.” … Perhaps the most remarkable symposium analyzes fanfiction about “Beckys.” “Becky” is a slur for “a stereotypical basic white girl; obsessed with Starbucks, Ugg boots, and trying to have a bigger butt.” The panel, titled, “Critical Becky Studies: Critical Explorations of Gender, Race, and the Pedagogies of Whiteness,” includes a paper called “Becky Book Club: White Racial Bonding in the Living Room,” which explores the “more insidious workings” of book clubs “laced with white supremacy and surveillance.” Another essay, “Border Becky: Exploring White Women’s Emotionality, Ignorance, Investment in Whiteness,” examines white women who find themselves “at the border between choosing to be a race traitor and repledging their allegiance to white supremacy.”"

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — The Pawtucket Red Sox dropped both games of their doubleheader against the Syracuse Mets on Saturday afternoon at NBT Bank Stadium, losing the first contest, 6-3, and dropping the second, 4-3.
In the opener, Syracuse overcame an early 2-0 deficit by scoring in the second, third, fourth and sixth innings to grab the win.
Pawtucket's Tony Renda, who was the hero in Thursday's season-opener with a bases-clearing double in the 10th inning, pulled a two-run homer to left field in the second inning. Chandler Shepherd fanned six in five innings but allowed four earned runs and took the loss.
In the second contest, the PawSox jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the top of the first inning thanks to a two-run homer by Gorkys Hernández, who would later add a sacrifice fly in the fifth inning to stretch Pawtucket’s lead to 3-1.
A pair of errors in the sixth and seventh innings allowed Syracuse to tie it at 3-3. Hernández, however, did force extras with an outfield assist to home plate that nabbed Gregor Blanco on a would be walk-off sacrifice fly.
In the eighth, Syracuse plated its automatic runner at second base on a walk-off single from Adeiny Hechavarria.
Starter Erasmo Ramírez, Dan Runzler and Domingo Tapia each pitched two innings for Pawtucket. Trevor Kelley took the loss."
Missing Morris Dees,www.vdare.com,Steve Sailer,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vdare.com/posts/missing-morris-dees,"April 06, 2019, 10:09 AM A+ | a-
The Washington Post runs a long article about how, while the SPLC is trustworthy, co-founder Morris Dees was actually a white male and therefore had to go.
Years of turmoil and complaints led the Southern Poverty Law Center to fire its founder Morris Dees By Neena Satija, Wesley Lowery and Beth Reinhard April 5 at 5:22 PM
… “Why is he still here?” Costello said she asked Cohen, an exchange she documented that day in an email to a colleague. “People see him as racist and sexist.”
“Or an anachronism,” Cohen responded, according to Costello. “That would be kinder.”
Dees, 82, was fired last month for unspecified misconduct, igniting a rush of speculation about what had come between him and the organization he built into a legal and fundraising behemoth. The nonprofit said that Dees had acted in ways that did not reflect “the mission of the organization.”
Internal documents reviewed by The Post, along with interviews with current and former employees, suggest that the celebrated civil rights organization had been bitterly at odds with its founder for several years. Those battles have centered on his refusal to retire, his behavior toward women and his comments regarding race, according to the documents, the employees and Dees himself.
In a series of emails and an interview with The Post, Dees, who is white, strenuously denied any racist or sexist behavior and said he was not fired for misconduct.
“I built the Southern Poverty Law Center out of nothing,” Dees said in an interview last week in Montgomery, where he lives and the SPLC is based. “This stuff that they’re after me about is just total crap.”
Interestingly, the Washington Post can’t come up with any smoking guns against Morris.
Part of their problem is that they don’t want to report basic facts, like that Morris has been divorced five times. To be divorced by one wife could be a misunderstanding, but to be divorced by five wives bespeaks of … well, something reflecting on the basic credibility of the SPLC. It’s almost as if Morris is less the greatest moral authority of our time than a junk mail living legend who hit upon a great grift. Perhaps they are worried that readers might wonder why the Post has been quoting the SPLC as an unbiased oracle for all these years …
The anecdotes in this article are mostly like this:
In late 2017, the organization investigated a complaint from a female employee about Dees’s behavior after a fundraising event in Atlanta. Dees said that at a social gathering, he approached the woman, put his hand on her shoulder and asked her about a visible tattoo on her arm. He said that, after she asked if he had any tattoos, he pointed to the front of his clothed right thigh, where he said he had one.
Okay … well, how is Morris going to find Wife #6 if he doesn’t flirt with women? It sounds like she got creeped out that, briefly intrigued by the prospect of becoming the Widow Dees, she flirted back with an octogenarian.
… And they brought up two allegations of racially insensitive comments.
The first of those complaints concerned remarks Dees had allegedly made about black voter turnout. According to Dees, a senior employee complained that he had said low black voter turnout in Montgomery ensured no black candidate would be elected mayor. He said he could not recall making the remarks ascribed to him….
Never complain about low black voter turnout. White men are not allowed to say anything complaining about blacks, including: Gee, it would be nice if blacks would vote more.
The other complaint that the board members brought up, Dees said, stemmed from a lunch in 2015 with Don Terry, a journalist who at the time was a senior writer for the nonprofit. According to Dees, the men were discussing a recent car accident, and he remarked that he had heard black teenagers in Montgomery are more likely to run red lights.
Dees emailed Terry later about a study he’d found online showing that black drivers were not more likely to violate traffic laws.
“I stand corrected,” Dees wrote.
“Thank you for being open-minded about my challenge,” Terry, who is black, wrote back.
Hey, Morris, it is not too late to come over to the pro-science side.
… The nonprofit has promised that change is underway. It has hired Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama’s former chief of staff, to review its “workplace culture and its past practices and policies.”
Tina Tchen … where else have we heard that name lately?
And on Tuesday, board member Karen Baynes-Dunning, a black woman and former juvenile court judge, was named interim president to succeed Cohen.
Certainly, Morris had it coming … Yet, still, he was a giant at what he did and the people pushing him out are dwarves. I will miss Morris:"

When it comes to squishiness on immigration, the Trump Administration is now setting the pace. Every week brings news of some new concession to the business lobbies on legal immigration.
I don't have to go looking for these stories. They pop up every few days. Washington Times , March 29th: DHS to double seasonal guest worker increase (by Stephen Dinan ) The story tells us that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has approved an extra 30,000 seasonal guest worker visas. That's 15,000 extra over last year's increase.
This increase also comes earlier in the season, which, the report tells us, ""will give employers more time to apply and plan."" Well, isn't that nice for them.
Secretary Nielsen is just as worthless on illegal immigration. She showed up on Tucker Carlson's show earlier this week to talk about the tens of thousands of Central Americans coming across our southern border without authorization every month and being released into the U.S.A.
Nielsen emitted billowing clouds of hot air. On compulsory E-Verify for employers:
Clip : Carlson: ""How about this: Why wouldn't your agency write an executive order, present it to the President, have him sign it, and do it tomorrow?""
Nielsen: ""Everything is on the table. We'll do everything we can within our authorities ( sic ).""
Carlson got the same answer on the birthright citizenship executive order the President offered us before last November's elections.
[ Clip : Nielsen: ""Y'know, Tucker, I think the President's been clear: All of that is on the table.""]
E-Verify , birthright citizenship, visa tracking , stop remittances (or at least tax them), … ""All of that is on the table .""
And that's where it sits—on the table, turning brown and curling up at the edges like last week's sandwich.
On the table.
Madame Secretary, with respect: ""On the table"" butters no parsnips. Americans are not impressed by things lying uselessly ""on the table."" We want action —clear, decisive action, like your directive the other day to import 30,000 foreigners to do seasonal work—but we want action for American workers, for American sovereignty, for a demographically stable nation to bequeath to our grandchildren.
When shall we see that clear, decisive action, Madame Secretary?
Mr. President?
But note that immigration patriots are at least getting rhetoric from Trump—more than they would have gotten from any random Bush. I am under orders not to repeat that We Are Doomed too often on VDARE.com. And there is a Big Picture development that transcends Trump trivia.
What actually divides our two main parties? We know of course that Republicans are the Stupid Party while Democrats are the Evil Party; but what are the substantive issues that really separate them?
This has of course varied across historical time. The Republican Party started out sectionalist, as the anti-South Party. They'd prefer me to say ""anti-slavery,"" and to be sure abolitionists had a home in the early party; but so did Free Soil advocates, who just didn't want slavery expanded into new territories but many of whom were indifferent to slavery as a moral issue.
The impression you get from contemporary sources is that most pre-Civil War Republican Party voters wanted blacks to stay in the South, preferably but not necessarily as free citizens; or else be shipped off to black colonies in Africa or the Caribbean.
If a Donald Trump had shown up in 1860 promising to build a wall around the slave states, I bet he'd have won in a landslide.
After the Civil War the GOP coasted along for a while as the Party of Victory in that war, then morphed across the turn of the 20th century into the party of capitalism, most especially of the small businessman and his beloved tariffs, while the Democrats drifted leftwards into progressive social reform. The sectionalist stamp was still strong, though, with Democrats solid in the old Confederacy down to the 1960s.
With the great expansion of higher education and knowledge work after WW2, meritocratic elitism began to rise, bearing aloft the standard of essentialist egalitarianism, most especially of race and sex denialism.
This "" New Class "" easily took over the Democratic Party. Its rise stirred a reaction, though: Richard Nixon's ""Silent Majority,"" Donald Warren's "" Middle American Radicals ."" The old South, where meritocratic elites were thinner on the ground and race realism was strong, swung Republican.
This was a new kind of sectionalism, the beginnings of what I call the Cold Civil War. The sectionalist line no longer cuts cleanly across the nation: it now separates one county from the next, one city district from the next. It cuts through neighborhoods and streets, even through individual families.
That's the history of the two big parties in a nutshell—familiar to all of us, I think.
OK, but what's the key defining issue today? What, more than anything else, separates the two parties? Immigration, that's what.
Back in February, during the congressional fight over funding for Trump's wall, I went to NumbersUSA and looked up the immigration score cards on all the members of the House Appropriations Committee with a voting record. I tweeted out the result .
Executive summary: The 23 Republican members had a spread of ratings, from two members rated A down to one rated F-minus. The median rating for Republicans was B-minus.
Of the 29 Democratic members, one was rated D and two were rated F. The other 26 were all, every one of them , rated F-minus.
B-minus is not actually very impressive from an immigration-patriot point of view. There's considerable squishiness over immigration on the Republican side, due of course to big-money business donors looking to imported workers to keep wages down.
But the striking thing is the near-total absence of squishiness among the Democrats. F-minus, F-minus, F-minus, F-minus, F-minus, F-minus, … These guys are rock-solid.
It's the defining issue between the parties in our age. We may as well call them the ""Immigration Control Party"" and the ""Open Borders Party.""
It’s a tectonic shift that seems to be happening regardless of what the Trump Administration is actually doing.
Finally some good news: Down in the antipodes, ripples from the March 15th mosque massacres in New Zealand continue to spread out.
Brenton Tarrant, who committed those massacres, is actually an Australian; so the event generated even more interest in Australia than it would have anyway. That interest has brought forth a hero: Sixty-nine-year-old Fraser Anning, who has a seat in the 76-member Australian Senate.
Senator Anning is … I think the word is ""colorful."" He is plain-spoken and straightforward in what we used to consider a classically Australian style, although in recent decades the loathsome turbid waters of Political Correctness and feminized sensitivity have risen and drowned much of the cultural landscape Down Under.
Anning is culturally conservative: hates homosexuality and abortion, opposes multiculturalism, and—you may want to position yourself near the fainting couch for this one—in his maiden speech to the Senate last year, called for a referendum on re-introducing the White Australia policy that his country practiced up to the 1970s . That policy limited permanent settlement of immigrants to white people.
Senator Anning responded to the New Zealand killings by saying
As always, left-wing politicians and the media will rush to claim that the causes of today's shootings lie with gun laws or those who hold nationalist views but this is all cliched nonsense.
The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place. Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators.
Lawmaker hit by ‘Egg Boy’ censured for blaming New Zealand mosque shootings on Muslims, by Emily Jacobs, New York Post, April 3, 2019
That had them reaching for the smelling salts from Brisbane to Perth, from Bunda to Wagga Wagga , from Kalgoorlie to Kookaburra Springs .
There were condemnations, a motion of censure in the Senate, and a petition to remove Fraser Anning from the Senate (although there is apparently no constitutional way to do that).
One young chap was so incensed he snuck up behind the Senator in public and broke an egg over his head. Senator Anning span round deftly and bopped his assailant very accurately on the jaw, twice.
Nothing abashed, this week Senator Anning registered a new party, Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party . He also published a spirited open letter to the Australian Prime Minister—you can read it at the Occidental Observer , on Facebook, or at Australia’s Pickering Post —defiantly asserting his objections to mass Muslim immigration:
It is a matter of causation, not moral blame, that until recently we were largely immune to this problem because until the 1970s Western populations were, for the most part, ethnically, culturally and religiously homogenous.
I believe that these changes were initiated by governments, not requested by the people, who generally wished to retain their way of life, as did others around the world.
The Japanese people have no wish to bring in millions of Vietnamese and grant them citizenship. The Chinese don't want to be swamped with Indians.
No people wish for this. We didn't vote for it and we weren't asked.
You can take issue with Senator Anning's bluntness, and even with his arguments. I, for example, would take issue with his saying that Australians didn't vote for mass immigration and weren't asked.
It is true that in Australia, as here and in Britain, all the big old political parties, with various degrees of honesty, promoted mass Third World immigration. It's also true that there are difficult institutional barriers to getting a new party established.
Still, no-one has to vote for the established parties.
I was about to add: ""indeed, no-one has to vote at all …"" Then I remembered that Australia does in fact have mandatory voting , with a $20 fine if you fail to vote—not a bad idea, in my opinion. [ How Compulsory Voting Works: Australians Explain , by Tacey Rychter, NYT, October 22, 2018]
Still, there must have been minor parties people could vote for that didn't push mass immigration. Or voters could have staged a strike—a voter strike!
Yet Aussies—like Americans and Brits—went on voting for the major parties. In that default sense, contra Senator Anning, we did wish for it; we did vote for it.
But see what I'm doing there: I'm arguing back, as cogently as space and my abilities permit, against Fraser Anning's points, which he has very cogently expressed.
That's what's supposed to happen in a free, self-governing society. We make our points and argue them in public. The one who persuades the most listeners advances to the next round.
Australia's elites are having none of that! They are laboring mightily to silence Senator Anning, just as their counterparts here are laboring to silence dissident voices like ours here at VDARE.com.
Further quote from Senator Anning's open letter:
In order to lock-in permanent mass immigration, you multicultural elitists have annihilated the bedrock principle of Free Speech from our society.
This is the foundational principle on which our system of democracy is built.
That was the point where I stood up and cheered.
Strength to your arm, Senator—and to your pen.
If you ever find yourself out here on Long Island, the Fosters are on me.

Financial Guru Dennis Gartman Endorses Border Wall! Cites Larry Lindsay,www.vdare.com,Patrick Cleburne,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vdare.com/posts/financial-guru-dennis-gartman-endorses-border-wall-cites-larry-lindsay,"April 05, 2019, 07:09 PM A+ | a-
Dennis Gartman, frequently to be seen on financial television shows, is one of the phenomena of this Wall Street era. Single-handedly, from humble origins, he has over the last 40 years built up The Gartman Letter to be the default source of global and macro perspective for a remarkable community of investment houses, hedge funds and commodity traders.
In doing so, he has been extremely careful not to offend the political prejudices of his subscribers. Those who do not know it would probably be surprised to find how Leftist many Wall Streeters are. This stems from ethnic and regional traditions, and from a heavy dose of virtue signaling.
Astonishingly, on Wednesday Gartman took a huge risk by endorsing a Border Wall. This he did with characteristic indirectness by extensively quoting Larry Lindsey , the supply-side economist whose public career abruptly ended when he suggested (correctly of course) that the Iraq War would cost a multiple of what the Bush Administration purported to believe.
Gartman, who apparently knows Lindsey personally, opens by saying …we have found ourselves on the opposite side of the question of immigration for we have always been believers in very open borders here in the US, for as 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants to the country, immigration is what has made… and will continue to make… America great. However, Larry wrote something yesterday which has given us pause and reason to reconsider our view.
Lindsey gave the Border mess perspective
It is fashionable to say that there is no crisis on the southern border. But the facts say otherwise. Current illegal border crossings are running about 100,000 per month. That is equal to the total amount of legal immigration in the country.
These people have to be accommodated. For perspective, the entire city of New York has 117,000 hotel rooms. A city like Phoenix has 27,000.
After more similar statistics he went on One of the key reasons for the current surge is that word has gone out that “you can get away with it” but might not be able to in the future once the wall does go up...Over 90 percent of illegal border crossers never show up for their hearing.
Suggesting that the economic impact of closing the border could be mitigated by intelligent management, Larry Lindsay however did not flinch from the inevitable conclusion: It is not politically correct to say but as the Border Patrol has argued, the most cost-effective way to solve the logistical nightmare at the border is to build the wall where the Border Patrol itself has argued one is needed.
(VDARE.com emphasis.)
For Dennis Gartman to depart from years of pro-immigration remarks and risk enraging a significant part of his subscriber base (to say nothing of jeopardizing his MSM access) by supporting the need for a wall is a truly patriotic act."

Hello One of our contractors has just posted us a schematic with a high side transformer isolated FET gate drive design on it, in an offline power supply that he designed Put it this way, this circuit does not appear in here .. Its extremely ingenious, and yet, rather simple. What I cannot understand is why I cant find it anywhere on the web. If youve seen this design youll know the one I mean. It appears to bypass many of the usual problems with transformer isolated gate drives. Do you know the origin of it? I am currently on a gremlin hunt of it, because this design is so brilliant that I suspect there must be a gotcha do you know of any? He's got a working prototype, and it works well on the simulator at my end. I cant post the schem, but if you know this circuit, then you'll know exactly what i am talking about"

Can you assure me that 100% of illicit drug movement passes through ports of entry? Can you assure me that 100% of illicit drugs arriving at POE are interdicted? Since drug smugglers make rational economic choices, the level of interdiction achieved must be regarded by them as a negligible cost of doing business, or they would resort to other means. Last I heard, the DTOs were not going broke. El Chapo paid his president $100million just to shut up and go away - another CDB. So, we don't have any idea how much dope evades detection at the POE, and we don't have any idea how much evades inspection by avoiding the POE. Same goes for humans - I know a number of people who entered illegally at POE and were waved in without any real examination, but it still counts as 'inspected and admitted'. So, as another commenter noted, a wall alone is not sufficient, but if you want anything approaching border control - not to say security - a wall is necessary, if only to establish a baseline for all other control measures. You have to force ALL the drug cargoes into POE and then increase interdiction levels until it forces the DTO's into using other means - probably another air offensive like we had in Florida in the '70s and '80s."

Further, the other part of the answer is a major revision of laws dealing with immigration, but Congress does nothing.
