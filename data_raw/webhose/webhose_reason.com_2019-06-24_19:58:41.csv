Wade overthrew. And there’s a significant part of the pro-lifers that would ban most contraceptive drugs because they might kill a fertilized ovum.
A reasonable abortion law would recognize that a viable 8-month fetus is a human being, and a fertilized ovum or blastocyst is not. The argument between reasonable people would be where to draw the line – say 1st trimester, or the pre-Victorian standard of “quickening” at about 5 months -, and who decides when special circumstances allow later abortions, such as fatal developmental defects, and pregnant children who did not know what was happening or could not escape an abusive family until later in their pregnancy.
In fact, the Roe v. Wade court anticipated some such debate with their remarks about trimesters. But fanatics took over on both sides. On one side, there were those that insisted that a woman should have the right to have a healthy full-term baby stabbed to death in the middle of a normal delivery – that’s a “partial birth abortion” isn’t necessarily all of that, but pro-choicers wanted to allow all of that. On the other side, nearly every post-Roe law to come before the Supreme Court was designed to make abortions more difficult, at least for some pregnant children or women, regardless of the stage of the pregnancy, and so nearly every one was overturned."

Trump Loses Round One in Financial Record Fight,reason.com,Smith_FT_MI,05-21-2019,2019,5,https://reason.com/2019/05/20/trump-loses-round-one-in-financial-record-fight/#comment-7798828,"Good point. Nuance is required, and I’d have to think more about a definite “formula” I would suggest.
The Dual Sovereignty issue (to which you might be alluding) is an interesting one. (It still remains to be partially addressed this month, doesn’t it?) I agree that it is clear that nothing a State or Federal prosecutor undertakes constrains Congress. And probably nothing that either class of prosecutor does constrains the other.
However, I think there should be some constraint on Congress based upon the difference in functions between it and the enforcement agencies. (It may well be though that the scope should only be limited in clearly-egregious situations, leaving the remedy for correction of abuses to the voters rather than the courts.) Fact Finding is clearly a power and duty of Congress in connection w/ prospective legislation – and also government oversight, w/ abuses of executive function to be primarily remedied by corrective legislation. But criminal investigation ought to be cautiously exercised as being a departure from the aforesaid functions.
In answer to your core question I would say that once Act A has been discovered, determined to likely constitute Criminal Violation X, and referred to an appropriate prosecutor, it should refrain from investigating for the accumulation of corroborating evidence of Criminal Violation X. However, if some of the facts constituting Act A also establish an element of Criminal Violation Y, then they certainly can continue to investigate the circumstances of Act A for the purpose of determining whether there is evidence to support the other elements of Criminal Violation Y. And if any facts disclosed during the investigation suggested that other ancillary lines of inquiry should be pursued, the investigation certainly ought to continue.
I know the above is confusing, even to me, and needs to be hammered out at more leisure. It does suggest that the scope of these investigatory powers is broad, but that there should be some rational connection between each step as well as to the enumerated powers and functions of Congress."

He claims that in extremely partisan times like we have now, the risk is that Congress would be less likely to use impeachment to hold the president responsible for his actions.
This claim is completely nonsensical and ahistorical. In the first 220 years of the Republic, we had 1 impeachment (Andrew Johnson). Now we are on the verge of the second impeachment in 20 years, based largely on extreme partisanship (using the results of an investigation that began with no evidence of collusion by the Trump campaign and went on for 2 years with no evidence).
The extreme partisanship makes it more likely that we’ll have impeachment proceedings, whether deserving or not."
