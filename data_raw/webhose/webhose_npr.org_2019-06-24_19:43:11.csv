toggle caption Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice Curators have organized a retrospective at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., to mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of Italian painter Jacopo Tintoretto. Above Tintoretto's The Creation of the Animals, painted circa 1550-1553.
Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice Legend has it that when Jacopo Tintoretto was 12 years old, he was so good at drawing that he rattled Titian — the master artist of Venice, 30 years his senior. Young Tintoretto was an apprentice in Titian's workshop and — as the story goes — the old master gone away for several days, and when he came back he found some of Tintoretto's drawings.
""He saw these drawings and said, 'Who did this?' "" explains art expert Frederick Ilchman. ""The young Tintoretto was nervous, thinking he'd done a bad job ... and was going to be corrected. No, they were not bad — in fact, they were too good.""

The Philadelphia Museum of Art/Art Resource, NY Titian felt threatened and kicked the kid out. But Tintoretto got all the lessons he needed in ambition and toughness — and went on to have a long, successful life in the art world.
That career is the focus of Tintoretto's very first U.S. retrospective, now on view at the National Gallery of Art , co-curated by Frederick Ilchman and Robert Echols. It marks the 500th anniversary of the 16th century Venetian artist's birth.
""He never saw a wall that he couldn't envision covered with a large Tintoretto,"" says Echols. The canvases are huge — jammed with hunky men (and some women) — writhing, and reaching, and rushing — in myths or Biblical scenes. Tintoretto painted them all over a ceiling of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice. It took ambition — and a lot of hustle.
In 1564, Tintoretto was one of four artists invited submit drawings for the grand building.
""Tintoretto doesn't have a drawing,"" says Ilchman. ""Instead, he has pulled aside from the ceiling a big piece of cardboard to show — the fully completed oil on canvas installed in its intended position.""
But wait, there's more: Tintoretto announces it's a donation, knowing full well that there are regulations that stipulate all gifts — large or small — must be accepted, Ilchman explains. It worked, and Tintoretto went on to do some 60 more paintings for the place.

National Gallery of Art Tintoretto competed for work all his life. In the 16th century, the cosmopolitan city of Venice was teeming with artists who had to fight to make a living. ""It was a cut-throat environment,"" Ilchman says. ""You had to paint quickly in order to get your commissions, in order to fill them.""
Over the years, Tintoretto became immensely successful. Eventually he got so many commissions he had to hire a vast number of assistants. They worked so fast that critics thought the pieces looked unfinished. And the commissions kept coming, even though Titian had tried to block them by blackballing his former apprentice. All the while, as the rivalry continued, both artists were painting their heavenly religious scenes.

There's so much well-known ""Last Supper"" imagery — the apostles sitting in a row at the table, a serene Jesus in the center. Some 60 years after Leonardo da Vinci painted his famous Last Supper , Tintoretto puts the apostles in a blender and spins them around — and paints their reactions when Christ says one of them will betray him.
""Some of them are practically falling out of their chairs backwards,"" Echols says. ""Some of them are reaching forward, gesturing towards Christ. The painting is full of action, push, and pull, and drama. And this is typical of Tintoretto: His paintings are always dynamic — full of energy and action.""
They're cinematic. You can almost hear the soundtrack.
""Jean Paul Sartre the philosopher said that Tintoretto was the first film director,"" Echols adds.

Musée du Louvre, Paris/Art Resource, NY Speed, competition and success took its toll. You can see it for yourself in two self-portraits that bookend the retrospective at the National Gallery of Art. The first self-portrait, made when he was around 28, shows an intense, almost fierce Tintoretto — with dark curly hair, mustache and beard, he's glaring at viewers, demanding that we pay attention. The exhibit ends with another self-portrait, made when he was around 70; Tintoretto's hair and beard are white, and his stare is stony.
""The impetuous, aggressive, younger artist in that early self-portrait — now the fire has really gone out of his eyes,"" Echols says. ""He's now tired. He's had a very long career, he's been very successful, but boy, is he weary.""
Several of the artworks in the retrospective are coming to the U.S. for the first time. The exhibition is on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., until early July.

Training Police To Better Track Hate Crimes,www.npr.org,UNH Police Chief Paul Dean,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/726545423/we-need-to-evolve-police-get-help-to-improve-hate-crime-tracking?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image University of New Hampshire police recently participated in a training on hate crimes.

toggle caption David Goldman/AP University of New Hampshire police recently participated in a training on hate crimes. The police chief enlisted the help of a traveling workshop organized by two advocacy groups.
David Goldman/AP For the picturesque college town of Durham in southeastern New Hampshire, a reckoning came in 2017.
That was the year a complaint about the cultural appropriation of Cinco de Mayo spiraled into weeks of racial unrest, a boiling over of tensions that had simmered for years at the University of New Hampshire. Students who called out racist incidents faced a backlash of online bullying, swastikas and slurs, and the vandalism of sculptures that symbolized their cause.
Student activists blamed UNH leadership for allowing the problem to fester. Their criticism was backed up by news reports that showed the university hadn't reported a single hate incident for more than a decade before — an oddity for a campus its size.
""That time was sad,"" UNH Police Chief Paul Dean said. ""But there were opportunities.""
Dean was speaking from a campus auditorium this month as he welcomed guests to one of those opportunities: a hate-crime training for the university police and the Durham Police Department.
Dean and Chief Dave Kurz of Durham, N.H., where the college is located, were among the latest chiefs to enlist the help of a traveling workshop organized by two advocacy groups, the Matthew Shepard Foundation and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. In the daylong workshop, the officers learned about state and federal laws related to bias crimes, heard from black and Jewish activists who've had firsthand experience with hate incidents, and debated whether certain scenarios had all the legal requirements of a hate crime.
I just don't like the idea of somebody feeling uncomfortable in my community.
UNH Police Chief Paul Dean
Dean said the workshop is one of many ways he's trying to make good on a promise to students to be more responsive to bias-motivated incidents.
""Just because something has always been the way it is doesn't necessarily mean that's the right way. We need to evolve,"" Dean said. ""I just don't like the idea of somebody feeling uncomfortable in my community.""
The idea for the mobile trainings came a couple of years ago, when FBI data showed a sharp increase in reported hate crimes — and that's with only spotty, voluntary reporting from law enforcement agencies around the country.
The trainers are former senior Justice Department prosecutors and agents with years of experience in bias-motivated crimes. They go from city to city teaching police about hate-crime laws in their states — not always an easy task given the debate in law enforcement circles over whether such laws are necessary or even constitutional.

Deitle is with the Matthew Shepard Foundation, an advocacy group that's part of a traveling workshop to teach law enforcement about state and federal hate-crime laws.
Hannah Allam/NPR ""There's one set of the population that looks at hate crimes and sees laws that were passed to protect certain people. And why were those certain people more special than somebody else?"" said trainer Cynthia Deitle, a former FBI special agent who was in charge of the bureau's Civil Rights Unit and is now with the Matthew Shepard Foundation.
The workshop materials list some of the most common arguments of skeptical officers: Laws are already in place for crimes, so it's a waste of time and resources to add an extra charge for bias. Hate crimes aren't a major problem in our area. These laws are an exercise in political correctness.
The trainers don't shy away from the tough conversation; they open with it. In New Hampshire, trainer Albert Moskowitz, a former senior Justice Department prosecutor, stood before roughly 50 officers and posed the big question about hate-crime laws.
""Do we need them?"" Moscowitz asked. ""What do you think?""
At first, nobody responded. Then one officer said he supports the approach New Hampshire takes now — no state hate-crime law, but prosecutors can seek tougher sentencing when bias is a motivation.
""So you're saying that somehow these crimes are more serious than they'd otherwise be,"" Moscowitz said, prodding the officer to explain his thinking.
""I didn't say more serious,"" the officer said. ""An assault is an assault no matter how you look at it.""
""Because an assault against anybody is a serious crime, right?"" Moscowitz said. ""So why would it be more serious if the assault is substantially motivated by the person's race or religion?""
""It should be enhanced as far as penalties,"" the officer replied. ""But as far as seriousness? No.""
Technology San Francisco Approves Ban On Government's Use Of Facial Recognition Technology Supporters of hate-crime laws say the idea is to acknowledge the sweeping impact of targeting someone simply for who they are. The torching of a mosque is felt by the larger Muslim community, for example, just like the murder of a trans woman sends a message to others who identify as LGBT.
Strafford County Attorney Thomas Velardi, who oversees Durham and the surrounding area, says he sees hate-crime laws as restorative.
""There are some people that are being singled out and in some instances hurt, and we need to do something about that. We're sort of struggling with how to respond to that – what do we do and how do we do it?""
The trainers are careful about the framing, stressing how it's just good police work to stay on top of hate incidents that might point to a trend or signal the formation of groups like the ones that wreaked havoc in Charlottesville, Va.
""None of us want you to be the next Charlottesville or the next Charleston or the next Pittsburgh,"" Deitle said, referring to cities where deadly hate-inspired attacks took place. ""We don't want you to be that. But we don't know. And you need to be prepared.""
During the training, few of the New Hampshire officers volunteered their thoughts, but they opened up a little more over lunch. The chiefs asked that the officers not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the topic and because some work undercover.
Sitting around a table in the campus cafeteria, the officers used some of the language of hate-crime skeptics. There's not an increase, it's just that there's more reporting now, they argued, or the media are quick to call something a hate crime without knowing the facts. Still, the officers said, they see the training as helpful even if they're still conflicted about the purpose of hate-crime laws.
""If we don't train, if we don't stay on top of the current changes and laws and the attitudes and the climate, then we're going to pay a big price for that,"" one veteran officer said, as others nodded in agreement. ""We'll lose the trust of the community, and we can't do that."""

Myriam Santos/Courtesy of the artist Mavis Staples could've retired in good conscience years ago.
But slowing down isn't her style.
With her father, sisters and brother as The Staple Singers, her gospel songs scored the civil rights movement.
More than a half century later, as Staples nears 80, the decorated R&B star continues to train her soulful pipes on hope and resilience in her call for change.
As her lifelong mission endures, she's been pushing out new material with contemporary artists. Ben Harper produced and wrote most of the songs on her new album, We Get By , after Mavis and the singer-songwriter clicked during a collaboration on her 2016 album, Livin' on a High Note.
In a recent interview, NPR's Michel Martin caught up with Staples from her hometown of Chicago, following up on their conversation in 2016 , around the time that then President Obama celebrated Staples at the Kennedy Center Honors.
As she told Martin at the time, Staples felt that the world looked a lot like it did in the 1960s, and said she respected artists who were singing to inspire change.
Her tune remains the same.
""We're going at the world backwards,"" Staples said. ""We need a change. And every chance I get I'm going to sing songs of change.""

Mavis Staples, ""Change"" ANTI- Records YouTube Interview Highlights On what keeps her going
It's what I love to do. I'm happiest when I'm singing. I'm just grateful that I have so many fans that still want to hear me, you know, and grateful to the record company for making room for me to continue. It's my gift — it's what God put me here for, I do believe.
On her collaboration with Ben Harper
Ben had written me a song for one of my other albums, Livin' on a High Note . And that song was ""Love and Trust."" I fell so in love with that song and every time we'd sing it, the audience they would just roar. We'd been singing it for a couple of years.
Then I ran into Ben on the road — we would always meet up somewhere on the road. I said ""Ben, you have got to write me another song."" He said, ""Well, Mavis, why don't I write you 11 songs,"" he said, ""Let's make an album."" Sounds good to me, you know, I said ""I don't know if I could handle 11 good songs from Ben Harper."" He said, ""Well yeah, you can handle it Mave.""
He was not playing with me. I wasn't playing with him either. I love him so much. He is such a beautiful spirit. Actually, he's writing what I've been singing all my life. But all songwriters have a different twist and I like Ben's, I like it a lot.
On the opener track, ""Change""
I felt like I was singing with my family again. It was just in the groove of where we would sing, not to mention the message that's in that song: It is time for a change. It's been time a long time ago but, you know, now more than ever. It's just too many things going wrong.
I mentioned back in the '60s [ in a 2016 NPR interview ], and still the news reminds me of the '60s. We're going at the world backwards. You know we've got to change. We need a change. And every chance I get I'm going to sing songs of change .
On why she chose the 1956 Gordon Parks photo ("" Outside Looking In, Mobile, Alabama"" captures six African-American children peering into a whites-only park through a chain-link fence )
That photograph hit me like a ton of bricks. They had sent me about nine pictures, you know, trying to find something for the album. That was the only one I saw — and it grabbed me. You know, these little babies, standing on the outside — they want to swing, they want to go on the slide.
And it kind of reminded me of my sisters and I, we had that problem when we were growing up. We couldn't go to the beach, we couldn't go to the park. We wanted some grass where we lived, we didn't really have any grass, you know, we'd have to play in a vacant lot with dirt and glass so that photograph grabbed me in the heart and almost brought me to tears. I said, ""This is the one.""
On what she hopes her songs will give others
I hope my songs give them a reason to wake up, and think about what is going on in the world. And hopefully, they resonate with the audience. I've always hoped from the time we started singing the freedom songs that our songs, we're singing them to make a difference, you know, make a better place — help somebody instead of hurting somebody — so much we could do to make it better.
On whether she has a favorite song
I love every one, but I do love ""Heavy on My Mind.""

Missouri is within days of losing its last remaining health center that provides abortions. Unless a court intervenes, it will become the first state in the nation without such a clinic.
Planned Parenthood officials say they are filing a lawsuit in state court Tuesday, asking for a restraining order to prevent its St. Louis clinic from being forced to stop offering the procedure after a state license expires Friday.
Planned Parenthood officials say they've been unable to reach an agreement with officials at the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, who want to require several doctors who perform abortions at the health center to submit to questioning as a condition of renewing the license.
""This means that more than 1.1 million women of reproductive age in Missouri will live in a state where they cannot receive the health care they need,"" Planned Parenthood President, Dr. Leana Wen, said in a statement to NPR. ""This is a world we haven't seen in nearly half a century.""
Planned Parenthood says state officials have indicated the questioning could lead to criminal proceedings or board review for those physicians, who provide the procedure at Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.
In her statement, Wen described the state's actions as ""harassment"" meant to ""intimidate"" physicians who perform abortions.
Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of State Media Campaigns for Planned Parenthood, said the situation in Missouri has been unfolding for years and is the result of what she describes as a ""weaponized inspections process.""
""This didn't happen overnight. It's been a slow drip of restriction after restriction, and we've been warning for some time that abortion access is on the line,"" Lee-Gilmore said.
The news comes just days after Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Parson, signed a law criminalizing abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy. In a statement upon signing, Parson said the abortion ban sends ""a strong signal to the nation that, in Missouri, we stand for life, protect women's health, and advocate for the unborn.""
That law makes Missouri the latest in a growing number of states to ban the procedure in the early stages of pregnancy, often before women even know they're pregnant. Doctors convicted of violating the Missouri law could face prison time. Several states have passed similar early bans in recent weeks, but none have taken effect so far. Legal challenges are underway, and federal judges in Mississippi and Kentucky have already blocked such laws.
But even without banning the procedure, restrictive health regulations can force clinics to stop offering abortions or close altogether. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, Mo., stopped performing the procedure in October 2018, after it was unable to fulfill a state requirement that doctors performing the procedure have admitting privileges at a hospital within about 15 minutes of the clinic. Planned Parenthood officials say there are some hospitals in Missouri that will perform abortions under rare circumstances, such as a medical emergency.
Missouri is now one of six states with only one remaining clinic, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.
The St. Louis clinic will continue to provide services such as birth control and health screenings, but will have to stop offering abortions unless a judge grants a restraining order. Patients seeking abortions in Missouri would then have to travel hundreds of miles, to clinics in Kansas or Illinois, Wen said.
Wen said it would be the first time in decades that an entire state would be without a health center offering abortions.
""This is a tragedy for Missouri women and doctors. And it's a disturbing preview of what anti-choice politicians are trying to implement across the country,"" Wen said.
Planned Parenthood officials say they have reached agreements with state health officials on other rules, including a requirement that physicians perform two pelvic examinations on women seeking surgical abortions. Supreme Court Upholds Indiana Provision Mandating Fetal Burial Or Cremation
Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an abortion provider at the St. Louis clinic, said in a statement provided by Planned Parenthood that repeat pelvic exams are ""medically unnecessary and invasive.""
""For some patients, this can even be re-traumatizing,"" McNicholas said in the statement. ""In this case, we had to weigh this against abortion access for an entire state — a nearly impossible decision and state officials know it.""
Planned Parenthood has stopped offering medication abortions in Missouri because of that requirement.
Dr. Sarah Horvath, a fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who is aware of the negotiations in Missouri, said via email that such policies ""harm the patient-physician relationship and erode patient trust.""
Asked about the state's move to question abortion providers, Horvath said the procedure is ""highly over-regulated due to stigma and politics. ... Doctors should be able to provide health care without fearing interrogation."" Facebook"

Philip Wayne Lock/Fairfax Media via Getty Images Tony Horwitz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, historian and author whose books have graced best-seller lists and college syllabuses, has died at the age of 60. His publisher confirmed to NPR that he died Monday without warning, suffering an apparent cardiac arrest while in Washington, D.C., on tour for his most recent book.
The book, Spying on the South , had been released just two weeks ago .
The writer won the Pulitzer for national reporting in 1995 for his work with The Wall Street Journal , covering working conditions for low-wage employees in the U.S. The stories took him from Mississippi to Maryland to Iowa. But he'd already done a lot of travelling for his own work before that.
In One for the Road , published in 1987, a young Horwitz wrote of his grueling journey hitchhiking across 7,000 miles of the Australian Outback, and roughly two decades later, he retraced the steps of the early European settlers along the east coast of the U.S. in A Voyage Long and Strange .
""I think part of what I wanted to do is restore a little bit of the unpredictability to history,"" Horwitz told NPR's Melissa Block shortly after the book's publication in 2008. ""It didn't have to unfold this way, it could well have gone very differently.""

Philip Wayne Lock/Fairfax Media via Getty Images Tony Horwitz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, historian and author whose books have graced best-seller lists and college syllabuses, has died at the age of 60. His publisher confirmed to NPR that he died Monday without warning, suffering an apparent cardiac arrest while in Washington, D.C., on tour for his most recent book.
The book, Spying on the South , had been released just two weeks ago .
The writer won the Pulitzer for national reporting in 1995 for his work with The Wall Street Journal , covering working conditions for low-wage employees in the U.S. The stories took him from Mississippi to Maryland to Iowa. But he'd already done a lot of travelling for his own work before that.
In One for the Road , published in 1987, a young Horwitz wrote of his grueling journey hitchhiking across 7,000 miles of the Australian Outback, and roughly two decades later, he retraced the steps of the early European settlers along the east coast of the U.S. in A Voyage Long and Strange .
""I think part of what I wanted to do is restore a little bit of the unpredictability to history,"" Horwitz told NPR's Melissa Block shortly after the book's publication in 2008. ""It didn't have to unfold this way, it could well have gone very differently.""

FDA's Accelerated Approvals For Cancer Drugs At Odds With Many Later Studies : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Richard Harris,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/28/727598045/cancer-drugs-approved-quickly-often-fail-to-measure-up-later,"Enlarge this image Avastin got an accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of glioblastoma, but additional research found the drug didn't extend patients' lives.

J.B. Reed /Bloomberg via Getty Images Cancer drugs that speed onto the market based on encouraging preliminary studies often don't show clear benefits when more careful follow-up trials are done, according to research published Tuesday.
These cancer drugs are granted accelerated approval to give patients faster access to the treatments and to allow drug companies to reap the economic rewards sooner. As a condition of this process, the Food and Drug Administration requires drug companies to conduct more research, to confirm whether the medications actually work and are safe.
In 2018, the FDA looked back on 93 cancer drugs granted accelerated approval and touted that only five had been removed from the market over a 25-year span. A research team at Harvard Medical School's Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law dug deeper to see what had happened with the rest.
In the follow-up studies, only 19 of the 93 drugs clearly extended the lives of the patients taking them, according to the study , published in the latest JAMA Internal Medicine.
For example, Genentech's Avastin, or bevacizumab, won accelerated approval to treat the deadly brain cancer glioblastoma, but the drug did not extend the lives of patients in a follow-up study.
Sometimes patients value drugs because they improve their quality of life. This drug didn't do that either, yet the FDA left it on the market as an approved treatment for glioblastoma.
""So that was the most baffling thing,"" says Bishal Gyawali, an oncologist on the research team. ""I find it very difficult to understand.""
The researchers said follow-up studies for these cancer drugs often didn't even use overall survival or improved quality of life as the benchmark.
Instead, many used the same measure that formed the basis for their preliminary approval — for example, tumor shrinkage. Those targets, called "" surrogate endpoints ,"" often don't predict who will live longer or more comfortably.
""How can we use the same surrogate endpoint and say they have clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial?"" Gyawali asks, when that endpoint clearly wasn't sufficient for full approval of the drug at the outset. (Gyawali is now at Queens University in Ontario.)
""The reason for giving these approvals should be transparent,"" he says, but the FDA doesn't explain its reasoning.
A second study in the same issue looked at cancer drugs approved based on a specific surrogate endpoint called ""response rate."" Response to a drug can be anything from spectacular and complete remission to weak and transitory shrinkage of a tumor. And these responses don't necessarily mean people will live longer or be more comfortable.
The study looked at 59 cancer drugs approved initially on the basis of their response rate and found that just six eventually won regular approval based on their overall survival benefit.
Studies based on response rate don't include a comparison group, so the scientists at Oregon Health and Science University argue that it's difficult to say whether these new drugs are better than other drugs already on the market.
Sometimes there is no comparison group because these are rare cancers, or the drug targets a rare mutation in a common cancer, so it's difficult to pull together a study that randomizes patients into different treatment groups, says Dr. Richard Schilsky , the senior vice president and chief medical officer at the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
But for other circumstances, ""if we put the investment in it we would be able to do randomized controlled trials,"" says Emerson Chen, an oncology fellow at OHSU. Those studies often add another year or more to a follow-up study, he says, but he advocates for them because they provide ""more definitive information about the survival and the patient-reported outcomes.""
""One of the reasons we don't do those kinds of studies is that people say these drugs are so potent it would be wrong to do those kinds of studies ... ethically or practically,"" says oncologist Vinay Prasad , senior author of the paper. ""But I think what we find is these drugs unfortunately are not that potent.""
In a commentary , Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania write that there ""is no good reason for the FDA to rely so heavily on accelerated approval using response rates or other unreliable surrogate end points.""
""Drugs with unproven effectiveness sell false hope to desperate patients, who are likely paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for them,"" they write, adding, ""Approval of ineffective drugs also crowds out innovation that might produce effective treatment.""
The FDA gets pressure both from patients and from drug companies to accelerate approval of new cancer drugs and constantly needs to strike a balance between innovation and caution, ASCO's Schilsky says.
Randomized trials are the gold standard for cancer research, but he says they can be challenging if a drug is already on the market.
""When the preliminary results with some of these new treatments are looking very promising, it's particularly difficult to get patients to accept randomization to a standard therapy that may be far inferior — or at least appear to be far inferior — to the new treatment,"" Schilsky says.
He also pushes back against the ""sweeping generalizations"" in these two studies. ""Regulatory decisions have to be made on a case by case basis and in a particular context,"" he says. But he agrees that the FDA should be more transparent about its decisions, so scientists can better understand them.
The FDA did not provide NPR with details about its decision to leave Avastin on the market for brain cancer. In a statement, an agency spokeswoman notes that the FDA weighs risk and benefits, saying, ""It has been widely accepted that benefit can be demonstrated by a number of endpoints, not just overall survival.""

"NPR Review: 'The Confessions Of Frannie Langton,' By Sara Collins : NPR",www.npr.org,Annalisa Quinn,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/725902180/frannie-langton-takes-power-over-her-own-story,"'Washington Black' Is A Soaring Tale Of Enslavement And Escape
But one thing is different: Benham's wife, Marguerite: ""Everything they say beauty is supposed to be, she was."" They begin a love affair, sweetened with opium. It is partly because of the drug that, when Frannie wakes up, bloodsoaked and confused, next to a dead Marguerite, her husband's corpse in another room, she can't be sure she didn't kill them.
At its worst, Collins' style is hampered by repetition, excess, and meaningless aphorism. At its best, it is full-hearted and visceral: ""I am guilty of this,"" Frannie writes. ""I was a woman who loved a woman ... [M]y thoughts were all of her, and coarse and lewd, disturbing as dog-barks. Oh, the shock of it. The wrongness. The dark, surprising glee. That was the beginning of all my misery and all my joy.""
The question of who killed the Benhams provides the ostensible narrative tension of the book, and the love story its heart. Neither is wholly convincing: Marguerite is hazy and bloodless, and the mystery is obscured as incest, prostitution, addiction, secret pregnancy, and other twists are added to the narrative tangle.
The true, vital energy of this book comes from its preoccupation with knowledge, science, and writing, both for their inherent values and because they are proxies for power. Nearly all the major characters write accounts of themselves, from Frannie to Langton to Marguerite to Benham. For Frannie, the language of writing and the language of emancipation go together: Before she can read, she looks longingly at letters ""small and black and sharp, like little claws."" Indecipherable, ""they seemed trapped, each one shackled to the next one.""
The true, vital energy of this book comes from its preoccupation with knowledge, science, and writing, both for their inherent values and because they are proxies for power.
The white people around her also understand knowledge's destabilizing potential: The sight of Frannie reading prompts confusion, rage, or amusement. Or they use black learning for their own ends. When a visiting botanist comes to the estate where she is enslaved in Jamaica, he interviews another slave, Phibbah. He takes her medical knowledge and publishes it in his own work; meanwhile, Phibbah is executed for practicing obeah because of that same knowledge. ""[A]ll bush medicine is obeah if they say it is,"" writes Frannie. When she sees his book in a London shop years later, she steals back the next day with a concealed pencil and scratches Phibbah's name ""on every page.""
In The Confessions of Frannie Langton , the rebellion and freedom represented by black wisdom is set against the terrible, false authority of the bogus race scientists. For the latter, Collins draws on real people: Crania , the racist treatise Langton hopes to publish, is based on a real book, Crania Americana , by Samuel George Morton. Morton, like Langton, claimed that the races were separate species, and tried to prove it with bad science.
""Langton once told me that when the English soldiers rounded up the obeah men in Jamaica, after Tacky's rebellion, they experimented on them,"" writes Frannie. ""Tied them with shackles, prodded them with electric machines and magic lanterns, gave them all manner of jolts and shocks. It must have felt like thunder going through their bones, or pops of lightening cleaving their skulls. When they could no longer stand it, they were forced to admit that the white man's magic was stronger."" The book's most deeply felt battle is over that magic. Who has knowledge, who keeps it, who spreads it, and who gets the credit. In its best moments, The Confessions of Frannie Langton is less a romance or a mystery than a counter-curse. Facebook"
Texas Secretary Of State David Whitley Resigns After Botched Voter Purge Effort : NPR,www.npr.org,Ashley Lopez,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727528998/texas-voting-chief-who-led-botched-voter-purge-resigns,"Enlarge this image Texas Secretary of State David Whitley resigned on the last day of the state Legislature's session as part of the fallout from an unsuccessful effort to remove alleged noncitizens from the state's voter rolls.

Texas Secretary of State David Whitley, who was behind the botched effort to remove alleged noncitizens from the state's voter rolls , resigned Monday as the Texas Legislature's session came to a close.
Politics Texas Officials Begin Walking Back Allegations About Noncitizen Voters Whitley, who was appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott in December, needed a two-thirds vote from the state Senate to be permanently confirmed to the position, but voting-rights groups put pressure on Texas Democrats to stop the confirmation following his voter purge efforts .
This year, Whitley's office sent local election officials a list of more than 90,000 people on the voter rolls that it suspected might not be citizens. Whitley, the state's chief elections officer, asked officials to vet the list and possibly remove those names from voter rolls.
The list was compiled by flagging the names of people who at one point told the Texas Department of Public Safety that they were not citizens and then also registered to vote within several years.
Politics After Democrats Surged In 2018, Republican-Run States Eye New Curbs On Voting Immigrant-rights groups and voting-rights groups accused the state of intentionally targeting recently naturalized citizens , who have the right to vote.
In his resignation letter, Whitley alluded to controversy around his tenure, writing, ""I built a bridge for opposing voices to engage in dialogue to improve election integrity and access.""
Under the Texas Constitution, lawmakers must confirm appointments before the legislative session officially ends. If they don't, the appointee has to immediately vacate the position, and the governor must choose someone else. That person serves in the position until lawmakers weigh in during a regular session.
Resistance from Democrats presumably held up Whitley's confirmation vote in the Texas Senate.

Whitley's voter-removal effort was halted by a federal court in February. State officials eventually settled the matter with voting-rights groups and Texas voters. The state is now prohibited from attempting a similar voter purge.

Michigan State University Names Samuel Stanley New President,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727542112/after-tumult-over-nassar-scandal-michigan-state-university-gets-a-new-president?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Michigan State University has named Samuel Stanley Jr. as its 21st president. Derrick L. Turner/MSU Derrick L. Turner/MSU Michigan State University has named Samuel Stanley Jr. as its 21st president.
Derrick L. Turner/MSU Michigan State University's board of trustees unanimously voted to name Dr. Samuel L. Stanley Jr. the 21st president of MSU during a special meeting on Tuesday morning. His term begins Aug. 1.
Stanley has been president of Stony Brook University in New York since 2009.
The appointment comes after more than a year of instability in the university's presidency. In January 2018, Lou Anna Simon resigned after serving 13 years as MSU's president. Her departure came hours after Larry Nassar, a former MSU sports doctor, was sentenced to a 40- to 175-year prison term for sexual abuse. Simon is charged with two felony and two misdemeanor counts. She is accused of lying to investigators about when she knew of Nassar's sex crimes. Her preliminary hearing started in February and will continue in June.
Former Michigan Gov. John Engler then served as interim president of MSU. In January, his tumultuous term as the school's interim president came to an end following heavy backlash to comments he made to the Detroit News regarding survivors of Nassar's abuse.
Stanley earned a bachelor's degree in biological sciences at the University of Chicago and his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1980.
Stanley subsequently spent many years researching infectious diseases. According to Stony Brook University:
A highly distinguished biomedical researcher, Dr. Stanley was one of the nation's highest recipients of support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for his research focusing on enhanced defense against emerging infectious diseases. He is an expert in the biological mechanisms that cells employ when responding to infectious agents such as parasites, bacteria and viruses — a process commonly called the inflammatory response.
Prior to joining Stony Brook University as president, Stanley was vice chancellor for research at Washington University.
Stanley is married to Ellen Li , a biomedical researcher and gastroenterologist. They have four children.
MSU's Executive Vice President for Administration Satish Udpa has been serving as MSU's acting president.
Stanley will be MSU's 21st president."
Missouri Could Soon Have No Clinics That Provide Abortions,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727323584/missouri-could-soon-become-first-state-without-a-clinic-that-performs-abortions?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Teresa Pettis (right), an abortion opponent, protests outside the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis, on May 17.

Unless a judge intervenes, health officials will force a Missouri facility to stop offering the procedure this week.
Jim Salter/AP Missouri is within days of losing its last remaining health center that provides abortions. Unless a court intervenes, it will become the first state in the nation without such a clinic.
Planned Parenthood officials say they are filing a lawsuit in state court Tuesday, asking for a restraining order to prevent its St. Louis clinic from being forced to stop offering the procedure after a state license expires Friday.
Planned Parenthood officials say they've been unable to reach an agreement with officials at the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, who want to require several doctors who perform abortions at the health center to submit to questioning as a condition of renewing the license.
""This means that more than 1.1 million women of reproductive age in Missouri will live in a state where they cannot receive the health care they need,"" Planned Parenthood President, Dr. Leana Wen, said in a statement to NPR. ""This is a world we haven't seen in nearly half a century.""
Planned Parenthood says state officials have indicated the questioning could lead to criminal proceedings or board review for those physicians, who provide the procedure at Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.
In her statement, Wen described the state's actions as ""harassment"" meant to ""intimidate"" physicians who perform abortions.
Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of State Media Campaigns for Planned Parenthood, said the situation in Missouri has been unfolding for years and is the result of what she describes as a ""weaponized inspections process.""
""This didn't happen overnight. It's been a slow drip of restriction after restriction, and we've been warning for some time that abortion access is on the line,"" Lee-Gilmore said.
The news comes just days after Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Parson, signed a law criminalizing abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy. In a statement upon signing, Parson said the abortion ban sends ""a strong signal to the nation that, in Missouri, we stand for life, protect women's health, and advocate for the unborn.""
That law makes Missouri the latest in a growing number of states to ban the procedure in the early stages of pregnancy, often before women even know they're pregnant. Doctors convicted of violating the Missouri law could face prison time. Several states have passed similar early bans in recent weeks, but none have taken effect so far. Legal challenges are underway, and federal judges in Mississippi and Kentucky have already blocked such laws.
But even without banning the procedure, restrictive health regulations can force clinics to stop offering abortions or close altogether. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, Mo., stopped performing the procedure in October 2018, after it was unable to fulfill a state requirement that doctors performing the procedure have admitting privileges at a hospital within about 15 minutes of the clinic. Planned Parenthood officials say there are some hospitals in Missouri that will perform abortions under rare circumstances, such as a medical emergency.
Missouri is now one of six states with only one remaining clinic, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.
The St. Louis clinic will continue to provide services such as birth control and health screenings, but will have to stop offering abortions unless a judge grants a restraining order. Patients seeking abortions in Missouri would then have to travel hundreds of miles, to clinics in Kansas or Illinois, Wen said.
Wen said it would be the first time in decades that an entire state would be without a health center offering abortions.
""This is a tragedy for Missouri women and doctors. And it's a disturbing preview of what anti-choice politicians are trying to implement across the country,"" Wen said.
Planned Parenthood officials say they have reached agreements with state health officials on other rules, including a requirement that physicians perform two pelvic examinations on women seeking surgical abortions.
Law Supreme Court Upholds Indiana Provision Mandating Fetal Burial Or Cremation Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an abortion provider at the St. Louis clinic, said in a statement provided by Planned Parenthood that repeat pelvic exams are ""medically unnecessary and invasive.""
""For some patients, this can even be re-traumatizing,"" McNicholas said in the statement. ""In this case, we had to weigh this against abortion access for an entire state — a nearly impossible decision and state officials know it.""
Planned Parenthood has stopped offering medication abortions in Missouri because of that requirement.
Dr. Sarah Horvath, a fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who is aware of the negotiations in Missouri, said via email that such policies ""harm the patient-physician relationship and erode patient trust.""
Asked about the state's move to question abortion providers, Horvath said the procedure is ""highly over-regulated due to stigma and politics. ... Doctors should be able to provide health care without fearing interrogation."""

Bunch, the museum's founding director, will be taking over as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in mid-June.
Astrid Riecken/Getty Images Updated at 10:47 a.m. ET
A new pilot is set to take the helm at the Smithsonian Institution.
The organization, a public-private partnership that has established and maintains many of the best-known museums in the U.S., unveiled its next secretary at a news conference Tuesday: Lonnie G. Bunch III , the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture , will take over the day-to-day administration of the Smithsonian's 19 museums, 21 libraries and the National Zoo — among other operations .
Bunch's selection, made by unanimous vote of the organization's 17-member Board of Regents , makes him the first African American to serve in the role of secretary in its 173-year history . He will take over for the outgoing secretary, David Skorton , in roughly three weeks.
Shortly after his name was announced, Bunch stepped to the lectern to reflect on just what this move means to him — and to acknowledge the ""challenges that the institution faces during the next decade.""
""But more importantly,"" he said, ""I'm excited by the potential to meet those challenges.""
Bunch represents a new leader for the Smithsonian, but in many ways he is something of an old hand. He took over the African American history museum in 2005, steering it from the early days of its inception through its 2016 opening and beyond. Before that, he worked at the National Museum of American History for over a decade.
Grand Opening: The National Museum of African American History and Culture Mission Of African-American Museum Writ Large In Its Very Design Grand Opening: The National Museum of African American History and Culture At African-American History Museum, Visitor 'Dwell Time' Is Off The Charts Yet for all his work in history, Bunch said Tuesday that he's got his eyes trained squarely on the future.
""It is important for the public to view the Smithsonian not simply as an addict of nostalgia, but as a cauldron of ideas of innovation and understanding that can be transformative for our country,"" he said at the news conference.
""To accomplish this, though, the Smithsonian must become a much more nimble entity,"" he added. ""It must be an institution that is ripe with technology, an institution better suited to serve 21st century audiences, and an institution of research, of great collections, and of wonder that helps America understand itself and its world. This will ensure that the Smithsonian will always be what it once was. It will always ensure that the Smithsonian will be a place where scholarship, creativity, education and service come together for the greater good.""
Within the Smithsonian Institution's leadership structure, the secretary is akin to a private company's CEO — the executive responsible for the umbrella organization's general vision and daily direction.
Under Skorton, a cardiologist and former president of both the University of Iowa and Cornell University , the Smithsonian weathered the federal shutdown earlier this year and opened the long-awaited National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016.
Later this summer Skorton plans to move on to the Association of American Medical Colleges, where he will become president and CEO.
""The Regents, and the Smithsonian, are fortunate to have had Secretary Skorton's leadership, vision and commitment during a crucial period when the Smithsonian is expanding its reach and focusing its research and educational efforts,"" John Roberts, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and Smithsonian chancellor, said in a statement after Skorton announced his departure late last year. ""He has laid a solid foundation for the Institution's future.""
Bunch will assume the role of secretary on June 16.

Nate Hegyi/KUER Nate Hegyi/KUER Around 50 tourists and photographers were huddled near Mesa Arch in Utah to catch a glimpse of the sunrise in early May.
Nate Hegyi/KUER The dark blue, predawn sky was just beginning to brighten over Mesa Arch — a once-hidden gem in Utah's Canyonlands National Park — as Jonathan Zhang frantically set up his camera and tripod.
The Los Angeles tourist wanted to get the perfect shot of the sun rising over deep, tan canyons and red rock spires, framed by the glowing, orange arch. But he had to squeeze through throngs of other photographers and smartphone-wielding tourists to do so, nearly 50 people total.
There was an Italian man with long, brown hair sitting next to a time-lapse camera rig. A bearded, college-aged man was FaceTiming the sunrise for his friend.
The busy scene was not how it looked when Zhang first came here a decade ago.
""There were only two or three guys,"" he said. ""But now it's like, every morning it's crowded.""
That's because Mesa Arch has joined the growing ranks of places in the United States that have become #Instafamous. The landmark first gained popularity in 2010 after Microsoft used a picture of the sunrise there as one of its default backgrounds for its Windows 7 operating system.

The sandstone formation has since caught on in social media circles and has been tagged on Instagram more than 25,000 times.
But the growing crowds at Mesa Arch aren't an isolated phenomenon. All across the country, more people are flocking to national parks and public lands with smartphones in their hands.
Horseshoe Bend in Arizona, for example, was once a sleepy, locals-only pitstop on the side of a highway until someone took a beautiful photo of the Colorado River there and posted it on Instagram.

Now around 2,800 people visit the landmark every day , according to data from the National Park Service. Across that agency's eight-state intermountain region, visitation to national parks and recreation areas has increased by 37% since Instagram was first founded in 2010.
But is social media solely to blame for the big crowds at national parks and public lands? The evidence is anecdotal.
National 'Lingering Fields Of Yellow' As California's Super Bloom Begins To Fade ""There hasn't been a study done yet that's been published that's been able to show a direct cause and effect,"" said Ashley D'Antonio, a recreation ecologist and associate professor at Oregon State University.
A strong U.S. economy and low gas prices are more probable drivers for increased visitation than social media, according to D'Antonio, though she acknowledged that many of these new tourists are sharing photos on Instagram and Facebook. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, she argued.
The National Park Service and other groups, for example, have been using social media to try and diversify the kinds of visitors who travel to places like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.
""Most of the visitors to our parks and protected areas are upper middle class, white and slightly older,"" D'Antonio said. ""There's been a lot of groups that use social media to get more people of color, or people that aren't traditionally seen in our protected areas, out promoting and saying that this is a space for you, too.""
Still, growing crowds of smartphone-toting tourists means long lines, traffic jams and, in rare cases, even injuries and fatalities.
In 2018, a California woman fell to her death at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan while trying to take a selfie. Similar incidents have happened at Grand Canyon and Yosemite national parks. At Yellowstone National Park, a woman was gored by a bison while attempting to get a selfie with the animal in 2015.
Park officials there have now instituted a voluntary safety pledge visitors can take that includes a warning on selfies.
""No picture is worth hurting yourself, others, or the park,"" the pledge states. ""Be aware of your surroundings, whether near wildlife, thermal areas, roads or steep cliffs.""
No one has fallen to their death at Mesa Arch yet. But as the landmark has become more popular with the selfie-taking crowd, tensions are brewing between tourists and serious photographers such as Drew Armstrong and his two friends. They watched as a young woman struck a yoga pose in front of the arch.
""It's frustrating when they want to get a shot with their Lululemon pants because they're wearing Lululemon pants,"" Armstrong said. ""I want them to be here and say, 'You know, this is important. This needs to be protected.' ""
Armstrong and his two friends believe that, in the rush to take selfies and post them, people are missing out on what makes national parks and public lands so amazing in the first place.
""Solitude, peaceful moments and nature,"" said Neale Zingle, Armstrong's friend. ""We're so focused on saying, 'We were there.' So focused on having that information that people think you can capture on a snapshot. But you can't do that. You have to take the time to experience it. It's sort of an old-fashioned approach. But there's no shortcut.""
Zingle and his friends have been taking photographs around Canyonlands National Park for the past three decades. This new breed of ""selfie tourist"" appeared to get under their skin. But it didn't seem to bother Zhang, the Los Angeles photographer, too much. He was finishing a time-lapse of the sunrise over Mesa Arch.
""I think it's getting crowded,"" he said. ""But you can't really prevent people from coming. It's public land. They have a right to see these things, too.""
As the sun climbed above the arch and the day became warmer, the big crowds aiming to get their perfect shot began to dwindle. Eventually no one was left. The Instagram moment was over — at least until the next sunrise.

From Snakebites To Kissing Bugs: Surprising Moments At The WHO Assembly : Goats and Soda : NPR,www.npr.org,Brian Simpson,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/05/28/727513989/snakebites-and-kissing-bugs-among-surprise-items-on-world-health-agenda,"Enlarge this image The black mamba is a large venomous snake found in Africa.

suebg1 photography/Getty Images Staid and steeped in parliamentary rules, the annual World Health Assembly is a mostly predictable exercise. Delegates from 194 member states of the World Health Organization gather each May to plod through a lengthy agenda and haggle over policies and priorities for the WHO's upcoming year. A few decisions are momentous, most mundane.
Yet the May gathering always yields some surprises. This year's meeting, which ended Tuesday, was no exception. From royalty to kissing bugs and sexual rights to snakebites, the 72nd World Health Assembly offered some unexpected moments and decisions.
Fireworks Over The Cost Of Medicines
Intense marathon debates broke out at the Assembly over revealing the true costs of medicines. Italy proposed a resolution calling for public reporting of the research and development costs of pharmaceutical companies. Knowing how much it costs to develop a given medicine would give countries leverage in price negotiations. WHA watchers were surprised to see Germany isolated in seeking to block transparency, aligned with the U.K. and Hungary but not with normal allies on such issues like France and the U.S. In fact, the U.S., normally a supporter of Big Pharma on the international stage, leaned more on the side of Italy. A last-minute, weakened version of the resolution was finally approved on Tuesday.
Snakebite Fast Track
While the words ""WHO"" and ""speed"" rarely seem to go together, the organization achieved what may be a personal best by officially launching its new global snakebite strategy on May 23 — just a year after a World Health Assembly resolution urged action on the issue. WHO's quick response is needed given that an estimated 5.4 million people are bitten each year and up to 138,000 people die, according to WHO . The strategy seeks to cut snakebite deaths and disability by 50% by 2030.
Goats and Soda Why A Snakebite Victim In An Indian Village Won't Walk Through A Door Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights
As expected, U.S. representatives moved to eliminate any reference to sexual and reproductive health and rights from a resolution on universal health coverage. (It appears to be part of a Trump administration effort to remove language around sexual health from U.N. resolutions, according to documents obtained by Foreign Policy .) What wasn't expected was a surge in pushback against the U.S. Led by Sweden, 43 countries from Europe, Latin America and Asia asserted that sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential to universal health coverage (which is the main focus of this year's WHA), according to Health Policy Watch . Discussions on the resolution are expected to continue through July in advance of a U.N. high-level meeting on universal health coverage in September.
A Royal Guest
Just before a May 22 meeting on mental health began, more than 200 attendees suddenly began scooting back their chairs so they could stand. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had arrived, but he usually doesn't receive that kind of welcome.
The reason for the mass respect? Her Majesty Mathilde, Queen of the Belgians, was in the house. The royal advocate for mental health told attendees that the issue has not been prioritized on the global agenda. ""This means care is far too modest,"" Queen Mathilde said. ""Care for mental health must be mainstreamed.""
Chagas Disease Finally Has Its Day
More than a century after its discovery, the lethal, kissing-bug-transmitted disease known as Chagas finally got some recognition. WHA member states voted to officially establish April 14 as World Chagas Day . Chagas kills up to 10,000 people annually, primarily in Latin America, according to WHO . Trypanosoma cruzi parasites, transmitted by blood-sucking triatomine bugs, can ultimately cause cardiac arrhythmias or progressive heart failure that kills victims. The current Chagas strategy emphasizes better surveillance of the disease and increasing access to treatments.
Goats and Soda Kissing Bug Disease: Latin America's Silent Killer Makes U.S. Headlines Stars On The Streets
On May 19 attendees proved they can do more than just talk about health. WHO sponsored a ""Walk the Talk"" event the day before the assembly began. The event sent an estimated 1,000 participants to walk or run the streets of Geneva ostensibly to promote WHO's health agenda and celebrate ""healthy lifestyles."" But it was also an occasion for world health celebrity watching: Joining Tedros for the event was Lady Gaga's mom Cynthia Germanotta, who has just been named a WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Mental Health; Nigerian singer Korede Bello; and Kenya's First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, who drew attention to WHO's goals by stating ""physical activity has always been the lifelong secret to healthy lives and longevity for the people and communities around the world"" but also garnered attention for her track suit, emblazoned with ""FLOKE"" — First Lady of Kenya.

Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images The Louvre was shuttered on Monday, leaving hordes of tourists outside amid its famous glass pyramids. The reason? The Paris museum's security and reception staff were on strike, protesting ""unprecedented deterioration of conditions"" amid record crowds.
The museum, located in a former royal palace on the city's Right Bank, attracted a record 10.2 million visitors last year – a 25% increase over the year before. ""No other museum in the world has ever equaled this figure,"" the museum trumpeted in January.
But workers say both visitors and staff are suffering from such massive popularity.
""The Louvre is suffocating,"" the Sud Culture Solidaires Union said in a statement Sunday. ""While the public has increased by more than 20% since 2009, the palace has not grown. ... Today the situation is untenable.""
⚠ Museum closed today ⚠
Due to a recent increase in visitor numbers, members of the Musée du Louvre’s Reception and Security staff are exercising their right to strike. The museum will therefore remain closed all day today (May 27, 2019).
— Musée du Louvre (@MuseeLouvre) May 27, 2019 Amid rising crowds from 2009 to 2018, staff headcount declined in that period from 2,161 to 2,005, according to the union.
American visitors to the museum on Monday posted photos of the disappointed queues outside. ""Well this is great,"" tweeted one Californian. ""Glad I got to the Louvre early.""

— Ariel Ferrer (@arielferrer1) May 27, 2019 The museum is offering refunds to those who bought tickets for the day.
The union cites several problems it says are caused by overcrowded conditions at the museum: an aggressive and impatient public, jostling crowds and inadequate emergency evacuation measures.
""What to say about visiting conditions when people are confronted with noise, trampling, crowds, extreme fatigue and the total inadequacy of museum facilities at such a high volume of visitors?"" the union said in the statement. ""The Louvre does not have the means of its ambitions.""
The Louvre is closed today, as it is customarily on Tuesdays. A notice on its website said the museum would open late on Wednesday after ""a general meeting attended by members of the Musée du Louvre's Reception and Security staff."" It warned that large numbers of visitors are expected in the coming days, and recommended buying tickets online.
Pierre Zinenberg, a Louvre employee and union representative, told the Associated Press that the outcome of Wednesday's meeting would determine whether the museum would re-open that day, or whether the strike would continue.

Nitrous Oxide During Labor Can Be Costly : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Lauren Weber,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/28/726572880/bill-of-the-month-4-836-charge-for-laughing-gas-during-childbirth-is-no-joke,"Enlarge this image Karli-Rae and Christopher Kerrschneider play with their kids, Eleanor and Leviathan, in their front yard in Baldwin, Wis.

Ackerman + Gruber for Kaiser Health News Nurse midwife Karli-Rae Kerrschneider wanted the same supportive birth experience she promises her own patients — and that included the use of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, to dull her discomfort.
The delivery of the gas during labor has come back in vogue in the U.S. in the past few years as a less invasive alternative to an epidural administered by an anesthesiologist.
With a tank in the hospital room, a woman in labor can take breaths of the gas as she needs it.
""Nitrous doesn't take away the pain so much as make you not care about it,"" Kerrschneider said, noting its mild euphoric effect.
Kerrschneider had an epidural for the birth of her daughter in 2016 and didn't like being immobilized and confined to her bed during labor. For the birth of her son last December, she opted for nitrous oxide at Hudson Hospital in Hudson, Wis.
The labor was long — 11 hours — but it went just as she'd hoped, with no complications and great care from a nurse midwife and doula. Being able to take puffs of nitrous was empowering and ""took the edge off"" as she moved around and spent time in the bathtub during her contractions. She estimated she breathed in the nitrous 10 to 15 times an hour in active labor.

Courtesy of Kara Jo Prestrud, Birth Made Beautiful She and her husband, Christopher, welcomed their son, Leviathan, on Dec. 19.
""It was amazing,"" she said. ""I would do it all over again.""
Then the bill came.
Patient: Karli-Rae Kerrschneider, 32, a certified nurse midwife who lives with her husband and two children in Baldwin, Wis. She has insurance through Medica, which her job at Western Wisconsin Health provides.
Total bill: $11,890 for the hospital stay, including $4,836 for the nitrous oxide.
Service provider: Hudson Hospital, a 25-bed critical access hospital in Hudson, Wis. It's part of HealthPartners, a nonprofit regional health system and insurer based in Bloomington, Minn.
Medical service: Kerrschneider had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery attended by a nurse midwife and a doula. Her water delivery was followed by a two-day hospital stay for her and her newborn. Her only pain relief during her labor was the nitrous oxide.
What gives: As hospitals have adopted billing practices common in other businesses, more and more of their services are billed by the minute — for example the time a patient spends lying in the recovery room after surgery, the time a cancer patient spends receiving a drug infusion or the time a patient is hooked up to heart monitoring.
May2019botm (PDF)
May2019botm (Text) Kerrschneider was charged for 39 units of nitrous oxide, or about $124 for every 15 minutes the tank was in her room after a nurse showed her how to use the gas. The billing for nitrous continued whether or not she was using it. After almost 10 hours, the charges amounted to $4,836.
""I think it's ridiculous that they charged so much,"" she said, pointing out that she didn't even have IV pain relief. ""I can buy my own machine for that.""

Lisa Poole/AP As colleges and universities across the country report an explosion of mental health problems, a new book argues that college life may be more stressful than ever. Dr. Anthony Rostain, co-author of The Stressed Years of Their Lives, notes that today's college students are experiencing an ""inordinate amount of anxiety"" — much of it centered on ""surviving college and doing well.""
""What we're seeing now are growing numbers of students coming [onto] campus who are already being treated for mental illness, or who are on various medications and who really have learned to manage their illnesses at home,"" he says, ""but suddenly they're on their own and sometimes they're not following through [with] their own recommended treatments.""
Rostain is a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and the former chair of the school's Task Force on Student Psychological Health and Welfare. His co-author, B. Janet Hibbs, is a family and couples psychotherapist whose son took a medical leave of absence during his first college spring break to deal with anxiety and depression. Hibbs faced a difficult set of choices: she wanted to best parent her son as he struggled, but she also wanted his life to stay on track.
NPR Ed So We Know Students Are Stressed Out ... Now Let's Talk About It ""One of the reasons we wrote this book is not to scare parents, but to help them know what they can do to help,"" she says.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Interview highlights On why current college students are more stressed than previous generations
Rostain : We think that the culture has changed in the last 30, 40 years, and that these students are growing up in the post-9/11 era, that they've been exposed to a lot of trauma, both in the media and also in their lives. ... School shootings, the rise in the uncertainty from globalization and the economic uncertainties, and of course the economic recession of 2008. Our students today were young then, and the anxiety, we think, really had an impact on their families, as well as on what they could glean from the news. And, of course, being in this 24/7 news cycle as well as the Internet itself, has really created a different childhood.
Hibbs: Parents are scared that there's only one path, a linear path, to the good life, and so for some parents who are affluent enough, that means the brand-name college, or the top prep that you can get. For other parents, it's just a lot of pressure on the kids, ""You have to do well. You can't make a mistake or your chances will be ruined."" So we see especially very smart kids, which some researchers call brainiacs, they have what we call ""destructive perfectionism""; they cannot tolerate not excelling at everything. And no one typically excels at everything. We all have, you know, times when we both make mistakes or fail. And kids don't have as much practice at that today, because they're protected from having those experiences, and also it freaks their parents out, which makes then the kids feel more responsible.
Shots - Health News The Perils Of Pushing Kids Too Hard, And How Parents Can Learn To Back Off On how high tuition is contributing to stress
Rostain: Students come to school nowadays very conscious of that ... and that adds to their burden of worry about doing well and especially about anything going wrong. I mean, we can also talk, I think, about the preparation for school — that many of them have been over-parented and also over-prepared, in terms of taking tons of AP classes and really packing their CVs with all kinds of activities. And we worry that there is not enough downtime ... [to do things that are] not going to necessarily always result in a grade or in someone noticing them.
On why some students have trouble adjusting to college
Hibbs: I think most kids are still really happy to leave home. They want to be in the life of the pseudo-adult. But what they're unprepared for are what I would call ... the ""expectable challenges"" that college poses — in terms of the requirement for more independence, more ownership of your hours, whether it's sleep, saying no to partying, managing yourself, basically.
Rostain: There's a certain amount of inevitable anxiety about the transition. ... But it's the response that they're having to that uncertainty that we've noticed students have a lot less resilience or preparation [for]. So that's part of what we're trying to do in this book is really talk about readiness — social-emotional readiness.
There's no question people are academically prepared. They're learning an incredible amount nowadays in school. They're learning amazing kinds of things, and the Internet has opened up knowledge that was never as available. But it's also created distractions and a lot of pressure socially and, more importantly, I think, when people get to college, maybe not enough time has been spent in high school — both in the curricular side and with the family — in what we call social-emotional readiness, or maturity.
On the cost of pushing kids too hard
Rostain : We're giving our kids everything we have and we care about them, but at the same time, what's the message? It's, ""Oh you need to succeed or else we're going to really get upset,"" as opposed to, ""Life is curvy, and there are moments of ups and downs."" I think if the message from a parent to a kid is, ""You may not know, but we expect that you'll be able to figure it out. Let's see what happens,"" [that] is different than saying, ""You better do this. You better know that. You better not mess up."" ... We want parents to deal with their own anxiety and then [be] able to let go in a way [that] more feels more natural. It's OK to not know.
On why most students don't use counseling services
Rostain: There are some startling surveys that show that among students who endorse suicidal ideation, suicidal thoughts on a regular basis, only about one in four go for help. The other three out of four say things like, ""Well, I can handle this myself,"" or ""It's not probably not that bad,"" or, ""I don't have time."" And wishing that eventually it'll just go away on its own like a bad cold.
Now, it may be true that for some students, they're able to plow through and avoid disaster. But what ... I have seen too often is [students] waiting too long to acknowledge and in a way staying in that state of denial. Not because you're deliberately doing so, but because you really don't want to have to face maybe having to take care of this. Or even worse, maybe having to leave school because you just can't function. You're so much a part of a community when you're in college. ... The thought that, ""Gee, I can't function anymore and I may need to take a break"" — that's a hard pill to swallow, so to speak.
On how parents can help their college-age children deal with anxiety
Rostain: I think growing up is a complicated process, and we all have to recognize that we're all still going through changes. So parents have to adapt to the idea of their child growing up and of letting go. And if they're anxious about it, [parents should] try to figure out why and to be more mindful about their reactions, and to try to be less reactive and more responsive when things are not going as hoped for.
Don't be afraid of getting help from mental health professionals. We're here to work with you and with your kids and we're not here to blame you or to condemn you.
Anthony Rostain
It's fine [if] your kid goes off to school and they're successful. Everybody feels good. But what if there's a setback? What if things don't go as planned? How do you prepare yourself for that? By simply reminding yourself that there is no straight line through life. ... Time off may help. Sometimes it's better to just take a step back. Get your game back to where you want it to be. ... Don't be afraid of getting help from mental health professionals. We're here to work with you and with your kids and we're not here to blame you or to condemn you. So many parents face this fear of the shame or the embarrassment or the stigma, and what we think is the most deadly thing of all is not the mental illness, but the stigma around it that leads people to avoid getting the help in time.

MacKenzie Bezos Pledges To Give More Than Half Of Her Billions To Charity : NPR,www.npr.org,Bill Chappell,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727612204/mackenzie-bezos-pledges-to-give-more-than-half-of-her-billions-to-charity,"Enlarge this image MacKenzie Bezos, one of the wealthiest women in the world, says she'll give at least half her fortune to charity.

toggle caption Jörg Carstensen/picture alliance via Getty Image MacKenzie Bezos, one of the wealthiest women in the world, says she'll give at least half her fortune to charity. She's seen here in April 2018 with her now-former husband, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Jörg Carstensen/picture alliance via Getty Image MacKenzie Bezos, who received more than $35 billion in her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has signed the Giving Pledge, making a commitment to give more than half her fortune to charity or philanthropic causes.
""We each come by the gifts we have to offer by an infinite series of influences and lucky breaks we can never fully understand,"" Bezos wrote in a letter announcing her pledge . ""In addition to whatever assets life has nurtured in me, I have a disproportionate amount of money to share.""
As one of the wealthiest women in the world — and the ex-wife of a billionaire who has not signed the Giving Pledge — Bezos is the most prominent name on the list of new signatories to the pledge.
Jeff Bezos celebrated the news, saying via Twitter , ""MacKenzie is going to be amazing and thoughtful and effective at philanthropy, and I'm proud of her.""
Discussing her pledge, MacKenzie Bezos, a novelist, quoted from Annie Dillard's The Writing Life:
""Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book... The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now. Something more will arise for later, something better... Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.""
By signing the Giving Pledge, wealthy benefactors promise to give away more than half their assets, either during their life or after their death. The group does not require donors to name the organizations or causes they plan to support with the bulk of their fortunes.
Bezos said she will give careful thought to how she distributes the money. And in what may be a sign that she intends to far exceed the pledge's requirement of giving away more than half her money, she added, ""It will take time and effort and care. But I won't wait.

In the past, Bezos has backed several social and charity initiatives, from funding research into cancer and Alzheimer's disease to pushing for marriage equality. And she's currently the executive director of the Bystander Revolution, an anti-bullying group she founded in 2013.
In late 2018, Bezos and her then-husband announced they would spend $2 billion to support homeless families. And they gave millions to TheDream.US, which offers college scholarships for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors.
National Jeff Bezos Says 'National Enquirer' Tried To Blackmail Him Over Personal Photos The Giving Pledge was started in 2010 by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. And while it has been praised as giving very public inspiration to anyone who wants to help others, the pledge has also been criticized for lacking a legal enforcement tool.
Those who sign the Giving Pledge make ""a moral commitment to give more than half of their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes,"" according to the Giving Pledge's website. And while the wealthy donors use the group to share ideas about how to use their money effectively, their funds are not pooled for a common goal.
Complicating matters further, many wealthy signatories of the pledge create family trusts and charitable foundations — steps that, while having the potential to spread their wealth around, can also make it hard to define when their personal pledge has been fulfilled.
More than 200 wealthy philanthropists have now committed to the Giving Pledge, the group announced Tuesday . Other notable new pledges include Pinterest co-founder Paul Sciarra and his wife, Jennifer; WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton and his wife, Tegan; and Ryan D. ""Jume"" Jumonville, owner of the health care company United Networks of America.
This year's pledge class also includes Stewart and Sandy Bainum, whose fortune derives in part from Stewart Bainum's longtime leadership roles at Choice Hotels International and Artis Senior Living.
Announcing their pledge, the Bainums wrote:
""Historically we've preferred to quietly allocate our philanthropic capital. But we believe that joining 'The Giving Pledge' might motivate others to as well. We are especially proud that this pledge also expresses the wishes of our two sons, who share the belief that one's highest calling is to make a difference in the lives of others.""

Courtesy of the Bloomstein Family NPR and ProPublica teamed up for a six-month long investigation on maternal mortality in the U.S . Among our key findings:
More American women are dying of pregnancy-related complications than any other developed country. Only in the U.S. has the rate of women who die been rising. There's a hodgepodge of hospital protocols for dealing with potentially fatal complications, allowing for treatable complications to become lethal. Hospitals — including those with intensive care units for newborns — can be woefully unprepared for a maternal emergency. Federal and state funding show only 6 percent of block grants for ""maternal and child health"" actually go to the health of mothers. In the U.S, some doctors entering the growing specialty of maternal-fetal medicine were able to complete that training without ever spending time in a labor-delivery unit.

"Stressed At Work? Burnout Is A Serious Problem, Says World Health Organization : Shots - Health News : NPR",www.npr.org,Rhitu Chatterjee,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/28/727637944/who-redefines-burnout-as-a-syndrome-linked-to-chronic-stress-at-work,"Enlarge this image Chronic stress at work can lead to burnout, a syndrome defined by the World Health Organization as including depleted energy, exhaustion, negativity, cynicism and reduced productivity. baona/Getty Images hide caption

baona/Getty Images Updated 7:55 p.m. ET
The World Health Organization is bringing attention to the problem of work-related stress. The group announced this week that it is updating its definition of burnout in the new version of its handbook of diseases, the International Classification of Diseases — ICD-11 — which will go into effect in January 2022
The new definition calls it a ""syndrome"" and specifically ties burnout to ""chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.""
Despite earlier reports to the contrary, WHO does not classify the problem as a medical condition. It calls burnout an ""occupational phenomenon"" and includes it in a chapter on ""factors influencing health status or contact with health services.""
According to WHO, burnout is characterized by ""feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced professional efficacy.""
Burnout was also included in the previous version of WHO's disease handbook, the ICD-10, in the same category as it now appears. But it was defined simply as a ""state of vital exhaustion,"" Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for WHO, wrote in an email.
The earlier definition ""was kind of this weird in-between 'you're not really sick, but you're not fully capable of doing your work,' "" says Torsten Voigt , a sociologist at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, who published a review of existing studies on burnout in 2017.
Shots - Health News Doctors Today May Be Miserable, But Are They 'Burnt Out'? Shots - Health News Does Taking Time For Compassion Make Doctors Better At Their Jobs? The new definition is now more detailed, he says, and while it's not a major change, it gives people who suffer burnout more legitimacy.
""People who feel burnout are finally fully recognized as having a severe issue,"" he says. The new definition may be a step toward making it easier for people to get help, at least in some European countries, where health professionals rely on the ICD, he says.
Bringing more clarity to the definition of burnout is important, says Elaine Cheung, a professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""There needs to be greater critical discussion on how we can more precisely measure and define this condition,"" she said in a statement.
She also told NPR that she welcomes the WHO's new definition because it might raise awareness of the problem of burnout not only among health care workers but also individuals and employers.
""I think a lot of people have a lay definition of what burnout may be,"" she says. ""But I think by highlighting the specific facets of burnout ... my hope is that it might create greater awareness.""
Cheung says many studies show that certain aspects of workplace culture can increase risk of burnout.
She says employers have a big role in addressing burnout by paying attention to whether employees have a sense of community at work, strong social relationships, a collegial environment, a workload that's not too burdensome, a sense of agency at work, and a healthy work-life balance.
The new WHO definition also requires that to diagnose burnout, mental health professionals have to rule out anxiety, mood disorders and other stress-related disorders.
Cheung thinks that's important. ""Burnout is different from depression in that it is tied specifically to our work and our relationship with our work,"" she says.
Cheung says that understanding this distinction could lead to more targeted research into how to prevent and treat the problem.
WHO also announced it plans to begin developing evidence-based guidelines on mental well-being in the workplace.

In her foreword to America Is in the Heart — Carlos Bulosan's classic 1946 novel about Filipinx and Mexican migrant workers on the West Coast — the Filipina American novelist Elaine Castillo asks readers, ""Do you remember how old you were when you first read a book that had a character who looked and lived like you in it?""

Amazon Independent Booksellers As a white reader, my answer to Castillo's question is most assuredly different than that of readers of color — I can't share the thrill of discovering people who look like me in the pages of Bulosan's gorgeous and brutal autobiographical novel, nor in the other three mid-century Asian American novels that Penguin Classics has just reprinted.
But I can experience a different kind of thrill: that of being blown away by the work of some of these writers and understanding America better through the fierce love and disappointment that courses through their pages.
Bulosan is the best known novelist of the four — his book, America Is in the Heart, has long been celebrated as the Filipinx counterpart to John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath . Bulosan's first-person narrator here is beaten up and dismissed as a ""googoo"" and ""brown monkey"" as he tries to organize fellow workers and rides boxcars up and down the West Coast, looking for subsistence jobs in kitchens, laundries and out on farm fields. Yet, the novel ends with the narrator's affirmation that ""no man — no one at all — could destroy my faith in America"" — a reassurance that no doubt boosted the novel's eventual wide acceptance onto the college curricula.

Amazon Independent Booksellers ""Wide acceptance"" aren't the words you'd think of in connection with the work of Chinese American writer H.T. Tsiang. His novel, The Hanging on Union Square , was rejected by virtually every publisher in America, prompting him to self-publish in 1935.
I can sympathize with those flummoxed publishers. This book, like much of Gertrude Stein's work, is more fun to talk about than to read. It follows an everyman hero named, ""Mr. Nut,"" over the course of a single night in New York as he wanders into Communist cafeterias, Bowery flop houses and a violent confrontation with a capitalist named ""Mr. System"" in Union Square.
Forget Mr. Nut; Tsiang's own life story sounds like it would make a fabulous novel or film. He was born in poverty in Shanghai, became a secretary to Chinese President Sun Yat-sen and eventually wound up working as an actor in Hollywood, known for performing an ""R-rated, one-man, one-hour adaptation of Hamlet every Friday night ... for a dozen years."" Tsiang nestles comfortably into the ""American Oddball"" creative tradition.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Korean-American novelist Younghill Kang didn't need to self-publish: He was taken on by Maxwell Perkins, the legendary Scribner's editor who counted Fitzgerald and Hemingway among his authors. Kang's 1937 novel, East Goes West , is a coming-to-America odyssey that charts the wanderings of its hero, Chungpa Han, as he flees Japanese-occupied Korea for America. Kang is distinguished by his stylistic gusto. Here, for instance, is his rendering of that iconic immigrant moment — Chungpa Han's first sighting of the skyline of Manhattan:
A city of Babel towers, casually, easily strewn end up against the skies—they stood at the brink, close crowded, the brink of America, these Giantesses, these Fates, ... No earth clung to their skirts. ... [T]hey spurned the earth. And there was no monument to the Machine Age like America.
No-No Boy by John Okada

Amazon Independent Booksellers I saved for last the novel that, for me, is the greatest discovery: John Okada's 1957 book, ­ No-No Boy . Okada was a second-generation Japanese American — a nisei — who served in World War II. His brilliant noir-ish novel dives deep into the fractures in the Japanese American community after the war. Some nisei men, in protest of the forced internment of Japanese Americans, refused to serve in the military and or to pledge allegiance to the U.S. They became known as ""no-no boys""; after the war, their community turned away from them, just as it later turned away from Okada's truth-telling novel.
No-No Boy is filled with charged moments and observations: Japanese-American men nervously wearing ""I am Chinese buttons""; the crucial difference of an apostrophe that turns the Japanese name, ""Ohara"" into the Irish, O'Hara; and the constant refrain of ""Go back to Tokyo, boy"" that our main character, a young man named Ichiro, hears on the streets of Seattle.
No-No Boy is spectacular and troubling and topical. Castillo said of America Is in the Heart, ""To not read it is, to put it simply, not to know America."" Certainly the same can be said of most, if not all, of these classic Asian American novels.

One of the most iconic things about HBO's Veep was the way the characters insulted one another. Each insult was delivered with laser-like precision to get at each character's insecurities. Perhaps no character on the show received more of these zingers than Jonah Ryan. He was an unlikable White House aide who went on to become one of New Hampshire's least popular members of Congress.

Veep starred Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Selina Meyer. A narcissistic politician who, despite constantly sabotaging herself, manages to ascend to the Oval Office.
Only to lose it almost as quickly.
Jonah, Simons' character, starts the show as a lowly staffer in the West Wing. By the final season, he's a presidential candidate facing off against Selina. It's a wild and funny ride.
Simons talks with Bullseye about his unique, fascinating journey to Veep . He dreamed of being a film and TV actor since he started out in Chicago. He and his wife had only been married a short time before they dropped everything and left the Windy City for Los Angeles. At the time it was a big risk. He didn't have a gig lined up. He had never even been to California. The first time he saw LA was on his drive in from the long haul. It was a tough transition, but soon after he landed the part as Jonah. When he went into auditionhe did not look the part at all. The casting directors were looking for someone short, bearded and kind of chubby. Simons, who's slender and tall, gave the writers something different to work with. But it worked.
Simons explains why thick skin doesn't always protect you from fictional insults. Plus, how being a dad has impacted his acting career and knowledge of elementary school handball. Facebook"
How Johnson & Johnson Ended Up At The Center Of A Trial In The Opioid Crisis : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666310/how-johnson-johnson-ended-up-at-the-center-of-a-trial-in-the-opioid-crisis,"NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Wall Street Journal reporter Sara Randazzo about how Johnson & Johnson ended up at the center of the first big trial in the opioid crisis, which opened Tuesday.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Let's dig deeper now into Johnson & Johnson's role here and try to understand what is at stake for the company. To help us do that, we have called Sara Randazzo. She's covering the trial for The Wall Street Journal, and she joins us from outside the courthouse there in Norman, Okla. Sara, welcome.
SARA RANDAZZO: Thanks for having me.
KELLY: Is there an irony here that this is the first big trial in the opioid crisis and it involves not Purdue Pharma, the company that we've all heard so much about, that's made the most headlines and which makes OxyContin, but instead Johnson & Johnson?
RANDAZZO: Yes, it's certainly a weird dynamic, and that has taken the bite a little bit out of this opening trial. Purdue is obviously the big villain, if you can call them that, in these cases. And with them settled out, we're instead learning a lot more about Johnson & Johnson and the opioids they make, which frankly haven't gotten much attention up to this point.
KELLY: Right. We should mention that Purdue Pharma agreed back in March to pay - I think it was 270 million and settle claims and avoid having to go to a trial like the one you've been sitting in on today.
RANDAZZO: Correct.
KELLY: So to focus on Johnson & Johnson's role, I wasn't even aware that they manufactured opioid painkillers. What are the products under scrutiny at this trial?
RANDAZZO: Yeah, so it's interesting. There's actually two separate businesses that they're looking at from the company. The first is that they actually owned two businesses that they sold by 2016 that processed Tasmanian poppies into narcotic raw materials. And then they also had a company that turned those into active pharmaceutical ingredients that they used, I believe, for their own drugs as well as other companies.
So the state says that through that, they essentially had a role in all opioids that were hitting the market. But then separately they also have two of their own products. One is a fentanyl patch called Duragesic that they launched in 1991. And they still make it, but they don't actively market it. And the second is called Nucynta, and they had a few versions of that, and they sold their interest in it by 2015.
KELLY: As we just heard, the case that Oklahoma is making is a public nuisance case. How unusual is that as the legal strategy to sue a major pharmaceutical company?
RANDAZZO: It's fairly unusual. Public nuisance has been used in many other contexts with mixed results. But the state said earlier today that just because it hasn't been used in a case like this before doesn't mean that it can't be used now. So they're already trying to preempt the company's arguments that will say this is not the use of public nuisance; it's used more for, you know, an overgrown shrub or a loud neighbor that is causing a nuisance and making it, you know, so that your property is less valuable and that kind of thing. So it's definitely a unique and novel approach, and it will be interesting to see what kind of case law might come of this.
KELLY: And how exactly Johnson & Johnson attorneys go about trying to counter this case in court - but what is at stake for Johnson & Johnson in this trial?
RANDAZZO: Yeah, so Johnson & Johnson faces quite a few litigation matters over various drugs and products of theirs. So this kind of territory is nothing new for them but somewhat robust set of lawsuits that they're challenging.
KELLY: So this case, as we've said, is the first of a couple thousand of lawsuits that various jurisdictions have brought against pharmaceutical companies. To what extent do you expect whatever happens there in Norman, Okla., to set precedent and set the tone for litigation to come?
RANDAZZO: Nothing would be legally binding in terms of this one judge, and Oklahoma's decision wouldn't have to be followed by other courts but, certainly in a broader sense, will be closely watched. And if they lose here, it will certainly bolster plaintiffs around the country who are suing that say, great, there's one win on our side, and, you know, we can hopefully win our cases, too.
If the company succeeds, I feel like that will then give a lot of weight to the drug makers who say, OK, maybe we should fight these things and not settle because there's a chance. And so it definitely will be used a bit as a bellwether even though in other ways it's very much one state, one particular set of claims, you know, one company, whereas around the country, there's so many other companies and factors involved in these other lawsuits.
KELLY: Sara Randazzo - she is legal reporter for The Wall Street Journal, and we just reached her outside the courthouse in Norman, Okla. Sara, thank you.
RANDAZZO: Thank you so much.

Opioid Epidemic Trial Against Johnson & Johnson Begins In Oklahoma : NPR,www.npr.org,Jackie Fortier,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666303/opioid-epidemic-trial-against-johnson-johnson-begins-in-oklahoma,"The first major trial against an opioid manufacturer began Tuesday in Oklahoma. The state is suing Johnson & Johnson for money to help treat addiction, arguing the epidemic became a public nuisance.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
The first major trial in the opioid crisis began today in a courtroom in Oklahoma. The defendant is not Purdue Pharma, the company behind the painkiller OxyContin. It has settled with Oklahoma, as has another drug manufacturer, Teva. Both companies have agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to the state to fund addiction treatment. But the trial is continuing with Johnson & Johnson left as the sole defendant.
We begin our coverage with Jackie Fortier of StateImpact Oklahoma. She is at the courthouse. Hey there, Jackie.
JACKIE FORTIER, BYLINE: Hey.
KELLY: So set the scene for me. What is the case that Oklahoma is making here?
FORTIER: Well, today lawyers for Oklahoma made their opening statements, and they're laying out their case not for a jury because this is a bench trial but for the judge. Oklahoma State Attorney General Mike Hunter said that the flood of opioid medications into the state was a, quote, ""manmade public health crisis.""
So in other words, you know, the marketing of these painkillers was too aggressive, they say. The patients became, you know, dependent and addicted, and that led to diversion and more addiction. Some people took up street drugs like heroin and fentanyl, and people died. The state is grappling of course with the costs of addiction, and they're arguing that Johnson & Johnson created a public nuisance.
KELLY: A public nuisance - and walk me through the legal reasoning here.
FORTIER: Well, one of the attorneys for the state, Brad Beckworth, introduced a sort of slogan this morning, and he kept repeating it for the judge. Here it is.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BRAD BECKWORTH: If you over-supply, people will die.
FORTIER: It's a little bit off-mic, but he's saying, if you over-supply, people will die. And what he's arguing is that Johnson & Johnson created an oversupply, that their drug reps, you know, pushed opioids into the state, encouraged doctors to prescribe them and that that led to addiction, overdose and deaths. And to prove their point about the oversupply, Oklahoma lawyers dipped into some of the evidence that they'll present going forward in the trial.
One lawyer said Johnson & Johnson had a marketing campaign called the squeeze. It was designed to, in their words, put the squeeze on doctors to prescribe more opioids. We also heard from a memo from one drug representative that they wrote after visiting an Oklahoma doctor, and she described how the doctor had some hesitations about prescribing opioids. And then she said she was trying to dispel the doctor's hesitations.
KELLY: Well, we're going to here in just a moment about some of the - the case that Johnson & Johnson is planning to make. But let me ask you to zoom out and answer this. What is at stake for Oklahoma here? I mean, how big is the opioid crisis in Oklahoma?
FORTIER: Well, I mean, there are quite a few people who have died of opioid overdose in Oklahoma, but frankly we're not West Virginia. We don't have numbers that are quite that high. Oklahoma leaders have decided against expanding Medicaid. So this is a big public health crisis, and there isn't a whole lot of funding for treatment. So that's kind of the situation here.
KELLY: That's Jackie Fortier of StateImpact Oklahoma. Thanks for your reporting.
FORTIER: Of course. Thank you.

Why The Green Party Won Big In Last Week's European Elections : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666317/why-the-green-party-won-big-in-last-weeks-european-elections,"NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with newly elected German Parliament member Sergey Lagodinsky about his Green Party's success in European elections and how it's moving into the political mainstream.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Elections in Europe over the weekend saw a big victory for the Green Party. The so-called Green Wave saw voters turning out to support a climate-focused agenda, especially younger voters. The German Green Party made an especially large impact. They finished in second place in that country. Sergey Lagodinsky is a newly elected Green member of the European Parliament from Germany, and he joins us now from Berlin.
Welcome.
SERGEY LAGODINSKY: Hi. Good evening.
KELLY: Hi. And I suppose I should say congratulations.
LAGODINSKY: Yes, thank you. It's exciting.
KELLY: Exciting, as you say, but what was different this time? - because the Green Party has been around for a while in Germany.
LAGODINSKY: Well, on the surface, the topic of climate change and the demonstration of young people - the so-called Fridays for Future, where students skipped their classes and went demonstrating, demanding that the politicians start listening to them in terms of climate policies - this got traction among their parents, among their grandparents.
KELLY: What about beyond the environment? - because your platform goes well beyond just issues...
LAGODINSKY: Yeah.
KELLY: ...Of climate. What else do you stand for?
LAGODINSKY: Well, having a clear attitude against racism through our diversity, not flirting with populist parties but confronting them. This is something that the Greens have been always good in. And I think that resonates with the population. And also, the Green Party has always been most pro-European party, longing for United States of Europe as a vision.
KELLY: Although, you are going to, of course, have to work with other parties in the European Parliament. And you mentioned confronting far-right parties. They also made gains in these elections. Will you work with them?
LAGODINSKY: No. If you mean the populist parties, the authoritarian parties, this is something where we cannot imagine working with them. But we can work with conservatives, the European People's Party - so, basically, party of Merkel - those are not our natural enemies. And if we see that we can at least further our green agenda with them, I think it would be possible to cooperate also in terms of supporting the new commission, which is kind of the European government that we have here.
KELLY: I was reading that the Green Party did very well among - we mentioned young voters but young, affluent, urban voters, not as well in places that are maybe more poor or struggling economically. Does that lead to a perception that your party is for the privileged of Europe? And if, so what do you do about it?
LAGODINSKY: Look. I've been campaigning in Brandenburg - very rural, very similar to Rust Belt in the United States. It's much easier to talk to them when we explain that our vision is not just environmental. It's a social policy vision. We are in the middle of a transition and transformation of our society and of our economy, so we need to make our society, our cities and towns fit for it. And this includes social support.
KELLY: And how does that message register? I mean, that sounds like a hard case to make to those voters.
LAGODINSKY: It's not an easy case to make, but it's important to listen to people. And it's important to tell them that we don't have answers to all the questions. But we have a vision. When they hear that, many of them open up because there are plenty of stereotypes about the Green Party. And one of those stereotypes is precisely what you said, you know, that this is a party of those who are better off. And I think we are moving away from that by marrying Green innovation agenda with the social policy, so I think the future will probably be Green even there.
KELLY: Sergey Lagodinsky, thank you for your time and congratulations again.
LAGODINSKY: Thank you so much.
KELLY: He is a newly elected Green member of the European Parliament, speaking to us there from Berlin.

German Government Official Recommends Jews Exercise Caution When Wearing A Kippah,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666324/german-government-official-recommends-jews-exercise-caution-when-wearing-a-kippa,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Deidre Berger, director of the AJC Ramer Institute for German-Jewish Relations, about a government official saying he does not recommend Jews wear a skullcap everywhere.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Let's stick with Germany for a moment and look at a disturbing trend in that country. The German government says anti-Semitic crimes were up 20% last year. Over the weekend, the country's top official in charge of fighting anti-Semitism was reported saying he does not recommend Jews wear a kippah, or skullcap, in all parts of the country. Deidre Berger directs the American Jewish Committee's Ramer Institute for German-Jewish relations in Berlin.
Welcome.
DEIDRE BERGER: Hello.
SHAPIRO: How did people in Germany respond to these remarks from Felix Klein, who's the man responsible for Germany's efforts to combat anti-Semitism?
BERGER: You know, I think most Germans who heard this were really shocked. There's a deep-seated belief and conviction among many in Germany and people of goodwill that anti-Semitism was stamped out in the post-war years here in Germany. And it really was a basis for creating the Federal Republic of Germany on liberal democratic values. So the notion that it's not safe for someone who's Jewish to wear a kippah in Germany is quite astonishing for most Germans.
SHAPIRO: Have you seen a lot of signs that, in fact, anti-Semitism is not stamped out? Is there a lot of evidence of it these days?
BERGER: There's more and more evidence. Those of us in the Jewish community, particularly those - we live more openly as Jews, attend Jewish events, our children and schools - we know that there's definitely been a more open manifestation of anti-Semitism for a number of years now. It's very difficult to measure. The statistics are rising, but they are also better at collecting statistics, to the credit of Germany, I would say, and also civil society. But we feel it in sports field, in schools, comments made casually at dinner parties. It's really definitely a feeling of there's more going on than there used to be.
SHAPIRO: What form does it take? Is it mostly language, acts of violence, Internet harassment?
BERGER: There's a lot of Internet harassment. There's a lot of verbal assaults. The number of actual physical attacks is, fortunately, fairly low, so about 60 last year - 60 too many. But we're mostly talking about a different kind of secondary verbal assault in terms of anti-Semitism.
SHAPIRO: Are Jews in Germany already hiding external markers of religion?
BERGER: Yes, they have for quite some time. Jews in Germany who wear yarmulkes often wear baseball caps to hide their yarmulkes because there is a feeling of unease. There aren't incidents all the time. And yet, one doesn't want to court that sort of danger. That said, of course, there's a great wish that this doesn't have to be, that one can wear a yarmulke openly. And here on the streets of Berlin, generally, it is no problem. But no one wants to be the person where it is a problem.
SHAPIRO: Right.
BERGER: And even - it's not just wearing kippahs. It's also speaking Hebrew, it's wearing Magen David Jewish star necklaces. Any outward sign can be a problem.
SHAPIRO: In response to the statement saying that it may not be safe for Jews to wear a kippah in public, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, tweeted the opposite is true. Wear your kippah. Wear your friend's kippah. Borrow a kippah and wear it for our Jewish neighbors. Educate people that we are a diverse society, he said. So which approach do you think more people are adopting in Germany today?
BERGER: I think it was important what U.S. Ambassador Grenell said. It is, of course, the right thing to do to wear open and outward signs of being Jewish. And the more there's acceptance of it, the more there's discussion of it, the easier it will be to do so. But I think no one can recommend to people themselves who wear yarmulkes as to whether or not in which parts of their city they should openly walk around with a yarmulke. Generally, it's no problem. But there are certain areas where one might feel a little more constricted. It's a personal decision but it's - in public, it's important for us as AJC and for everyone to say, be outward. Don't be afraid. Jews live in Germany. There's flourishing Jewish life, and it needs to be public.
SHAPIRO: Deidre Berger of the American Jewish Committee Berlin, thank you so much.
BERGER: You're welcome.

Extending 'Zero Tolerance' To People Who Help Migrants Along The Border,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/725716169/extending-zero-tolerance-to-people-who-help-migrants-along-the-border,"Enlarge this image Scott Warren is a volunteer for the humanitarian aid organization No More Deaths delivers food and water along remote desert trails used by undocumented immigrants near Ajo, Arizona.

Warren is scheduled to appear in federal court on May 29 in Tucson, Ariz., on felony charges of harboring and conspiracy. If found guilty Warren could face up to 20 years in prison.
John Moore/Getty Images Arrests of people for harboring, sheltering, leaving food and water or otherwise protecting migrants have been on the rise since 2017, when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered federal prosecutors to prioritize cases covered under the harboring statute .
Scott Warren, a 36-year-old college geography instructor from Ajo, Ariz., works with a group called called No More Deaths or No Mas Muertes . The group's volunteers leave water and food for migrants traversing the Arizona desert.
Warren was arrested in 2017 and faces three felony counts including conspiracy to transport and harbor migrants. In its complaint, the government claims Warren was seen talking to two migrants who sheltered in Ajo. He denies being part of any sheltering plan.
""It is scary to be intimidated like this and to be targeted but there really is no choice,"" said Warren. He believes the government is violating his right to religious freedom by criminalizing his spiritual belief that mandates he help people in distress.
""For the government, it's kind of been an expansion of the interpretation of what it means to harbor,"" he suggested.
The stretch of desert near Ajo can be deadly. The Pima County Medical Examiner has documented 250 migrant deaths in the area since 2001. In the same time frame, thousands have died of dehydration and exposure in the Arizona borderlands.

John Moore/Getty Images ""It is life or death here. And a decision not to give somebody food or or water could lead to that person dying,"" Warren said.
'Can I be compassionate?'
Nine and half hours away by car from Ajo, in the west Texas town of Marfa, another case is unfolding that pits the government against a four-time elected city and county attorney, Teresa Todd.

Lorne Matalon for NPR Lorne Matalon for NPR Teresa Todd is a city and county attorney in Marfa, Texas. She is the subject of a federal investigation after allowing three migrants to shelter in her car.
Lorne Matalon for NPR She is under investigation for human smuggling after stopping to help three migrants alongside the road at night in February, 2019.
""I see a young man in a white shirt. He runs out toward the road where I am,"" Todd recounted. She says the man was pleading for assistance. ""I can't just leave this guy on the side of the road. I have to go see if I can help.""
The young man told Todd that his sister, 18-year-old Esmeralda, was in trouble.
""I mean, she can hardly walk, she's very dazed,"" recalled Todd.
The migrants took shelter in Todd's car while she called and texted a friend who is the legal counsel for the local U.S. Border Patrol, asking for advice. Before that friend could reply, a sheriff's deputy showed up. The deputy called in the U.S. Border Patrol.
An agent was soon reading Todd her Miranda rights. Eight days later, a Department of Homeland Security investigator accompanied by a Texas Ranger arrived at Todd's office with a search warrant for her cellphone. Todd says she was told she'd have the phone back in a matter of hours.
""It makes people have to question, 'Can I be compassionate'?""
Todd's phone was returned 53 days later.
The sheriff of Presidio County, Danny Dominguez, whose deputy called the Border Patrol, defended the action against Todd. He said anyone with undocumented migrants in their car risks arrest.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the western district of Texas declined comment on Todd's case.
Todd is unrepentant: ""I feel like I did the right thing. I don't feel I did anything wrong.""
Speaking by phone from the migrant detention center in Sierra Blanca, Texas, Esmeralda said of Todd, ""I'm really grateful to her."" She said doctors told her she was on the brink of death by the time she got to the hospital.
Figures confirmed to NPR by TRAC, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, show that in fiscal year 2018 there were more than 4,500 people federally charged for bringing in and harboring migrants. That is a more than 30% increase since 2015, with the greatest rise coming after Sessions' order to prioritize harboring cases.

""With these prosecutions, the government is saying, 'we're extending our zero tolerance policy to Good Samaritans,'"" said Ranjana Natarajan, director of the Civil Rights Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. ""People shouldn't be helping migrants even if they might be at threat of death.""
Accused of human smuggling
Ana Adlerstein, a U.S. citizen and volunteer at a Mexican migrant shelter, has her own story to tell. Earlier this month, Adlerstein accompanied a migrant seeking asylum from Sonora, Mexico to the U.S. border crossing at Lukeville, Ariz. Adlerstein was present to observe the process. Instead, she says she was detained by Customs and Border Protection officers for several hours.
""I was accused of human smuggling,"" she stated.
Border officials had been forewarned that a migrant seeking asylum was coming that day, accompanied by a U.S. citizen. Under current law, once a migrant steps onto U.S. soil, he or she can request asylum.
""If that's not how you're supposed to seek asylum at a port of entry, how are you supposed to seek asylum in this country?"" Adlerstein asked.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined comment on Adlerstein's specific claims. In an email, a CBP spokesperson added:
""All persons entering the country, including U.S. citizens, are subject to examination and search. CBP uses diverse factors to refer individuals for selected examinations and there are instances when this process may take longer than normal. CBP is committed to ensuring the agency is able to execute its missions while protecting the human rights, civil rights, and dignity of those with whom we come in contact.""
Adlerstein has not been charged but has received subsequent calls from a DHS investigator.
In Texas, Teresa Todd is waiting to find out if she will be indicted for human smuggling.
As for Scott Warren, he faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all three felony counts, a prospect he can't even contemplate.

toggle caption Hero Images/Getty Images/Hero Images Participation in team sports as a teen may help protect against the long-term mental health effects of childhood trauma.
Hero Images/Getty Images/Hero Images As a kid, Molly Easterlin loved playing sports. She started soccer at age four, and then in high school, she played tennis and ran track. Sports, Easterlin believes, underlie most of her greatest successes. They taught her discipline and teamwork, helped her make friends and enabled her to navigate the many challenges of growing up.
When Easterlin became a pediatrician, she started seeing a lot of kids suffering from trauma, from physical abuse to emotional neglect. Many of these kids didn't respond fully to traditional treatment for trauma and depression. Frustrated and searching for answers, Easterlin turned to her own past. ""I suspected that sports might have a powerful impact [on kids],"" she says.
Easterlin wanted to know: Could sports improve the lives of people with trauma the way they'd improved hers?
Her research , published Tuesday in JAMA Pediatrics, finds that, in short, yes: Participation in team sports as a young person can significantly reduce the long-term likelihood of depression and anxiety for people with childhood trauma. But according to Easterlin and other experts, the growing cost of youth team sports means that they can be off-limits to those who may need them most, kids living in poverty.
In the burgeoning U.S. youth sports industry, many sports now require steep fees for participation, a factor that limits lower-income kids' ability to participate. This trend, known as ""pay to play"" sports programming, is allowed in 49 states.
NPR Ed What Do Asthma, Heart Disease And Cancer Have In Common? Maybe Childhood Trauma Shots - Health News Take The ACE Quiz — And Learn What It Does And Doesn't Mean Earlier research has shown that traumatic events in childhood, called adverse childhood experiences ( ACEs ) by public health researchers, contribute to social and physical problems throughout life , from obesity to chronic depression. ACEs are also common: About 50% of people have had at least one, and the more you have the more likely you are to have long-term health effects.
To analyze how team sports impact the health of people who've experienced childhood adversity, Easterlin and her colleagues analyzed data from 9668 teens who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They honed in on about 5,000 teens who had reported one or more ACEs.
The kids were assessed first in 1994-1995 when they were in 7th-12th grade, and asked whether they participated (or planned to participate) in team sports. Fourteen years later, in 2008, these same people, now adults, were asked whether they had ever received a diagnosis of depression or anxiety. They were also tested for depressive symptoms in case they just hadn't been diagnosed.
Easterlin found that kids who had participated in team sports were significantly less likely to receive a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and less likely to test positive for depressive symptoms. The findings were stronger for boys than for girls, but Easterlin says this may be in part because at the time of the initial data collection — 1994 — girls' sports were less well-funded and supported than they are today.
Easterlin and her colleagues also looked at participation in non-athletic school clubs, like drama and orchestra. These groups did not protect kids with ACEs against depression and anxiety the way that sports did in her study. That doesn't mean these activities definitely aren't helping, she says, but they didn't capture an effect in their research.
The study also doesn't pinpoint exactly why sports may help, but Easterlin thinks teamwork may be a key.
""There may be something powerful about that team environment [in sports], where you're in competition, being coached in a certain way and interacting with your teammates towards a common goal,"" she says.
Christina Bethell , a professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University with a focus on child well-being and adversity, says the study is a useful contribution to the study of ACEs. Bethell was not involved in the research. ""Protective factors [for kids with trauma] are important to identify,"" she says. ""Sports is one such factor.""
But, she says, it's important to consider additional factors when examining resilience, like emotional connection with relatives and a sense of safety and support. These ""family factors"" may increase a person's overall well-being, in addition to their ability to participate in sports. So sports might not be the sole cause of the protective effect. However, exercise is healthy regardless and ""is clearly a priority"" for developing kids, so we should be encouraging it anyway, she says.
Bethell also notes that the study did not distinguish between kids with one ACE from kids with multiple ACEs: for kids with more ACEs, she thinks the effect of team sports likely would have been even more powerful.
Amanda Paluch , a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, highlights the study's novelty and potential impact. ""In terms of a longitudinal study, this [association] has not been looked at much at all,"" says Paluch, who wrote the study's associated editorial .
But, she says, ""It is frustrating to think that those who may need [sports] most are less likely to have access to [them].""
Though ACEs occur across income levels, kids raised in low-income families are more likely to have more of them . Additionally, adolescents who experienced childhood trauma were more likely to have parents with lower educational attainment and to live in single-parent households, both factors associated with low income.
Less money, increasingly, has meant reduced access to sports and physical activity in the U.S. According to a 2018 report by the Aspen Institute, kids from families with household incomes less than $50,000 a year have reduced their sports participation over the last decade, while white kids from wealthier households have increased participation. Kids from lower income brackets participate in team sports at half the rate of their wealthier peers.
To address this lack of access, Petruch and Easterlin say, policymakers and child health advocates should find ways to boost sports participation for kids, particularly those most at risk of childhood trauma. About half of American kids report some kind of ACE; conversely, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, often contributing to other diseases both physical and mental.
With so many potential benefactors, Petruch points out, why not increase access to a treatment that's fun, low-cost and ultimately far less painful than many other kinds of interventions?
""[Team sports] could be a low-hanging fruit to address mental health outcomes,"" she says. ""Something that is so enjoyable...could be an important part of every kids' life.""

The Smithsonian Institution has named Lonnie Bunch III as its new secretary. He will become the first African American to lead the institution and the first historian to be elected to the position.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
The founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture has been selected to lead the entire Smithsonian Institution. Lonnie Bunch III will oversee 19 museums, nine research facilities and the National Zoo. He will be the first African American to hold the position since the Smithsonian was founded 173 years ago. NPR's Elizabeth Blair reports.
ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: You can practically smell the history in the Smithsonian's 19th century castle. That's where Lonnie Bunch received a round of applause from board members, fellow museum directors, major funders and his mom.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LONNIE BUNCH III: OK, you're going to make a historian cry.
BLAIR: Lonnie Bunch has worked for the Smithsonian in various capacities for about 30 years, but his crowning achievement is opening the Smithsonian's African American Museum in 2016. Four and a half million visited in its first year. Its 40,000-piece collection includes Nat Turner's Bible and costumes from the Broadway show ""The Wiz."" David Rubenstein, chair of the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, says Bunch started with almost no money, no donors, no land and no artifacts.
DAVID RUBENSTEIN: And over a period of about 12 years or so, he put everything together. So it was a real tour de force. There were plenty of other people involved, but Lonnie was the general.
BLAIR: Lonnie Bunch was born and raised in Newark, N.J. His parents were schoolteachers. He's worked at two other Smithsonian museums - Air and Space and American History. He says he wants to make the institution more nimble, and he wants the public to think of it as more than a collection of art and artifacts.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BUNCH: I want it to be the kind of institution that helps us debate, that helps us discuss, that helps us understand, that helps us become better as a nation.
BLAIR: Bunch will also face budget challenges. Many of the Smithsonian's buildings are in desperate need of repair. He will replace David Skorton, a cardiologist who is leaving to head up the Association of American Medical Colleges. Elizabeth Blair, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Mark Lennihan/AP Sports Illustrated has been sold for the second time in less than two years. This time, however, the $110 million purchase by Authentic Brands Group places far more importance on the iconic magazine's reputation than the publication itself — pushing the name further into such ventures as gambling and live events.
The Meredith Corp. acquired Sports Illustrated in January 2018 along with a bunch of other titles as part of its purchase of Time Inc. Meredith moved to unload most Time Inc. magazines that were not focused on its primary audience: female readers. And those moves also reflected the flagging finances of major legacy publications.
So Meredith sold Time magazine to Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne Benioff; it dealt Fortune to a Thai entrepreneur, Chatchaval Jiaravanon; and it killed Money magazine's print edition.
Media Meredith Corp. To Sell 'Time' Magazine To Salesforce Founder For $190 Million Sports Illustrated dominated sports journalism for decades, featuring the articles of such powerful writers as Frank Deford , George Plimpton and Gary Smith and the photojournalism of such photographers as Neil Leifer . The magazine incorporated clear-eyed looks at civil and human rights, politics, power and money through the prism of professional, collegiate and amateur sport. A cover was considered a feat equal to many accomplishments on the field of play.
Yet the immediacy of sports news, on cable television and online, in particular, from nimble and caustic websites to TV giant ESPN, chipped away at its seeming indispensability. So did larger societal shifts in how people consume information and news.
"" Sports Illustrated had so much residual goodwill among its readers and entire audience,"" Terry McDonell, the former top editor of the magazine, tells NPR. ""Everybody remembered something about sports in relationship to Sports Illustrated . I don't think that's gone away. It might have shrunk a bit.""
Goats and Soda Halima Aden Is First To Wear A Burkini In 'Sports Illustrated' Swimsuit Issue A Meredith spokeswoman says Sports Illustrated remains profitable with a 27-issue-per-year schedule. Yet the company has now sold Sports Illustrated to Authentic Brands in a deal that hinges on the acquisition of the magazine's intellectual property. That includes its photo archive, its past sportsman and sportswoman of the year covers, and the annual swimsuit issues, which feature female models in bikinis — including supermodels from Cheryl Tiegs and Christie Brinkley in decades past to Tyra Banks.
""As a trailblazer and cultural phenomenon, Sports Illustrated has created moments and experiences for its readers that are unmatched by any other sports brand,"" Nick Woodhouse, president and chief marketing officer of Authentic Brands, said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with Meredith to extend Sports Illustrated's legacy and connect the brand with new audiences around the world.""
Authentic Brands also controls the rights to a wide array of brands, including such pop cultural figures as Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley; such sports figures as Julius Erving and Shaquille O'Neill; and such fashion lines as Juicy Couture.
The Two-Way Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc. In Koch-Backed Deal Meredith will continue to publish the magazine and run its website for now — paying Authentic Brands a licensing fee to do so while maintaining editorial independence, according to both companies. Meredith's president of national media said he would integrate SI 's print and digital products into Meredith's operations.
In a memo to staff, Sports Illustrated Editor-in-Chief Chris Stone wrote that the magazine would seek to reach greater audiences on other platforms — including in live events, conferences, gambling and video games. He also cited the development of television shows from SI material. And he praised Meredith for striking a deal that honored the magazine's work.
""This deal only made sense if we continue to generate premium journalism and storytelling,"" Stone said. The guarantee that the magazine would continue to publish under Meredith, however, lasts just two years."
"Tony Horwitz, Author and Pulitzer Prize Winner, Dies At 60",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666331/tony-horwitz-author-and-pulitzer-prize-winner-dies-at-60,"Tony Horwitz won the Pulitzer Prize in 1995 for his Wall Street Journal reporting and was known for his history books, including Confederates in the Attic. He died Monday at age 60.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Now a moment to remember the writer Tony Horwitz. He died yesterday at the age of 60. Horwitz was best known for his historical nonfiction, including the bestselling ""Confederates In The Attic."" He began his writing career as a journalist.
NPR's Lynn Neary has more.
LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: Tony Horwitz had an easy manner and a wide smile. He was as interested in listening to someone else's story as he was in telling his own. I learned that when I visited with him and his wife, writer Geraldine Brooks, at their home on Martha's Vineyard a few years back.
I was there to interview Brooks, but I spoke with both of them about their time overseas, where they met as reporters covering the Mideast. Horwitz remembered the first time they flew into a combat zone together.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
TONY HORWITZ: This helicopter was shaking and bucking and, you know, I'm looking out the open hatch, just puking with terror. And I look over, and Geraldine has nodded off on the way to our first battle.
NEARY: Brooks and Horwitz went on to win an Overseas Press Club award for their coverage of the Persian Gulf War.
Horwitz spent a decade overseas as a foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. Back in the U.S., he won the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 1995 for his stories about low-income workers. After leaving the Journal, Horwitz wrote for The New Yorker and eventually moved to Martha's Vineyard, where he and Brooks worked full time on writing books.
He told WHYY's Fresh Air that he was inspired to write his book about the legacy of the Civil War, ""Confederates In The Attic,"" when he returned to this country after living overseas and noticed so many lingering controversies about that war.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
HORWITZ: And I was just struck. I said, my God, this war is not only alive to Civil War buffs, but it's really a hot subject of debate. And I thought, you know, this conflict is still very alive in somewhat the same way of some of the conflicts I covered overseas.
NEARY: ""Confederates In The Attic"" was one of many popular historical works of nonfiction by Tony Horwitz. Others include ""Blue Latitudes"" and ""Midnight Rising.""
He was on a book tour promoting his latest, ""Spying On The South,"" when he collapsed of apparent cardiac arrest. He was in his hometown of Washington, D.C., for an event at the Politics and Prose Bookstore. The store's notice, canceling the event, was the way many people learned one of their favorite writers had died.

Kishi Bashi Says His 'Omoiyari' Album Looks To The Past,www.npr.org,Kishi Bashi,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727533256/kishi-bashi-uses-the-history-of-japanese-internment-to-explore-america-today,"Enlarge this image Kishi Bashi's Omoiyari, out May 31, is largely inspired by the artist's visit to ex-internment camps in America. Max Ritter/Courtesy of the artist Max Ritter/Courtesy of the artist Kishi Bashi's Omoiyari, out May 31, is largely inspired by the artist's visit to ex-internment camps in America.
Max Ritter/Courtesy of the artist Kishi Bashi 's ""Summer of '42"" is a love song inspired by and set in one of the darker chapters of American history: the internment of Japanese-Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. ""What are the things you wanted / The same as anyone,"" the songwriter and multi-instrumentalist sings. ""Just a hand to hold a little / After all is said and done.""
First Listen First Listen: Kishi Bashi, 'Omoiyari' Tiny Desk Kishi Bashi: Tiny Desk Concert "" Summer of '42 "" is the lead single from Kishi Bashi's latest album, Omoiyari, out May 31. Although Kishi Bashi's family was not sent to the internment camps — his parents immigrated to the United States after WWII — the Japanese-American artist says that the current political climate has turned his attention back to that period. On Omoiyari , he considers the lessons it offers and how they might inform the modern American experience.
Kishi Bashi spoke to NPR's Mary Louise Kelly about the camps that inspired Omoiyari, reckoning with his identity as a Japanese-American and more. Hear their conversation at the audio link and read on for interview highlights.
Interview Highlights On how visiting ex-internment camps inspired the album
Frankly, if you go in the summer, [the camps are] really beautiful, some of them on the West Coast. And it's really conflicting, because these places are pretty desolate in the winter — probably pretty miserable. So, to kind of get that effect, I went to Arkansas in the winter. And that was very bleak.
To have to suppress or even forget or destroy your own culture in order to survive is something that really was heartbreaking for me.
Kishi Bashi
There was a lot of Japanese culture in these camps that was largely suppressed, internally and also externally. Like, the camps wouldn't allow you to have Japanese material, written material. And everybody was encouraged to assimilate. To have to suppress or even forget or destroy your own culture in order to survive is something that really was heartbreaking for me. That became the [""Theme from Jerome (Forgotten Words).""]
On the connection between Japanese-American internment and the modern political climate
For me as an artist, you know, or a songwriter, you connect it through stories and these emotions that are timeless and universal — love, loss, desire — you find these connections so that you can actually empathize with how they might have felt.
I also looked back at how hysterical it was back then in World War II. We know that they weren't the enemy, they were civilians, just families locked up. But if you look at a lot of the average people on the ground, citizens, white Americans, they probably were afraid. I think that's exactly where we stand today and that we have to be very careful to not fall into this hysteria, so that this kind of thing doesn't happen again with new vulnerable minority groups.
YouTube The immigration debate, Islamophobia and, you know, 'Immigrants are coming to kill us and take our jobs.' This is a fear tactic that was exactly the same as what happened 76 years ago and ultimately, our leaders failed us by not protecting civilians.
On the moral complexity heard on the track ""F Delano""
So, Delano is obviously the middle name of [President Franklin D. Roosevelt.] It's kind of interesting, because FDR is really still considered one of the greatest presidents of all time. He helped America out of the Great Depression and created all of these social programs that we still depend on today, yet he was a villain in the story about Japanese-American incarceration, because he just took away civil rights for a whole entire race of people. And I think the lesson here is that history is really complicated. You can have heroes and villains, and that's easy for children to understand, but for adults, we have to look at the complexities of the situation and understand that there's a lot going on back there. But the more you understand, the more you can grow as a person.
On Omoiyari 's warning and underlying optimism
I mean, yeah, that's the simple message: Be careful. But also, the good thing about history is the more I study it, I see that humanity is actually progressing towards a more compassionate, empathetic state. I see my daughter, and her classmates. I see them as a kind of hope for a new generation, that we are headed in the right direction."
Planned Parenthood President Reacts To Potential End Of Abortion Services In Missouri : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666352/planned-parenthood-president-reacts-to-potential-end-of-abortion-services-in-mis,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood about how Missouri could become the first state without a clinic providing abortions.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Missouri could soon be the only state in the U.S. without a clinic providing abortions. Planned Parenthood said today that later this week, the Missouri Health Department will force the Planned Parenthood health center in St. Louis to stop performing abortions unless a court intervenes. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit today to prevent the center from closing. Right now that St. Louis center is the only clinic in Missouri where women can receive abortions. Leana Wen is the president of Planned Parenthood, and she joins us now from St. Louis.
Dr. Wen, welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
LEANA WEN: Thank you - glad to be with you, Ari.
SHAPIRO: So this change hinges on a license that expires on Friday, which your organization says Missouri is unlikely to renew. The clinic has been operating for almost 90 years in St. Louis. What has changed in the renewal process?
WEN: Well, I want to first say that this is a public health crisis - that if the court does not grant us a restraining order, Missouri will go dark. And more than 1.1 million women of reproductive age will be living in a state where they cannot access essential health care - the first time since 1974 that safe, legal abortion is inaccessible to people in an entire state.
SHAPIRO: So explain for our listeners what has happened that the state has refused or you expect will refuse to renew this license.
WEN: The state of Missouri has enacted regulation upon regulation that have no basis in medicine, like forcing a 72-hour waiting period on patients and even requiring multiple medically unnecessary and invasive pelvic exams - all requirements that the National Academy of Medicine, that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have said are - have - they have no basis in medicine whatsoever.
SHAPIRO: And in this case, it seems that the renewal of the license hinges on a question of whether people who perform abortions will be interviewed by state officials. Is that right?
WEN: The state of Missouri is requesting that seven physicians who have worked in our health centers be subject to interrogation. And they're specifically saying that our doctors, if they consent to this interrogation, they would be threatened with losing their medical license and even face criminal prosecution. And this has a chilling effect for medical professionals all across the country. It follows a trend that we're seeing to criminalize doctors and to prevent us from taking care of patients.
SHAPIRO: If medical officials at the clinic are complying with all regulations, why not agree to answer questions?
WEN: We have complied with every single regulation that politicians have thrown our way, but the goalpost keeps on changing. And this most recent goalpost is potentially subjecting physicians and training residents, fellows to criminal prosecution, which is not theoretical. Last week, the Missouri governor just signed into law an extreme abortion ban that also includes putting doctors in jail for up to 15 years for performing abortion care.
SHAPIRO: You're in St. Louis today, but I also want to ask you about a major development here in Washington. The Supreme Court let stand an Indiana law mandating that aborted fetuses be buried or cremated. And the court declined to take up the part of a law that bans abortions based on testing that finds abnormalities. What do you see as the implications of this ruling?
WEN: Well, we're very concerned about this Supreme Court ruling because once again, it stigmatizes abortion care. And I'm also deeply concerned about the fact that there are 15 cases that are one step away from the Supreme Court. And if any of them are taken up, then one in three women of reproductive age in this country would be living in states where abortion is banned, criminalized and outlawed. Although, as we're seeing in Missouri, just having abortion being safe and legal is not enough if there literally is no health center that can provide this care.
SHAPIRO: Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood, speaking with us from St. Louis, Mo., thank you so much.
WEN: Thank you.

Missouri Could Soon Be The Only U.S. State Without A Clinic That Provides Abortions : NPR,www.npr.org,Sarah Mccammon,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666359/missouri-could-soon-be-the-only-u-s-state-without-a-clinic-that-provides-abortio,"Planned Parenthood says it might have to stop providing abortion services in Missouri. That would make Missouri the first state in the country without a clinic that performs abortions.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
To talk about how Missouri's fight over abortion fits into the larger national picture, NPR's Sarah McCammon joins us now. She has been covering the abortion debate across the country.
Hi, Sarah.
SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi there.
SHAPIRO: How unusual is what is happening in Missouri? How close are other states to being in the same situation?
MCCAMMON: Well, abortion is still legal in all 50 states, Ari, but that does not mean it's accessible or even available. Right now Missouri is one of six states with only one clinic, so abortion rights advocates say any of those six states could find itself in a similar situation. And we should note a couple of hospitals in Missouri could still provide abortions in rare situations like medical emergencies. But this clinic is the only option in the state for most women seeking abortions.
SHAPIRO: These clinics have been closing in a number of states. Explain why.
MCCAMMON: Right. A lot of it does come down to laws and regulations like those in Missouri that make it hard for clinics to stay open. Activists say it's a strategy - an intentional strategy by anti-abortion rights groups. And it's happening along with efforts we've seen to ban abortion outright. Planned Parenthood says something like 300 abortion restrictions have been introduced in state legislatures this year. And more than half of those involved regulating clinics and doctors, things like hospital-admitting privileges for doctors who perform abortions or transportation agreements with local hospitals in case of an emergency. Medical groups say many of these regulations are excessive and unnecessary.
SHAPIRO: What do groups that oppose abortion say about these new regulations? How are they reacting to them?
MCCAMMON: Right. Well, no surprise, they're pleased to see that this facility in Missouri might have to stop performing abortions. I heard from Marjorie Dannenfelser with the anti-abortion rights group the Susan B. Anthony List. She said in a statement that this would be good news for health and safety, as she put it. And she says that there is growing momentum around the country to restrict abortion.
SHAPIRO: There's been a lot of speculation about how the Supreme Court might weigh in on laws that ban specific abortion procedures or ban the procedure at certain stages. What does the Supreme Court said about these other kinds of restrictions on clinics and doctors who perform abortions?
MCCAMMON: So, yeah, the Supreme Court has weighed in on this. About three years ago, there was a case from Texas called the Whole Woman's Health case. It was a Texas law that required hospital-admitting privileges for doctors and surgical facilities at clinics that provide abortions. In that decision, the court said, basically, that states cannot impose these kinds of health regulations without demonstrating that they're medically necessary.
Groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say the regulations that could force Missouri's last clinic to stop offering abortions are unnecessary and interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. There's another case before the Supreme Court from Louisiana that looks at similar issues, so I'd expect to hear more about this, Ari, along with those - the debate over banning abortion outright.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thanks, Sarah.
MCCAMMON: Thank you.

Security Experts Express Concern Over Electronic System To Check-In At Polling Places,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666387/security-experts-express-concern-over-electronic-system-to-check-in-at-polling-p,"Electronic poll books are a popular technology used to keep polling place lines short on election days. But they are also a potential security weakness for hackers wanting to disrupt an election.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
With so much of our lives done by computer, it's no surprise more and more states are turning to them on Election Day, helping check people in faster at polling stations. As NPR's Miles Parks reports, along with the convenience, the technology also brings security risks.
MILES PARKS, BYLINE: From 8 a.m. to noon last Election Day, voting in Johnson County, Ind., ground to a halt. Lines at precincts across the county swelled.
CINDY RAPP: There were hundreds of people standing in line - absolutely.
PARKS: That's Cindy Rapp. She's the Democratic member on the Johnson County Election Board. The county votes using electronic voting machines, but they weren't what caused the issue. The problem was with the systems poll workers were using to check people in. They're called electronic poll books. They moved the check-in process from the big book of names it used to be in to a laptop computer or tablet. But like in all aspects of the elections world, there are big questions about security and reliability when you switch from paper records to electronic ones.
e-Poll books are often connected to the Internet, and that makes them significantly more vulnerable to a cyberattack than paper records. At this point, there are no federal regulations or even voluntary guidelines for how these e-poll books need to work.
JOE HALL: Which means that a lot of the stuff that happens to cross the T's and dot the I's in a regular voting system certification to make sure it's suitable for an election just don't happen.
PARKS: Joe Hall is the senior technologist for the Center for Democracy & Technology. I asked him and his colleague, Maurice Turner, to look over the third-party report of what happened in Johnson County and walk me through it. There were a number of issues. First, the company in charge of maintaining the poll books didn't provide enough bandwidth for the Election Day crowd. That caused the poll books to slow down to the point where they were barely working. Rapp says poll workers weren't able to give frustrated voters answers.
RAPP: And there's no one voting on the machines, so they know it's not the machines. And, you know, all we can say is, oh, it's computers. And people weren't happy. People had to leave and go to work.
PARKS: To get around the problem, the company maintaining the system basically disconnected the poll books from each other. In Johnson County, voters can cast their ballot at any polling place, but the e-poll books have to be able to communicate so people don't vote twice. To get over the technical hurdle, the company disabled that security feature. Had voters wanted to vote twice in Johnson County at different locations, they could have. Here's Maurice Turner from the Center for Democracy & Technology.
MAURICE TURNER: It would be like if someone was going to the airport and they got to the security checkpoint, and then all of a sudden, those lines were overloaded. If you just turned off all the metal detectors, obviously, you can get people through much more quickly. But the more secure way to do it is actually to open up more lines with more metal detectors.
PARKS: Johnson County terminated their contract with the company after Election Day, and they're going to use a different company going forward. But what happened there was an example of how much havoc can be caused with a hitch in this part of the voting system even though these machines don't actually affect election tallies. Election supervisors say they do offer huge benefits, especially faster check-in times.
DENISE MERRILL: It's so much less work and so much more accurate, really, than doing things by hand.
PARKS: That's Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill. Four years ago, she got her state's legislature to provide money to get electronic poll books for every voting jurisdiction in the state. Her office took proposals from companies hoping to provide the technology. And she took them to the University of Connecticut's voting technology center for recommendations.
MERRILL: They came back to us and said we don't feel comfortable with any of these being entirely secure.
PARKS: So Merrill didn't let local officials use state money to buy the technology. But she's optimistic the products will improve. In general, she worries about jumping into this technology too quickly.
MERRILL: But it's like, anything in elections, there's a risk-reward ratio, I guess I'd say. And, no, I don't think there has been a thorough conversation of the risks inherent but - and also the benefits of electronic poll books.
PARKS: The thing is, Merrill says, once governments have spent the money on this new technology, they're not eager to hear what's wrong with it. Miles Parks, NPR News, Washington.

They are popular. They are controversial. And now, video games have just become an internationally recognized addiction.
On May 25, the World Health Organization officially voted to adopt the latest edition of its International Classification of Diseases, or ICD, to include an entry on ""gaming disorder"" as a behavioral addiction.
This is a move that could alarm parents all over the country. According to Pew , 97 percent of teen boys and 83 percent of girls play games on some kind of device.
But in order to be classified as having a disease, being a video game fan isn't enough. According to WHO, the criteria doesn't include a certain amount of hours spent playing. Instead, the description is of someone with an inability to stop playing even though it interferes with other areas of one's life, such as family relationships, school, work, and sleep. And, these problems would typically continue for at least one year.

Dozens of inmates were killed in four jails in northern Brazil on Sunday and Monday, authorities said, in the latest wave of violence to rock the country's severely overpopulated and dangerous prison system.
Sandro Pereira/AFP/Getty Images Robert Muggah is the co-founder of the Igarapé Institute , a Brazil-based think and do tank that focuses on security and justice across Latin America, Africa and Asia. He is also co-founder of the SecDev Group, a digital consultancy working in the Middle East, Eurasia and South Asia. He advises governments and business and civil society groups in Latin America and around the world on data-driven and evidence-based security, justice and new technologies.
Once again, Brazil's hellish prisons are making global headlines. The spotlight this week is on Manaus, the capital of the country's northern Amazonas state, where violence at different prisons left 55 inmates dead.
On Sunday, the mutilated bodies of 15 prisoners were discovered at one Manaus prison, many of them reportedly showing signs of strangulation and stab wounds from sharpened toothbrushes. Another 40 bodies were recovered on Monday from three other prisons, reported to have signs of asphyxiation.
In virtually any other country, prison massacres on this scale would trigger a national crisis and high-level resignations. In Brazil, it barely registers on most people's radar.
Many Brazilians are numb to violence, especially when it occurs in prisons. The country has the highest number of recorded homicides in the world, more than 51,000 last year , according to official statistics assembled by a group of independent researchers. Brazil also registers the world's third-largest prison population, over 704,000 inmates . That figure is almost twice the amount of available cell space — just under 416,000 — which leads to severe overcrowding, inhumane conditions, brutal riots and periodic jailbreaks.
While the latest outbreak of prison violence in Manaus is still under investigation, it is likely connected to disputes between warring drug factions. The fact that the killings occurred simultaneously across multiple prison facilities suggests it involved the settling of scores between gangs. That many of the victims were killed in front of their families during visiting hours only adds to the horror.
Sending a message
These kinds of gruesome acts are performative — they are intended to send a message to rank and file and rival factions. The more violent, the more effective they are at keeping gang members in line.
State authorities speaking to the local media played down the idea that rival drug factions were involved, describing it instead as a violent internal disagreement that spiraled out of control. Amazonas' secretary for penitentiary administration, Marcus Vinícius de Almeida, added that the state should not be held responsible since prisoners will kill one another if they want to. The mayor of Manaus, Arthur Virgílio Neto, admitted that the state had lost control and that there was open warfare between rival gangs.
Historically, prison violence has broken out over drug gang disputes or frustration over dire prison conditions. The conditions in most of the country's jails are inhumane, often crowding dozens of people into spaces designed for a handful. A former justice minister once declared that he'd rather die than spend time in a Brazilian jail cell.

Andre Penner/AP Recent history of prison violence
The latest prison massacres share uncanny resemblances with the violent outbreaks that spread across northern Brazil in late 2016 and early 2017. In January 2017, another 56 people were slaughtered in one of the same private prisons, the Anísio Jobim Penitentiary Complex, as this week's carnage. Over the course of a few weeks in 2017 , another 70 inmates were decapitated and stabbed to death in prisons across northern Brazil and dozens more escaped.
The bloodletting in 2017 was widely attributed to disputes between the Família do Norte gang and the Primeiro Comando da Capital, or PCC, who were fighting over control of the prison system and the cocaine trade. This week the regional attorney general, Leda Mara Albuquerque, has already linked the latest outbreak of violence to the Família do Norte.
Brazil's prison violence is legendary. The homicide rate for inmates is six times higher than the national average. An especially brutal episode occurred in 1992, when 111 inmates were killed during a riot in the Carandiru prison in São Paulo. This incident led to the formation of the PCC, today Brazil's most powerful drug-trafficking faction.
Other prison massacres have occurred in the northern Rondonia state in 2002, the northeastern states of Maranhão in 2010 and Pernambuco in 2011, Rio de Janeiro in 2014, and across Rondonia and Amazonas in 2016 and 2017. In fact, 24 of Brazil's 26 states (and district capital) have suffered prison violence in the last decade.
The Amazonas military police's shock troops claimed to have brought Sunday's prison violence under control within 45 minutes. Families of several inmates disagree, describing scenes of chaos in the wake of the police intervention. Amazonas' prison authorities have said they are suspending visiting hours for all prisons across the state and are investigating who was behind the carnage.
The conditions in most of the country's jails are inhumane. A former justice minister once declared that he'd rather die than spend time in a Brazilian jail cell.
For its part, the federal government announced that it will deploy a penitentiary intervention task force made up of some 100 federal penal authorities and federal police to assist. There are already hundreds of troops stationed in Amazonas, many of them deployed there after the prison riots of 2017. Justice Minister Sergio Moro has also approved the transfer of several gang leaders to federal prisons.
Deep reforms needed
These kinds of reactive measures are not enough to stem massacres from recurring. Deeper reforms are required. According to an official investigation of the 2017 prison riots in Amazonas, violence was allowed to escalate because the local penal authorities — some of whom knew about a planned ""rebellion"" brewing in the prisons — failed to notify the state military police in advance. There were similar red flags this time around.
The prisons also suffer from massive shortages of staff: There are just one judge and two prosecutors responsible for handling as many as 17,000 cases a year and inspecting the state's eight prisons. Making matters worse, the private company managing Anísio Jobim prison, Umanizzare , was singled out for offering uneven services and charging double the cost per prisoner than the national average.
The reality, however, is that Brazil's prison problem is tremendously hard to fix. One of the reasons is because they are often literally administered by drug factions who serve as judges, jurors and executioners. Most prisons are divvied up among competing gangs, and the government exerts nominal control.
Much of Brazil is socially conservative and supports a strong prison system and tougher sentences. Recent polls suggest most of the public favors lowering the age of criminal responsibility from 18 to 16. This partially helps explain the appeal of President Jair Bolsonaro, elected in October 2018 on a tough-on-crime ticket.
Opinion Opinion: Brazil's High Murder Rate Could Get Even Worse If Gun Laws Are Relaxed The latest Manaus killings are almost guaranteed to inspire retribution inside and outside the prison walls. Amazonas is already one of Brazil's most violent states. The homicide rate in its capital city is 45 per 100,000 last year , almost twice the national average. As recent history has shown, Brazil's prison wars often spill onto the street and spread across state borders.
To reform the penitentiary system, Brazil needs to step back from its policy of mass incarceration. Since 2018, just over 8,650 prison spaces were built in the country — but the number of new inmates jumped by more than 17,800 over the same period, according to national news sources.
At a minimum, the government needs to focus on reducing both the stock and flow of inmates. This means drastically reducing the number of pretrial detainees, who currently make up an estimated 36% of the entire caseload. Federal and state-level judges, prosecutors and public defenders need support to resolve outstanding cases. Much greater attention is needed to rehabilitate first-time offenders and keep at-risk adolescents from joining a gang — 70% of Brazilian offenders end up back in jail within five years.
Brazil's government needs to deliver a comprehensive strategy for public security, and the penal system in particular. Rather than imposing harsher sentences and building new prisons, the authorities need to ensure suspects are provided with a hearing within 24 hours of their arrest and expand the network of public defenders.
But real change must go beyond reforming sentencing procedures and improving prison conditions, though both are necessary. Brazil needs to decriminalize drugs, promote proportional sentencing and offer rehabilitation opportunities for offenders — all of which are dim prospects in a country inured to violence.

A swarm of tornadoes tore through parts of Ohio and Indiana Monday night, with significant damage done just outside Dayton, Ohio. Power is still out for many and water must be boiled.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Severe storms swept through Indiana and western Ohio last night, killing one person and injuring at least 60. Ohio's governor has declared a state of emergency for the part of the state that includes the Dayton area. The National Weather Service says it appears two tornadoes struck that region within minutes of each other. From member station WYSO in nearby Yellow Springs, Jess Mador reports.
JESSICA MADOR, BYLINE: The massive storms struck Monday night, beginning just before 9 o'clock. They continued for hours, sparking more than three dozen tornado warnings and a flash flood warning in what National Weather Service forecasters are calling a high-impact event. The storms hurled so much debris into the air, it could be seen on radar.
Overnight, state highway crews deployed snowplows to clear downed trees and rubble from an interstate. At daybreak, emergency crews began the work of clearing streets of debris, stabilizing Dayton's water treatment facility and trying to restore power to tens of thousands of customers across the Dayton area.
The one reported fatality from the storm occurred when winds blew a parked car into a house. National Weather Service meteorologist Myron Padgett says so far, he's confirmed one EF3 tornado with winds of up to 140 miles an hour.
MYRON PADGETT: It's not very common that we have this type of magnitude and amount of tornadic activity in one particular area, so it certainly is a fairly rare occurrence and would not be a usual event.
(SOUNDBITE OF GENERATOR RUNNING)
MADOR: In a busy residential and shopping district northwest of Dayton, the sound of generators and hammers are filling the air at a group home facility for people with disabilities. Two dozen workers are clambering along a roof, replacing missing tiles. Wet insulation and plywood pokes through a ripped-out wall. Timothy Neville runs this facility. He says he's grateful staff were able to evacuate residents from the building in time last night.
TIMOTHY NEVILLE: I actually spoke with the staff this morning when they came back over. And they were just rejoicing when they saw the damage that they were able to get out of there safely.
MADOR: Dayton's power company says it could take several more days before electricity is fully restored across the region. Many Dayton-area residents are being told to continue boiling their drinking water until further notice.

Michigan State President Dr. Samuel Stanley Jr. On His Plans For The University,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666409/michigan-state-president-dr-samuel-stanley-jr-on-his-plans-for-the-university,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with new Michigan State University President Dr. Samuel L. Stanley Jr. about taking over the university following the Larry Nassar abuse controversy.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Michigan State University has elected its first permanent president since the conviction of former MSU sports doctor Larry Nassar for sexual abuse. The investigation and cover-up by university officials led to more than a year of instability in the presidency. In August, Samuel Stanley Jr. will take over. He is a medical doctor who is currently president of Stony Brook University in New York. He joins us now from East Lansing, Mich.
Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
SAMUEL STANLEY JR: Thank you so much. Great to be here.
SHAPIRO: Although Michigan's case was very high-profile, many schools, including Stony Brook, are being investigated by the federal government for its handling of sexual assault cases. How have you dealt with this issue as you've been president of the school that you're at now, Stony Brook?
STANLEY: It's been a really important issue for us and one that I think we've had a tremendous amount of focus on. As you pointed out, there's an unfortunate reality that this kind of case is happening all over campuses all around the country. That's the result of a systemic problem that we need to deal with.
We've worked really hard to do a couple of things. One is to work to change the culture on our campus - and this is something I'll be working at Michigan State as well - to increase awareness about the issues around this, to make people understand what behaviors are acceptable and not acceptable and then develop processes and procedures that reduce barriers to people reporting, that make them feel safer about reporting and make them feel that they're going to be listened to and they're going - things are going to be pursued in an appropriate manner when they bring complaints.
Overall, we want to continue to work to try and reduce this kind of behavior on campus. And again, that involves education and also creating a culture where we're looking out for each other on the campus, a culture of safety and a culture of transparency and respect. So that's really what we've been trying to do at Stony Brook University and I think what we'll be working on at Michigan State University as well.
SHAPIRO: You know, phrases like change the culture and increase awareness are very broad. Can you tell us about a specific thing that you think you could bring from Stony Brook to Michigan State that might help the school?
STANLEY: So we've begun before students get to campus. We've been educating on issues around sexual violence, domestic violence and sexual misconduct. But it also involves being at the top where people know that this is not acceptable at our institution, where it's not acceptable with my senior staff. It's not acceptable at the dean or department level. But that kind of message gets through the campus as a whole - that we're not a place that was going to tolerate this. And we're going to make sure that we have the most respectful and safe campus that we can.
SHAPIRO: You're talking about ways to prevent sexual abuse from happening in the future. Looking to the past, this is a school whose reputation has been damaged, that people have lost trust in. How do you rebuild that?
STANLEY: Regaining trust is about aligning what we're saying and with our actions - that we're taking the appropriate actions to move things forward and that we're holding people accountable for their behaviors, and we get rid of a culture where people may - even unintentionally in the name of collegiality - try and cover up activities that are taking place. I think that's possible to do. And ultimately, I think for Michigan State University, we want to be defined not just by the Nassar episode but how we responded to it and how we improved culture on the campus in response to it.
SHAPIRO: Is there something from the last year that you wish the school had done that they didn't, that you would like to see happen as soon as you take charge?
STANLEY: I think not. The key thing, I think, that was very important was President Udpa's apology to the survivors. I think they had not been adequately addressed in that way. And I think that was a very important thing that was done within the past six months. I think that really does make a difference on campus.
I think I - the survivors are a group that I plan to meet with as soon as I can. I plan to listen with, listen to and learn from, understand their ideas. And it took tremendous courage for them to come forward, and I think we need to honor that.
SHAPIRO: When you meet with the survivors, the people who survived Larry Nassar's abuse, what do you think you can say to them that Michigan State leaders haven't already tried to say?
STANLEY: I don't think there's anything probably I can say to them that hasn't been tried to have been said. I think I'm going to be there really to listen. I think it'll be my actions that we take afterwards, understanding from them where are the areas where they think we've fallen short? Where are the areas where we think we can do more? And I think my responsibility will be to listen to them and try to do everything I can to translate that into action.
This is so horrific what happened. As a physician, I'm particularly sensitive to the kind of betrayal that took place, why there would be a lack of confidence and trust associated with it. The physician-patient relationship is very important. And to see it abused and really violated in this way is heartbreaking for me. And it angers me as well.
SHAPIRO: You officially begin this job August 1. And soon after that, new students will arrive on campus. What's your message to them?
STANLEY: The same message - that Michigan State University is working to develop a culture of safety that's going to be as inclusive and diverse as possible. The campus needs to come together to do this. It's something that everybody needs to care about. And again, giving them - helping them have the awareness and sensitivity and the tools they need to help in prevention in this particular area.
SHAPIRO: Dr. Samuel Stanley begins his new role as president of Michigan State University in August. Thanks for joining us today.
STANLEY: Thank you so much. It was my pleasure.

"In Oklahoma, Tulsa Braces For More Flooding, Big Test Of The City's Levees",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727666423/in-oklahoma-tulsa-braces-for-more-flooding-big-test-of-the-citys-levees,"Record rainfall and flooding are causing all sorts of problems in Oklahoma. And more rain is predicted to make it even worse. In Tulsa, thousands of people have been evacuated.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
People in Tulsa, Okla., are bracing for more rain tonight and tomorrow, and that means more flooding in a city that has already been drenched. It's led to floods, evacuations and a big test of the city's levees. Matt Trotter of member station KWGS in Tulsa joins us now. Hi, Matt.
MATT TROTTER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: How bad is it right now there in Tulsa?
TROTTER: So the Arkansas River that runs through Tulsa - since last Monday, it's up from 11 feet, which is a little above average but still pretty typical to more than 23 feet.
SHAPIRO: Wow.
TROTTER: Its highest recorded level was back in 1986 at 25. So it's still 2 feet below that all-time high, but it's still really high here.
SHAPIRO: And how is the city dealing with all of this water?
TROTTER: Well, we have a levee system, and that's keeping water out of a lot of areas right now as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lets water out of Keystone Dam. That's the main dam for the reservoir upstream from us. But the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is just trying to balance those releases with what comes into the reservoir as we get just a ton of rain. I mean, some areas around us have had 20 inches in the past month. So it's a lot of rain that we're trying to deal with.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. Tell us about what city leaders are saying right now.
TROTTER: Sure. So earlier this afternoon, Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum held a news conference to give an update. Here's what he had to say about the levees.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
G T BYNUM: The levees continue to operate as they're designed. They do have a heavy load on them. They're being tested in a way that they never have been before. We continue to encourage people that live behind those to please proactively relocate.
TROTTER: And the mayor is calling this a high-risk situation right now but not an emergency just yet.
SHAPIRO: Not yet, but more rain is expected tonight and tomorrow. So what is the outlook for the future?
TROTTER: Well, the Army Corps of Engineers is in charge of the dam, and they're hoping things will improve in a few days. What they told us during the briefing this afternoon was as long as what flows into the reservoir stays even or below what they're letting out, then things should be OK. They expect the level to start decreasing sometime this afternoon, and that'll make a little bit of room for any additional rain that falls in the area tonight.
SHAPIRO: Now, I understand that today city officials warned people to stay out of parks along the river. Have people actually been going there where the river has flooded?
TROTTER: Yeah, that's actually been sort of an interesting problem that's happened. People want to go look at the river, see what's basically a historic flood situation. They're taking photos and selfies. I've seen pictures of people actually wading into the river, full-on bathing in the river like it's their own personal hot tub or something like that. So today...
SHAPIRO: Not something people should be doing.
TROTTER: (Laughter) No, absolutely not. There's a few risks. The obvious one is it's dangerous just to walk around an area where the water's been eating away at the ground. Sinkholes could open up. But there's also raw sewage in this floodwater, and there's also venomous snakes. There's water moccasins that have washed down with the flood.
SHAPIRO: All right, Matt Trotter of member station KWGS in Tulsa, Okla., thank you for joining us, and stay safe there.
TROTTER: You're welcome.

toggle caption Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty Images Eleven people have died climbing Mount Everest so far this year, amid long lines to reach the peak last week. The mountain is seen here on Monday.
Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty Images Nepal's tourism board is defending the number of permits it issued to climb Mount Everest for this season in which 11 people have died. And the country says it has no plans to restrict the number of permits issued next year, but rather that it hopes to attract still more tourists and climbers.
""There has been concern about the number of climbers on Mount Everest but it is not because of the traffic jam that there were casualties,"" Mohan Krishna Sapkota, secretary at the country's Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, told the Associated Press. He instead pointed to weather conditions, insufficient oxygen supplies and equipment.
""In the next season we will work to have double rope in the area below the summit so there is better management of the flow of climbers,"" he told the news service.
The image of a crowded Everest linked to the death toll was spurred by a viral photo last week that showed climbers in their neon gear, packed in a tight, unforgiving queue to the highest point on Earth.

toggle caption Nirmal Purja/AP A long queue of mountain climbers line a path on Mount Everest on May 22. Nepal's tourist board says weather conditions and other factors, not crowds, were to blame for eight deaths on the peak in two days last week.
Nirmal Purja/AP ""You essentially have something that looks like people are waiting in line for concert tickets to a sold-out show, only instead of trying to get in to see their favorite artist, they're trying to reach the top of the world and are running into traffic,"" Outside magazine editor at large Grayson Schaffer told NPR's Weekend Edition .
It's a traffic jam that can turn fatal. ""The danger there is that, at that altitude, the body just can't survive,"" Schaffer said. ""They're breathing bottled oxygen. And when that oxygen runs out because you're waiting in line, you are at much higher risk for developing high-altitude edemas and altitude sickness — and dying of those illnesses while you're still trying to reach the summit.""
National American Man Dies Just After Achieving Dream Of Reaching Summit Of Mount Everest Everest's very highest reaches are known as the death zone. And once a climber reaches it, all bets are off.
""Once you get above about 25,000 feet, your body just can't metabolize the oxygen,"" said Schaffer, who has been to Everest but not the death zone. ""Your muscles start to break down. You start to have fluid that builds up around your lungs and your brain. Your brain starts to swell. You start to lose cognition. Your decision making starts to become slow. And you start to make bad decisions.""
And that breakdown in cognition is happening to people who have often flown hundreds or thousands of miles and paid significant sums of money to achieve their dream of reaching the top.
""The reason that people try to climb Mount Everest is because it grabs a hold of them and they feel like they just have to make the summit,"" Schaffer said. ""And so you'll have some people in distress and not necessarily getting help from the people who are around them.

Nepal's government doesn't put a specific limit on permits. This year 381 people were permitted to climb – a number the AP says is the highest ever. Foreign climbers must pay a fee of $11,000 for a spring summit of Everest, and provide a doctor's note attesting to their fitness.
A few reasons made last week on Everest such a crowded one, in which eight people died in two days. One factor is that China has limited the permits for the Tibetan side of the mountain, driving more people to the Nepalese side.
Another factor is weather. Alan Arnette, a four-time Everest climber, told CNN that bad weather left just five days ideal for reaching the summit. ""So you have 800 people trying to squeeze through a very small window,"" he said.
Hence the traffic. ""There were more people on Everest than there should be,"" Kul Bahadur Gurung, general secretary of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, a group comprising all expedition operators in Nepal, told the AP.
Now Nepal's tourist board finds itself working to counter the narrative of that viral photo. On Tuesday, the tourism board's social media accounts shared a tweet by Nepali climber Karma Tenzing .
""Everest unfairly trashed via viral image of 'traffic jam' on May 22 2019,"" he wrote . ""Below are REAL photos of my climb to Summit on May 15. Devoid of jams & I spent an HOUR at summit. With only a 3-4 day weather window & ~300 Everest Summiteer annually, jams will exist. Spread the truth!""

"After Deadly Season On Everest, Nepal Has No Plans To Issue Fewer Permits",www.npr.org,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727707684/after-deadly-season-on-everest-nepal-has-no-plans-to-issue-fewer-permits,"Enlarge this image Eleven people have died climbing Mount Everest so far this year, amid long lines to reach the peak last week.

toggle caption Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty Images Eleven people have died climbing Mount Everest so far this year, amid long lines to reach the peak last week.
Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty Images Nepal's tourism board is defending the number of permits it issued to climb Mount Everest for this season in which 11 people have died. And the country says it has no plans to restrict the number of permits issued next year, but rather that it hopes to attract still more tourists and climbers.
""There has been concern about the number of climbers on Mount Everest, but it is not because of the traffic jam that there were casualties,"" Mohan Krishna Sapkota, secretary at the country's Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, told The Associated Press. He instead pointed to weather conditions, insufficient oxygen supplies and equipment.
""In the next season, we will work to have double rope in the area below the summit so there is better management of the flow of climbers,"" he told the news service.
The image of a crowded Everest linked to the death toll was spurred by a viral photo last week that showed climbers in their neon gear, packed in a tight, unforgiving queue to the highest point on Earth.

Nirmal Purja/AP ""You essentially have something that looks like people are waiting in line for concert tickets to a sold-out show, only instead of trying to get in to see their favorite artist, they're trying to reach the top of the world and are running into traffic,"" Outside magazine editor at large Grayson Schaffer told NPR's Weekend Edition .
It's a traffic jam that can turn fatal.
""The danger there is that, at that altitude, the body just can't survive,"" Schaffer said. ""They're breathing bottled oxygen. And when that oxygen runs out because you're waiting in line, you are at much higher risk for developing high-altitude edemas and altitude sickness — and dying of those illnesses while you're still trying to reach the summit.""
National American Man Dies Just After Achieving Dream Of Reaching Summit Of Mount Everest Everest's very highest reaches are known as the death zone. And once a climber reaches it, all bets are off.
""Once you get above about 25,000 feet, your body just can't metabolize the oxygen,"" said Schaffer, who has been to Everest but not the death zone. ""Your muscles start to break down. You start to have fluid that builds up around your lungs and your brain. Your brain starts to swell. You start to lose cognition. Your decision making starts to become slow. And you start to make bad decisions.""
And that breakdown in cognition is happening to people who have often flown hundreds or thousands of miles and paid significant sums of money to achieve their dream of reaching the top.
""The reason that people try to climb Mount Everest is because it grabs a hold of them and they feel like they just have to make the summit,"" Schaffer said. ""And so you'll have some people in distress and not necessarily getting help from the people who are around them. It's this kind of bizarre thing to be surrounded by hundreds of people, and yet totally alone at the top of the world.""

Free-Range Food Labels: Can My Groceries Really Help The Planet? : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/23/726252987/free-range-food-labels-can-my-groceries-really-help-the-planet,"Enlarge this image Lindsey Balbierz for NPR Lindsey Balbierz for NPR So many food labels proclaim their eco-virtues these days — organic. Pasture-raised. Cage-free. Non-GMO. What do they actually mean? Here are six ways to make sense of it all.
Beware of ill-defined labels. It's easy to call food ""natural"" or ""sustainable,"" because there's no legal standard for what those words mean. An ""organic"" label does have a clear meaning, and it's enforced. Organic food delivers environmental benefits, but the food itself may not be better for you. ""Non-GMO"" is not organic. The food was still grown with pesticides. If you want to be sure that your milk or eggs come from animals that got to live outdoors, look for a third party on the label, such as Animal Welfare Approved or American Grassfed Association — or organic. ""Fair Trade"" products deliver a little extra money to small farmers who are organized into cooperatives. Don't let labels stress you out. When it comes to solving the world's problems, your shopping decisions aren't nearly as important as political decisions. The Salt Why Food Reformers Have Mixed Feelings About Eco-Labels For this episode we spoke with Rebecca Thistlethwaite , who manages the Niche Meat Processor Assistance Network at Oregon State University and co-authored a book on raising and selling ethical meat ; Matt Dillon, who grew up on a farm in Nebraska and now works as Clif Bar & Company 's director of agricultural policy and programs; and Kim Elena Ionescu, chief sustainability officer for the Specialty Coffee Association .

At least 12 people were injured in a massive rain-wrapped tornado that touched down to the west of Kansas City, Kan., on Tuesday.
The large and dangerous twister hit just outside of Lawrence, ripped through Pleasant Grove, Bonner Springs and Linwood, in what has become a brutal stretch of severe weather across the central and southern plains that has left chaos and destruction in its wake.
""Houses were damaged and destroyed for a mile in any direction,"" The Kansas City Star wrote about the devastation in Linwood, a city with a population of about 375 people.
Kim Buchanan, deputy director of Emergency Management in Leavenworth County, estimated about 30 houses in the area were damaged, NPR member station KCUR reported .
""It is something we haven't seen in Leavenworth County in a very long time,"" Buchanan said.

In Lawrence, the police department said the tornado struck just outside of the city limits. Although the city was spared, officials said on Twitter, ""Large trees, power lines, and debris"" were strewn along roads on the southeastern end of the city, making some impassable.
""Please do not go sight seeing tornado damage,"" the department pleaded. ""This only hampers the efforts of emergency workers."" Large trees, power lines, and debris are along roads on the southeastern edge of the city. Some are impassable. Please do not go sight seeing tornado damage.

Lawrence Memorial Hospital said a dozen patients were being treated at the facility.
""LMH Health is treating 12 patients with injuries from the tornado,"" officials said on Twitter. ""One is in surgery. No conditions or status are available. Neighbors are streaming into the hospital seeking shelter.""
Photos taken by The Weather Channel reporter Charles Peek, demonstrate the capriciousness and unpredictability of powerful tornadoes. In one shot, rain is pouring into the living room of a house with the roof torn off leaving the interior space in shambles. Meanwhile, an etagere shelf with what appears to be several delicate ceramic water pitchers remain untouched.

The Associated Press reported that the town of Bonner Springs endured a serious battering with toppled trees, power outages and structural damage to buildings.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in person at a bilateral summit in Russia on Thursday, as U.S.-North Korea nuclear talks remain at a stalemate.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
A little more than a year ago, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, had never traveled outside his country on diplomatic missions. Well, he's become quite a globetrotter now. He's gone to China, South Korea, Singapore and Vietnam to meet with world leaders, and now Kim has arrived in the Russian port city of Vladivostok, where he's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow. NPR's Anthony Kuhn is following this from Tokyo.
Hi, Anthony.
ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Hey there, David.
GREENE: I guess some geography here - Vladivostok is actually a lot closer to North Korea than it is to Moscow. It's Putin who had the long trip here.
KUHN: That's right. If he flies, he has an 8 1/2-hour flight. Kim, on the other hand, is taking a train, so it's going to take him a bit longer, even though Vladivostok is in his backyard. But he's already there. We've seen him on TV exiting his train and being greeted by Russian officials. He's expected to meet with Putin one-on-one on Thursday and then go into a bigger meeting. He'll probably tour the city a bit and then head back to North Korea on Friday. And the Kremlin is saying that Putin and Kim are going to be discussing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
GREENE: Why now? What's the timing of this visit, do you think?
KUHN: Well, as you noted, Kim was in diplomatic isolation until last year. And you know, Russia is North Korea's second main ally, really, after China. And the Soviet Union was North Korea's first main backer; they installed Kim Jong Un's grandfather as the country's leader after World War II. So there's a lot of historical significance, and Kim has to make up for lost time.
GREENE: I want to play a little bit of tape here of President Trump. This was Trump back in February in Hanoi, where he was meeting with Kim. The two were shaking hands in front of the media.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think that your country has tremendous economic potential - unbelievable, unlimited. And I think that you will have a tremendous future with your country - a great leader. And I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen, and we will help it to happen.
GREENE: Now, of course, Anthony, Trump and Kim's meeting ended early; there was no agreement. So I guess - I wonder, is this Kim saying, OK, if nothing feels like it's moving forward with the United States, I'm going to reach out to more traditional allies now?
KUHN: That's definitely part of it. I mean, you know, Trump walking out of the summit saying that, you know, this is a bad deal, and we can't accept it, was a tremendous loss of face for Kim, especially to a domestic audience, and he's trying to repair that damage. So what he's saying now is, following Hanoi, we're going to try to rely on ourselves to get through the sanctions, we're going to hold out hope still of a third summit with Trump, but we're also going to explore alternative options - Plan B is China, with which they do most of their business, and Plan C is Russia.
GREENE: Well, if the Kremlin and Russia are saying that the goal is denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, I mean, what does Putin bring to the table? What does he have to offer?
KUHN: Well, economically, he doesn't have much; the two sides only did $34 million in trade last year, mostly because of sanctions. You've got North Koreans working in Russia, doing things like working as lumberjacks, but because of the sanctions, they're going to come home. So Putin really, I think, wants influence and leverage in the region, and it's really very symbolic. He doesn't have a lot of money, which is what Kim needs.
GREENE: Think this could put pressure on President Trump to come back to the negotiating table, if he's watching these two leaders' meeting?
KUHN: Yes, well, people have - in the Russian media, people have voiced that hope; it's impossible to tell. But they are going to talk about denuclearization, and the U.S. is clearly interested in this visit because the U.S. special envoy on North Korea, Stephen Biegun, paid a visit to Moscow just ahead of Kim's trip.
GREENE: NPR's Anthony Kuhn reporting on this meeting between Kim and Putin. He's been following this from Tokyo. Antony, thanks as always.
KUHN: You're welcome, David.

Laurel Morales/KJZZ Neda Billie has been waiting to turn on lights in her home for 15 years.
""We've been living off those propane lanterns,"" she says. ""Now we don't have to have flashlights everywhere. All the kids have a flashlight so when they get up in the middle of the night like to use the restroom they have a flashlight to go to [the outhouse].""
Billie, her husband and their five kids live in a tiny, one-room hogan, a traditional Navajo home. Their three sheep graze on sagebrush that carpets the rolling hills of Dilkon, Ariz., on the Navajo Nation, the largest Native American reservation in the U.S.
They watch two men in a cherry picker hook up the last power line to their home. Billie says they've gone through too many generators to count.
""My two boys, they have really bad allergies and they have asthma, so sometimes they need the nebulizer,"" Billie says. ""So we usually go to my mom's house, travel in the middle of the night over there back and forth.""
Shots - Health News Poll: Many Rural Americans Struggle With Financial Insecurity, Access To Health Care The Billies are not alone. About 10% of Navajos on the reservation live without electricity. And as much as 40% of them have to haul their water and use outhouses. A poll of rural Americans conducted by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that more than a quarter of Native Americans have experienced problems with electricity, the Internet and with the safety of their drinking water.

Laurel Morales/KJZZ Northern Arizona University professor Manley Begay Jr. , who is Navajo, says the numbers are probably even higher. Begay says electricity provides more than just light. With electricity, a family can pump water, charge their phone, store food, even get and maintain a job.
""Electricity itself provides a tremendous amount of convenience and having access to the world at large,"" Begay says. ""You can just imagine if you were to fill out an application for a job, you do it online and you send it in. Or you're Googling for information — if you don't have electricity, you're in trouble.""
Begay says he recently saw something strange when he pulled into a hotel parking lot in Window Rock, Ariz., the capital of the Navajo Nation. He noticed a bunch of teenagers in their cars.
""You could tell that they were high school students,"" Begay says. ""They were doing their homework outside this hotel in the parking lot. They had the light on in their cars and doing their homework. It became quite clear that they didn't have Internet.""

""We'll get a meter going and you should have electricity,"" Cooper says. ""Can't wait to see the real smile here in a minute. Don't cover it up! I want to see it! That's what joy looks like.""
Cooper traveled from New Mexico along with several other crews from around the country volunteering their time to connect people like the Billies to the power grid.

Laurel Morales/KJZZ On the Navajo Nation, the homes are so spread out that it costs $40,000 on average to hook up one home to the grid. And half the tribe is unemployed. So you can't raise rates to energize all those homes. The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority and the nonprofit American Public Power Association have put a call out to utilities across the U.S. to help.
""I had no idea there were people still in 2019 without power,"" Cooper says.
Finally, after waiting for so long, the Billies watch the foreman turn on the meter behind their house and snap the cover shut. Neda then runs inside to flip the switch.
""It's so exciting to finally have electricity here after so many years without it,"" Billie says. ""My kids are going to be so happy. They keep asking every day. ... They go, 'Mom we're going to have light! We're going to finally have light!' ""
Now the family will wait and pray for running water and Internet.

Meredith Rizzo/NPR Dan Efseaff, the parks and recreation director for the devastated town of Paradise, Calif., looks out over Little Feather River Canyon in Butte County. The Camp Fire raced up this canyon like a blowtorch in a paper funnel on its way to Paradise, incinerating most everything in its path, including scores of homes.
Efseaff is floating an idea that some may think radical: paying people not to rebuild in this slice of canyon: ""The whole community needs some defensible space,"" he says.
Residents would get expanded green space for recreation and a vital safety buffer to help protect Paradise from future fire calamities. ""We would work with either landowners on easements,"" he suggests, ""or looking at them from a standpoint of some purchases in here.""
""There are areas you just don't build in,"" he says.

Meredith Rizzo/NPR The disaster industrial complex
He is up against the two-centuries-old American ethos to build, build, build, no matter the costs or the wisdom. It's an ethos baked into the federal disaster response system, what critics call the ""disaster industrial complex"" — a system constructed around responding to natural disasters, delivering immediate and long-term aid.
Politicians vow to rebuild.
The federal agencies swoop in.
The signs sprout: ""Paradise Strong!"" and ""We Will Rebuild!""
But wildfire and recovery experts warn that this immediate impulse to re-create what was there before the disaster is misguided, expensive and dangerous.
There need to be more areas where building is limited, they argue, especially with the extraordinary buildup of forest fuels after a century of suppressing wildfire and a warming climate.

Meredith Rizzo/NPR The career fire, over and over again
Many veteran wildland firefighters are saying the same thing.
""Every year, starting at about 2014, we thought we were seeing the career fire. We thought, 'We can't get much worse.' And every year it was getting worse,"" says Ken Pimlott, who fought wildfires and led men and women doing the same for more than three decades. Pimlott recently retired as the director of the state agency known as Cal Fire. ""Firefighters are seeing and living climate change firsthand,"" he says.
His last five or six seasons, Pimlott says, you could feel the difference in the winds: more intense gusts fueling blowtorch-fast blazes that were bigger and lasted longer.

Meredith Rizzo/NPR ""You know, we're recording 70- and 80-mile-an-hour gusts in many of the locations where these fires are occurring,"" he says. In the 2017 Thomas Fire in Southern California, a red flag alert — the highest fire and wind warning — lasted for an unprecedented 13 days.
""These aren't random. These are truly weather pattern changes that are being fueled by a changing climate,"" he warns.
National More Than 1,000 Families Still Searching For Homes 6 Months After The Camp Fire In the past two years California has seen its deadliest and most destructive wildfires on record, including the Camp Fire in Butte County, which killed 85 people in and around Paradise and torched more than 19,000 structures.
Wildland urban interface
I met up with Pimlott in the Pine Hill Preserve in Cameron Park, a suburban community in the Sierra Nevada foothills 30-plus miles east of Sacramento.
I worry about it every day. There are hundreds of communities like those just here in California. It's just a matter of time.
Ken Pimlott, former Cal Fire chief
Cameron Park is a small example of a big problem across the West: Wooden backyard fences for comfortable homes mark a fragile, artificial line between wildland and suburbia. It's the classic wildland urban interface. The growth of these areas where homes and forests mix is a fire challenge across the country.
This community is galvanizing itself like it's galvanizing itself for a war.
Reinette Senum, vice mayor, Nevada City, Calif.
""We really need to change the conversation to ahead of the fire occurring,"" Pimlott says.
Across the West, as development expands into this interface, Pimlott says, it is a kind of ticking firebomb. The potential site of future Paradises. ""I worry about it every day. There are hundreds of communities like those just here in California. It's just a matter of time.""

In determining fire risk throughout the year, Cal Fire measures the moisture content of different parts of various vegetation, including manzanita.
Meredith Rizzo/NPR In California, the challenge is acute: About quarter of the state's population — 11 million people — lives in high- or very high-fire-risk areas. One in three homes in the state is in this fire-prone area — from parts of Malibu to the Oakland hills to Paradise. Research shows that 75 percent of buildings destroyed by wildfire in California are in these WUI zones.
I don't know what more proof you need of the sense of urgency.
Gov. Gavin Newsom
A 1991 wildfire in the steep, densely populated Oakland and Berkeley hills killed 25 people and destroyed nearly 3,500 homes and apartments. That firestorm prompted the state to better map fire hazard zones and create tough new building codes for fire safety.
During an April 2019 visit to those same East Bay hills that burned, Gov. Gavin Newsom made the case for better fire preparedness. ""Over the last two years we've lost 139 lives; 2.8 million acres have been lost to wildfires,"" Newsom said. ""Ten of the most destructive fires have happened since just 2015. ... I don't know what more proof you need of the sense of urgency.""

Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR Defensible spaces, areas of cleared land around a home, act as a buffer between houses and potentially flammable vegetation.
Meredith Rizzo/NPR Defensible space is not enough
Encouraging people to have an evacuation plan and create a 100-foot buffer of ""defensible space"" around their home — what firefighters have traditionally called basic wildfire preparation — are definitely important, Pimlott says.
But it's not enough. He would like to see the Paradise tragedy spur broader discussions about where people can safely live.
""Certainly I'm not advocating a ban on building in the urban interface. I think that obviously people are going to move and [there's] landowner rights, all of that,"" he says. ""But at the end of the day we need to be looking at every development at every home and seeing if we can mitigate all aspects of [wildfire] before we build. And if we can't, then maybe we have to make a decision that that's not the right place.""
California lawmakers are not seriously debating new limits on where people build. Plans for new, large developments in fire-prone areas continue, many prompting lawsuits . And some warn it's not practical to relocate or buy out hundreds of thousands of people. But Paradise has changed the conversation.
After the Camp Fire leveled the town, Newsom declared a state of emergency — suspending some environmental regulations to fast-track tree removal, fuel reduction and firebreaks in 35 fire-vulnerable areas around the state.
Newsom has also beefed up spending on firefighting, including new equipment and training, and has added funds to assess the effects of power line de-energizing by utilities in response to wildfires, and more.

Meredith Rizzo/NPR The next Paradise
But many fire-exposed communities remain scared. They want bolder action. Post-Paradise, communities are ""hardening"" their towns against wildfire like never before.
""This community is galvanizing itself like it's galvanizing itself for a war,"" says Reinette Senum, a vice mayor of Nevada City, Calif. It's a gold rush mining town in the Sierra foothills packed with lots of lovely old Victorian homes — made of wood.
""This was the first we saw forest fires obliterate whole towns. That was a game-changer for us,"" says Senum.
We're going to be back in these communities time and time again rebuilding. We're going to be spending months looking for people. Bodies of people in rubble. And we can't keep doing that.
Ken Pimlott
Hardening this tourist-dependent town includes a mix of low- and high-tech.
The town is reinstalling old-school emergency alert sirens to warn residents of a coming firestorm. Senum says the last two fire seasons exposed shocking flaws in phone- and broadcast-based alert systems. In Paradise, only about a third of the few who had signed up for phone warnings actually received the alert.
""And many of them perished waiting for that call or that text. We're bringing back old-fashioned, hard-wired sirens with battery backup, a solar backup,"" Senum explained. Nevada City hopes to have them up and running by early summer.
Some neighbors, Senum says, are now talking about investing in full-body fire-resistant suits — like the ones NASCAR drivers use — in case they have to flee a fast-moving inferno like the one that hit Paradise.
All over town, lower branches on trees around homes are freshly trimmed so any wildfire can't ""ladder"" up into the tree's crowns and grow.
The vice mayor also started a successful ""goat fund me"" campaign this spring to pay for brigades of hungry, brush-eating goats to munch away fuel on fire-prone hillsides and parks. The goats were helped by volunteer software engineers who aligned maps to direct the goats.

And they have done much more.
""That deck wraps around the house and it's made out of a plastic composite; at least [it] is retarded for flames and embers,"" she says, touring me around the outside.

Meredith Rizzo/NPR Paying for wildfire resilience
But retrofitting is expensive. ""So many people just don't have the dollars or the capacity physically to do that,"" says Senum. ""So we're constantly talking about how we can help those who can't help themselves.""
California currently does almost nothing to incentivize or help homeowners pay to prepare their homes for wildfire safety, as it does for earthquakes. State and local authorities offer up to $3,000 and insurance discounts to help homeowners retrofit for quakes. A bill to create a $1 billion fund to create a similar program for wildfire retrofits has effectively stalled in the state Legislature. The bill by Assemblymember Jim Wood (D-Santa Rosa) is moving forward but was stripped of any funding. ""Assemblymember Wood will continue to fight for this program whether it is in this bill or in another larger bill around wildfire-related issues,"" his spokeswoman Cathy Mudge told NPR.
Newsom says he supports the idea, but funding it is the big question. ""We'll try to do our best,"" Newsom told reporters recently.
The need is enormous. California already has the nation's strictest building standards for fire protection. But that's only for homes built after 2008. Tens of thousands of homes in the state were not built to the newer, tougher standards.
That's a major problem.
Reports by McClatchy, The Associated Press and partner papers showed that more than half of the homes in the path of the Camp Fire built to those stricter codes were largely undamaged. But just 18% of homes built before 2008 survived the blaze.

Meredith Rizzo/NPR Climate scientist Shaye Wolf with the Center for Biological Diversity says that it is shortsighted not to invest in retrofits now: ""In this era of climate change, with so many homes in fire-prone ecosystems, it's absolutely essential that ... state and local governments do a much better job of preparing homes and communities to make those homes as fire resistant as possible,"" Wolf says. ""That's where the money needs to be invested."" She criticized the governor's emergency declaration as misguided.
""Cal Fire is thinning forests away from where most Californians live and far from areas with big risks of wind-driven fires,"" Wolf says. ""The governor should reject this doomed, destructive approach and direct funding toward proven fire-safety strategies like retrofitting homes and improving defensible space around them.""
Retrofitting may be costly, but building new homes to be wildfire-resistant can significantly reduce loss, says Kelly Pohl with Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit land management research group. A study by the group shows the cost is not prohibitive .
Mindset change; personal responsibility
Two-plus hours southeast of Paradise, the Lake Tahoe tourist town of Truckee is also ""hardening"" itself for wildfire in new ways. The town, surrounded by national forest land, has accelerated work to expand key firebreaks around the area by thinning forest to create a protective ""halo.""
Enlarge this image In an effort to reduce fire risk in Truckee, the fire department banned backyard campfires during fire season. Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR In an effort to reduce fire risk in Truckee, the fire department banned backyard campfires during fire season.
Meredith Rizzo/NPR And in a major move for a tourist-dependent area that will soon crowd with summer renters, Truckee has banned the use of charcoal BBQs and wood-burning campfires this summer, except in designated campgrounds with metal fire pits.
""On the wrong day with high winds, that's a recipe for disaster,"" says Truckee Fire Protection District Chief Bill Seline. Sometimes careless renters dump coals into a grassy or wooded area behind their rental home, ""and next day the winds pick up, the temperatures heat up and next thing you know we're chasing a wildfire through a neighborhood,"" Seline says.

Seline says those moves are all important. But they're not effective without homeowners taking action themselves, especially when it comes to planning and evacuation.
Fire and police, of course, will have a robust wildfire and evacuation response, Seline says. ""But the third leg of the stool is personal responsibility ... having your own personal plan: How are you going to get out of the neighborhood? Have you thought about evacuation? What you are going to take? Are you familiar with what critical fire weather is? Are you connected to the communication systems that we have in place so that when we and law enforcement agencies communicate with you to get out of the neighborhood, you have a plan and you're ready to go?""

Meredith Rizzo/NPR Beyond defensible space and evacuation plans
Former Cal Fire Director Pimlott believes a big lesson out of the Paradise tragedy has yet to sink in: There needs to be wholesale mindset change about wildfire in the West, he says, by everyone — homeowners, planners, builders and policymakers.
That includes tough choices and decisions about where people can build or rebuild.
""These are hard decisions. They cost money. They may mean land use changes.""
Changes should include embracing more prescribed burns to reduce fuels; expanding fire buffer zones and escape routes for the most susceptible towns; and incentivizing retrofits.

""If we don't look at [wildfire] differently and start making some hard decisions collectively we're going to be back in these communities time and time again rebuilding. We're going to be spending months looking for people. Bodies of people in rubble,"" he warns. ""And we can't keep doing that."""

NOEL KING, HOST:
More than 500 kids are showing off their mastery of spelling this week at the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Karthik Nemmani from McKinney, Texas, won last year. Here he is.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""92ND SCRIPPS NATIONAL SPELLING BEE"")
KARTHIK NEMMANI: Koinonia - K, O, I, N, O, N, I, A - koinonia.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: That is correct.
(APPLAUSE)
KING: There is always plenty of drama, and this year's opening round on Tuesday was no exception. Thirteen-year-old Max Greenspan was spelling out mot juste, a French phrase that means the exact right word, and he paused a few seconds to figure out whether to add a final E when a judge rang the bell to declare that Max had spelled the word wrong. But after a review, Max was reinstated, since there is no rule against pausing in the middle of a word. Shalini Shankar's most recent book is about the latest generation of spellers.
SHALINI SHANKAR: I've seen the competition get much more intense, and it's also grown in terms of broader interest and the number of kids who come to D.C.
KING: Your book focuses on Generation Z spellers, so kids who were born '96, '97 or after. How does their work ethic differ from kids who were born earlier?
SHANKAR: Well, any kid who makes it to the National Spelling Bee is going to have worked hard to get there. But what spellers need to do now to become competitive and advance in the contest is so much more intense. So they spend hours before school, after school, on weekends really honing their craft to become elite spellers.
KING: And is this beneficial to kids? Because it sounds a little sad, I mean, the idea that a kid could be outside playing and instead is inside with a dictionary.
SHANKAR: I think it's a version of childhood that is becoming more and more common today - kids who are specializing and becoming experts in really esoteric things and becoming masters at them very young. And so I think these kids enjoy it to the degree that one can enjoy being so intensively focused on something.
KING: One thing about your book that I like was you point out how media-savvy some of these kids are. I mean, you think of them as - and I say this as a former speller - you think of them as nerds, but they are really comfortable around TV cameras. They do interviews. They're on ESPN. It's extraordinary.
SHANKAR: It is. They are very comfortable with the camera, or at least they become comfortable over time. They also love the exposure. They work so hard, and I think when they finally get that moment to shine, they want that, and they take it.
KING: We talk a lot in this country about whether or not we're putting kids under too much pressure to compete. Let me ask you two questions. In your book, you point out that a lot of the kids tell you it's not so much that they're competing with each other, they're competing with the dictionary. Do you believe them?
SHANKAR: I do believe them.
KING: Yeah?
SHANKAR: In part because there's such an element of luck involved in which word they get and whether they know it. So I'll hear from some kids that they didn't know another kid's word in the same round, but they knew theirs, and so they advance. So if they learn the dictionary to the degree that they need to, they can win.
KING: And you point out that some of these relationships between kids and families go on for years after the spelling bee.
SHANKAR: They do, and often there are younger siblings who start to get involved, and there are just family and community members who get drawn to it because one speller has done really well. So that legacy continues.
KING: Legacy spellers, I love that idea.
SHANKAR: Yeah.
KING: Shalini Shankar's latest book is ""Beeline: What Spelling Bees Reveal About Generation Z's New Path To Success.""
Shalini, thanks so much.
SHANKAR: Thank you so much.

In Oklahoma, Tulsa and other nearby communities are in a tense standoff with the raging Arkansas River. The river has already flooded hundreds of homes and businesses.
NOEL KING, HOST:
In Oklahoma, Tulsa and areas around that city are in a kind of standoff with the Arkansas River. Hundreds of homes and businesses have already been flooded, and Governor Kevin Stitt is counting on levees to keep the damage from getting worse.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KEVIN STITT: We've just got to pray for no rain up north. And if we keep getting rain into that watershed, there could be some serious problems.
KING: Because, as NPR's Frank Morris reports, the old levees protecting the Tulsa area are starting to show their age.
FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Sand Springs, Okla., straddles the Arkansas River just west of Tulsa. It's a working-class suburb complete with a big, old steel mill and, until last week, an expansive riverfront park.
BEAU WILSON: This is a major feather in our cap, and probably 90% of the park, at this point, is inundated by water.
MORRIS: Beau Wilson's forefathers worked at the steel mill here. He's a city councilman with an insurance business looking out at a lot of brown water where the city's new park used to be. His grandparents and aunt and uncle are flooded out, too, along with hundreds of others in this town. But what worries him are the levees, like this one downstream from the park.
WILSON: And it's an earthen levee made out of dirt and sand 70 years ago.
MORRIS: The Arkansas River has climbed this far up on the levees before once and for only a few hours. Wilson says this time the river could rage at near-record levels for a week, and that's without more rain. The Army Corps of Engineers is letting 275,000 cubic feet of water per second roar out of the Keystone Dam just upstream from Sand Springs, close to record flows. The levees are stressed; they're leaking.
UNIDENTIFIED OFFICER: Stop your vehicle.
MORRIS: Police keep drivers back from the section where floodwater runs from the levee, as construction crews heap sand around its base. It's starting to rain, and businesses in the shadow of this levee are scrambling. Kathy Adams (ph) is rushing to empty a construction company warehouse.
KATHY ADAMS: We're taking about everything out - the lumber, buildings and everything.
MORRIS: Why's that?
ADAMS: Well, afraid of the levee breaking and flooding.
MORRIS: Even without breaking, the old, saturated levee is slowly failing. Val Silcox (ph) points out water bubbling up from under the pavement, perhaps 40 feet from the levee, into the building that she and Adams are unpacking.
VAL SILCOX: We're evacuating. The water's rising behind us. It's coming up under the concrete. It's getting wetter and wetter.
MORRIS: Out front, Silcox's husband, Cleven Silcox (ph), hustles to truck what he can out of the yard - lumber, small wooden sheds, piles of sheet metal. Time is running out.
CLEVEN SILCOX: There's water all underneath this property, and we're getting stuck with our forklifts, where this is hard gravel. It's been here for years, and it's never been an issue. But the water has undermined it. So therefore, our forklifts are getting stuck.
MORRIS: So it's time to go.
C SILCOX: It's time to go.
MORRIS: Sand Springs has flooded before, but the levees protecting the town have always held. But Wilson fears that this could be the time they fail.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
We've heard about the way that mainstream political parties have lost ground in Europe. The traditional parties were hammered in EU elections the other day. Now let's talk of one party that gained - the pro-environment Green Party. Group leader Ska Keller offered an explanation for its success.
SKA KELLER: I think this has to do with people wanting a positive vision of the European Union but also wanting change and people asking for concrete steps to fight the climate crisis.
INSKEEP: German politician Terry Reintke is an elected Green Party member of the European Parliament, and she's on the line.
Welcome to the program.
TERRY REINTKE: Hello.
INSKEEP: OK, so Keller calls it a positive vote, a positive vision. But isn't this really a negative message being sent by a lot of voters against the bigger parties? You're a beneficiary of that.
REINTKE: Not at all. There was a story going around that only with anti-immigration sentiment, with, you know, hardening laws on security, you can win elections. And this was also expected for the European elections that the far right would massively gain. And the exact opposite happened. People stood up for the environment. They stood up for social rights. They stood up for rule of law and democracy. And that's why the Greens have such a good result in so many EU member states.
INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about your central issue - climate change. Is there a consensus in Europe about what to do about climate?
REINTKE: Well, I think that we have concepts on the table. Now we need to find majorities that we can actually put them into practice. We are negotiating with all the pro-European forces in the European Parliament right now. And we'll have to see if what the other parties said in the election campaign actually boils down to having a consensus on moving there. But we are not only negotiating about environmental issues. We are also negotiating about strengthening fundamental rights, about strengthening social justice in Europe. And that will be a very, very difficult negotiation.
INSKEEP: We should remind people that multiple parties end up with large blocs of seats in the European Parliament after this election. There's likely to be some kind of coalition. Do you expect, then, to be in a governing position as a party?
REINTKE: Well, as you know in Germany, the Greens are already in government in a lot of states. So we have a lot of experience when it comes to governing. The situation in the European Parliament is slightly different. But, indeed, we hope that now after this election, where we have gained a lot of support, where we have gained a lot of trust, that we can actually boil that - make that into a real political action. And so we are ready to take that challenge, and we will see how the negotiations go.
INSKEEP: I want to circle back to the question of how far European voters might be willing to go because, as you know, I'm sure, far better than I, scientists indicate that dramatic, dramatic economic changes would be called for in a relatively short period of time to deal with climate change. Do you think European voters are there - that they will be fine with profoundly changing where they get their energy from - changing every car to electric, whatever needs to be done?
REINTKE: Well, you see right now, every single Friday in many European cities, we have hundreds of thousands and millions of young people, also older people on the street saying that we need to act on the climate now. We have about 10 years left to make this a successful story, to make sure that this planet will be livable also after 2050. And I think that it will be a global challenge. And I hope that Europe will lead the way in order to make the world more ready for the climate change and to protect the climate as we have it now.
INSKEEP: Do you still face factions in Europe that are something like, well, the Republican Party here in the United States, where they're skeptical of the science, and, entirely aside from the science, they're not really eager to put a lot of restrictions on the economy?
REINTKE: Yes, and if you look at the far right in Europe, they are climate deniers. They are people who still say humans don't have anything to do with that. Obviously, if you look at the scientific results of the very, very, very, very big majority of scientists, it's absolutely clear that we have to do something, that we have to work on how we produce energy, how we move around, how our economy works. And I hope that we will have a big coalition here in the European Parliament to make these changes happen.
INSKEEP: Ms. Reintke, thanks so much.
REINTKE: Thank you.
INSKEEP: Terry Reintke is a Green Party member of the European Parliament.

Traffic Jam Of Climbers Makes The Trip Up Everest Even More Deadly,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727796661/traffic-jam-of-climbers-makes-the-trip-up-everest-even-more-deadly,"NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Dan Richards, CEO of Global Rescue, about crowding on the summit of Mount Everest, and what could be done to reduce the number of climbers dying.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
A photo taken near the summit of Mount Everest is bringing new attention to the world's highest mountain. This snapshot shows a long line of climbers waiting for their turn to summit Everest. It looks like, I don't know, people standing in line for a Disney ride or a Black Friday sale, except they are packed on a trail, on a snowy mountain, within what is called the death zone, which is called that for a reason. Grayson Schaffer, editor at large of Outside magazine, told NPR's Weekend Edition what happens in the thin air.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GRAYSON SCHAFFER: Your body just can't metabolize the oxygen. Your muscles start to break down. You start to have fluid that builds up around your lungs and in your brain. Your brain starts to swell. You start to lose cognition. Your decision-making starts to become slow, and you start to make bad decisions. And all of this is happening in the face of, you know, each person trying to sort of reach their ultimate dream.
INSKEEP: At least 11 people have died so far this season, the latest an American attorney who died Monday after reaching the summit. Dan Richards is CEO of Global Rescue, one of the major rescuers on the mountain, when they're needed. He joins us from Vermont Public Radio's studio in Norwich, Vt. Good morning.
DAN RICHARDS: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: What's making this such a deadly year?
RICHARDS: Well, there's really a variety of factors. The first and foremost is there have been more climbing permits issued this year than in any year in past history. There are about 381 climbing permits for climbers that have been issued and an equal number for Sherpas and guides. So you have more people in that environment than you've had in past years. That's No. 1. No. 2 - there was a very brief weather window for people to try and get to the summit of Mount Everest, and what you ended up finding were all these folks trying to get to the top and in a very brief period of time, and that resulted in a big traffic jam, as you've seen in some of the pictures.
INSKEEP: Is the crowd itself inherently dangerous - people get in each other's way and cause each other to make mistakes?
RICHARDS: Oh, absolutely. When you get into, as you just described, or Grayson just described, the death zone, you've got a limited amount of time to do what it is that you need to do to get to the summit. And every minute that you are delayed because somebody is in your way, or where you're having some kind of a technical problem with your equipment or your ropes, increases the risk.
INSKEEP: And when you say limited amount of time, it's because your body is gradually being destroyed up there; that's why your time is limited?
RICHARDS: Above 8,000 meters, your body cannot get enough oxygen to sustain itself, and you slowly start to die. And virtually, all of the climbers that go to Everest use supplemental oxygen, and those oxygen supplies are limited by what you can carry on your back and what your Sherpas can carry on their backs. And when that oxygen runs out, you can get into real trouble, and your decision-making becomes compromised, your brain starts to - and your skull cavity starts to fill with fluid; it's called cerebral edema. Your lungs start to fill with fluid. And ultimately, you die.
INSKEEP: When you said that Nepal has given an unusually - or sold an unusually large number of permits, is that purely driven by market demand, by which I mean do they sell a permit to anybody who asks for one, regardless of how many people show up?
RICHARDS: It's sort of amazing that, you know, in the United States or most countries, to get a license to drive a car you have to take a test, a written test and a driving test. If you want to climb Mount Everest, you need $11,000, and that's it. There is no requirement for skills. There is no test regarding experience. You just need to show up and pay your money.
INSKEEP: If Nepal were to come to you for advice, what would you tell them to change?
RICHARDS: Well, there's a lot of things that could be changed. First and foremost, having an organizing agency or entity that regulates who's going to the summit and when would be right at the top of the list. The second...
INSKEEP: Oh, maybe you could have timed tickets, like for White House tours - only so many people at a time?
RICHARDS: Something like that. It would obviously have to be more structured, given the location. But yes, everybody could be allocated a time slot. The problem is, in that environment, is based on the weather, which is so unpredictable. you're going to end up in a situation where some people who have paid an enormous amount of money - because $11,000 is only for the permit; it doesn't cover the cost of the climb itself...
INSKEEP: Yeah.
RICHARDS: ...Which can exceed $100,000, they may not get to the summit. And that obviously would create a very high degree of dissatisfaction with those folks.
INSKEEP: Mr. Richards, thanks very much for the time and the insights - really appreciate it.
RICHARDS: My pleasure, Steve. Thank you.
INSKEEP: Dan Richards, CEO and founder of Global Rescue.

NPR's Noel King talks to Chris Brice, an official with New Mexico's Luna County, where U.S. border agents dropped off busloads of asylum-seekers, who are waiting for their cases to be processed.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Deming, N.M., is a little desert city. It's less than 40 miles north of the Mexican border, has about 14,000 residents, but it's getting crowded. It's one of the places where U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have dropped off busloads of people who are seeking asylum. Chris Brice is the interim assistant manager of Luna County, where Deming is located. He also manages the town's shelter.
Good morning, Mr. Brice.
CHRIS BRICE: Good morning.
KING: How many people have been dropped off in your town since the buses first came through?
BRICE: A little over 3,000 now.
KING: Little over 3,000 in a town with a population of 14,000 - where are you housing people?
BRICE: We started originally in one of the big, metal buildings that comprises our fair area. And then we moved to an old World War II hangar here at the local airport as a backup.
KING: Wow.
BRICE: So we're using both now.
KING: Have federal officials said why they picked Deming?
BRICE: I don't think they picked Deming necessarily. You know, we just happen to be a big border patrol station as well as our neighboring county. They're dropping off here as well - the Hidalgo County drops here as well.
KING: How are these people - the asylum-seekers being housed in an airport hangar - how are they handling things?
BRICE: You'd be surprised. I think they're - you know, they're a little - you know, I guess they're a little worried when they first show up. But then, I think, it's actually better than most places they've been, and that's what they tell us. So they have more room and more freedom than most places they've been, so they're actually really happy.
KING: And how is the community of Deming handling this influx of new people?
BRICE: On the whole, that - it's been amazing. The volunteers, the support has been amazing. Obviously, there's a small percentage of people who are detractors and don't like the idea at all. But I think most of them are just kind of misinformed on what the status is of the asylum-seekers. And, you know, they want them all to go home, and that's just not possible. But on the whole, it's been really positive.
KING: Well, you mentioned that some residents of your community are curious about the status. I wonder, has Customs and Border Protection told you not just what you're supposed to do with these people but how long you should plan on them being there?
BRICE: Well, first of all they're - they have a legal U.S. status, so there's nothing that we're supposed to do with them.
KING: OK.
BRICE: They could walk away at any given time and go find their own transportation and their own food and the way to their sponsor here in the United States. So, no, I mean, they don't really - they tell us that that's the case. We're really here just to help them transition to their sponsors here in the United States because 90% of them - probably more than that - are actually outside of New Mexico, so...
KING: And are people leaving? Are they getting situated and then moving on to their next destination?
BRICE: They don't - well, they don't leave of their own - they can of their own free will. But they wait until we contact their sponsor or try to set up travel arrangements. And then we typically get them to a bigger hub - a bigger transportation hub, and then they're on their way.
KING: So you're doing a lot of logistics as well. As I understand it, Deming has declared a state of emergency. What does that do for you? What does that get you, if anything?
BRICE: Well, the city - and remember I'm the county, that's the city.
KING: Mmm hmm.
BRICE: They did make an emergency declaration. That was just to free up some funding. And that was, you know, on the governor's word that we would be reimbursed in whole. And it was essentially just so we could spend money to help support these people until they're on to their next destination.
KING: OK, so your understanding is that the federal government is going to pick up the tab for this?
BRICE: No. The governor of the state of New Mexico has assured us that we will be restored for the money that we're spending. She has gone to D.C. to fight for reimbursement for the state and for local entities that are helping with this effort.
KING: She was here recently, in fact. Before I let you go, I wonder, have you been told - you've got 3,000 people come through so far - have you been told whether more are coming?
BRICE: Every day - every day there's...
KING: Every day.
BRICE: ...More coming, absolutely. We average about 220 to 250 a day. And they're saying that that's probably anywhere from six months to 18 to 24 months. We just don't know.
KING: Extraordinary. Chris Brice, the interim assistant manager of Luna County, N.M.

Growing Number Of Turkish Military Officers Seek Asylum In The U.S.,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727796635/growing-number-of-turkish-military-officers-seek-asylum-in-the-u-s,"More than two dozen ex-Turkish military officers are in the U.S. seeking asylum — afraid they'll be jailed if they return home. They say they were falsely accused of taking part in a 2016 coup.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
We have an update today to our story of a former Turkish naval officer. He fled his country with his wife and kids, saying he was wrongly accused of taking part in a coup. When he was on this program yesterday, we disguised his voice to protect his identity.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH NAVAL OFFICER: (Through interpreter) At first, we didn't believe that they would come for us. But one day, one of my supervisors called me and told me that we are suspending your job. I am not involved. I condemned a coup attempt.
INSKEEP: This officer received asylum in the United States to get protection from Turkey, which is a NATO ally. Now, here's the additional information - more than two dozen other former Turkish officers are in this country seeking asylum, afraid they will be jailed if they return home. NPR's Tom Bowman has been following their story for years and is on the line. Tom, good morning.
TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: Who are these officers?
BOWMAN: Well, they're from the Turkish army, navy and air force. They range from major to the senior ranks. And when the coup happened, they were all ordered home from this NATO training command in Norfolk, Va. But they were worried. A fellow Turkish officer at the command obeyed and went home because his wife was sick. She went to the hospital, Steve; he went to jail. So these guys stayed in the Virginia area and are seeking asylum. And they, too, say they played no role in any coup against the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Some work now as commercial airline pilots; others are college professors, high school teachers, and one works as a manager for Amazon. And they've really been embraced by the Norfolk community. They go to Thanksgiving dinners, parties. They have close American military friends. It's really quite extraordinary.
INSKEEP: That is an amazing story. And yet, you mentioned they are waiting for the possibility of asylum. Unlike the person we heard yesterday, they don't have a final determination. They must be living their lives day to day.
BOWMAN: You know, they really are. They've all been interviewed by U.S. officials, so they're hopeful, and the asylum requests are pending. But again, this is unprecedented. You have officers from a NATO country seeking asylum from another NATO country. And Steve, I think it shows that relations with Turkey continue to deteriorate. Some senior U.S. officers I talked with say they know these guys and others arrested in Turkey. They say they're under suspicion not because of any coup activity, but because they either work for NATO, work with Americans, spent time in the U.S. or speak perfect English. And privately, they worry about the Turkish government, as it gets more and more authoritarian and anti-American.
INSKEEP: Well, what is the Turkish government saying, as the United States allows these officers not to return home as ordered and even considers asylum for them?
BOWMAN: You know, nothing really at this point. Turkey's not talking about it. But of course, the asylum requests have not been granted yet; just for that Turkish officer in California. But again, relations are getting worse, and U.S. officials worry about it because Turkey is not only a NATO partner, but it's strategically located in the southern end of Europe. They have a key airfield. They border the Middle East. Some officers I talked with say the relations will continue to spiral downward.
INSKEEP: Trump administration has not been too friendly to asylum-seekers, generally. Have they been welcoming to these guys?
BOWMAN: Well, this all started before the Trump administration, so we'll see what happens. Again, they've been interviewed, but no final decision on the asylum request yet.
INSKEEP: Tom, thanks so much.
BOWMAN: You're welcome, Steve.
INSKEEP: That's NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman.

Violent Clashes Break Out At 4 Prisons In Northern Brazil,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727796621/violent-clashes-break-out-at-4-prisons-in-northern-brazil,"NPR's Noel King talks to Brazilian-based reporter Catherine Osborn about the explosion of gang violence in four prisons in northern Brazil in which nearly 60 inmates died.
NOEL KING, HOST:
In Brazil, at least 55 prison inmates are dead - strangled or stabbed after fights broke out in four different prisons over the weekend. Officials blame gang violence and say they're transferring some of these inmates to other prisons. Reporter Catherine Osborn is on the line from Rio.
Good morning, Catherine.
CATHERINE OSBORN, BYLINE: Morning.
KING: So what is going on with these gangs in Brazilian prisons? This is a lot of people dead.
OSBORN: Yeah. Many drug gangs that operate outside of jails in Brazil in activities like drug trafficking and extortion operate and recruit from inside of the jails. And they're so powerful inside the prisons that, right after arriving, people join the gangs to get some small amount of protection. Prisons have even earned the nickname schools of crime in Brazil.
KING: Wow.
OSBORN: Yeah, and this appears to be linked to a dispute inside one of those gangs.
KING: This happened in four different prisons but almost simultaneously. Was it coordinated?
OSBORN: This happened in Manaus. It's a city in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, and it's a main outpost for commerce, including drug trafficking. And it appears that the prison fight that broke out on Sunday was between two factions inside the same gang. And then the 40 dead bodies that were found by the next day were related to the same dispute. So that dispute was inside the gang Familia do Norte - Family of the North - which controls a main cocaine route through the Amazon's rivers.
KING: All right. So this is obviously very complex if you've got not just gangs fighting each other but factions within gangs fighting each other. The government's response is to say it's going to transfer some of these guys to other prisons. Is that likely to help?
OSBORN: What the government says they're doing is addressing the problem with intelligence, which means being aware of rifts like this inside the gangs before they become violent. Fifty-five dead shows that that strategy failed here. And the governor says he's not renewing the contract of the private company that runs these prisons. Now they are taking these transfer measures. You know, they're using the intelligence that they have to transfer some gang leaders to a maximum security prison and then moving 200 other inmates who they say have received death threats. And that's their measures right now. The city is also under alert. There are police on the streets making sure this doesn't spill out into gun violence on the streets. And, you know, we'll see over the next few days whether that can contain even more possible violence.
KING: Interesting that you say it's a private company that is running these prisons. Given that, why are these facilities so out of control? These are profit-making enterprises.
OSBORN: Watchdog groups have been sending out red flags about prison overcrowding in Brazil for many years now, and so it really is a political will issue. Many experts, after the tragedy of the past few days - including a U.N. spokesperson yesterday - say that to really address this problem, you have to reduce overcrowding. And countrywide, prisons are around 70% over capacity and around 137% in this state alone.
KING: Just quickly - Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, is a guy who talks tough on crime. Has he said anything about this?
OSBORN: He didn't issue a statement about it. When asked about it, his spokesperson said he was saddened. But in the past, he has taken a strong stance on incarceration. He thinks juvenile convicts should be sent to these adult prisons, which experts say would worsen overcrowding and expose young people even earlier to these schools of crime.
KING: Reporter Catherine Osborn from Brazil.
Thanks so much, Catherine.
OSBORN: Thank you.

Morning News Brief,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727796614/morning-news-brief,"Missouri's last clinic that provides abortions is close to losing its license. Oklahoma communities are in a standoff with the raging Arkansas River. New election technology sparks security questions.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Missouri's last health clinic that provides abortions is within days of losing its license. If it does, Missouri would become the only state in this country without an abortion provider.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Right. And unless a court steps in, the state's health department probably won't renew that clinic's license. It expires on Friday. Now, Planned Parenthood runs the center in St. Louis. Their president, Leana Wen, told NPR they've been fighting to keep it open.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LEANA WEN: We have complied with every single regulation that politicians have thrown our way, but the goalpost keeps on changing. And this most recent goalpost is potentially subjecting physicians and training residents, fellows, to criminal prosecution.
KING: That goalpost she's referring to is this requirement that clinicians submit to questioning in order to get the clinic's license renewed.
INSKEEP: Why is that questioning a problem? Well, let's try to find out from Sarah Fentem of St. Louis Public Radio, who's covering this story and is on the line.
Good morning.
SARAH FENTEM, BYLINE: Hi, everyone.
INSKEEP: I can imagine someone from the state saying, listen. We just want to ask some questions, and it's the rule. What is the reason that Planned Parenthood or the employees at this clinic give for not wanting to be questioned?
FENTEM: So that's not 100% clear. Planned Parenthood reps said yesterday that they asked the state if what was said during these interviews could potentially be used against the clinicians, and the state said it couldn't rule it out. And also, several of the clinicians aren't technically Planned Parenthood employees. Like, for example, there are independent trainees or there are residents that work there, so Planned Parenthood said it couldn't compel them to be interviewed even if they wanted to do that.
INSKEEP: Oh, OK. So there's some technicality of who's the boss. But when we heard the person from Planned Parenthood there say potentially subjecting physicians and training residents to criminal prosecution, that's what she's saying. She's essentially saying, we believe this interview would be to - for the purpose of gathering criminal information on somebody.
FENTEM: I think they were worried that could potentially happen, yes.
INSKEEP: But it is not clear, from the perspective of the state, that that's the purpose of this interview?
FENTEM: As far as I know, that's all that they have told me. Yes.
INSKEEP: OK. And the state says this interview is necessary - why? What is the reason they give?
FENTEM: Well, they said that it was to investigate certain problems with the clinic. But beyond that, they did not give either reporters or Planned Parenthood workers any more information than they just wanted to investigate certain problems with the clinic.
INSKEEP: OK, so some mutual suspicion here and some unanswered questions in this standoff. Now, we have to note that Missouri is one of the states that, at the same time, has been passing quite restrictive abortion laws. The governor of Missouri signed a bill banning virtually all abortions just last week. Is there a connection between that act by the legislature and the governor and this standoff with the abortion clinic?
FENTEM: Sort of. So last week, as you said, Governor Parson signed a bill that would outlaw most abortions after eight weeks, and that makes Missouri one of the most restrictive states when it comes to abortion rights. But that law doesn't go into effect until the end of August. So it's not a direct effect of that law, but it is part of this larger anti-abortion movement that's happening in Missouri. The governor and many members of the legislature have been really tough on abortion. Mike Parson is a Republican who has said on Twitter he wants to make Missouri the most pro-life state in the country. And abortion rights supporters say the increased regulations on abortion clinics, including those annual inspections and license renewals, are a way to further that anti-abortion agenda. And abortion clinics have, indeed, closed across the state in recent years. The one in St. Louis that we're talking about is sort of the last one standing.
INSKEEP: Sarah, thanks so much for the update - really appreciate it.
FENTEM: Thanks for having me.
INSKEEP: Sarah Fentem of St. Louis Public Radio.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
INSKEEP: All right. The tornadoes that swept through eastern Kansas last night were just the latest severe weather for that region.
KING: That's right. A series of storms also flooded rivers. Parts of the city of Tulsa, Okla., have gone underwater. Governor Kevin Stitt is relying on levees - very old levees - to keep the damage from getting worse.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KEVIN STITT: We just got to pray for no rain up north. And if we keep getting rain into that watershed, there could be some serious problems.
INSKEEP: NPR's Frank Morris is in Tulsa covering this story.
Hey there, Frank.
FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.
INSKEEP: What have you been seeing?
MORRIS: Well, the river, of course, is really high. There are a number of homes and businesses flooded, I mean, in the hundreds. And people are just on pins and needles here watching these levees start to deteriorate - these 70-year-old levees that have been under pressure for days and days.
INSKEEP: Now, you just said start to deteriorate. We heard yesterday on NPR News from the mayor of Tulsa who said, wow. They've never been tested like this, but they're holding. Are you saying there are now some signs of weakness?
MORRIS: I don't think that the signs of weakness have ramped up significantly, but they are leaking. And the water is just seeping through underneath some of these levees and causing all kinds of problems for businesses and homes in the - you know, in the shadow of these things and nearby. The ground is just turning to a kind of slurry in some places because the water is - there's been so much pressure on these levees for days now, and it's just going to stick for days longer.
INSKEEP: What are you hearing from some people that you talk with there in Tulsa?
MORRIS: Well, again, people are taking this pretty seriously, especially folks who live and work down in what would be the shadow of these levees if the sun was shining. Yesterday, I was down in an industrial part of Sand Springs, Okla. That's sort of a working-class suburb just west of Tulsa, right downstream from this Keystone Dam, where the Corps of Engineers is releasing huge amounts of water - 275,000 cubic feet per second.
And I spoke with Val Silcox (ph) - I'm sorry - Val Silcox. She was rushing around to get her stuff out - the implements of this business - out of a warehouse.
VAL SILCOX: We're evacuating. The water is rising behind us. It's coming up under the concrete. It's getting wetter and wetter.
MORRIS: She's talking about water just bubbling up from the concrete - bubbles coming up through the concrete as the water comes up...
INSKEEP: Wow.
MORRIS: ...And destroys the business.
INSKEEP: Not a thing you really want to see. Frank, I want to ask about something else. I know your hometown is Kansas City. Weren't there tornadoes in Kansas City last night?
MORRIS: There were tornadoes in - near Kansas City. Kansas City itself didn't get hit. Lawrence took a pounding - Bonner Springs, Kan. Linwood looks terrible. You had some of the kind of damage just clearing the foundations in Linwood to some extent. Not clear of how strong those buildings were to begin with in the pictures, but the tornado looked to be about a mile wide last night. And so it was very serious. About two dozen tornadoes reported yesterday, mainly in Kansas.
INSKEEP: Well, best to your friends and relations there.

INSKEEP: Standing in line to vote has become much less of an ordeal than it used to be.
KING: Yeah, get this. No state in the 2016 election averaged a wait time longer than 20 minutes. That's according to the Elections Performance Index from MIT. One big reason for this is a new technology called electronic poll books. But now there are some questions about how secure that technology really is.
INSKEEP: NPR's Miles Parks covers voting and election security. And, goodness, you have a lot to cover, Miles.
MILES PARKS, BYLINE: There's a lot to mine here.
INSKEEP: OK. So this technology that's supposed to make everything better, how's it work?
PARKS: So, basically, you think about the old days. And you walk in your community center, and somebody opens this huge binder of names. They find your name. They check you off. This is basically that process only electronic, either on a laptop or on a tablet, like an iPad. This...
INSKEEP: OK. I think I've seen that in a voting station somewhere.
PARKS: Exactly. I mean, well, the technology has taken off. Almost - more than 50% of voters who vote in person in 2020 are going to sign in using this technology. The problem is that this technology also raises a lot of tough security questions because, in a lot of cases, it's either directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.
INSKEEP: Oh, which means that a particularly clever hacker might find some way in there.
PARKS: Right. We know that voting machines themselves are - one of the big selling points is that they are never connected to the Internet. But these machines - these electronic poll books - a lot of their benefits - which there are a myriad of benefits. They're - if a voter is in the wrong location and they go to sign in on one of these, a poll worker can, using this machine, tell them where their right voting location is. If a voter tries to vote twice in a place where you can vote at different jurisdictions, it will be able to catch that by talking to the other electronic poll books in that district.
The election supervisors love this technology. They say it cuts down on voting times. And it cuts down on human error and on the amount of paperwork that election supervisors have to do. But that can also be a problem because these election supervisors who love this technology - they're supposed to be the ones who are asking the really tough questions. And a lot of security experts I've talked to are not convinced that those tough questions have been asked as this technology has truly started to take over.
INSKEEP: Well, help me out here. Let's look at this from an election supervisor's perspective. You said the actual voting machine is not connected to the Internet. The tablet where people are checking off names is connected to the Internet. But the tablet just has public information - a list of registered voters.
PARKS: Right. So what are the stakes here, right? The biggest thing is that, whether it's due to technical information or - excuse me - a technical malfunction, whether it's due to poor poll worker training or whether, in this worst-case scenario, a cyber attacker is able to get in there and make some mischief happen...
INSKEEP: Mess with who's registered and who's not.
PARKS: Exactly. You could see a situation where this can really screw up day-of-election voting. And we've seen this in real life. You look back at 2018 - I did a story yesterday on All Things Considered about Johnson County, Ind., which, basically, saw the company that was maintaining these poll books not provide enough bandwidth. And it meant that in-person voting on Election Day froze from 8 a.m., when people are trying to go right before work, all the way through lunchtime. That leads to delays. And it leads to people not voting.
INSKEEP: Wow. So the technology that's supposed to shorten the line - in that case, anyway - lengthened it.
Miles, thanks so much.
PARKS: Yeah. Thank you, Steve.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Miles Parks.

Marco Torres/HOU/VMG via Getty Images This story is part of American Anthem, a yearlong series on songs that rouse, unite, celebrate and call to action. Find more at NPR.org/Anthem .
Editor's note: This story includes includes brief mentions of suicide.
When HBO's drama The Sopranos began airing in 1999, the idea of a mob boss seeking therapy was revolutionary. But Tony Soprano wasn't the first gangster to expose his sensitive side to the world: That distinction came nearly a decade earlier, thanks to three gangstas of a different stripe.
The year was 1991. John Singleton's Boyz n the Hood was playing on the big screen. Rodney King's beating by LA cops was on virtual loop on the small screen. And "" Mind Playing Tricks on Me ,"" by the Houston rap trio Geto Boys, was bumping out of nearly every car with speakers in the trunk, putting a voice to the angst and paranoia that defined what it meant to be a young black man in America at the time.
When ""Mind Playing Tricks"" came out, the Geto Boys were already legendary in the South. It was hard not to stand out with a group that included Willie D, a former Golden Gloves boxer; Bushwick Bill, a brash Brooklyn transplant and former breakdancer who stood less than four feet tall; and Brad Jordan, a lyricist with enough street cred to wear the stage name of rap's most celebrated kingpin: Scarface. He wrote three of the four verses in this song, originally intended for his solo album until Rap-A-Lot Records founder J. Prince decided it was the breakout record he needed for the label's flagship group.
Advisory: This video contains profanity and depictions of violence.
YouTube But it's Scarface's grandmother who deserves credit for the song's title. ""It was a strange way of how he came about it,"" she told MTV several years ago. ""I come through the room and I think I was just kinda mumbling to myself or my lips was working or something. He said, 'Mawmaw, what you talking about?' I said, 'Oh nothing, my mind's just playing tricks on me.' And didn't have no idea he was gonna go out and be making a song about it.""
A multi-instrumentalist from a long line of musical talent, Scarface had been a fan of metal as a kid. But growing up in Houston's Southside introduced him to a different kind of hard rock: He went from dropout to local drug dealer coming up. He also spent some time in a hospital psych ward, after trying to kill himself once as a teenager.
Learning to articulate his feelings must have contributed to making him the coldest songwriter in rap, more Southern Gothic than Edgar Allan Poe. Just listen to him in the song's third verse: One moment he's in church praying for an exit out the drug game; the next, he's contemplating suicide.
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bulls***
This was confessional rap — street ministry. Scarface was acknowledging emotions a generation of black boys had been conditioned to hide.
Gangsta rap may have been America's nightmare in the '80s and '90s, but it was also America's creation. There's a post-traumatic stress that comes along with being black in this country: It's almost part of your inheritance. And the feeling was compounded by the crack era, by the war on drugs, by over-policing and mass incarceration. This was the era when it wasn't at all unusual to hear young black men referred to as an endangered species — and the worst of it is, we were being told that we were the ones we should fear the most.
American Anthem 'Fight The Power': A Tale Of 2 Anthems (With The Same Name) The music of that era was rebellious; it was aggressive. It was misogynistic and hyper-masculine to a fault. It was definitely political, even if it was far from ""conscious"" rap . But one thing it hadn't much been up until that point was vulnerable. ""Mind Playing Tricks"" became that first vulnerable gangsta rap song. In the lyrics, the Geto Boys were still hardcore hustlers, but they weren't glorifying the streets — they were traumatized by them. The beginning of Willie D's verse tells the story:
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, something ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's headlights
All of a sudden, the villains depicted on record — and by society — were cast as the victims. They were haunted by their own demons, but also by the economic degradation that hollowed out the hoods from which they came. The track got a creepy music video that would probably be labeled Afro-Surreal today, like something out of a Jordan Peele flick.
Geto Boys lowered their masks enough to reveal their inner fears, but you didn't have to be an ex-drug dealer like Scarface to relate. You didn't even have to be from the ghetto like Geto Boys. If you were black, if you felt the pressure of growing up with a target on your back, ""Mind Playing Tricks"" was your anxiety anthem. Our generation knew how to posture. We knew how to pose and play hard. But the survival tool we'd really been missing all this time was a way to process our pain, to process our reality.
Therapy was still a huge taboo — and really a privilege — that most black folks just weren't privy to. ""Mind Playing Tricks"" became the Trojan Horse, giving a generation the language to consider something we'd never let down our guard to talk about. Pretty soon, you even had preachers using the song as text for their Sunday sermons.
""The first time I actually heard the song analyzed and broken down was at church,"" says music journalist and Southern hip-hop historian Maurice Garland, recalling one of his earliest encounters with the song as a kid back in the '90s. ""Somebody was preaching at church — you know how preachers do analogies with their sermons. He was like: 'And you know, it's like that Geto Boys song, when your mind's playing tricks on ya.' He was breaking down the depression, the drugs, the anxiety, the everything — he was corralling all of this into his sermon. That was one of the first rap songs that I remember where topics like that were even touched on.""
The Record Why Black Boy Joy And Lil Uzi Vert's Melancholy Are All The Rage American Anthem The Legacy Of 'Adam's Song,' An Anthem To Darkness, Loss — And Recovery After ""Mind Playing Tricks,"" gangsta rap started to sound a little different. It was still hard, still raw and uncut. But now, it began to echo the blues tradition it grew out of. You had artists like MC Eiht rapping about how the ""hood took [him] under."" Or Spice 1 wearing ""The Face of a Desperate Man."" And Tupac crying all those thug tears .
Today, mental health is one of the biggest topics in hip-hop culture: Even as many still suffer in silence or die tragically from drug overdoses, many more conversations are happening in public. Last year, Kanye West called his bipolar diagnosis his ""superpower"" in an attempt to destigmatize mental illness. The importance of self-care is a constant theme on Black Twitter. Radio personality Charlamagne the God wrote a whole book, Shook One: Anxiety Playing Tricks On Me, about confronting his anxiety and getting help for it. (Scarface even wrote the foreword.)
And there isn't a popular rapper out there who doesn't owe their career to this song in some way — whether they know it or not. It gave an artist like Drake the range to wear his heart on his sleeve. It gave Kid Cudi his biggest hit in ""Day 'N' Nite,"" a song he wrote while trying to make his own version of ""Mind Playing Tricks."" And it's gifted us a whole subgenre of emo rappers like Lil Uzi Vert, Juice WRLD and, yes, even Post Malone, who top the charts by pouring out their pain.
For so many artists and fans today, rap is still the closest thing they have to therapy. It's the space where artists articulate their trauma and and air out their toxic behavior. There's still pain, and a whole lot of the wrong coping mechanisms. But at least rappers who represent the streets aren't afraid to use their music as a way to express it anymore.
Meanwhile, the Geto Boys fight on. Willie D is still as politically outspoken as ever. Bushwick Bill is battling stage 4 pancreatic cancer, a diagnosis he recently revealed to the public. Then there's Scarface, easily one of the greatest rappers of all time. His grandmama told him her mind was playing tricks, and he turned it into something bigger than a hit: a diagnosis. Not just of black boys in the hood, but of the effects America's systemic ills were having on us.
If he made a new version of the song, ""it would be bigger than me,"" he said in Charlamagne's book. ""My paranoia would be based on my people going back into slavery."" His mind could still be playing tricks. Or just maybe, 30 years later, he's seeing reality with more clarity than ever before.

"Debt Collectors Face New Rules, But Consumer Advocates Are Skeptical : Shots - Health News : NPR",www.npr.org,Michelle Andrews,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/29/727596397/mired-in-medical-debt-federal-rule-changes-proposed-for-bill-collectors,"Enlarge this image At least 43 million Americans have overdue medical bills on their credit reports, according to a 2014 report on medical debt by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Hero Images/Getty Images/Hero Images Hero Images/Getty Images/Hero Images At least 43 million Americans have overdue medical bills on their credit reports, according to a 2014 report on medical debt by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Hero Images/Getty Images/Hero Images Elham Mirshafiei was at the library cramming for final exams during her senior year at California State University, Long Beach when she grew nauseated and started vomiting. After the 10th episode in an hour, a friend took her to the nearest emergency room. Diagnosis: an intestinal bug and severe dehydration. In a few hours, she was home again, with instructions to eat a bland diet and drink plenty of fluids.
That was in 2010. But the $4,000 bill for the brief emergency department visit at an out-of-network hospital has trailed her ever since. Mirshafiei, 31, has a good job now as a licensed insurance adviser in Palo Alto, Calif. But money is still tight, and her priority is paying off her $67,000 student loan debt rather than that old hospital bill.
While a college student in 2010, Elham Mirshafiei turned to the emergency room of a hospital that wasn't in her insurance network for treatment of an intestinal bug and severe dehydration. She still carries the $4,000 debt from that visit. Courtesy of Elham Mirshafiei Courtesy of Elham Mirshafiei Once or twice a year she gets a letter from a collection agency. She ignores the letters, and so far the consequences have been manageable. ""It's not like electricity that gets cut off if you don't pay it,"" she says.
Mirshafiei has plenty of company . At least 43 million other Americans have overdue medical bills on their credit reports, according to a 2014 report on medical debt by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And 59% of people contacted by a debt collector say the exchange was over medical bills, the most common type of contact stemming from an overdue bill, according to the CFPB.
This month, the CFPB proposed a rule to frame what debt collectors are allowed to do when pursuing many types of overdue bills, including medical debt.
Federal law already prohibits debt collectors from harassing consumers or contacting them before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., among other things. But the law, which was passed in 1977, didn't anticipate email and text messages. The CFPB's proposal clarifies how debt collectors can use these communication tools. And it would allow consumers to opt out of being contacted through these means.
The rule also specifies that debt collectors can make no more than seven telephone calls weekly over a specific debt.
But some consumer advocates have panned the effort . ""This really doesn't go far enough to protect consumers and make sure that consumers are not abused or harassed or subject to unfair collection practices in debt collection,"" says April Kuehnhoff , an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center who specializes in debt collection.
For instance, the center wants a limit of just three telephone attempts each week on a debt. The seven-call limit could be particularly tough on people with medical debt, Kuehnhoff said. They may accumulate bills from several providers for a single medical event — a hospital, doctors, a lab and a nursing home, for example — and all could be in collections separately, potentially resulting in dozens of calls each week.
Debt collectors aren't necessarily in favor of the seven-call cap either, but for different reasons. They say that limiting the number of calls could lead to more litigation or adverse credit reporting rather than working out a payment plan.
Overall, the proposed rule seems to strike a good balance between the collection industry and consumer concerns, says Leah Dempsey , vice president and senior counsel for federal affairs at ACA International , a trade group representing 2,500 debt collectors, asset buyers and related professions.
Shots - Health News Medical Bills Still Take A Big Toll, Even With Insurance The general consensus is that people should pay their debts. But taking responsibility for medical debt isn't always as straightforward as paying off a large-screen TV that someone put on a credit card. Did health insurance pay the correct amount? Was the person screened for eligibility for Medicaid, charity care or financial assistance?
""The actual debt collector problem is often about the lack of accountability that providers have for the people that they pass their debt along to,"" says Leonardo Cuello , director of health policy at the National Health Law Program.
When a debt collector calls, consumers who are confused about the bill should ask — in writing and generally within 30 days — that the debt be validated. Debts are often bundled and sold multiple times to different collectors, which means errors may be introduced along the way.
""There are no magic words. You don't need to cite the statute,"" says Justin J. Lowe , legal director at Health Law Advocates, a nonprofit law firm in Boston that helps people with low incomes who are having trouble accessing or paying for medical care.
At that point, the collection agency has to stop activities until it proves what the consumer owes. The proposed CFPB rule would spell out verification information that must be provided along with instructions for consumers about how to dispute the debt.
Get Out Of Debt Rx For Medical Debt The proposal would also address other practices, including the collection of what is sometimes called zombie debt . That term refers to a bill that has passed a time limit — or statute of limitations — for bringing legal action, often between three and six years, depending on the state. In many states, if a collector sues someone for such a time-barred debt, consumers can raise the issue in court in their defense. If a judge agrees, the case could be dismissed.
Consumer advocates have long wanted debt collectors to be prohibited from trying to collect zombie debt. After several years, it can be difficult for patients to locate records or remember whether a bill has been paid, they argue.
The proposed CFPB rule would prohibit debt collectors from suing or threatening to sue consumers for zombie debt, but only if the collectors knew or should have known that the statute of limitations had expired. That puts the onus on the consumer to prove what was in the debt collector's mind rather than merely show that too much time had passed to collect.
As the federal government moves ahead with the rule to address various types of debt collection activities, legislators in a few states have introduced bills that specifically target medical debt. Their efforts often focus on improving access to financial assistance for medical care and limiting predatory debt collection tactics.
Last month, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law that reduces the maximum interest rate on medical debt prior to a court judgment from 12% to 9%. It also prohibits sending a medical debt to collections until 120 days after the patient is sent the initial bill, and it requires collection agencies to provide itemized statements to patients for medical and hospital debts and to notify them of their possible eligibility for charity care.
In Oregon, a bill sponsored by Rep. Andrea Salinas would require nonprofit hospitals and affiliated clinics to provide care free of charge to families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level (about $43,000 for a family of three) and charge a sliding scale for families earning up to 400% of the poverty level (about $85,000 for a three-person family).
Like the Washington law, the Oregon bill places limits on the interest charged for medical debt. It also requires health care facilities to screen patients for eligibility for financial assistance and insurance.
The bill passed the House in Oregon last week.
Some hospitals already have strong financial assistance policies, but the playing field needs leveling, Salinas says. ""We really need hospitals to be a part of the solution to prevent consumers from going into bankruptcy over medical debt.""
It's unclear how the proposed changes announced by the CFPB might affect Mirshafiei's situation. The statute of limitations in California on written contracts is four years.
One thing someone in Mirshafiei's situation should be aware of is that making a payment could reset the statute of limitations, Lowe says. The debt collector could argue that by making a payment, the person is affirming that he or she owes the debt.
Because of her damaged credit, Mirshafiei needed a relative to cosign for student loans for graduate school. She worries that if she tries to buy a house, she'll have trouble getting approved.
""I just hope that in the next chapter of my life, I don't have to be denied things because of this stain on my record,"" she says.

While the military campaign has been directed at quashing an Arakan rebellion, the vulnerable Rohingya population is also a target as well as other Buddhists and Christians. According to the report, a military helicopter opened fire on Rohingya laborers cutting bamboo on April 3, killing at least six men and boys and injuring at least 13 others.
""The helicopter came from behind the mountain,"" a survivor of the attack told Amnesty International. ""Within minutes, it fired rockets. I was running for my life thinking about my family and how I would survive.""
Meanwhile, Amnesty International says the government military isn't the only force committing atrocities. The Arakan Army is also perpetrating human rights violations, victimizing local villages and businesses. Rebel soldiers have ""threatened and intimidated village administrators and local business people, warning them in letters against interfering with the group's activities. The letters were each accompanied by a bullet and bore the [Arakan Army's] official seal.""
Amnesty International estimates about 30,000 people have been displaced by the conflict since January. Nearly all humanitarian aid has been blocked, and as both sides continue to destroy farmland and harvests, human rights groups are warning of a ""looming food insecurity crisis.""
The report follows the release of two Reuters reporters earlier this month after spending more than 500 days in prison. They were captured after reporting the massacre of 10 Rohingya men at Inn Din in Rakhine in 2017. The investigation earned the pair a Pulitzer Prize last month.
Amnesty International said it is imperative to step up international pressure on Myanmar's government, advocating for targeted sanctions and a comprehensive arms embargo by the International Criminal Court.
""With Myanmar's military committing atrocities as brazenly as ever, it's clear international pressure needs to intensify,"" Bequelin said. ""Again and again, the international community has failed to stop the Myanmar military's crimes and protect the civilian population.

Partisanship In American Politics | Hidden Brain,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/20/724999235/more-divided-than-ever-excavating-the-roots-of-our-political-landscape,"Enlarge this image Roy Scott/Getty Images/Ikon Images Roy Scott/Getty Images/Ikon Images The nastiness of American politics today may seem extreme compared to the tone of earlier eras. But historian David Moss says our nation's founders were also happy to sling mud. Thomas Jefferson's supporters said John Adams had a ""hideous hermaphroditical character."" Adams called Alexander Hamilton that ""bastard brat of a Scotch peddler."" Beyond the noxious language, there were also deep disagreements about what it meant to be a nation.
Moss argues that the intensity of our partisan disagreements shouldn't be cause for alarm. He believes our democracy is much more resilient than we realize, and that conflict, however bitter, can be productive.
""I think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect, but it is extraordinarily resilient, and it has generated tremendous progress,"" he says.
That said, Moss also believes that Americans should ask a key question as we assess the health of our political discourse: do the politicians you support ever put democracy in second place at the expense of a partisan battle?
""It's good, I think, in a democracy to be hypochondriacs - that is, to think that, oh, our system might be sick. Because when you think it might be sick, you start to take some action to try to fix it.""
That's in the second half of this week's show. In the first part of our program, we revisit our 2018 conversation with political scientist John Hibbing . Over the years, he has studied how our political views may be influenced by our biology.
""We would look at brain scan results and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative, just on the basis of that,"" he says.

Steve Bannon Stars In Michael Wolff's New Trump Tell-All With Supporting Cast Of No-Names : NPR,www.npr.org,Michael Wolff,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727724850/michael-wolffs-new-trump-tell-all-siege-stars-steve-bannon-and-cast-of-no-names,"Siege Trump Under Fire
by Michael Wolff
Hardcover, 335 Siege Subtitle Trump Under Fire Author Michael Wolff Michael Wolff's new book about President Trump, Siege: Trump Under Fire, offers many surprising stories — but its power to shock may be limited.
Most Americans have long since decided what they think of Trump. And most people who pay attention to such books have made up their minds about Wolff, as well.
There may never have been a more polarizing president, nor an author less likely to be read as a neutral recorder of facts. This is regrettable, because much of Wolff's gossipy but disturbing tale is not only plausible but credibly corroborated elsewhere. Siege includes events widely observed, or present in accessible public records. Yet all of that material has been conjoined with so much else that cannot be confirmed that the reader is apt to be left in doubt.
Wolff is a longtime writer for popular magazines who scored a hit with Fire and Fury , his earlier account of Trump's first seven months in office. The first book, a runaway 2018 bestseller, was based partly on personal observation from weeks spent inside the White House. But in this sequel, Wolff relies primarily on interviews with current and former intimates of the president. Nearly all are unnamed, with the egregious exception of the book's mainspring source, former campaign manager Steve Bannon, of whom more in a moment.
An author's credibility is everything in this kind of journalism, whether one is known primarily for entertainment reporting or for winning multiple Pulitzer prizes. And that is problematic for Wolff, because in this case the single most newsworthy item in the 315 pages of Siege has already been called into question.
In his chapter on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Wolff says there was a draft version of a three-count criminal indictment against President Donald Trump as early as March 2018. He says the three charges (under Title 18 of the federal code Sections 1505, 1512 and 1513) did not stem from the Russian interference itself but from Trump's efforts to thwart the investigation.
Wolff links this draft to Mueller's deputy Andrew Weissmann and reports that Mueller let it languish for nearly a year while preparing his own report, ultimately deferring to a longstanding Justice Department policy that a president could not be indicted while in office. Wolff says he got a look at the draft, and other related memoranda regarding that no-indictment policy, from ""a source close to the Office of Special Counsel.""
But the Office of Special Counsel on May 28 released a statement denying that account. ""The documents you describe do not exist,"" said Peter Carr, responding to questions from The Guardian and other media organizations.
We can now expect the initial response to Siege to focus on this issue — and for the president and his defenders to say the rebuff from Mueller's team debunks the book more or less in its entirety.
Much of the other controversy likely to greet the publication of Siege will concern things Trump is quoted as saying, often in late-night phone calls to his coterie of personal friends (most of whom seem to be New York business associates). Wolff would have us believe at least some of these midnight confidants have shared descriptions of Trump's sexual boasting, as well as his harsh assessments of rivals and critics and even of his own appointees and family members.
For example, when former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and accountant Allen Weisselberg agree to talk to investigators, Wolff quotes Trump saying ""the Jews always flip."" And when Trump learns the White House counsel Donald McGahn has talked to Mueller's team, Wolff quotes the president saying ""McGahn is a dirty rat.""
Plausible? Believable? Perhaps, but the prejudice of the reader is not a substitute for evidence. If we do not know who supposedly told Wolff these things, we cannot even begin to assess whether Trump in fact said them.
Wolff also claims that his own ""certain knowledge that in the end [Trump] will destroy himself"" is a view shared by ""almost everyone who has encountered him since he was elected president."" The inclusion of ""almost"" scarcely rescues this assertion from obvious overstatement.
Wolff also quotes an unnamed White House staffer ""who has spent almost countless hours with the president"" saying ""I have never met anyone crazier than Donald Trump."" Wolff says he has heard something similar from ""a dozen others with firsthand experience.""
These group attributions may carry the added weight of numbers, but they suffer from the same essential lack of verifiability.
Wolff does have one source on the record. Again and again. From chapter to chapter, almost page to page, we see the words of Steve Bannon, a former Trump campaign manager and then White House ""chief strategist"" for seven months. He later broke with Trump in the furor over Fire and Fury.
The former chairman of the website Breitbart, Bannon has never quite left the world of ""alt-right"" media and movement politics. He has remained an active campaigner and adviser to nationalist and populist groups in Europe and elsewhere and worked for various Republican candidates in 2018.
He also seems to have spent much of 2018 talking to Wolff, in whose new book he seems to be perched over the author's shoulder like Edgar Allan Poe's raven, squawking caustic remarks. In one moment, Wolff says Trump's businesses had ""increasingly seemed to resemble a semi-criminal enterprise"" and then has Bannon chuckling: ""I think we can drop the 'semi' part."" At times, Bannon quite nearly takes over the narrative, as when Wolff lets one Bannon quote run without interruption for five pages.
In truth, Bannon's idiosyncratic view of the world and raw language provide much of the color and punch in this book. But his vocabulary of imperatives and superlatives grows wearisome, like a sportscaster declaring each dramatic moment the turning point of the game. Bannon is always declaring one crisis or another — the budget, the wall, the midterms, the Brett Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court — to be the crux of the entire Trump presidency.
We have now seen nearly a dozen insider tell-alls emerge from Trumpworld, some by staffers such as Cliff Sims and Omarosa Manigault Newman and others by seasoned journalists such as Bob Woodward of the Washington Post . Two former heads of the FBI have penned critical memoirs that made the best-seller list. It can be said that each of these adds something to the mosaic, extending the tale of White House infighting and chaos a bit further into history. In this sense, they will be read, at least by many, as corroboration for each other.
So by now we may find it easy to believe that McGahn was ""deeply depressed"" by the time he left the White House, or that he had a ""black hatred"" for Trump, as Wolff writes — even if we have this only from ""a friend."" At times, even Wolff casts doubt on something he is reporting — such as Trump's claim to having had a sexual encounter with Nikki Haley, his first appointee as Ambassador to the United Nations. Wolff suggests he doesn't believe this happened, but he stands by reporting that ""multiple associates"" of the president told the author he had bragged about it.
Wolff is not a policy maven, nor does he dwell on the deeper and even global political issues Trump represents — the rise of populist nationalism and the turn toward autocracy. Wolff's subject is the president as a personality, and the people in his immediate circle who observe that personality.
And so it may seem quite natural for Wolff to rely on blind sourcing for his text. How else can a writer with an eye on book sales get some of the really good stuff on paper if he doesn't let folks dish anonymously? How else to get little anecdotes such as the one about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, entertaining friends with their impressions of the president. Or the one about the time the president came into the Oval Office in such a ""full-on rage"" that ""his hair came undone [and] there stood an almost entirely bald Donald Trump.""
Among the head-shaking impressions from Siege is that of extraordinary events following on each other in such rapid succession that they quickly recede in memory. Was it really less than a year ago that Melania went to a military hospital in D.C. for ""a benign kidney ailment,"" staying there for days and out of the public eye for weeks?
Was it really just last fall that the president refused to punish Saudi Arabia for the murder of journalist (and Virginia resident) Jamal Khashoggi? Or that Haley abruptly informed the White House she was leaving after less than two years at the U.N.?
Was it just last July that Trump went to Helsinki and held a two-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin with no other American official in the room, emerging later to say he accepted Putin's denials of Russian interference in the 2016 election?
Was it just last Christmas that Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned in dismay at the president tweeting a decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria immediately? And the government shut down for five weeks because the president did not like the Twitter and talk show treatment of his budget deal with his own party's congressional leaders?
Wolff has pulled these and other cases from the file drawer, one by one, waving them overhead like a courtroom lawyer summing up for the jury.
In this case, it is likely the jury has already made up its mind. Most of those who read this book will already believe terrible things about Trump. There will be those too who dismiss the book in its entirety as a compendium of illegitimate charges — as prejudiced as they are unproven.
But if nothing else, Wolff has performed a kind of service in Siege by taking us back over this rocky ground and reminding us what a long strange trip it has already been.

How Deutsche Bank Became A Mainstay Of Trump's Business Empire : NPR,www.npr.org,Lucian Kim,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727817948/how-deutsche-bank-became-a-mainstay-of-trumps-business-empire,"How Deutsche Bank Became A Mainstay Of Trump's Business Empire How Deutsche Bank Became A Mainstay Of Trump's Business Empire Embed Embed
While Congressional investigators wait for Deutsche Bank to turn over the president's financial records, we examine how the German financial institution came to lend Donald Trump so much money.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
How did Germany's most illustrious bank become so important to the business empire of Donald Trump? Deutsche Bank has given the president hundreds of millions of dollars in loans over the years, dating back far before he was president. Congressional investigators have asked Deutsche Bank to turn over the president's carefully guarded financial records, but his lawyers have filed suit to block the subpoenas. NPR's Lucian Kim has the backstory from Berlin.
LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: President Trump doesn't like to reveal the details of how he does business. But when he was still on the campaign trail, he gave a little bit away.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's called OPM. I do that all the time in business. It's called other people's money. There's nothing like doing things with other people's money because it takes the risk.
KIM: A lot of that OPM came from Deutsche Bank, which kept lending Trump money, even after he defaulted on a loan, even after he sued the bank, claiming it was responsible for his failure to pay his debts. It might seem like baffling behavior for such a venerable institution.
Deutsche Bank was founded in Berlin in 1870. I've come to its former headquarters, which were housed here in a complex of massive, stone buildings that symbolized solidity and the proximity to power. After World War II, the bank relocated to Frankfurt in West Germany.
In the 1990s, the bank started taking on ever more risk as it went global.
DIRK LAABS: There was nothing solid and nothing professional about that bank.
KIM: That's Dirk Laabs, author of ""Bad Bank: The Rise And Fall Of Deutsche Bank."" Lending to Donald Trump was only one of many questionable moves. Deutsche Bank bought up mortgage-backed securities and was dangerously exposed when the global financial crisis hit in 2008.
LAABS: This still comes as a shock for lots of - a lot of Germans. I think it's hard to understand for people abroad how big this bank was and how important it was for the mindset. It's like Mercedes-Benz for cars. That's what Deutsche Bank is for, you know, finance business in Germany.
KIM: But Dirk Laabs says this image of a bastion of financial prudence didn't reflect the changes that had taken place.
LAABS: On paper, the headquarter of Deutsche Bank is Frankfurt. But in the mid-90s, the power really shifted to London and to New York.
KIM: That's when Deutsche Bank started aggressively competing with Wall Street banks. That was also when American banks, which had been burned by Trump's defaults on casino loans, stopped lending to him. German journalist Ingo Nathusius says Deutsche Bank saw doing business with Trump as a price of getting into the game.
INGO NATHUSIUS: Deutsche Bank was an ambitious B bank that had to deal with B clients. And in that time, Donald Trump and Deutsche Bank needed one another, so it was kind of a symbiotic relationship.
KIM: This month, Trump tweeted it was fake news that banks wouldn't lend to him. He said he didn't need the money. But Deutsche Bank did take risks that more established Wall Street players wouldn't. Dirk Laabs says the bank's leadership in Frankfurt had lost control.
LAABS: The investment bankers in London and New York wouldn't really listen to their bosses in Frankfurt.
KIM: That's why it was British and American regulators who stepped in. Since 2003, they've ordered Deutsche Bank to pay penalties for selling toxic mortgages, manipulating interest rates and laundering $10 billion of Russian money. Deutsche has promised to clean up its act with better internal controls and reduced exposure to derivatives. In a statement to NPR, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said the bank has increased its anti-financial crime staff and enhanced controls. It takes compliance with anti-money-laundering laws very seriously. But Gerhard Schick, a former German lawmaker who now campaigns against financial crime, says Deutsche lacks a clear strategy.
GERHARD SCHICK: (Speaking German).
KIM: He says its business model for the future is still open and that, perhaps, it should set a more modest goal of just being a big European bank. But author Dirk Laabs says it's too late for reform.
LAABS: The reputation of Deutsche Bank is damaged for good in Germany.
KIM: In November, dozens of German law enforcement officers raided the bank's Frankfurt headquarters in a money-laundering probe. Last week, as the bank held its annual shareholders meeting, Deutsche's stock price hit an all-time low. If Deutsche Bank turns over records of its dealings with Donald Trump, there may be more bad news to come.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Michael Wolff's new book about President Trump, Siege: Trump Under Fire, offers many surprising stories — but its power to shock may be limited.
Most Americans have long since decided what they think of Trump. And most people who pay attention to such books have made up their minds about Wolff, as well.
There may never have been a more polarizing president, nor an author less likely to be read as a neutral recorder of facts. This is regrettable, because much of Wolff's gossipy but disturbing tale is not only plausible but credibly corroborated elsewhere. Siege includes events widely observed, or present in accessible public records. Yet all of that material has been conjoined with so much else that cannot be confirmed that the reader is apt to be left in doubt.
Wolff is a longtime writer for popular magazines who scored a hit with Fire and Fury , his earlier account of Trump's first seven months in office. The first book, a runaway 2018 bestseller, was based partly on personal observation from weeks spent inside the White House. But in this sequel, Wolff relies primarily on interviews with current and former intimates of the president. Nearly all are unnamed, with the egregious exception of the book's mainspring source, former campaign manager Steve Bannon, of whom more in a moment.
An author's credibility is everything in this kind of journalism, whether one is known primarily for entertainment reporting or for winning multiple Pulitzer prizes. And that is problematic for Wolff, because in this case the single most newsworthy item in the 315 pages of Siege has already been called into question.
In his chapter on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Wolff says there was a draft version of a three-count criminal indictment against President Donald Trump as early as March 2018. He says the three charges (under Title 18 of the federal code Sections 1505, 1512 and 1513) did not stem from the Russian interference itself but from Trump's efforts to thwart the investigation.
Wolff links this draft to Mueller's deputy Andrew Weissmann and reports that Mueller let it languish for nearly a year while preparing his own report, ultimately deferring to a longstanding Justice Department policy that a president could not be indicted while in office. Wolff says he got a look at the draft, and other related memoranda regarding that no-indictment policy, from ""a source close to the Office of Special Counsel.""
But the Office of Special Counsel on May 28 released a statement denying that account. ""The documents you describe do not exist,"" said Peter Carr, responding to questions from The Guardian and other media organizations.

Missouri Health Clinic May Be Forced To Stop Abortion Services,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727815202/missouri-health-clinic-may-be-forced-to-stop-abortion-services,"NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, about how Missouri could soon lose the only clinic that provides abortions.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The state of Missouri is days away from becoming the first state without a single health facility that provides abortions. The state health department is threatening not to renew the license of the last clinic that does. Dr. Leana Wen of Planned Parenthood, which runs that clinic, discussed the case yesterday on NPR's All Things Considered.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LEANA WEN: If the court does not grant us a restraining order, Missouri will go dark. And more than 1.1 million women of reproductive age will be living in a state where they cannot access essential health care - the first time since 1974 that safe, legal abortion is inaccessible to people in an entire state.
INSKEEP: The state is asserting its right to interview the employees of the clinic, but some do not want to talk. And that's where the conflict lies. Dr. Colleen McNicholas did answer the state's questions. She is an OB-GYN and has performed abortions at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region. She's on the line.
Good morning.
COLLEEN MCNICHOLAS: Good morning, Steven. Thanks for having me.
INSKEEP: I know you may not be able to say every detail. But, broadly speaking, what is it that the state wants to know?
MCNICHOLAS: Yes. I can't get into specifics, but I can say generally that the department asked about our practices at RHS, including - and maybe really specifically focusing on - how we work with residents and fellow trainees. And while I still believe that the interviews are unnecessary, as I'm confident about the exceptional care that we provide, I do also hope that the department now feels that with a better understanding of how medical education works that they can resolve any remaining issues.
INSKEEP: That, on the surface, doesn't sound unreasonable; that the state - which licenses your facility, wants to make sure that it's safe and in accordance with laws and regulations - would ask people about that subject.
MCNICHOLAS: That's exactly right. And Planned Parenthood has - for as long as I have been working with Planned Parenthood - has been responsive to oversight. And we are interested in sincere and reasonable oversight to help make health care more safe and appropriate for our patients. However, it's impossible for us to do that when they use that oversight process as a weapon to politically drive an agenda.
INSKEEP: That sounds like you do not think that this is sincere and reasonable oversight.
MCNICHOLAS: It's hard to believe that it is when, in fact, the state department of health continues to reassess and reinterpret their own regulations from year to year.
INSKEEP: Would it not make sense, though, for some of your colleagues who have declined to answer questions to simply do as you have done and answer them?
MCNICHOLAS: You know, it's interesting because one of the tactics they're using is to really focus on trainees. Those are residents and fellows who are still in training, who are only providing care under the supervision of attending physicians. And the standard sort of across medical education is that, ultimately, the attending physicians are responsible for the care provided. And, really, this can only be seen as a tactic to harass and intimidate those trainees.
INSKEEP: I guess we should just be - residents, doctors in training; these are people who are - apprenticed is the wrong word. But they're working under someone like you. That's the kind of person you're talking about, right?
MCNICHOLAS: That's correct.
INSKEEP: And are they especially vulnerable in some ways - legally vulnerable or otherwise - if they're answering a lot of questions?
MCNICHOLAS: Well, you know, this is part of the larger context of criminalizing abortion across the states - criminalizing it for patients who are seeking abortion and for physicians and clinicians who are providing that care. And so certainly in Missouri, like in many other states, there are some abortion statutes that are tied to criminal penalties.
INSKEEP: Again, granting that you can't get into all the specifics - but I want to know if there is evidence to back up what you just said. You've essentially said this is a process where they're asking questions that, on the surface, are reasonable. But it seems like they're in bad faith. Was there something that any state official has done or said to you in that questioning or elsewhere that makes you think they're just trying to shut this clinic down?
MCNICHOLAS: Well, here, I can give you this as an example. So there has long been a requirement to include pelvic exams in the provision of our care, which is part of standard medical care for providing a surgical aspiration abortion. However, this year, despite this being part of our practice forever, the state has now reinterpreted its own regulation to say we must provide that pelvic exam at the same time that we perform their consent, which is at least three days and, sometimes, weeks before the patient actually has the procedure - which has no medical relevance to their care.
And so that's just one example of how the state is continuing to reinterpret their own regulations - really making the goalpost for compliance continuously moving and impossible for us to comply with.
INSKEEP: Dr. McNicholas, I want to take a moment to ask a really big question here. You are providing a service - abortions - a service that is a constitutional right according to Roe v. Wade in many, many circumstances but a service that a lot of people in this country and probably a lot of people listening now find fundamentally wrong. What have you said when you've encountered - I don't know - a friend or a relative or an acquaintance who just disagrees with what you do?
MCNICHOLAS: You know, everybody has an opinion on abortion until they need one. And so what I remind people is that it is completely appropriate for them to have an opinion on it, but their opinion should direct their own health care and that public health policy should really be driven by science and evidence and that every person deserves to make their health care decisions consistent and in line with their own values.
INSKEEP: Even if those values, in the case of some people listening now, would include protecting the unborn - that's the way they would phrase it.
MCNICHOLAS: Again, you know, my experience has been that everybody's opinion on abortion changes once they face a situation or their sister or their brother or their mom faces a situation in which they might need one.
INSKEEP: Well, Dr. McNicholas, you're still on the job today. Correct?
MCNICHOLAS: That's true. We are still open.
INSKEEP: Until Friday.
MCNICHOLAS: We are open and providing abortion services until Friday, and we will continue to provide the remainder of the services that we provide beyond then.
INSKEEP: OK. Dr. McNicholas, thanks so much - really appreciate it.
MCNICHOLAS: Thanks, Steven.
INSKEEP: Colleen McNicholas is an OB-GYN who has provided abortions at the last clinic that is still doing so in Missouri. We should note that NPR's reached out to Governor Mike Parson and also to Dr. Randall Williams, the director of Missouri's Health Department. They have not yet responded to our requests for comment. But if you or your staff are listening, that invitation is still open.

"NPR Review: 'The Rosie Result,' By Graeme Simsion",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/726332994/the-fizz-has-flattened-some-in-the-rosie-result,"In 'The Rosie Effect,' An Unusual Romantic Hero Perseveres
Part of the problem is that when Don's rational-to-a-fault approach to life isn't offset by Rosie, his sarcastic comic foil, he can sound about as engaging as a refrigerator manual. But Rosie's primary focus in this volume, alas, is on battling her sexist boss's attempts to marginalize her in what was supposed to be her new dream job.
Don, an ""Einstein in overalls"" whose default conversational response is ""Correct,"" is still tightly programmed, with an idiosyncratic propensity for what he calls ""time-sharing"" — multi-tasking in pursuit of efficiency. (He learns the hard way that shucking oysters while doing squats is a recipe for disaster.) He tends to miss nuance, but his gaffes aren't as funny as I suspect Simsion wanted them to be.
Don's biggest misstep is what he refers to as the Genetics Lecture Outrage, a distressing consequence of his unfortunate, unorthodox response to a student's question about whether race has a genetic basis. (It involves lining up students by skin shade.) This leads to serious trouble, which Don might be able to mitigate by admitting to autism.
The Rosie Result addresses multiple forms of discrimination, including not just a tendency to label all but the ""neurotypical"" as weird, but gender prejudice as well. So for a variety of reasons, including marital equity, Don takes the lead in dealing with Hudson's problems adjusting to his new school after the family moves back to Australia for Rosie's job.
While this final installment may well educate readers ... it's less likely to charm them. It plods along to its heartwarming climax, generally more earnest than amusing.
Don's approach to life is cerebral and methodical, and the Hudson Project (as he calls it) involves working his way down a long checklist of life skills he deems essential for happiness — including bike-riding, sex education, and making friends. This is a case of the clueless leading the clueless: For sex education, Don compiles a video of animals mating, which he gives to Hudson on his way to school. Oops.
The trouble is that Hudson interprets his father's campaign as a signal that he's not good enough the way he is. The rosy news is that while Hudson may share a lot of qualities with Don, he's smart and resourceful enough to devise several surprising workarounds.
A roster of atypical characters, including Hudson's albino friend (named Blanche!), whose father is an anti-vaxxer with serious anger issues, infuses some fizz. When Don learns that ""Rabbit"" Warren, Hudson's insensitive teacher, called the boy a ""grammar Nazi"" — fueling classmates' taunts — his comment is priceless: ""'No filter,' I said, without thinking.""
It quickly becomes apparent that father and son are on parallel learning curves, and both may be able to dodge some sticky situations by agreeing to submit to testing for autism. Why resist, then? A woman at a seminar on autism sums up the issue: ""In the end, it's your choice, your identity. Diagnosis is for diseases."" In the end, The Rosie Result is about learning to be comfortable with who you are. Facebook"

On Tuesday, by a 7-to-2 vote, the Supreme Court upheld part of an Indiana measure that was signed into law when Vice President Mike Pence was governor of the state.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
We do not yet know how the Supreme Court might rule on state laws passed to restrict abortion this year. We now do know how the court addressed an abortion law passed a few years ago in the state of Indiana. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg.
NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The renewed storm over abortion struck this week with repeated force. Today in Missouri, Planned Parenthood is in court over a standoff with state regulators that threatens to close down the only remaining clinic in the state that performs abortions. Yesterday, the Supreme Court, by a 7-2 vote, upheld part of an Indiana statute signed into law by Vice President Pence when he was governor. It mandates that aborted fetal remains be buried or cremated.
In contrast, the court let stand a lower court ruling that struck down a different provision that banned abortions for reasons of fetal abnormality or disability as well as abortions based on race, gender or ancestry. In an unsigned opinion, the court said it would wait for other lower court rulings before weighing in on fetal characteristic provisions. The decision appeared to be a compromise between some of the court's conservative and liberal justices.
Law professor Leah Litman of the University of California, Irvine.
LEAH LITMAN: That has a solitary benefit of keeping abortion out of the court's docket in an election year and, in that respect, makes the court look less political.
TOTENBERG: But keeping abortion cases off the docket will be difficult, as illustrated yesterday by the fire-breathing, 20-page opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas that leveled a broadside attack against Planned Parenthood, alleging that the group's founders had been enthusiastic supporters of eugenics. He said, quote, ""this case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation. From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics,"" close quote.
While yesterday's opinion allows the court to tread water on abortion for now, still sitting on the court's docket is a lower court ruling temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court earlier this term. At issue is a Louisiana law that's nearly identical to a Texas statute struck down by the court just three years ago. The law requires doctors who perform abortions at clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. In 2016, the Supreme Court said that same kind of provision in Texas did nothing to promote the health of women seeking abortions but did impose barriers to abortion by imposing needless requirements on abortion providers.
In any event, legal experts on the left and right see Roe v. Wade on the chopping block. With five conservative justices on the court now, all with outspoken views opposed to Roe, it would seem the only question is whether the landmark decision will be hollowed out so that abortions are, for all practical purposes, unavailable in a dozen or more states, or whether the court will actually reverse Roe entirely, handing the abortion question completely back to the states.
George Mason University law professor Helen Alvare.
HELEN ALVARE: All of the smart money, from what I've been hearing, is that the court would prefer an orderly and bit-by-bit giving back to states more of the authority to legislate on abortion restrictions.
TOTENBERG: Professor Litman maintains that hollowing out Roe versus outright reversing it is, in practical terms, a distinction without a difference. But hollowing out Roe is better optics.
LITMAN: I think it allows the court to kind of get off easy because it doesn't create the same kind of public rallying cry and issue around which to kind of motivate voters who care about this issue to go to the polls and make some changes.
TOTENBERG: Don Verrilli, who served as the government's chief advocate in the Supreme Court under President Obama, however, predicts a direct ruling to overturn Roe in the next three to five years. He draws an analogy to the court's desire to go slow on gay marriage.
DON VERRILLI: You know, there was a sense in 2013, well, this is going to be a while because the court isn't ready to address this issue yet. But then boom - it was there two years later, and I think that's because events forced the court's hand. And I think something parallel is likely to happen here too.

Missouri Health Clinic May Be Forced To Stop Abortion Services,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727815202/missouri-health-clinic-may-be-forced-to-stop-abortion-services?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, about how Missouri could soon lose the only clinic that provides abortions.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The state of Missouri is days away from becoming the first state without a single health facility that provides abortions. The state health department is threatening not to renew the license of the last clinic that does. Dr. Leana Wen of Planned Parenthood, which runs that clinic, discussed the case yesterday on NPR's All Things Considered.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LEANA WEN: If the court does not grant us a restraining order, Missouri will go dark. And more than 1.1 million women of reproductive age will be living in a state where they cannot access essential health care - the first time since 1974 that safe, legal abortion is inaccessible to people in an entire state.
INSKEEP: The state is asserting its right to interview the employees of the clinic, but some do not want to talk. And that's where the conflict lies. Dr. Colleen McNicholas did answer the state's questions. She is an OB-GYN and has performed abortions at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region. She's on the line.
Good morning.
COLLEEN MCNICHOLAS: Good morning, Steven. Thanks for having me.
INSKEEP: I know you may not be able to say every detail. But, broadly speaking, what is it that the state wants to know?
MCNICHOLAS: Yes. I can't get into specifics, but I can say generally that the department asked about our practices at RHS, including - and maybe really specifically focusing on - how we work with residents and fellow trainees. And while I still believe that the interviews are unnecessary, as I'm confident about the exceptional care that we provide, I do also hope that the department now feels that with a better understanding of how medical education works that they can resolve any remaining issues.
INSKEEP: That, on the surface, doesn't sound unreasonable; that the state - which licenses your facility, wants to make sure that it's safe and in accordance with laws and regulations - would ask people about that subject.
MCNICHOLAS: That's exactly right. And Planned Parenthood has - for as long as I have been working with Planned Parenthood - has been responsive to oversight. And we are interested in sincere and reasonable oversight to help make health care more safe and appropriate for our patients. However, it's impossible for us to do that when they use that oversight process as a weapon to politically drive an agenda.
INSKEEP: That sounds like you do not think that this is sincere and reasonable oversight.
MCNICHOLAS: It's hard to believe that it is when, in fact, the state department of health continues to reassess and reinterpret their own regulations from year to year.
INSKEEP: Would it not make sense, though, for some of your colleagues who have declined to answer questions to simply do as you have done and answer them?
MCNICHOLAS: You know, it's interesting because one of the tactics they're using is to really focus on trainees. Those are residents and fellows who are still in training, who are only providing care under the supervision of attending physicians. And the standard sort of across medical education is that, ultimately, the attending physicians are responsible for the care provided. And, really, this can only be seen as a tactic to harass and intimidate those trainees.
INSKEEP: I guess we should just be - residents, doctors in training; these are people who are - apprenticed is the wrong word. But they're working under someone like you. That's the kind of person you're talking about, right?
MCNICHOLAS: That's correct.
INSKEEP: And are they especially vulnerable in some ways - legally vulnerable or otherwise - if they're answering a lot of questions?
MCNICHOLAS: Well, you know, this is part of the larger context of criminalizing abortion across the states - criminalizing it for patients who are seeking abortion and for physicians and clinicians who are providing that care. And so certainly in Missouri, like in many other states, there are some abortion statutes that are tied to criminal penalties.
INSKEEP: Again, granting that you can't get into all the specifics - but I want to know if there is evidence to back up what you just said. You've essentially said this is a process where they're asking questions that, on the surface, are reasonable. But it seems like they're in bad faith. Was there something that any state official has done or said to you in that questioning or elsewhere that makes you think they're just trying to shut this clinic down?
MCNICHOLAS: Well, here, I can give you this as an example. So there has long been a requirement to include pelvic exams in the provision of our care, which is part of standard medical care for providing a surgical aspiration abortion. However, this year, despite this being part of our practice forever, the state has now reinterpreted its own regulation to say we must provide that pelvic exam at the same time that we perform their consent, which is at least three days and, sometimes, weeks before the patient actually has the procedure - which has no medical relevance to their care.
And so that's just one example of how the state is continuing to reinterpret their own regulations - really making the goalpost for compliance continuously moving and impossible for us to comply with.
INSKEEP: Dr. McNicholas, I want to take a moment to ask a really big question here. You are providing a service - abortions - a service that is a constitutional right according to Roe v. Wade in many, many circumstances but a service that a lot of people in this country and probably a lot of people listening now find fundamentally wrong. What have you said when you've encountered - I don't know - a friend or a relative or an acquaintance who just disagrees with what you do?
MCNICHOLAS: You know, everybody has an opinion on abortion until they need one. And so what I remind people is that it is completely appropriate for them to have an opinion on it, but their opinion should direct their own health care and that public health policy should really be driven by science and evidence and that every person deserves to make their health care decisions consistent and in line with their own values.
INSKEEP: Even if those values, in the case of some people listening now, would include protecting the unborn - that's the way they would phrase it.
MCNICHOLAS: Again, you know, my experience has been that everybody's opinion on abortion changes once they face a situation or their sister or their brother or their mom faces a situation in which they might need one.
INSKEEP: Well, Dr. McNicholas, you're still on the job today. Correct?
MCNICHOLAS: That's true. We are still open.
INSKEEP: Until Friday.
MCNICHOLAS: We are open and providing abortion services until Friday, and we will continue to provide the remainder of the services that we provide beyond then.
INSKEEP: OK. Dr. McNicholas, thanks so much - really appreciate it.
MCNICHOLAS: Thanks, Steven.
INSKEEP: Colleen McNicholas is an OB-GYN who has provided abortions at the last clinic that is still doing so in Missouri. We should note that NPR's reached out to Governor Mike Parson and also to Dr. Randall Williams, the director of Missouri's Health Department. They have not yet responded to our requests for comment. But if you or your staff are listening, that invitation is still open.
