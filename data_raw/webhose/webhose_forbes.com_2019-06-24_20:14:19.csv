The Web Brought Us Limitless Information But Not The Tools To Manage It,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/25/the-web-brought-us-limitless-information-but-not-the-tools-to-manage-it/,"Trinity College. (Eddy Buttarelli/REDA&CO/UIG via Getty Images) Getty We are at a crossroads of democracy. Our globalized world is balkanizing as societies retreat within their algorithmically-shaped filter bubbles, while falsehoods and foreign influence co-opt the digital sphere to poison the information commons as local journalism’s countervailing influence fades. At their core, democracies rest upon an informed and enlightened society. Yet despite ever-greater information access, the lack of attendant tools to help us make sense of it all means societies are fracturing as the deluge of information reinforces our biases rather than expanding our horizons to humanize those different from ourselves. Is there any hope for our digital future? ADVERTISEMENT
The Web’s great promise was to unlock the world’s information, enabling anyone, anywhere to access all of human knowledge.
In many ways it has succeeded in this vision.
The problem is that this great leap in information access did not come with an attendant leap in how we access and understand all of this information.
Our human brains and societal structures were built for an era of information scarcity, yet we now live in an era of limitless abundance.
Our search engines are still based on keyword searches of text, even while the Web has moved to imagery and video.
Our limited attention span cannot begin to cope with the fire hose of content roaring by so we turn to algorithms to filter it for us.
Yet those algorithms are created by commercial companies focused on nudging us towards monetizable content and behaviors, not the acquisition of new knowledge and thoughtful discourse that can create the kind of informed society that can be a better participant in democracy.
Instead of enlighten, those algorithms attempt to enrage .
It is remarkable to think that the Web promised us informational riches, but not the tools to manage that newfound abundance.
At its core, the modern Web arose as a publishing platform, offering society a way to mass distribute information, but without any built-in mechanism for managing it all. The Web repackages words inside Web pages and provides the digital shipping to share those pages with the world. ADVERTISEMENT
Similarly, book publishers repackage words inside bindings and provide the shipping infrastructure to get those words to others.
Neither modality considers how to manage access and understanding of those words.
In the world of books, the institution of the library and the professional class of librarians emerged to assemble, catalog, index and help society navigate and leverage the intellectual and cultural riches of books. In the modern era these libraries and librarians were institutionalized as a state-supported public good, helping to both build community and assist those communities in navigating the complex informational world.
In contrast, the Web never developed the concept of the public good library or librarian. Those roles were taken over by commercial enterprises placing profit over all else. In particular, the role of the knowledgeable human librarian helping us better ourselves has been taken over by the faceless opaque algorithm nudging us towards self-destructive monetizable behaviors.
This raises the question of what the future Web might look like?
What technological and methodological infrastructure could help tomorrow’s leaders and society itself harness the digital world to engage in the thoughtful discourse and informed debate that defines democracy? ADVERTISEMENT
What technological changes might nudge us towards empowered and enlightened societies that bridge our differences rather than fomenting the demagoguery that deepens those divides?
How could we reorient the digital sphere towards creating the more informed societies that will strengthen and enrich our democracies into the 21st century?
Putting this all together, there are no easy answers to these questions. Given the way in which the modern Web has evolved into for-profit walled gardens curated by algorithms designed to nudge us towards monetizable behaviors rather than enlightened discourse, it is unclear what might reset the Web towards something more akin to the civic-oriented library and the public good librarians that staff them.
In the end, perhaps the biggest lesson the Web has taught us is that publishing platforms are of little use without the curators to help us navigate them. It is not book-laden shelves or digital publishing platforms that drive or destroy democracy, it is those curators that help us navigate our informational riches that are who, in human form, underlie successful democracies and who in algorithmic form can drive us towards dictatorships. The only question is which will prevail as the Web passes its third decade.

"Advice To Marketers Who Choose To Work For Large, Blue-Chip Firms",www.forbes.com,Kimberly A. Whitler,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/05/25/advice-to-students-who-choose-to-work-for-large-blue-chip-firms/,"I recently looked at data that indicated that many people often believe that working for large companies is not nearly as much fun as working for startups. The perception is that big firms are slow, uninspired, lack innovation, and bureaucratic. As somebody who has worked for both large and small(er) organizations (although none that were startups), I can generally understand this perception. However, I think it misses important and valuable perspective. ADVERTISEMENT A student who recently graduated accepted a job at a large, multinational firm. He is coming from nimble, small, unsophisticated organizations and so the shift to a large, structured, process-oriented system may be something of a shock. In preparation for the change, I sent him a version of the following letter. I share it with others in the hopes that they can perhaps see the benefits of working for a large company, and not just the negatives.
Open Letter on the Value of Working for a Big, Blue-Chip Company
As you leave school, I want to share some final thoughts on what you are about to experience.
You made a decision to work for a large, blue-chip, best-in-class training firm for a number of smart reasons. You indicated that you want to learn from a company that has had nearly two centuries of trial and error, perfecting processes, systems and approaches. You want to learn how to create $1 billion brands and how to steward them through periods of growth and decline. You want to understand how a sophisticated company approaches marketing and manufacturing and logistics and strategic relationships and finance. You want to learn how to create reward systems that motivate employees, how to structure the business to drive cross-functional alignment, and how to identify talent using best practices. In a nutshell, you chose a large company because they have the systems, processes, and training to help you maximize your learning and growth. I applaud your decision. Your 20's and 30's are about acquiring as much learning as possible; going to a company that has built world-class systems and has a reputation for providing the best training possible is smart.
However, it won't come without significant frustration. Large companies have $1 billion brands ... and they have a lot to lose. Small companies often have little to lose and so they put a premium on speed, not necessarily accuracy. They are often comfortable making mistakes because they are in a race to launch a single product faster than anybody else. Big companies have a lot to lose. Look at Toyota, BP, or Bayer's recent crisis. They move slower, with higher levels of oversight, precisely because the risk of making a mistake is much greater.
I joined P&G after serving in the military and so I was comfortable with structure, systems and process - and frankly P&G was less structured with greater autonomy than the military. You are entering a big firm from the opposite direction. You come from organizations that provided more flexibility, less structure, and more autonomy, enabling you to make decisions without asking others and moving quickly.
In the new company, because the impact of your decisions will be much more significant, you will face more scrutiny. As a 22-year old Brand Assistant at P&G, they entrusted me to manage a roughly $140 million promotion budget (this was in 1990 dollars). Would you hand $140 million to a 22-year old, inexperienced manager without asking questions and providing oversight? I wouldn't. You will be handed a lot of responsibility and the ability to have tremendous impact but it comes with oversight. That is one way to look at it. The other way is to consider your manager's engagement as coaching. You will have somebody who: 1) helps you learn how to think about these decisions, 2) helps you consider issues you wouldn't have otherwise, and 3) invests in your ability to one day make such decisions without oversight. I think that is exactly why you chose to go to a big company--to learn how to make decisions that drive profitable growth from really smart people who invest their time in your career and development. I call this training, coaching and mentorship that leads to faster growth and skill development.
ADVERTISEMENT I tell you this because I will be surprised if you don't feel a degree of ""constraint"" that will be frustrating. You will see a lot of problems and a lot of opportunity to fix things -- and are coming from environments that encourage non-stop vocal leadership from the most junior of folks. I encourage you to spend the first 6 months ""figuring out the company"". Watch, listen, ask questions, learn. Wait to provide your opinion (except on the business; see below). In general, it's a system where you have to earn the right to express an opinion. You earn it through data, analysis and experience (i.e., time). Higher ed doesn't distinguish between those with experience and knowledge and those without. Your company will. Having an opinion is best backed up with data, analysis, logic and/or experience.
You will have to learn the norms and unsaid expectations of behavior. Do people openly disagree with others in meetings? How do they challenge one another? Who does the challenging? What is the role of different people at different levels? Who is perceived to be a rock star? How does he/she behave? Why are they considered to be exceptional? In addition to being smart, what behaviors are associated with success/failure at the firm?
While this may be somewhat painful, guess what, you will do this forever. It is required if you want to adapt to the firm that you are joining. One way to acclimate is to look at your job in four stages:
Job #1: Understand the system
Job #2: Fit into the system (i.e., become a valued partner)
ADVERTISEMENT Job #3: Become a star (i.e., become a terrific business leader)
Job #4: Change the system
When I was in high school, I complained to my father that I, as a female, couldn't tee off (golf) until after the men/in the PM. I was angry. I had a lower handicap than almost all of the men (I ended up being recruited to play in college). Why wasn't tee time based on ability? My dad said, ""You can't change the system until you are part of the system. And you are a guest of mine, not a member. With that attitude, nobody will want you as a member and you'll never change anything."" I'm paraphrasing because my father said this in a kinder, gentler way. But this was an incredibly valuable lesson. Once you have fit into the system and have earned credibility, you have a greater ability to make a change. Of note, this doesn't apply to your area of responsibility. They will want you to use data/analysis to have opinions quickly.
And the final point ... how do you deal with the frustration that comes from working in a big company? I would encourage you to find a mechanism to focus on the positives. Here are five thoughts.
1) What are your reasons for choosing to work for a big company? Write them down and keep them in front of you. Stay focused on your ""why"" and it will better enable you to cope with the frustrations. Nothing is perfect. At the smaller companies I worked for, there was great frustration associated with the lack of process and systems. You often work in chaos which wastes a lot of time. I have learned that the grass is never greener; it's simply a different shade of green. You trade one set of frustrations for another. So learning to cope with the frustration is far more fruitful.
ADVERTISEMENT 2) Positive Reflection: At the end of each day/week, reflect on one thing that you learned about building and running a business and write it down.
3) Intention: At the beginning of each day, as you look at your schedule, think about one thing that you want to learn, one area to focus on.
4) Skill-Building Planning and Resume Building: Have a strategic plan for the skills you want to acquire. How will you acquire them? Manage the plan. At the end of each quarter, update your resume and have a separate document that summarizes your new knowledge acquired / skills accumulated. This will help at some point in the future (when you choose to apply for new jobs), but it will also allow you to reflect on how much you are growing quarter over quarter.
5) Find Positivity: There will be disgruntled people at your firm. And there will be really happy people. Make a commitment to hang around the people who are making it work. It will rub off.
Work is work and it isn't always fun. Every company presents challenges and frustrations. The more you can see how your decision is having a positive impact on your knowledge, skill, and growth, the more you will be able to cope with the frustrations. And oh by the way, there are millions of people who applied for your job and didn't get it. At some point, that company's name on your resume will be a brand badge that will follow you forever. So always remain grateful and thankful for the opportunity you have.
I leave you with best wishes for a successful experience and look forward to following your success in the future."
The Top 11 Books Americans Tried To Ban Last Year,www.forbes.com,Adam Rowe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamrowe1/2019/05/25/the-top-11-books-americans-tried-to-ban-last-year/,"Hundreds of individuals in the U.S. issue challenges to their local schools or libraries every year, attempting to get certain books banned. The typical reasoning is that the book in question highlights or endorses a value that the challenger doesn't hold, and doesn't want their child exposed to. As a result, the running list of the top most challenged book titles in the U.S. — operated by the American Library Association’s Office of Intellectual Freedom — offers a unique window into the state of the union: Any hot-button topics that parents are the most up in arms about will be revealed through the books that they found most offensive.
The eleven most popular titles on the list for 2018 include plenty of titles from previous top-ten lists of banned books: George , by Alex Gino, a Lambda Literary Award-winner for elementary-age children that features a transgender child, was the number one most challenged book in 2018, after reaching number five in 2017. 2017's number one, Thirteen Reasons Why , by Jay Asher, dropped to number six on the 2018 list.
The biggest new addition this year, however, is A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo , which was the second most challenged book of 2018. Written by Jill Twiss and illustrated by EG Keller, the children's book details a fictionalized look at the life of Marlon Bundo, the real pet rabbit of Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. It was banned and challenged for ""political and religious viewpoints,"" proving that the U.S.'s polarized politics are leading the way in book bans as well as driving millions in book sales .
Here's the full list of the top most challenged books of 2018, from the American Library Association’s Office of Intellectual Freedom :
George by Alex Gino
Reasons: banned, challenged, and relocated because it was believed to encourage children to clear browser history and change their bodies using hormones, and for mentioning “dirty magazines,” describing male anatomy, “creating confusion,” and including a transgender character
A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo by Jill Twiss, illustrated by EG Keller Reasons: banned and challenged for including LGBTQIA+ content, and for political and religious viewpoints
Captain Underpants series written and illustrated by Dav Pilkey Reasons: series was challenged because it was perceived as encouraging disruptive behavior, while Captain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stinks-A-Lot was challenged for including a same-sex couple
The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas Reasons: banned and challenged because it was deemed “anti-cop,” and for profanity, drug use, and sexual references
Drama written and illustrated by Raina Telgemeier Reasons: banned and challenged for including LGBTQIA+ characters and themes
Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher Reasons: banned, challenged, and restricted for addressing teen suicide
This One Summer by Mariko Tamaki, illustrated by Jillian Tamaki Reasons: banned and challenged for profanity, sexual references, and certain illustrations
Skippyjon Jones series written and illustrated by Judy Schachner Reason: challenged for depicting stereotypes of Mexican culture
The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie Reasons: banned and challenged for sexual references, profanity, violence, gambling, and underage drinking, and for its religious viewpoint
This Day in June by Gayle E. Pitman, illustrated by Kristyna Litten Reason: challenged and burned for including LGBTQIA+ content
Two Boys Kissing by David Levithan Reason: challenged and burned for including LGBTQIA+ content"
As EternalBlue Racks Up Damages It Reminds Us There Is No Such Thing As A Safe Cyber Weapon,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/25/as-eternalblue-racks-up-damages-it-reminds-us-there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-safe-cyber-weapon/,"Since the NSA lost control of its EternalBlue exploit two years ago, the tool has been repurposed by criminals and state actors alike to wreak billions of dollars of damage, upend the lives of citizens, damage businesses and paralyze governments. As the US Government’s own weapon is increasingly used to attack US municipalities, including, according to the New York Times, the recent Baltimore ransomware attack, it raises the question of whether governments and companies should have to pay for the damages when their cyber weapons escape their enclosures. When a US military training exercise goes awry or a weapon misfires and there is damage to civilian infrastructure, the military typically covers the cost of repairs. The same has not historically been true with respect to cyber weapons.
The NSA’s loss of control of its tranche of potent cyber weapons including EternalBlue marked a turning point of sorts in modern cyber warfare. Suddenly even amateur hackers had access to state-developed weapons against which much of the personal and business computing world were utterly defenseless.
Most importantly, these weapons were not fragile proof of concept experiments but rather battle-hardened production weapons designed for immediate deployment.
In many ways the loss of EternalBlue was the physical world’s equivalent of a nuclear armory being raided and distributed to criminals and adversaries across the world, along with the necessary equipment and codes to utilize them.
These were not innocuous computer programs repurposed to nefarious ends like an encrypted messaging app being used to plan a terror attack. They were legitimate state-created weapons that the state lost control of.
Over the subsequent two years, these tools have caused immense global damage raising the question of whether the US Government should be held financially responsible for the global harm its weapons have caused.
As governments across the world increasingly develop and stockpile such cyber weapons, there will invariably be future breaches. More intriguingly, as commercial hacking-for-hire companies stockpile their own armories of weapons, if those are lost to criminal actors or adversarial states, could those companies be held responsible for the harms caused by their weapons?
Could a US municipality sue the federal government for the costs of restoring its systems if the damage was incurred through the use of a US-developed weapon?
What might the liability landscape look like as foreign countries tally the damage from US cyber weapons used against them?
What about an ordinary citizen whose loved one dies in the hospital because a US cyber weapon caused medical equipment to malfunction during their surgery?
Could citizens, cities and businesses turn to the US Government for compensation?
More broadly, what happens to liability and responsibility as cyber vulnerabilities increasingly leach into the physical world? A consumer product with negligent physical construction that injures a user falls upon well-established legal precedent. What happens when a cyber vulnerability causes that injury?
Imagine an internet-connected oven in which a built-in debugging account with a default password is used to set a house on fire, killing its occupants. Would a court today still view that through the same lens as more traditional negligent physical construction? What happens if the oven itself adhered to all known security best practices, but a state-created zero-day is misdirected and targets that oven instead of the victim’s desktop? What if that zero-day is in the hands of a criminal organization rather than being wielded by a state actor?
In many ways the new landscape of cyber bears far more resemblance to the world of biological weaponry than the conventional munitions it is often likened to. Much like EternalBlue could be captured, mutated and repurposed an infinite number of times and even attack unintended targets, so too can biological weapons follow similar trajectories.
This is one of the reasons biological weapons have largely fallen out of favor: they can too easily harm unintended targets or swing back around and wreak havoc on the very nation that deploys them.
It seems the cyber world has failed to learn from those lessons.
Putting this together, the cyber landscape poses unprecedented new challenges to how we understand liability and responsibility. Unlike physical weapons that have clear manufacturing origins and can only be used once, cyber weapons often have far murkier origins and once released into the wild can be harvested and rereleased an infinite number of times. This makes them pose a unique threat to all nations in a way few munitions outside of biological agents do.
Will the increasing loss of control over cyber weapons eventually lead to governments proactively inoculating their own networks to protect against inadvertent return fallout? How might governments attempt to shield their own domestic citizenry without tipping off adversaries of their new capabilities?
In the end, the way in which EternalBlue has come back to wreak harm across the United States reminds us that there is no such thing as a safe cyber weapon."
"These Tiny, Bottom-Dwelling Fish May Be The Reason That Coral Reefs Are Flush With Life",www.forbes.com,Priya Shukla,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/priyashukla/2019/05/25/these-tiny-bottom-dwelling-fish-may-be-the-reason-that-coral-reefs-are-flush-with-life/,"In his 1842 book, The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs , Charles Darwin remarked that coral reefs were like an ""oasis in the desert"" - they were flush with life despite being surrounded by nutrient-poor seawater. This is a mystery that scientists have continued to grapple with, ascribing the diversity of reefs to the close relationships between the sea life within the reefs. Essentially, all food and waste produced within reefs is rapidly taken up, leaving only a few remnants in the seawater. However, a new study shows that tiny “cryptobenthic” reef fish – so called because they easily camouflage with the seafloor – may help make up the nutrient gap in coral reefs. Because cryptobenthic fish are incredibly small and reclusive, they can be difficult to study, so their role in ocean ecosystems is still being understood.
""We still don’t know the true diversity of cryptobenthic reef fishes on a global scale,"" says Dr. Carole Baldwin , a co-author of this study and curator of fishes at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, ""Most of the new reef-fish species discovered and described over at least the past few decades are cryptobenthics.""
Traditionally, when fish hatch from their eggs, they travel offshore to develop further before returning to their reefs closer to home. However, cryptobenthic reef fish stay closer to their parents’ reefs than other fishes do, which increases their survival and allows them to exist in such high quantities that they provide sufficient nutrition to larger fishes in the absence of other nutrients. The fish that survive their encounters with predators grow quickly and eventually become adults.
""The key to the role of the cryptobenthic fish larvae is that they don’t seem to be going anywhere,"" says lead author Dr. Simon Brandl , who worked with the Smithsonian’s Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network when this research was conducted, ""Basically, by foregoing the dangerous journey through the open ocean, the cryptobenthics form an (almost) endless cycle of life and death that provides a critical food source to larger fishes.""
Examples of cryptobenthic fish include gobies, blennies, and cardinalfishes, but also many fishes that will never be more than 1 inch in size. These fish are primarily fish food during the first few weeks of their lives and they exist in massive quantities during this time period, making up nearly 60 percent of the food that coral reef fishes consume.
""We are quick to recognize the importance of what we often call “forage fish” or “bait fish,” which have important roles for many important open-ocean fisheries species,"" says Dr. Brandl, ""My guess is that cryptobenthics fill a similar role to forage fish on the world’s shallow coastlines, but we have yet to fully discover this role.”"
3 Steps To Take Before Telling Your Brand's Data Story,www.forbes.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescontentmarketing/2018/09/05/3-steps-to-take-before-telling-your-brands-data-story/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin You log into your analytics dashboard on Monday morning to check traffic and engagement from the past week. All metrics are up by some miracle, so your day is off to a good start.
But when’s the last time you stopped to think about the method to the madness—the story behind the data? Without understanding the context, how much are the charts and graphs really worth?
I recently moderated a panel at the 2018 National Association of Black Journalists convention called “Predictive Data and Its Virtual Seat at the Table.”
The panelists—data pros from Dataminr , Spotify, and Columbia University—dug into how data decides what we believe matters and influences the content we create. L to R: Sade Muhammad (moderator), Roland Carter, Nekpen Osuan & Brian Clarke taking a question from the crowd at the NABJ data panel in Detroit.
Data is so powerful because it has “direct implications on [so much]—from what we think is healthy, to what we think is meaningful, to what we believe is true,” says Nekpen Osuan, adjunct professor of Data & Analytics at New York and Columbia Universities and founder of WomenWerk .
Here are three ways to gut-check the data in your dashboard and make sure your team is equipped to evaluate progress and drive success.
1. Uncover any biases in your data.
“There’s a saying, ‘garbage in, garbage out,’” says Roland Carter, data scientist at Spotify. “The same can be said for data—bias in, bias out.” Data teams at Spotify have access to an algorithmic bias checklist that helps them assess how biases can influence data.
The Spotify voice speaker is one example of where bias can come in. An algorithm might misinterpret artist names with special characters like A$AP Ferg or Ke$ha. If Spotify had assumed certain fans didn’t use the voice command feature, an entire audience that wanted to engage could have been overlooked. But because the data scientists account for how bias impacts product data, they’re able to catch and address such flaws.
2. Adapt your strategy over time.
“We use a lot of data to determine how can we reach a user with the right content at the right time,” says Carter. A lot of that success, he explains, is about having a robust data set to train models on past listener activity. With each new Spotify playlist, Carter and his team aim to drive engagement while also staying on-brand. Through sophisticated algorithms and personalized playlists, casual visitors turn into full-fledged fans.
How do you work toward building that level of customer loyalty? Create a roadmap and be open to evolving your KPIs and strategy over time. You can then deliver a more accurate view of what success for your campaign means now, and what it could mean in a year’s time. “As important as the algorithm is, the metric you’re optimizing is equally as important,” says Carter.
3. Know what the numbers don’t show.
In addition to her work as an educator, Nekpen Osuan has worked as a political organizer on presidential campaigns. She recalls a campaign where a consulting firm advised her team about how a set of voter data should inform campaign strategy. The data might have been technically accurate based on the polled users, but Osuan knew from her work on the ground that it wasn’t a true depiction of the region. She didn’t speak up—and later wished she had.
Professionals must bring their own expertise into the room to help gut-check technology and data, Osuan says. “Don’t check your conscience at the door when you have a technical meeting. Even if it looks intimidating, get closer to the data sets that actually drive outcomes.”
Dataminr monitors budding trends, breaking news and big moments to help clients keep up with the fast pace of social media. Brian Clarke, senior manager of event detection and operations, may be an expert in trend-spotting and making decisions based on data, but the data scientists who collect data are just as important to his team’s success.
Clarke says he consults with his technical colleagues to discover how data sets become the insights he uses to make strategic decisions. He recommends stepping outside of your comfort zone to deepen your technical knowledge and get a fundamental understanding of what data is really saying.
“It’s important to ask yourself: How do my users want to interact with my product?” he says. “How do I make this product as accessible as possible? How do we make sure it’s user-friendly, efficient, and [delivered] in the way [the user] likes it?” Ultimately, he explains, a shrewd understanding of your data story is the first step to meeting—and exceeding—audience expectation.

Taking Risks and Giving Back: The Socially Responsible CEO,www.forbes.com,Stephanie Sarkis,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniesarkis/2019/05/25/taking-risks-and-giving-back-the-socially-responsible-ceo/,"Representative Justin Amash, a Republican from Michigan, became the first member of the GOP in Congress to state that President Trump's behavior reached ""the threshold for impeachment."" He stated in a tweet that he believed ""President Trump has engaged in impeachable conduct."" Immediately the GOP went on the offense, with Trump calling Amash a ""loser"" and a ""lightweight."" Amash's response was that those in the GOP that questioned or criticized his statements "" were resting their argument on several falsehoods ."" An ""outlier,"" like Amash, can be a catalyst for change, but that change can largely depend on how much his voice is suppressed. Suppressed by others who do not believe in the outlier's stance; do not believe the timing for the message is right; or have a personal grudge against the messenger. However, there are outliers that create positive change day after day. For now, let's steer the conversation towards another kind of outlier- CEOs that are going out on a limb to create positive change in their companies and around the world. As a leader, the outlier can propel the company and its employees forward; again, the ""catalyst for change"" principle. For example, Chobani's CEO Hamdi Ulukaya announced the company would be paying off students' lunch debt in Rhode Island's Warwick Public Schools. The school had announced that children with debt on their lunch accounts would be given only a ""sunflower butter and jelly sandwich"" until their debt is paid off. This is widely referred to as ""lunch shaming."" (The school system has since rescinded its policy.)
Ulukaya was born to a Kurdish shepherding family in Turkey. He arrived in America with little money and did not speak English. By 2002, he built a small cheese company, and against advice from friends and family, took out a loan to buy a Kraft yogurt factory that had recently closed and laid off its workforce . That became Chobani. Chobani has over 2,000 employees, with plants in New York, Idaho, and Australia. Ulukaya's net worth is now $1.7 billion . As Ulukaya told Ergulen Toprak , "" In 1994, I came to New York to study English and later became drawn to the idea that anyone can start something in America—all you needed was a dream and the willingness to take a risk,” Ulukaya said.
Ulukaya makes a point of hiring refugees as much as possible. He also has pledged to donate $700 million to help Kurdish refugees and also refugees around the world. In 2016, he gave his employees 10% ownership in Chobani . The number of shares given to employees was based on how much time they had worked at Chobani. The average amount of shares was $150,000.
Malcolm Gladwell, author of Outliers: The Story of Success , states that people that are outliers are given opportunities and seized them. Those opportunities could be the result of various factors, including socioeconomic status, adversity, culture, and luck. Some are in the right place at the right time; others spend hours perfecting their craft or passion. Most are a combination of the two. Ulukaya had to take the leap of leaving the life he had known and trust that things would work out for him. He also had to have the courage to follow his instinct even when others told him he was not making a wise choice in buying a closed factory.

The next time you are faced with a decision that you know in your gut is right, but everyone else is telling you no, maybe you should take that leap of faith. Doing some analysis and creating some spreadsheets before the leap is even better."
America Begins To See The Consequences Of The Past Policy Errors That Helped China's Rise,www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/05/25/america-begins-to-see-the-consequences-of-the-past-policy-errors-that-helped-chinas-rise/?ss=retirement,"From the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean and the African Continent, China is rising fast, challenging America’s long dominance. That’s something investors should watch closely, as rising tensions between the world’s two largest economies raise geopolitical risks that begin to spread beyond trade. China’s rise didn’t happen by accident. It occurred systematically, helped by the kindness of the previous US administrations that allowed China to launch and execute its grand strategy. That’s according to a recently published Council of Foreign Affairs special report , which argues that US administrations, from President Clinton to President Obama, misread China’s strategic intentions on several fronts; and made optimistic statements about US-China relations.

While these presidents were making such optimistic statements over a nearly twenty-year period, China implemented a grand strategy under Xi Jinping; used geoeconomic tools to coerce its neighbors and others, including most recently though the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); violated international commercial practices, including by committing massive theft of U.S. intellectual property; manipulated its currency for trade benefits; threatened Taiwan; build up its military forces to push the United States beyond Japan and the Philippines; constructed and militarized artificial islands in the South China Sea, in violation of the international law. . . and patiently and incrementally built its power and influence with the strategic goal of challenging the United States as the primary power in Asia. One of the errors of previous administrations in South Asia was the failure to assure Asian allies that America would come to their side in case they were attacked by China, as has been argued by foreign policy experts for quite some-time. Ely Ratner of the Center for American Security, for instance, has been calling for America to abandon its neutrality in the South China Sea region by supplementing diplomacy with military assurances. In ‘The Stealth Superpower: How China Hid Its Global Ambitions,’ published in the January/February issue of Foreign Affairs, he says the US “should supplement diplomacy with deterrence by warning China that if it continues, the United States will abandon its neutrality and help countries in the region defend their claims. Washington should make it clear that it can live with an uneasy stalemate in Asia—but not with Chinese hegemony.” Ted Bauman, a senior research analyst and economist at Banyan Hill Publishing, agrees that US administrations played a role in accommodating China’s rise. But it wasn’t an act of kindness. “Successive U.S. governments have played a critical role in creating the modern Chinese economy, above all the Clinton administration's assistance to get China into the WTO,” says Bauman. “But they didn't do that out of the goodness of their hearts. They did it as part of a broader shift in the nature of the U.S. political economy — which in turn contributed to our trade deficit with China.” Like what he calls “post-New Deal social compact,” a system that allowed America to cope with the wage stagnation of the 1980s and the 1980s. Opening up the American economy to China allowed American workers to “have access to low-cost Chinese wage goods,” like electronics, appliances, clothing furniture and so on. This would mitigate the stagnation of real wages,” says Bauman.”
Getty Then there was easy credit that allowed Americans to live beyond their means, which placed American wage earners at the core of America’s merchandise deficit with China, according to Bauman. “A nation runs trade deficits when its consumption spending exceeds the value of goods and services it produces,” explains Bauman. “By using money borrowed from the owners of capital to buy Chinese goods before they have earned the wages that will ultimately pay for them, U.S. wage earners are at the heart of our merchandise trade deficit with China.” The bottom line: US policies accommodating China’s rise in the last twenty years may look like a policy error today, but they looked like an opportunity back then, when these policies were launched. US policies confronting China today look like an opportunity, how will they look in the next twenty years?

"Amazon Turns Shopping Malls Into Warehouses, Changing America's Community Landscape",www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/05/25/amazon-turns-shopping-malls-into-warehouses-changing-americas-community-landscape/?ss=retirement,"After helping drive local shopping malls toward collapse, Amazon is coming back to finish the job: turning them into warehouses. That’s according to scores of reports in recent years, including one early this month published in the Wall Street Journal, discussing how Amazon keeps on turning old malls into fulfillment centers in Northeast Ohio.
Apparently, this strategy makes a great deal of sense for Amazon, as it pushes customer experience to new limits, according to Sean Maharaj, managing director in the transportation logistics and retail practices of AArete.
Getty “While at a surface level, this appears simply to be about converting shopping malls into warehouses to strengthen Amazon’s supply chain and physically position the retailer closer to customers (both rural and urban) for same or next day delivery, the move has all the hallmarks of Amazon’s DNA,” says Mahara j. “It’s yet another example of its creative, disruptive and innovative mindset. The advantage play comes in many forms, but most importantly, pushing customer experience to new limits.”
Getty Amazon’s strategy of converting shopping malls into warehouses is another effective way of competing with brick and mortar retailer giants like Walmart and Target.
“As Walmart races to catch up to Amazon technologically, Amazon is racing to catch up to Walmart in brick and mortar logistical know-how, as well as physical locations it can use as fulfillment centers for its recent one-day shipping promises,” says Eli Finkelshteyn, CEO and co-founder of Constructor.io . “Currently, Walmart is pressing its physical presence advantages and new e-commerce abilities with programs like curb-side pick-up, and Amazon knows it needs to gobble up physical locations quickly to catch up.”
Harry Chemko, CEO of Elastic Path , agrees, but he thinks it’s a temporary solution. ""It’s easy to pay attention to Amazon purchasing mall property, especially given the irony that Amazon has been a big factor in many malls failing, but it’s nothing more than an easy, interim solution for the internet giant.
 The long-term solution? Autonomous semi-trucks, according to Chemko. “In the future, supply chains will see their biggest disruptor to come and it won’t come from warehouses. Autonomous semi-trucks will not only transport products. They will create a mesh network of moving warehouses, and this network will redefine last mile delivery.”
At any rate, Amazon’s strategy could be good for consumers, according to Finkelshteyn . “At the end of the day, consumers demand more instant gratification, and having physical presence near them is a huge leg up in delivering the products they want faster.""
But it may not be good for local communities. Shopping malls aren’t just places to buy or things. They are community centers, part of traditional American life, places to spen d time outside home on weekends and evenings, browsing new merchandise and running into friends and neighbors. T hat can explain the affinity for these types of stores shared by Americans.
Turning shopping malls into warehouses will change America’s community landscape.
Still, things may not end up be as bad as they sound. Amazon may end up turning local shopping malls to showcases or experience centers rather than warehouses, according to Maharaj .
 “ There remains an option for Amazon to convert these near market spaces into customer showcases and/or experience centers,” he says . “ This is what customers and shareholders have all come to expect from Amazon, as the clear leader in strategic disruptive thinking in every industry it touches.”
America’s community landscape will be transformed to adjust to new technology and consumer demands, but it won’t vanish.

Aston Villa Vs. Derby: Research Shows Premier League Spot Worth Much More Than Commonly Touted £170m,www.forbes.com,Bobby McMahon,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2019/05/25/aston-villa-vs-derby-research-shows-premier-league-spot-worth-much-more-than-commonly-touted-170m/,"On Monday, at Wembley Stadium, in London, Aston Villa and Derby face each other in the English Championship playoff. The winner will be promoted to the Premier League and will be the recipient of the biggest payday in world sport. The loser faces another grinding season in the Championship. The commonly held view is that winning Monday's game is worth $215m (£170m). But how is that figure arrived at and could it be less or even a lot more?
First of all, $215m is a back-of-the-envelope calculation. It takes the minimum amount earned by the team finishing last in the Premier League in 2018/19 and adds the value of parachute payments paid to a team relegated after just one season in the Premier League.
The Premier League has published its TV revenue for the 2018/19 season, ranging from £97m for #HTAFC to £152m for #LFC , who earned more than league winners #MCFC £151m, due to more matches broadcast live. Some thoughts in the following thread. pic.twitter.com/EW6blXFJEd
— Swiss Ramble (@SwissRamble) May 24, 2019
Huddersfield finished 20th this past season but still received $122m ( £96.6m) in Premier League prize money. Prize money is calculated using five criteria. Three of the criteria account for 67% of the distributed prize money and is allocated equally. The other two criteria are variable. A merit payment is based on the finishing position and the other is based on the number of times the team is on television.
Huddersfield was again the low mark with a combined allocation of 1.73% versus 5% if the allocations were shared equally. Given that a team can't finish lower than 20th and is going to appear on domestic broadcasts using a benchmark of $215m seems reasonable.
However, there is the new broadcast deal that kicks in starting with the 2019/20 season. Domestic rights for the next cycle are slightly less (7%) than the current deal but reports have overseas rights increasing by around 30%. The split of rights for the new three-year cycle will be 54% domestic and 46% overseas
But also starting next season the increase in overseas rights will be allocated based on merit i.e. based on finishing position. Once things are netted out the team finishing last will receive an estimated increase of $1.6M ( £1.25m) which would bump the minimum to $123.6m.
Parachute payments are linked to 50% of domestic income and 100% of overseas receipts. Parachute payments to teams relegated last season are 55% for 2018/19 - $53.8m ( £42.7m) - and 45% for 2019/20 - $44m (£34.9m).
The value of parachute payments will increase based on the new rights fees so any team relegated in 2019/20 can expect to receive around $105m over two years.
Add the two pieces and you get a minimum of $227M ( £180m).
Wes Edens: “It is a lot of stress. But this could truly be a unique circumstance in my life, where you have two teams deep in the playoffs (Milwaukee Bucks & Aston Villa) with massive consequences on either side of it.” [new york times] #avfc pic.twitter.com/JQByqEq4Y4
— villareport (@villareport) May 24, 2019
But the website sporting intelligence.com takes a different approach in calculating the value of the Championship playoff game.
Sporting Intelligence researched and calculated the additional revenue accrued by Premier League longevity and the halo effect of ""membership"" i.e. self-generated team income. In other words, what actually happened to the winners of each of the playoff matches from 2007 to 2016.
Added to the base value of each team's Premier League longevity were increased gate receipts and additional commercial activity.
The numbers are staggering and generally, well beyond the accepted value at the time.
Of course, all that money doesn't flow to the bottom line. Premier League membership also comes with increased costs, particularly salary costs. Nonetheless, the numbers are amazing.
The Championship play-offs are underway and the ultimate prize - promotion via the one-off final - have never been higher. This graphic from 2017 shows 'the most valuable fixture in sport' has actually always turned out to be even MORE lucrative than claimed. pic.twitter.com/akvXzcL9Ky

How Scottsdale Arizona Has Become A Leading Wellness Destination,www.forbes.com,Bridget Arsenault,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bridgetarsenault/2019/05/25/how-scottsdale-arizona-has-become-a-leading-wellness-destination/,"Deserts have long been places tied to spiritual journeys and purification. And for those with a free spirit who also calculate the thread count on their sheets, Scottsdale Arizona could be the answer. Abutting Phoenix, the state's capital, Scottsdale has a prodigious population of spas and hotels, not to mention a surplus of breathtaking views, outdoor action and a thriving food scene. O ften ranked as one of the most liveable US cities, it's a distinction that has no doubt been aided by its temperate winter climate and its annual 299 days of sun. Home to the saguaro cacti - Herculean finger-like plants that grow and flex for years - there's a magic and a mesmerising beauty found in these desert surrounds. ADVERTISEMENT
Onyx Patio at the Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale
Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale Splayed across 40 acres of striking desert scenery, the Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North sits in a prime location between downtown Scottsdale and downtown Phoenix. The 210 well-proportioned rooms are spread out over the property in a series of one and two-storey casita-style designs. Offering sweeping views of the tangle of rocks that form Pinnacle Peak - notable features throughout include the rustic gas fireplaces, beckoning sitting chairs and certain suites come equipped with telescopes and star charts. Designed with Southwestern influences recurring throughout, you'll find a palate of cream, purple, and burgundy, which reflects the cascade of colours from the surrounding desert.
While there is an excellent 24-hour gym with an exemplary complimentary class schedule, perhaps the best way to unwind and connect once here is to step outside and experience Pinnacle Peak on foot. Reaching an elevation of 3,200 feet, this moderate hike is both smooth and picturesque, an ideal first port of call.
Upon completion the 12,000-square-foot spa offers the ideal respite. Book in for the property's signature moonlight massage. The menu here offers everything you'd expect in terms of top-notch massages, scrubs, nail treatments and facials, as well as a host of extras, such as the introduction of local and seasonal ingredients, including saguaro blossom, the state flower, into the treatments and formulations. Ask as well to experience the aroma therapy bar and design your own unique scented scrub or moisturiser. As for the surrounds, expect plush robes, a sauna, steam room and an excellent spa boutique brimming with both local and international brands.
In fact, the entire resort is designed with serenity in mind - from the mighty hot tub to the three swimming pools (one of which is adults only) to the welcoming sun-drenched deck chairs and commanding desert views.
And as of late, the hotel's food has become a major talking point, ever since Samantha Sanz took hold of the kitchen. Just shy of 30 years old, Sanz is remarkable. Her reinvented T alavera is inspired, drawing influences from Spain, Mexico and even elements of Peru, the menu begets labelling, as it is something altogether unique. Try her twist on paella or splurge on her succulent 10 ounces of Wagyu beef.

With websites like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop touting serenity crystals, psychic vampire repellents to rid the world of negative energy and g olden dumbbells costing $125,000, it's easy to feel disfranchised from this new breed of health gurus. Located just outside of Scottsdale, CIVANA spa and resort - in the aptly named Carefree - is trying to knit the void, offering a retreat venue with a more attainable price tag. Based around four pillars - movement, spa, nourishment and discovery - CIVANA is a holistic wellness destination with a seriously weighty list of classes, experiences and spa treatments. The spa has a whopping 22 treatment rooms and includes a kneippe walk, Sanarium, Watsu therapy pool, 25-meter pool, sundeck and salon. And while onsite you can book in for everything from adult art classes to bowl meditation to aerial yoga to myofascial release and TRX training.

In fact, they've designed an in-house app - the Princess Navigator App - to help you get from a to b and everywhere else in between. Each of the 750 rooms and suites has its own balcony overlooking the golfing greens - a welcome design decision indeed. Decor is modern and muted, with touches of southwest peeking through in the artwork. Rooms also have all the latest gadgets - Nespresso machines, iHome clock radios, docking stations for iPods and clever mini fridges.

Some of the largest rooms range from the 600-square-feet, while the one- to three-bedroom suites measure in at 3,000 square feet and the dramatic presidential suite is about 2,400 square feet. Art throughout the rooms and common spaces pays homage to horses - don't forget this is cowboy country - while the knotted furnishings are clearly influenced by traditional Native American rugs and textiles. Rooms are finished with accents in rich ochre and the serene palm-fringed pool recalls something of a classic Hollywood film set.

After trolling Triple H with a throne-smashing entrance where Cody smashed a Triple-H-like throne with a sledgehammer, Cody defeated brother Dustin Rhodes in an emotionally charged match that featured a disturbing amount of blood.
After the AEW Championship was shockingly presented by Bret Hart, Chris Jericho prevailed over Kenny Omega in the night's main event. Jericho will now face surprise Casino Battle Royale Adam ""Hangman"" Page to crown the inaugural champion.
Jericho's demand for a ""thank you"" from AEW's audience was met with a surprise debut from Jon Moxley, formerly known in WWE as Dean Ambrose.

Cody Rhodes had to start his own wrestling company for this match to happen.
Jim Ross on Dustin Rhodes: ""That's a long walk for a 50-year-old man trying to gain respect from his family."" A poetic sentence indeed, but one that made Dustin sound so pathetic.
I rolled my eyes when I hear the obligatory ""you still got it chants,"" but smirked when I heard the more accurate ""never lost it"" chants.

Despite being the biggest babyfaces in the building, Cody and Brandi Rhodes were admirably dedicated to working heel.
Dustin Rhodes' blood just made it look like he had completed the rest of his red face paint.
Fans were clearly disturbed by the amount of bloodshed by Dustin Rhodes, but they still changed ""this is awesome,"" almost as if they were trying to convince themselves.
Watching people watch along in horror while Goldust lost half his weight in blood felt exactly like the Attitude Era Cody vowed to kill.

The (kayfabe) miscues by The Young Bucks after not wrestling for months was picture-perfect storytelling.
Rey Fenix had the best spot of the night. I won't even do it justice by trying to describe it with words. My point is the lack of instant replay from this company is officially criminal.
At what point does this excellent action become too depressing for The Revival to watch?
If I had one criticism for this match, it would be that it took one too many liberties with false finishes. At one point, even the crowd seemed to be like "" G.T.F.O.H."" and not in a good way.

Kenny Omega began bleeding out of his nose the hard way and the commentary immediately switched the narrative to how Omega's greatest strength, his cardio, had been inhibited. Excellent.
This was the most disciplined use of the V-Trigger by Kenny Omega in years.
This climactic moments of this match suffered from a late botch by Jericho and his victory after a brand new finisher was very surprising.
Jon Moxley feels like this era's Scott Hall circa 1996 and with proper booking, he could be world's better."
Leading Change? Change Your Leaders!,www.forbes.com,Mark Nevins,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hillennevins/2018/10/16/leading-change-change-your-leaders/,"(This article was coauthored with John Hillen .) Of all the stalls a leader may run into—from being unable tell a compelling story about the organization’s purpose, to failing to create a strong team, to mismanaging stakeholder relationships—the most fundamental one, perhaps the “king of all leadership stalls,” is the inability to create other leaders. This stall is especially problematic because the most important job of any leader should be to identify and develop other leaders.
Developing other leaders is no easy task. Many of the leaders we work with aren’t naturally good at this important job, don’t dedicate meaningful time to it, or believe that the grooming of leaders is someone else’s role—perhaps that of the company’s HR or Talent function.
Some executives feel that they lack the training or subject matter expertise to develop other leaders. Such an insecurity is unfortunate as well as ironic: would you rather learn to play basketball from Michael Jordan or from someone who got a Master’s degree in Basketball Theory? In other situations, leaders don’t develop leaders because their companies don’t reward them for doing so: “what gets measured and compensated is what gets done.” If these descriptions sound familiar to you, you may be headed for a stall of your own.
So what do the best leaders do to develop other leaders? Most of the time it just comes down to effort and willingness. When we ask executives to pause for a moment, reflect on the best leaders they have ever personally worked with or for, and then describe what made those leaders so effective, the responses are almost always the same: “They committed time to coaching me.” “They gave me a chance to stretch and grow.” “They took an active interest in my career.” (Try asking yourself this same question and see what you come up with.)
So how does an organization go about getting its executives to focus on developing leaders? Schlumberger, a state-of-the-art energy services company, offers a compelling example.
Almost 100 years old as a company, Schlumberger employs more than 100,000 employees, representing 150 different nationalities, operating in nearly 100 countries. The company recently set an ambitious goal: to transform into “the best-run company in the world""--no small ambition for a company of its size and complexity. At a seminal executive team meeting, Schlumberger’s 50 top executives debated an open question: What matters most in leading transformation? “We concluded that leadership is the thing that really makes the difference,” shared Dominique Malard, one of the executives chosen to spearhead the transformation effort. “But not all of us are natural leaders, and some of us are better than others. So, we asked, what makes leaders truly effective, and how can we create more of them?”
As leaders in a company whose workforce is made up almost entirely of highly trained engineers, Malard and his colleagues naturally broke the leadership question down into its component parts. First, they decided the differentiating factor could not merely be intellect. The company has a disciplined process for recruiting and hiring engineers, typically accepting only students with degrees from the best engineering universities in the world, and often with significant work experience as well.
Second, the difference could not be technical knowledge. Every engineer, already one of the best in his or her field, graduates from Schlumberger’s own intense training program. “So the second type of intelligence, technical and functional knowledge, is pretty consistent,” asserted Malard. In other words, it was not technical education that would set Schlumberger leaders apart.
And what did that leave? “The message was, as a leader, if you have high IQ and a high level of education, and if you want to be successful in leading and deploying change, what would set you apart would be your interpersonal effectiveness, including your level of emotional intelligence and what we always called ‘soft skills,’” concluded Malard. And that’s what he conveyed to his peers: To succeed in its transformation, Schlumberger’s 13,000 leaders around the world would need to develop a new level of sophistication as leaders.
Thus Schlumberger, in its quest to become preeminent, kicked off the deployment of its transformation not just by focusing on technology and management systems, but by cultivating a different approach to leadership. Different skills, mindsets, and capabilities.
In a session around the whiteboard, Malard and his team found themselves using different colored markers to describe various dimensions of the transformation deployment. In red, they listed technical innovations: improvements such as systematizing the use of bar codes and GPS location technology for more effective inventory management. In blue, they itemized project management or systems components, including how to define, measure, and monitor progress in implementing those red changes. And in green, they listed the different capabilities and approaches required to take their managers’ game to the next level in leading change across a vast and complicated matrix organization.
Everyone on the leadership team quickly came to realize that “the green stuff”—the sophisticated capability to “align, engage and empower” the workforce—was what would enable their ambitious transformation effort to take hold around the globe. “We have an army dedicated to creating and implementing the red stuff, and we manage projects effectively with the blue stuff,” Malard explained. “But unless we get engagement and buy-in, it’s going to be ‘push’ and not ‘pull.’ We know that the more you push, the more people resist, so to overcome resistance we had to go into an extensive campaign of the green stuff.”
Although the company’s leaders were intent on accomplishing the red stuff—that is, mechanical changes in a complex enterprise—they knew the muscle-building to do so would require more green. Instilling greater self-awareness in leaders. Teaching them how to engage and manage large and diverse groups of stakeholders, often across remote locations. Improving leaders’ capabilities in fostering dialogue and managing conflict and “difficult conversations” more effectively. Deepening understanding of how people respond to change, and how to coax and coach them through resistance to become evangelists. Getting better at communicating in ways that link execution to purpose.
The point was not that red or blue or green was more important, it was that mastering all three was required for success. For a company built on and proud of its engineering capabilities, this foregrounding of “soft” leadership skills was a novel, even foreign, idea. Malard, who had started as a field engineer and risen to president of one of the business units, admitted, “my role in the transformation effort also completely transformed how I thought about myself as a leader.”
“Thinking differently about how to lead and get results really changed how I approach situations and how I deal with people,” Malard said. He admitted that in the past he had been “a very directive” leader. Now he likes to cite a quotation often attributed to Gandhi: “I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people.”
In addition to serving as a case study for large scale organizational change, this Schlumberger story also highlights what to expect if you commit to becoming a lifelong student of “the green stuff.” You can become a leader who confronts and overcomes the subtle, sophisticated, and deeply embedded challenges that cause most leaders to stall. You will come across to others as having the judgment, character, and presence of a leader of leaders. You will face each inflection point in your leadership journey as an opportunity to transform yourself , not just the people, processes, and systems around you."
Why Your Team Needs Extreme Accountability,www.forbes.com,Mark Nevins,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hillennevins/2018/12/18/why-your-team-needs-extreme-accountability/,"(This article was coauthored with John Hillen .) It is a fashion of our times to label things “extreme.” Extreme sports. Extreme home make-overs. There’s even an Extreme Pizza chain with restaurants in a dozen different states.
Derived from Latin, “extreme” means “the utmost” or “to the highest degree.” Frequent use of this adjective may reflect our hyperbolic social-media culture—or maybe just the fact that the word is fun to say. “Extreme Whatever” is mere hype most of the time (what exactly would an “extreme pizza” taste like?), but a recent book titled Extreme Ownership is worth your time if you want to re-think your approach to getting business results. However, there is a complement to “extreme ownership” that may be neglected—a twin sibling that should be just as important to leaders who care about their goals and their relationships with those who will help achieve them. And that complement is “extreme accountability.”
Extreme Ownership
The authors of Extreme Ownership , Jocko Willink and Leif Babin, are former Navy SEALs who reframed their elite military training and experience as pragmatic advice for how to be more effective in work and life. For military leaders, “extreme” is serious—dead serious, and literally so. Military leaders train to deal with matters that are life or death, and in many cases the only option other than success is unthinkable. Willink and Babin’s principles, framed around anecdotes from the battlefield, are unique to a particular environment—one that most business or other institutional leaders will never even be able to imagine.
That said, Willink and Babin usefully frame their insights on leadership for leaders and managers of civilian organizations. For example:
The leader is always responsible for “owning” the failures or problems of the team (hence the book’s title)—and leaders should never blame their teams for mistakes. Plans should be simple and action-oriented, and activities prioritized to ensure goals are achieved. Sharing information and communicating effectively are absolutely critical for success, and most failures are rooted in poor communication. All team members need to understand and believe in the “why” of the mission as well as the “what.” Extreme Ownership made a positive impression on us and the book offers a powerful reminder that any meaningful effort must be rooted in high degrees of individual responsibility. That said, there seemed to be something missing when we finished reading: something essential for growing and sustaining an effective and profitable organization over years. This missing piece revolves around applying the concept of ownership to the people one is leading.
Extreme Accountability
In talking recently with Fred Voccola, the CEO of Kaseya, a fast-growing IT infrastructure management software company, that missing piece came into sharp focus. Voccola, who has led several start-ups to successful growth and exits, regularly preaches to his company and senior team the idea of “extreme accountability,” which can be seen as a complement to extreme ownership.
From his background, you might think Voccola’s leadership ethos would be similar to Willink’s and Babin’s. While not an elite soldier, he was a college linebacker who played for Tom Coughlin at Boston College. But in Voccola’s sense, extreme accountability is not the same as extreme ownership: ownership is what I am personally committing to, while accountability is my commitment to my colleagues and my team.
Ownership is self -focused—it’s what I can do—where accountability is actually other -focused.
In talking about extreme accountability, Voccola shares that he developed the concept with his teams over the years. And every time he brings together a new executive team, he re-creates the idea and how to apply it with that team from scratch. “Accountability isn’t something you can force on people—they have to want it and accept it themselves. And if it isn’t a value for them, they and I usually conclude that our company may not be a good fit for them.”
Voccola recently told us more about his philosophy of extreme accountability: “The core is simple: results matter, period. And in any company facing the challenges of growing and sometimes just surviving, results are all that matter. It’s not about your ego and it’s not about your job description. As members of the senior team we are all accountable for the overall business outcomes, not just our individual functions. It’s not simply doing our jobs but finding ways to do them that will result in success for the enterprise and the people who are counting on us—our customers, our employees, and our owners.”
A few of the principles of extreme accountability that Voccola highlights include:
I am accountable to the final degree of whatever I sign up for. Not just “doing my job” but finding a way to be successful, whatever it takes. I will fight through any and all issues to get results. Regardless of politics; never assigning blame to others; never saying “that’s not my fault” or complaining how hard it is. I will find a way to get results, including by working with my teammates to do things differently. Roles and organizational boundaries aren’t what matter, especially in fast-growing companies. If we all share the same commitment to the goals, we’ll work together however we need to in order to achieve them. When everyone is committed to extreme accountability, then success is measured in terms of our results, not my results. Practicing Extreme Accountability
The way Voccola describes extreme accountability it is as much a mindset as a management process. “Finding a way” is the commitment and the core value. What makes an organization work best is when every individual’s personal drive is balanced by his or her deep commitment to others and to the outcomes: doing whatever it takes; not wanting to let colleagues down; and never forgetting that it’s not about you … except if you fail to commit and be accountable.
Voccola adds that one of the best ways to explain extreme accountability is by what it isn’t : “If I oversee Product Management and I say we couldn’t get the results we promised because I don’t own Development, and Development was slow to build it so we missed the date—that’s a good illustration of a lack of extreme accountability. As head of Product I own the product and the date, so I have to find a way to get it done with Dev and make the date. Similarly, Sales may claim ‘the customer said they have to wait until next year, so I can’t get the deal or make my number.’ Well, in that case Sales has to find a way to get that deal, or another way to make their number, if they are going to be extremely accountable.”
Extreme accountability is a virtue for every high-performer, but it may be most critical for start-ups and early-stage companies where literally every quarter can mean the difference between success and survival.
Successful organizations of any kind depend on the symbiotic and mutually supportive relationship between ownership and accountability. Sometimes the most difficult thing about putting in place a strategic plan for your organization is not creating the strategic plan itself—it’s executing that plan, following through, and ensuring that every member of your team delivers, regardless of seen or unforeseen obstacles. If the leader puts together the right incentives and objectives, and the team is truly committed to success (“success is the only option”), then the collective outcome by definition will be success. That’s extreme accountability.
Here are some questions you can ask to assess whether your team is practicing extreme accountability:
Are all team members 100% completely and unequivocally committed to the principle that success is all that matters? Without exception? Are team members willing to have the crucial conversations to hold their peers accountable —in an unemotional, factual, and results-focused way if they fail to deliver or if they let the team down? Is it clear to everyone what a successful outcome looks like? Has the definition of success been communicated to all? Are there high degrees of commitment—including a “no excuses” mentality? Do your people accept that “it wasn’t in my control” is not an acceptable answer? Has the team come together around a powerful purpose: one they are all truly dedicated to above their own personal goals? Finally, it’s essential to note how concepts of extreme ownership and extreme accountability mirror the principles of servant leadership. They are not only applicable in the locker room or combat zones. These concepts apply to any setting where there is a shared goal and a group of people depending on each other to achieve it. In the words of Max Depree, author of the timeless book Leadership is an Art , “The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between, the leader is a servant.” That’s another way of saying extreme accountability: it’s not about you, it’s about the results and your commitment to achieving them because others are depending on you."
The Not So Secret Reason The Wealthiest Pay The Most In Income Taxes,www.forbes.com,Erik Sherman,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2019/05/26/the-not-so-secret-reason-the-wealthiest-pay-the-most-in-income-taxes/,"Last October, Bloomberg reported that the top half of taxpayers pay 97% of all federal income tax. And the top 1% pay 37.3% of the total. That may seem unfair. I've seen people, recently in a social media discussion the other day, bring that point up to rebut any criticism of wealth inequality. So, what if the wealthy have more? They do more to support the country. They pay most of the taxes. That should be enough.
In the discussion the other day, the context was wealth and how the rich are getting richer , as MarketWatch reported. The richest tenth of households hold 70% of the wealth in the country as of 2018. In 1989, it was 60%. The share of the top 1% shifted from 23% to 32%.
The figures come from a new Federal Reserve report that examines income and wealth.
On the wealth side, rich people got more, particularly through the big economic collapse just over a decade ago when the Federal Reserve dropped interest rates, which put cheap money into the hands of the wealthy who used it to make more wealth. Those in lower economic groups most of their wealthy in the value of their homes, which dropped like rocks.
But the new Fed report also discusses income. A quarter of all households brought in less than $25,000; 37% made less than $40,000 and 38% made more than $75,000. If you go through Figure 2 under family income distribution, 45% of households made less than $50,000 a year. Another 15% make between $50,000 and $74,999. For anyone who's been relatively comfortable, this isn't a lot of money.
The bottom half of households face major challenges. They don't make much. Forty percent couldn't cover an unexpected $400 expense with cash. There's too little money spread over too many people. Of course they aren't paying a lot in income taxes because they don't make enough.
That's the utter insanity of only pointing to tax payments. It's another example of shifting discussions away from a major problem faced by so many millions and, instead, trying to make it look as if they somehow get a good deal and to turn the wealthy into victims. And none of that is true."
CEOs Taking A Stand: Moral Imperative Or Cynical Marketing?,www.forbes.com,Mark Nevins,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hillennevins/2018/11/08/the-culture-wars-fools-rush-in-should-ceos/,"(This article was coauthored with John Hillen .) It sometimes seems like everything these days is political. During this week, election week, perhaps it should be. But in a deeply divided (and pretty evenly by the looks of it) country, how smart it is for corporate leaders to wade into the political morass or the cultural wars that accompany politics?
Over the past few years, there have been increasing calls for CEOs and other corporate leaders to take public positions on hot-button political and social issues of the day. The argument in favor of activism is two-fold. First, that executives lead not just companies, but rather “social enterprises” that demand a degree of activism on cultural and political fronts. Second, a CEO’s high-profile status provides that leader with a “platform” that should be used to speak out on social, cultural, and political controversies. The leader herself, the thinking goes, is somehow obligated by her position to “take a stand” for the whole company on issues such as climate change, immigration, guns, identity politics, foreign policy, abortion, and so on.
Politically vocal companies or CEO’s may be well-meaning, but in many cases their speaking up and taking a stand seems less like a moral imperative and more like trendy virtue signaling. Or, more cynically, marketing on the back of a heated controversy.
We do not agree with the famous remark by economist Milton Friedman that the only social responsibility of a business is to increase its profits. Firms don’t just make money – they are also guided by values and should think of themselves as microcosms of society and as powerful movers in helping to create a good society. And their leaders need to think constantly about the “good society” they are creating inside their own organizations; how they help shape those values and what “good” means to employees, customers, immediate community, and other stakeholders.
Even so, we are leery of the call for corporate executives to get political in this divisive climate. Being a leader of a company or other enterprise does not automatically confer on one either the wisdom or the privilege to make decisions or speak out on complex cultural or political issues – especially if only peripherally related to the company’s business. No corporate leader would think of making a quick financial decision without expertise, background, training, research, modeling, or counsel. And yet many senior executives seem increasingly pressured these days – especially by their younger or most politically active employees – to do just that on controversial social, political, and public policy issues.
Sometimes because of role, personality, circumstance, institutional position, or community corporate leaders must get involved in political or cultural issues that are deeply interwoven into their strategy, constituencies, or business model. But that is and should be rare. We counsel caution for everyone else and offer a few thoughts for leaders to think through before they jump with their organization into the culture wars or political activism:
Is it good business?
Pragmatically, we wonder about the wisdom of a company leader taking positions that could alienate some or much of their customer base or other stakeholders. It is an apocryphal story that a politically-hesitant Michael Jordan observed “Republicans buy sneakers too,” but the sentiment is understandable.
The United States (and much of the rest of the world) is clearly in the midst of a culture war—perhaps the most intensive in living memory and fueled by social media and other social phenomena. Nearly every point or topic these days seems divisive and everything is politicized—from business to sports to clothing. What are the benefits of politicizing your business?
Are you and your advisers seeing this objectively?
Sometimes it is hard to see that not everyone thinks the way we do. As leaders, we tend to spend our days with people who are more or less like us. Likewise, our country has, for the most part, been split into geographic, demographic, and economic pockets of homogeneity where we applaud each other for holding similar opinions on what are often very divisive issues—issues about which other good and logical people can feel differently for good reasons. Leaders need to beware of operating in a vacuum and assuming the moral certainty of same-thinking environments. It is easy for leaders who don’t stay open to multiple perspectives to fall into thinking that there is only one way to understand problems. Or that the other side – that entire other half of the country – is just “wrong.”
Is this the only or best way you can show your stakeholders that you have values?
Some CEO’s and corporate activists say that despite the market risk of alienating up to half their stakeholders, their leadership stature still demands that they express their corporate values on controversial social or political issues. “To be silent would be cowardly – the opposite of leading! We are values driven here at Company X.”
But political activism or wading into the cultural war is neither the only nor best way your company can demonstrate its values. Many have heard the expression that “the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.” This admirable statement of moral courage is often the rationale for those who promote corporate activism and visible CEO leadership on controversial political and cultural issues. We can’t just stand by while this happens! But it is a false argument that if a company or company leader does not act in in the political and social arena then that same enterprise is somehow less moral, values-driven, socially-connected, or even engaged.
Corporate values are fundamental – and companies should live them in their firm . But translating a corporate value of, say, “inclusiveness,” for one’s company into a specific political position on immigration policy, climate change, or foreign interventions can be a stretch – and perhaps not one on which even most corporate stakeholders would agree.
Is your corporation the place through which to express yours or your employee’s politics?
There is a reason (many actually) why in a participatory democracy we do not have corporations vote once and in only one way on behalf of all their employees. That could never possibly be fair or representative. Corporatism has never been a one-employee/one-vote structure. ""Voting"" on behalf of your employees imposes your corporate politics on theirs.
Political democracy however, is one-citizen/one-vote. And in that system citizens and their elected representatives are the mechanism through which we choose to address intensely complex issues of policy. Citizens can further participate in politics, policy, and society through a myriad of private and volunteer organizations. Perhaps it is fairest and most effective to leave politics to the political arena and not your corporate one.
Are you equipped to be a thoughtful political leader?
Besides the arguments as to the suitability of the institution for political/cultural activism, we also need to think about the suitability of the leader. What makes anyone think that an executive at a clothing manufacturer, coffee retailer, or tech company has some special expertise or a qualified voice on matters of public policy that could somehow add to our system of political representation? If they do, they can express it in many ways and in many forums rather than by use of their corporate “platform.”
Those of us entering or well into middle age will note that younger employees often seem to demand that their leaders and employers be active in the culture wars. To this we also urge caution. Companies don’t let their newest and most passionate employees run the firm—why should they let those same employees determine what political stances the company should or shouldn’t take? Leaders lead and are trained for that job. They have accountability or responsibility for wisdom, judgement, and results. Leaders should be careful not to let admirably passionate young employees, advertising agencies, or advocacy groups separate them from their responsibilities to all stakeholders.
There are very few CEOs who were chosen for their jobs based on their background and competence in public policy or social-issue leadership. CEOs are not public servants and their firms are not political polities. Instead, corporate leaders are chosen based on their abilities to deliver value to customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders by enabling the firm to thrive in its mission and core purpose. Making good and responsible values-based judgments on the issues confronting their company is challenging enough. We’ve seen of late how uncomfortable politics can get for leaders of firms like Google and Facebook. Managing affairs inside a firm is hard enough without also trying to be a political player on the national stage.
Do we need more political actors?
Leaders should work hard to develop their wisdom and judgement on issues much broader than their balance sheet—we devote an entire chapter of our recent book to an argument that effective executives must broaden their sources of authority. We have found that leaders who work to equip themselves to deal with legitimately competing values tend to be thoughtful and careful about dismissing the “other side” out of hand. They think and act carefully on whether or why their firm should have a singular political position on a public policy issue that may animate water cooler talk, but is peripheral to their business and stakeholders.
In these highly political and culturally divisive times, where civil dialogue has in many cases been replaced by polarization and name-calling, we caution leaders and corporations to consider whether they have the right, the processes, the background, the standing, or the authority to dive into controversial issues in a way that would benefit all their stakeholders."

Moxley's arrival happened at the end of the DON main event that saw Chris Jericho defeat Kenny Omega in an epic match. It wasn't the best match of the night (you can check out my results and grades piece for more information on that), but it was strong nonetheless. Obviously, Moxley's appearance and his brutal impact made it all the more entertaining.
Jericho executed his new finisher, the Judas Effect on Omega to secure the clean pinfall. Afterward, he took the mic and launched his typical stellar in-ring promo. He taunted the fans and credited himself for AEW's early buzz–which included a sell-out crowd at the MGM Grand, the TV deal with Turner and more.
Moxley would interrupt Jericho's mic work. He made his way through the crowd (much like he used to do in the WWE as a member of The Shield). He was wearing a vest with the word ""MOX"" on the back, and his persona was slightly different than what we've become used to over the past five years.
It was a change for the better, and his brutality during the short but impacting scene was fitting. He looked like a man who had broken away from the chains of an organization that had stifled his creative energy, and the release seemed pretty gratifying.
Moxley's arrival and involvement with AEW is the latest win for the upstart professional wrestling organization. Double or Nothing was a strong beginning. It got off to a relatively slow start, but unlike some WWE pay-per-views, it didn't peak at an odd time, and it didn't force the viewer to endure ebbs and flows throughout the event.
Once Moxley put Jericho down with Dirty Deeds, he wasn't done. He also took out the referee and Omega. The scrap with Omega went up the ramp and resulted in Moxley hitting the Dirty Deeds on top of a stack of giant poker chips. To finish the evening, Moxley launched Omega from atop the stacked poker chips down to an unknown flat surface. The final shot as the event faded out was of Moxley standing triumphant on the poker chips.

Because Moxley attacked Jericho and Omega, expect the former to be involved in the biggest feud in the organization, and perhaps in the title picture for the newly revealed AEW World title. Clearly, he has landed in a spot that is giving him more room to shine as a performer."
"3 Rat Lungworm Cases in Hawaii, What You Need To Know",www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/05/26/3-rat-lungworm-cases-in-hawaii-what-you-need-to-know/,"It's not just a rat disease. It's not just a worm disease. It's rat lungworm disease, and according to the Hawaii Department of Health , this is the disease that three separate people got when they visited Hawaii island not too long ago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) only recently confirmed that these were indeed rat lungworm disease cases. Such confirmation was necessary because, after all, it's not every day that someone gets rat lungworm disease. It's also not something to take lightly. You don't typically use it as an excuse to call in sick, ""oh, yes, couldn't make it to work today because of a bout of rat lungworm disease,"" or to back out of a date, ""sorry, you are so great but it's not you. It's just my rat lungworm disease acting up.""
No, rat lungworm disease can only occur after you eat rat lungworm larvae, which fortunately doesn't seem to be a common occurrence. R at lungworm larvae is not something that you would ever want to deliberately eat. It is not like avocado toast. If someone asks you if you would like rat lungworm otherwise known as Angiostrongylus cantonensis with your toast, say no. The same goes for live snails or live slugs.
Here's why. Snails, slugs, and, you guessed it, rats take turns hosting rat lungworms. A rat can acquire the larvae by eating a snail or slug infected with the larvae. The larvae then migrate to the rat's lung (hence the name rat lungworm), where they can lay eggs, specifically in the arteries that supply the rat's lungs with blood. After the eggs hatch, the resulting larvae then migrate up through the rat's lungs and airways up to the rat's throat. The rat then essentially coughs up these larvae and swallows them. Let that image percolate in your head for a bit. The larvae subsequently travel through the rat's gastrointestinal tract and exit the rat through the rat's poop.
So, rat poop, there it is. Ready for snails or slugs to munch on or rub against, because that's what snails and slugs do. The A. cantonensis larvae in the rat poop can enter the snail or slug either through their mouths or by penetrating their skin. After the larvae grow for a while in the snail or slug, a rat may then come along and see lunch. Thus, continues the circle of life for the rat lungworm. The first part of this CDC video shows this circle:
Wondering how humans can get in on this wonderful circle? Well, that can be accomplished by eating an infected raw snail or slug, something that has eaten an infected snail or slug (e.g., shellfish), or something touched by an infected snail or slug. Eating a live slug on a dare is what one of the adult visitors to East Hawaii did in December 2018. This slug apparently had the rat lungworm larvae in it. As a result, the adult grew ill in late December, becoming one of the 10 cases of angiostrongyliasis, the other name for rat lungworm disease, in Hawaii in 2018.
The other two of the three visitors became angiostrongyliasis cases during the first two months of 2019. Neither had eaten slugs on dares but instead ate fruits and vegetables that may have been contaminated by either snails or slugs.
Once the rat lungworm larvae make it into your gastrointestinal tract, various things could happen. You could end up having no symptoms and no real problems. The larvae could end up penetrating your intestinal walls and traveling to your central nervous system and your brain. There, they could potentially cause trouble.
One possibility is a rare type of meningitis (eosinophillic meningitis), which is when the membranes surrounding your brain get inflamed. Possible symptoms include severe nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, and headaches as well as abnormal sensations in your arms and legs. Such symptoms typically take one to three weeks (potentially up to six weeks) to appear and last from two to eight weeks.
Fortunately, your body doesn't tend to make a great home for this parasite, because you aren't a rat, at least in the biologic sense. Therefore, the infection and symptoms frequently resolve without any treatment.
However, this isn't always the case. In rare cases, the infection can result in permanent brain damage, especially if the brain itself gets inflamed, and even death. This is what happened to an Australian teenager, who also ate a slug on a dare, subsequently developed angiostrongyliasis, became paralyzed, and after a long eight-year struggle eventually tragically died, as described by Eli Meixler in Time .
Therefore, even though angiostrongyliasis is not very common, take proper precautions to prevent such an infection. T he Hawaii Department of Health recently tweeted the following warning to wash fruits and vegetables before eating them:
We received notification from @CDCgov that its laboratory confirmed three unrelated cases of angiostrongyliasis, or rat lungworm disease, in visitors to Hawaii Island. Learn more about the cases and how to protect yourself at https://t.co/kOqqhOFyHa pic.twitter.com/0bBfH5TYus
— HI Dept. of Health (@HIgov_Health) May 23, 2019
You also want to keep snails or slugs far away from your food and thoroughly cook shellfish or anything that may have eaten snails or slugs. Make sure that you thoroughly cook snails as well, before you eat them. If someone dares you to eat a live or raw slug or snail, don't. Just don't. You aren't Marty McFly from Back to the Future. You can walk away from a dare."

AEW Double or Nothing went out with a bang as Jon Moxley, who was inexplicably given a hero's sendoff on WWE programming, debuted and came off like a huge star. Moxley's expected arrival in AEW makes WWE's farewell tour of the former Shield member all the more head-scratching.
This is a great start by Ambrose, but his WWE career was defined by great starts/returns with enviable opportunities that were eventually squandered. Ambrose will now have to prove that he is every bit the main eventer WWE tried—and eventually failed—to make him.

Used as the embodiment of WWE's problems during interviews with The Elite and in tired side-by-side memes on Twitter , many zeroed in on WWE's latest creation and juxtaposed it against AEW's oversized semi-masterpiece of a belt. As AEW continues to emphasize the importance of championship belts, the whimsicality of the WWE 24/7 Championship will put the company in danger of seeming cartoonish in comparison.
Winner: The Rhodes Family

Cody and Dustin Rhodes had one of the more memorable and emotionally manipulative matches in pro wrestling history. This instant classic was cause for celebration for so many reasons. Cody's first match with his DIY wrestling promotion. The long-awaited Rhodes vs. Rhodes showdown. The ""Dusty"" chants. And while the excess amount of blood could have easily turned fans away from this match, the intense dedication from a hot Las Vegas crowd paid off as they were rewarded with a one-of-a-kind match and an incredible epilogue that saw the two brothers embrace after agreeing to join forces.
Winner: WWE
— Over The Top Sports (@OverTheTopSport) May 26, 2019
WWE was the pink elephant in the room the entire night, and AEW didn't even try to ignore it. From Cody's smashing of Triple H's ""throne"" to Dean Ambrose closing the show, this show felt like a stark reminder that WWE is the biggest game in town and AEW knows it. Of course, AEW plans on changing the pro wrestling landscape, but as long as it feeds into the perception that there is a war with WWE, both companies will benefit. It goes without saying, but WWE should feel inspired to step its game up following a grand-slam pay-per-view from its biggest competition.
Loser: Kenny Omega Kenny Omega suffered a surprising loss to Chris Jericho at AEW Double or Nothing. Credit: WWE.com
AEW's Executive Vice Presidents went 4-0 at Double or Nothing with the Exception of Kenny Omega. In fact, not only did Omega take a surprising loss to Chris Jericho, he suffered a beatdown to the debuting Jon Moxley. Perhaps this was somewhat of a message to the AEW locker room that the Executive Wrestlers will not be running roughshod over this company, and they'll be more than willing to put other performers over. But to sacrifice AEW's biggest star to send such a message seems questionable.

Huawei Price Shock: Value Of Flagship $1150 P30 Pro Comes Crashing Down To $130,www.forbes.com,Zak Doffman,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/05/26/huawei-price-shock-value-of-flagship-1150-p30-pro-comes-crashing-down-to-130/,""" With great design and color options,"" gushed one reviewer last month, "" immense battery life and plenty of power, the P30 Pro isn't just a photography phone, it's arguably the best flagship phone we'll see in 2019."" And it's priced accordingly, at around £900 ($1150) in the U.K., the same price as a Samsung S10+ with equivalent storage. The smartphone market has a vibrant trade-in and resale market, it drives upgrades and growth. In an ideal world, Samsung, Apple and Huawei would like consumers to upgrade annually, trading in last year's devices as they do so. And so the new smartphone market is sustained by its pre-owned resale market. It's the same with cars - if the pre-owned market hits the buffers, it hits new car sales.
On one of the U.K.'s most popular smartphone trade-in sites , that same Samsung S10+, in good condition, can be traded in for £510 ($650). That's a steep reduction from the retail price, representing a loss of some 45%, but it's relatively healthy all the same. On the same site, the Huawei P30 Pro, also in good condition, will now return just £100 ($130) to an owner wanting to sell it on. It has lost almost 90% of its value.
Music Magpie
Music Magpie The P30 Pro was launched at the end of Q1, a quarter for which IDC reported that ""t he only highlight from a vendor perspective was Huawei, which made a strong statement by growing volume and share despite market headwinds... Huawei moved its way into a clear number two spot as the only smartphone vendor at the top of the market... Impressively, the company had year-over-year growth of 50%... Huawei is now within striking distance of Samsung at the top of the global market.""
Now, in light of the U.S. sanction-driven suspension of Huawei's business with Google and ARM and others, much has been written this week about software and security upgrades for existing devices, about alternative future Huawei operating systems and app stores, and about the remaining runway on ARM chip designs and SD-card and WiFi licenses. Some analysts have suggested that this gives Huawei time to regroup, to plan, to think. But it doesn't work that way. Not in a fickle consumer market driven by brand sentiment and advertising.
And this is the short-term issue facing Huawei's consumer business.

Huawei's prior P20 smartphones fare even worse. "" Just a few months ago,"" the U.K.'s Express newspaper reported , ""you could have traded in your P20 Pro and received around £280... Trade-in prices for the P20 Pro are now as low as £50,"" adding that, ""Samsung's 2018 flagship is still worth around £235 which is considerably more than the newer phone from Huawei.""
And this is a global issue, even extending to Huawei's home turf in Asia. ""The market for used Huawei smartphones has taken a major hit,"" reported the Straits Times from Singapore. ""While a majority of mobile phone shops here said they are still buying used Huawei handsets, they are offering steeply lower prices for them. Some shops have stopped buying used Huawei products altogether. Customers, too, are staying away, with sales of used Huawei smartphones dropping sharply.""
According to the newspaper, o ne reseller ""has fielded inquiries from four or five sellers despite offering just $100 to buy the Huawei P30 Pro. The recommended retail price for the Huawei P30 Pro is $1,398.""
There are multiple trade-in sites with varied prices being offered, albeit all those I reviewed in preparing this article were showing sharply reduced trade-in offers - GiffGaff also offered £100 ($130), FoneWizard up to £150 ($190). Some, including leading site Mazuma, had no offers at all. There are of course peer-to-peer sales sites which will likely hold up pricing for longer. Much has happened in the last few days, and we will get a better view of pricing impacts over the next few weeks as the news settles. We will also see what impact the reduction in trade-in values and perceived future software risk might have on new phone prices.
Mazuma Last week, a spokesperson for the trade-in site WeBuyTek told Bloomberg that they had seen a 540% weekly increase in the trade-in of Huawei devices, the ""biggest spike"" the company has seen. The spokesperson said this had resulted in them ""temporarily stopping accepting any new trade-ins as we expect the value of these devices to plummet.""
Bloomberg also reported that ""c licks on Huawei devices declined 46%"" from the previous week, according to PriceSpy, while clicks on rivals including Samsung were up, as were the number of people ""assessing the value of their Huawei handsets.""
A Huawei spokesperson told me a week ago that the company ""will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those have been sold or still in stock globally. We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally,"" adding later that ""we are confident this regrettable situation can be resolved and our priority remains to continue to deliver world-class technology and products to our customers around the world.""

On Saturday I reported that Beijing has published a cybersecurity public consultation that has aired new regulation that could be used to restrict U.S. technology companies from selling into China. The consultation runs for a month. Huawei is too important to China for China to let it fail, and a run on the company's smartphone business would undo years of work and billions in investment. For Huawei, the clock is now ticking. They cannot afford for this to run and run."

Q: What did you like about Google+ specifically more than other platforms?
A: The impetus behind our pushing so hard towards Google+ had nothing to do with our liking their platform and everything to do with the ancillary benefits in organic search.
It was reasonably clear from the beginning that Google+ was a ghost town for consumers in our sector, so in our heart of hearts, we knew there wasn't going to be any inherent value in it as a direct driver of traffic or revenue. My disdain for Google+ was the highest because it felt like Google was ransoming rankings to try to attract users to their platform.
Q: What are you using now that Google+ has shut down?
A: Nothing. We're mostly reliant upon Facebook for our social media presence, but I wouldn't say that Facebook replaced Google+ for us. Their demise has opened up more time to do work that can measurably affect our business instead of ticking a box to show Google's crawlers that we're playing the game.

"Insight: As Ferrari Reveals The Hybrid Supercar, Design Director Flavio Manzoni Discusses Creativity",www.forbes.com,Nargess Banks,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nargessbanks/2019/05/26/ferrari-design-favio-manzoni/,"Ferrari will announce its first hybrid supercar on 31 May. The maker of history’s most exotic catalogue of sports cars, has had some experience in this area with the 2013 LaFerrari. Yet, whilst this is a limited-edition product, the new car will be the first series production Ferrari to drive on low emissions and with outstanding performance. Ferrari hasn’t revealed official performance figures, yet experts are predicting almost a thousand horsepower with the new GT. “I promise it will be really unique,” says the design director Flavio Manzoni when I meet with him before the big reveal. “Ferrari has always pushed the limits of automotive design and represented the pinnacle of vehicle technology. We have a constant quest to reach the ultimate step and this will never stop. Which means every new car must surpass our own expectations and you will see this with the new hybrid car.”
Ferrari's LaFerrari, or project F150, is a limited production hybrid sports car
Ferrari Ferrari’s identity is pivoted on making exotic motor cars, with the promise of driving pleasure. So, I ask the design director how it can maintain its distinctive values in the post-combustion age. Manzoni is candid, hesitating before admitting it isn’t easily. “For me Ferrari is a symbiosis of man and machine and hedonistic pleasure. If life is about the experience, then Ferrari offers an exceptional quality of life. But then, when we talk about Ferrari, we always consider three fundamental components - technological innovation, the pleasure of driving and beauty. So, the aspect of innovation is fundamental to Ferrari design.” Manzoni is quick to note that there will not be room for an autonomous Ferrari in the foreseeable future. “Autonomous driving is about mobility, which is not something connected with Ferrari. If we lose the pleasure of driving, the relation between human and machine, then there is no Ferrari.”
Centro Stile is the newly-opened design studio based at the home of Ferrari, Maranello
Ferrari For now, his team are focused on creating a new generation of Ferrari cars, including four new supercars this year, at Centro Stile, the newly opened design studio based at the home of Ferrari, Maranello. It is an impressive building, a collaborative venture which saw Manzoni, who trained as an architect in Florence, work alongside London-based architect Davide Padoa of Design International. The sculptural structure offers complex surfaces, with a double-skin façade of triangular glass and gilded aluminum. Centro Stile sits in the same compound as a handful of architectural gems including buildings by renowned architects Jean Nouvel, Massimiliano Fuksas and Renzo Piano’s dramatic wind tunnel. So, it needed to stand out. “Our objective was to create a ‘wow’ effect – a surprise when you walk in from the old Ferrari entrance to the Maranello site,” Manzoni tells me. The surfaces evoke Ferrari design with their concave and convex shapes and in the interplay of light and shadow. The second skin, he admits, looks great but is also functional for maintaining the privacy of what is being created inside Centre Stile.
Flavio Manzoni has been design director at Ferrari since 2000
Ferrari The design studio was at the top of Manzoni’s agenda when he arrived at Ferrari nine years ago. He feels an internal creative team housed close to the main Ferrari facilities is essential for design moving forward. “It is a new way of working for us,” he admits. In the past, Ferrari collaborated with Italian coachbuilder such as Pininfarina and Zagato. Now, the company is realizing the importance of daily interactions between design and engineering. “The studio allows us to inspire the creative team and the engineers with our visions. It also helps us to discuss our ideas with management at the start of each project, and to find solutions that answer our imagination.”
Centro Stile houses around a hundred vehicle designers, digital surface modelers, color and trim specialists. “We use real sculptors here to give a human touch to surfaces because for Ferrari technology is not the final objective,” says Manzoni. For him form follows function “but with an artistic appeal and the imagination to create an organic shape that connects with its function”. Ferrari’s are about evoking timeless design.
The Ferrari portfolio has evolved in recent years to include extreme hypercars but also vehicles created for everyday use - models like the latest Portofino. Manzoni says even as the family expands, his work as director of design is to ensure the two road-car families, the sports and GT series, maintain their distinctive identities. “The sports cars are technically driven so performance is pushed to such a high level that the design needs to incorporate a great many technical solutions to reach the goal,” he explains. Whilst the GTs are more design focused, “elegant and refined”, he notes.
The Ferrari Portofino, designed to be more of an everyday car, exists Maranello
Ferrari Each floor at Centro Stile houses one element of design including customization – “Tailor Made”. Here clients can specify the color scheme, materials and every little detail to make their Ferrari unique. The division opened in 2011, yet this is the first time customers work on their design in a bespoke studio alongside specialist. Personalization, says Manzoni, is increasingly important for Ferrari. He says working directly with customers challenges the team; it gives him the opportunity to create unique identities, work with new materials and shapes. “Our customers are passionate about Ferrari and can make the experience very interesting for us.”"
Snapchat's 'Self-Destructing Messages' Have Created A 'Haven For Child Abuse',www.forbes.com,Zak Doffman,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/05/26/snapchats-self-destructing-messages-have-created-a-haven-for-child-abuse/,"Not a good week for Snapchat. On Thursday, Motherboard reported that ""s everal departments inside social media giant Snap have dedicated tools for accessing user data, and multiple employees have abused their privileged access to spy on Snapchat users."" And now the Sunday Times has published an investigation into allegations that predators are ""flocking"" to the social media platform, which has become a ""haven for child abuse."" Motherboard's article cited two former employees who claimed that "" multiple Snap employees abused their access to Snapchat user data several years ago."" This included the use of "" internal tools that allowed Snap employees to access user data, including in some cases location information, their own saved Snaps and personal information such as phone numbers and email addresses.""
SnapLion, one of the tools referenced in the Motherboard article, was designed to gather information for "" valid law enforcement requests. Claims that this tool was involved in the alleged misuse have not been verified.
A Snap spokesperson told me that ""a ny perception that employees might be spying on our community is highly troubling and wholly inaccurate. Protecting privacy is paramount at Snap. We keep very little user data, and we have robust policies and controls to limit internal access to the data we do have, including data within tools designed to support law enforcement. Unauthorized access of any kind is a clear violation of the company's standards of business conduct and, if detected, results in immediate termination.""
Ironically, it is this limited user data that is central to the Sunday Times investigation. The newspaper's investigation has uncovered ""thousands of reported cases that have involved Snapchat since 2014,"" including ""pedophiles using the app to elicit indecent images from children and to groom teenagers,"" as well as ""under-18s spreading child pornography themselves."" This has now resulted in U.K. police "" investigating three cases of child exploitation a day linked to the app, [with] messages that self-destruct allowing groomers to avoid detection.""
The Sunday Times Quote: s Adam Scott Wandt from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York calling Snapchat a ""haven” for abusers, arguing that the ""self-destruct"" nature of Snapchat's messages ""makes it difficult for the police to collect evidence.""
Wandt claims that in this way ""Snapchat has distinguished itself as the platform where abuse of children happens... The problem was that adults realized you could do a simple Google search and find out that most Snapchat messages are unrecoverable after 24 hours, even by law enforcement with a warrant.""
The U.K. children's charity, the NSPCC, rates Snapchat as a high risk, with a spokesperson for the charity explaining that predators intent on grooming children ""cast the net wide in the expectation that a small number of children will respond.""
The charity has also warned on self-generated images taken and shared by children themselves. ""As soon as that image is shared or screenshotted, the child loses control over it... those images may start on a site like Snapchat, but they could very easily end up circulating among technologically sophisticated offenders, making their way onto the dark web.""
Snap told me that ""w e care deeply about protecting our community and are sickened by any behavior which involves the abuse of a minor. We work hard to detect, prevent and stop abuse on our platform and encourage everyone - young people, parents and caregivers - to have open conversations about what they’re doing online. We will continue to proactively work with governments, law enforcement and other safety organizations to ensure that Snapchat continues to be a positive and safe environment.""
A similar investigation in March focused on Instagram, with the NSPCC claiming that Facebook's photo-sharing app has become the leading platform for child grooming in the country. During an 18-month period to September last year, there were more than 5,000 recorded crimes "" of sexual communication with a child,"" and "" a 200% rise in recorded instances in the use of Instagram to target and abuse children."" The charity's CEO described the figures as ""overwhelming evidence that keeping children safe cannot be left to social networks. We cannot wait for the next tragedy before tech companies are made to act.""
This latest investigation makes the same point and comes a little over a month after the U.K. Government published proposals for ""tough new measures to ensure the U.K. is the safest place in the world to be online,"" claiming these to be the world's ""first online safety laws."" The proposals include an independent regulator with the "" powers to take effective enforcement action against companies that have breached their statutory duty of care."" Such enforcement will include ""substantial fines"" as well as, potentially, the powers ""to disrupt the business activities of a non-compliant company... to impose liability on individual members of senior management... and to block non-compliant services.""
The regulation of social media has been in and out of the headlines for most of this year. The prevalence of social media use by under-age children, and the risky interactions those children expose themselves to, has been one of the most disturbing aspects disclosed thus far. Regulation is coming. But the open question is how do the platforms prevent users from deliberately circumventing their security controls with little understanding of the risks they might then face."
The turning electric tide: Chevron announces that some California gas stations will get EV chargers,www.forbes.com,Bill Roberson,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billroberson/2019/05/26/the-turning-electric-tide-chevron-announces-that-some-california-gas-stations-will-get-ev-chargers/,"Some technology revolutions seem to take place in an instant and have an immediate effect on our world: Think of the telescope, Sputnik, or the atomic bomb. Others take a while, as in the transition from steam power to petroleum-fueled engines, or the development of computers and the internet. The conversion of our personal mobility systems - primarily cars and trucks - away from fossil fuels and onto an electrical platform is likely going to be one of those slower transitions, but a bit of news out this week may one day be considered a fairly major course correction in that journey.
In a press release, electric car charger maker EVgo says it has partnered with the petroleum giant Chevron to place electric car chargers at a number of gas stations in California. One of the charging facilities is already up and running, and will soon be joined by about a dozen more - to start. Chevron has also announced they are partnering with ChargePoint in California, another leading EV charging facilitator.
According to Jonathan Levy, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at EVgo, the partnership with Chevron is similar to the ""site host"" arrangement they have with other retailers, such as Walmart and Whole Foods. Levy said the initial conversation with Chevron quickly grew from talking about putting chargers at one site to several. ""We're really excited about it, since they recognize the win-win value, the fact that the world is changing, and that people need a place to go while they're charging,"" Levy told Forbes. ""And we realize they have great real estate and a great plan and are wanting to lead on transportation.""
While it's not a hard left turn for the entire fuel industry, the move is a relative first for stations in the United States, even if the initial rollout is located in Calfornia, the current center of the EV universe for the U.S. Still, the move breaks a seal of sorts in the thawing cold war between electric cars and gas-driven machines.
While electric cars have even become a political football some people, large petroleum companies are beginning to quietly move their chess pieces in preparation for what many auto and fuel industry watchers have been saying more loudly in recent years: electric vehicles are the future.
A natural extension of this tectonic shift in two world-shaping shaping industries is the requirement of an infrastructure build-out of places electric car and truck operators can recharge their batteries. While Tesla has led the way with their now widespread Supercharger network , some petroleum companies, notably Shell, have also begun to look at the electrification of transportation not as a flanking maneuver by some enemy force, but as a financial opportunity that will definitely come to pass. And while Chevron's recent website update has the tone of hedging their bets, it's also clear they can see the changes coming sooner than later.
Tesla now has charging stations in almost every U.S. state and many more in Mexico, Australia, Japan and China.
Tesla Motors While Shell has not yet made any big moves in the United States, it is setting the pace in Europe, where it has purchased charging companies and partnered with others, such as Ionity , as far back as 2017. Shell is now wired into over 30,000 chargers across several countries, many of which are located at gasoline stations or other places drivers can rest, shop or entertain themselves as their cars recharge.
That huge resource of existing locations gives petroleum vendors a huge advantage in the charging game. Many gas stations now incorporate minimarts where travelers queue up for bathroom breaks, coffee, snacks and even fast food partners. Adding chargers - either their own or those operated by a partner like EVgo - involves minimal infrastructure changes. The chargers can be easily added to already existing parking spots or an area on the lot can be set up with multiple connectors. A credit card or smartphone tap typically gets the electrons flowing, and most electric cars are now boasting fast-charge capabilities that recharge the battery to 80% of capacity in 30 minutes, depending on how ""hot"" the recharger is .
Over time, the waiting periods to recharge are only going to get shorter, and with the development of new battery technologies, namely solid-state batteries , charging times will eventually drop to minutes, just like gassing up.
Fuel companies would be smart to get in the game now and start serving both gas and electric customers at their stations.
It looks like Chevron just got the memo."
OnePlus 7 Pro Fingerprint Reader Hacked In Matter Of Minutes,www.forbes.com,Davey Winder,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/05/26/oneplus-7-pro-fingerprint-reader-hacked-in-matter-of-minutes/,"The new OnePlus 7 Pro is a stunning phone, of that there can be little doubt. The pop-up camera and all-screen display with a great refresh rate show that OnePlus is still pushing forward with the form and functionality of its devices. One area where it has been pretty static is device security though, and so it should come as no surprise that someone has already managed to hack the fingerprint reader. Which doesn't necessarily mean that you should be running around the room pulling your hair out, the ability to hack the fingerprint security lock and the opportunity to exploit this ability are two very different things. OnePlus 7 Pro biometrics
The fingerprint sensor is the same optical ""under the screen"" one that users of the OnePlus 6T will already be very used to. This is no bad thing as far as accuracy and speed are concerned; the OnePlus 7 Pro has one of the fastest finger to phone unlock routines I have seen, coupled with a decent target area meaning your finger (or thumb) will hit a lot more than miss. Indeed, Forbes contributor Ewan Spence says he will ""be using the fingerprint unlocking a lot more on the 7 Pro than the 6T"" as the pop-up camera makes facial recognition too slow by comparison. I am not suggesting he, or you, should change your mind in light of the revelation that the fingerprint reader can be fooled pretty easily.
The fingerprint hack explained
Earlier this week a video appeared on the Max Tech YouTube channel that showed how easily the OnePlus 7 Pro fingerprint reader could be fooled and the device unlocked using just a hot-glue gun, tinfoil and some white school glue. This methodology is nothing new, truth be told, and similar print molding techniques have fooled many a biometric security system in the past. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) famously bypassed the iPhone 5S Touch ID system back in 2013 by photographing a fingerprint, laser-printing to a transparent sheet using a thick toner laying over this with latex milk to produce a fake finger. The Max Tech method was even easier and a lot quicker; from finger to phone access was accomplished in a matter of minutes. It involves putting a blob of hot-glue onto some tinfoil, wetting your finger and dabbing it into the glue to make an impression and then filling over the top with some white school glue. As soon as the white glue dries, which only takes minutes, this is carefully peeled away to reveal a fake fingerprint that can be used to successfully and instantly unlock the OnePlus 7 Pro time and time again. The cloned fingerprint could also open a OnePlus 6T but didn't fool the ultrasonic reader used by the Samsung S10. Not that the Samsung S10 cannot be fooled, as I reported here on Forbes back in March.
Why it really doesn't matter that much
Across the years I have seen fingerprints cloned using everything from clay to Gummi Bear sweets. Yet I still use the fingerprint reader on my phone as the primary unlock method. Am I mad? Nope, I am just realistic. As ethical hacker John Opdenakker told me earlier today, ""it sounds very scary because this attack could give criminals access to your entire digital life. But it would be very difficult to realize because it requires a fingerprint of the victim and physical access to the device."" And there is the reason I still use fingerprint unlocking and so should you. For the hack to be effective the attacker would have to not only already have physical access to your OnePlus 7 Pro device but to your finger as well. Why bother forcing you to dab your finger in hot glue when they could just as easily force you to dab it onto the phone screen instead? My advice is to keep on using that OnePlus 7 Pro fingerprint biometric to unlock your phone. It provides ample security for most use cases and the risk of someone being able to bypass it is very small for the vast majority of people. Oh, and if anyone asks you to just pop your finger into a blob of hot glue, politely decline...
I asked OnePlus for comment regarding this fingerprint reader hack but had not heard back by the time of publication. If this changes I will update the story accordingly."

Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Joseph ""Joe"" Kava, head of data centers at Google, third from right, and Scott Beaumont, head of Greater China at Google, first right, attend the opening ceremony of the Google data center in Changhua, Taiwan, in 2013. (Ashley Pon/Bloomberg) BLOOMBERG NEWS After a decade spent trying to remain competitive in the global high tech race, officials in Taiwan appear to have decided the answer lies in AI. Taiwan has been losing out on consumer electronics orders from offshore brands–the island's long-time strength – as manufacturers look to cheaper factory hubs such as China. But investments in Taiwan by Google, Microsoft and Nvidia among others, all over the past year or two, show that Taiwan can start pivoting from hardware and become a leading R&D center in artificial intelligence.
In response, the government is now scrambling to develop talent, which may otherwise fall short of what it takes to keep attracting investments from big businesses. Premier Su Tseng-chang says 10,000 people will be trained every year for work in AI R&D. That ambition extends naturally from decades of educating engineers at the island's universities. Silicon Valley firms are setting up shop in Taiwan exactly because of that talent , tech analysts say.
“In less than two years, Taiwan has become a stage for AI application innovations watched by the world,” Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said in a statement on May 16. AI “bases” established in Taiwan by foreign tech giants, he said, will “raise industry competitiveness as well as raising the quality of life of our citizens.""
Artificial intelligence , or AI for short, refers to a type of computer science that lets machines act like humans, for example recognizing speech or making decisions based on large amounts of data.
AI education must begin early
To come up with those 10,000 people every year, the premier said AI education will “take root” in elementary and middle schools. Supplementary teaching material will enter the public schools this year, too, and about 1,000 people have signed up for a government-cosponsored online AI-applications lessons.
More on Forbes: How Taiwan Is Becoming A Top Destination For Artificial Intelligence In Asia
U.S.-based tech firms are picking Taiwan over other spots in Asia for AI projects because of the engineering “quality” as well as Taiwanese worker's reputation for loyalty and stability, American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei President William Foreman says. They know Taiwan has trained engineers since the 1980s to work on contract making tech hardware such as PCs, a major source of income before AI came along. New graduates earn an average of $1,084 per month, per this local media report .
However, there's still a talent shortage, Foreman says. “Taiwan has long had an extremely high demand for computer science talent, and the shortage of talent is growing even more acute as companies get into AI,” he says.
Worldwide, just 22,000 people are qualified to research AI well enough to start new projects, says J.F. Gagne, CEO and founder of the software firm Element AI in Montreal.
Who’s who of high tech needs the workers
In early 2018, Google, IBM and Microsoft announced expansions in Taiwan for R&D, and said they would eventually hire a a combined 600 people. Google's Chinese-language blog announced in March that it would build a new suburban Taipei office park next year with the space to double its current staff of 2,000 and do more with AI.
Those aren't the only firms looking to the island for talent. Chip developer Qualcomm said in August it would build a Taiwan production facility as the “nexus"" for supply chain operations and ""associated engineering and development functions.” Nvidia, a Silicon Valley-based maker of graphics processing units, entered a partnership about a year ago with Taiwan’s science and technology ministry for AI development.
Training people here to work in AI rather than in hardware will be crucial, says Helen Chiang, Taipei general manager with the market research firm IDC. She expects smartphones and PCs to incorporate AI in the near term, increasing the need for talent. “Taiwan already has a lot of AI projects in the universities, and in terms of scientists the government especially wants to cultivate this area, so the talent pool has been developing slowly over time, and the resources are quite important,"" Chiang says.

The Bootstrapped Bistro Startup That Became The Best In Britain,www.forbes.com,Alison Coleman,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2019/05/26/the-bootstrapped-bistro-startup-that-became-the-best-in-britain/,"Opening a new restaurant can be a costly venture, and a lack of startup capital is often the biggest challenge for food entrepreneurs in a fiercely competitive market. But Aga and Lewis King, owners of The Old Bank in Snettisham in north Norfolk, have proved that success in the restaurant business isn’t necessarily reliant on huge financial resources.
The husband and wife team opened their small bistro restaurant in 2016 with just £15,000 ($19,000). Two years later it was named Best Local Restaurant in Britain 2019 by the Good Food Guide and was listed in the Michelin Guide.
Lewis, a native of Norfolk, had started training as a chef at 19 and honed his skills working in restaurants all over the country, while Aga, who moved to the UK from Poland to study for a degree, had worked part time in catering roles since her teens. The pair shared a dream of running their own place, but they also knew the risks they’d be facing.
“It is really tough,” says Aga. “Profit margins in the restaurant business are low and the reality is you are going to struggle to get rich running your own restaurant.”
On the other hand, however, it would give Lewis the chance to escape the constraints of someone else’s kitchen and pursue his own culinary vision. In 2014 they began scouting various parts of the UK for the right location.
 “We eventually came to Norfolk and spotted The Old Bank, which at that time was being run as coffee shop,” says Lewis. “We wanted a 30-cover restaurant and everything about the place just felt right.”
However it was to be another two years before they achieved their goal, signing the lease, leaving their jobs and taking the plunge into the challenging world of restaurant ownership. Funding was the first obstacle.
“There wasn’t a lot of financial support available to a business like ours as we were considered high risk,” explains Aga. “We did look at the government’s Start Up Loan scheme, but it could take around eight months to secure funding. We’d both given up our jobs and didn’t want to wait that long, so we used our own money.”
The premises needed a lot of work; the kitchen had to be completely stripped out and refitted, and the restaurant needed decorating. With Lewis’s family roped in to help, it took them 17 days from getting the keys to opening for business, and they did it on a budget of £15,000.
What they lacked in startup cash, they made up for in the place already having a good reputation locally. “News travels fast and from the start we had people coming in,” says Lewis. “Our initial plan was to offer the same things they’d had from the previous owner; breakfasts, snacks, sandwiches, etc., not necessarily what we would choose to offer, but we needed to start earning money to reinvest. People loved it.”
With revenue coming in, they began evolving their offering and stamping their own mark on the restaurant, gradually phasing out the breakfasts and focusing on a more modern and sophisticated cuisine, with local produce at its heart.
“When we first started we weren’t absolutely clear about what we wanted our restaurant to be, ” says Lewis. “But if we’d offered what we offer now on the day we opened I don’t think we’d be still be here.”
Word of mouth recommendations soon saw the bistro topping Trip Advisor review rankings for the region. Last year the Good Food Guide named it Best Local Restaurant for the whole of Britain, an award that relied on customer nominations to make the initial shortlist.
“For a 24-cover restaurant to get enough customer nominations to be shortlisted against so much competition was amazing,” says Aga. “Then to find out we’d won the national competition was completely overwhelming and very emotional. We were just blown away.”
The restaurant was also listed in the 2019 Michelin Guide.
Now the Kings’ sights are set on their next phase of growth. “We’ve actually never stopped working on it – we’ve only just replaced the chairs - so everything is a work in progress,” says Aga.
Lewis has a small team, including a full time and a part time chef, and what he’d really like is a bigger kitchen. His ultimate goal would be to buy the building instead of leasing in order to expand the premises.
But for now they are delighted to have created a destination restaurant in a quiet little village that has virtually no passing trade. When people come to Snettisham, they are invariably coming to The Old Bank.
“We always wanted to be a destination restaurant, and it is very flattering to have people prepared to travel a long way to come here,” says Aga.
For Lewis, the proudest moment of their journey came on July 7, 2017. “We had been open for a year,” he says. “So many restaurants don’t make it – I know, I’ve worked in some of them – but we’ve been very careful with money, we had good industry experience and a vision, and our food is different to anything else around here, and people love it.”"
Ten Customer Experience (CX) Strategies To Amaze Your Customers,www.forbes.com,Shep Hyken,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2019/05/26/ten-customer-experience-cx-strategies-to-amaze-your-customers/,"With such a strong emphasis today on Customer Experience (CX), plenty of data and reports are coming out with information and ideas we can use to improve. One such report is Extens Consulting’s Best Practices Customer Experience 2018 . Based in France, Extens helps its clients create memorable experiences for customers and employees. It lists 24 ideas from as many companies, most of them from France, and some of which you’ll recognize. The list offers concepts that are worth considering as CX strategies for your organization. While nothing may seem radically new or different, they all work for the different industries these companies represent. I’ve taken 10 of my favorites from their list to give you a short synopsis. I also end each example with a question to help you consider if this is an idea you can use. Time Is Money: ING Direct France recognizes that customers don’t like to wait on hold. As a result, they pay their customers for having to wait to reach a representative. It’s 60 cents per minute, which doesn’t sound like much, but it’s the idea that counts. What can you do to ease the friction of having to wait on hold – or wait for anything else? An Easy Way to Pay: Aviva France makes it easy for its customers to pay their home and auto insurance with Amazon Pay. Customers use the information that Amazon has stored in their accounts, which eliminates having to enter a credit card number and other information every time they want to make a payment. How easy do you make it for customers to pay for your goods and services?
It’s Like I’m There, But I’m Not: The French digital real estate agency Nexity takes advantage of digital tools to create high-end virtual tours for its customers. Video use has exploded and is now almost commonplace as a method of showcasing a company’s products and services. Add in virtual or augmented reality, and it takes the “like I’m there” experience to another level. What are you doing to visually showcase what you sell? Talk to Me: The perfumer Guerlain is taking advantage of Google Assistant. Customers can get remote perfume consultation, find their nearest store and more – all through Google’s technology. Does your company take advantage of Google Assistant, Amazon Echo or other smart devices? Self-Service Appointments: Darty does same-day delivery and repairs on large appliances and televisions. It has created a self-service solution on its website for customers to make appointments, saving them time. How easy is it for your customers to make appointments or schedule meetings with you? Share Stories: Schneider Electricite is focused on creating a service culture. Proof of that is how they start each meeting with a customer story. This “ritual” emphasizes the company’s dedication to creating a great service experience by sharing what others are doing. How do you showcase great customer service for your employees? Everyone Together Now: FoxNot is a legal tech startup that helps notaries and their clients by connecting them with all the people they need for whatever they are working on. For example, in a real estate transaction, FoxNot would share the names of real estate agents, mortgage companies, appraisers, etc. It’s a great way to give some value-added support to customers and build good relationships with others in the industry . What referrals can you make to your customers to help them in areas beyond what you do? Personalize my Experience: Accor Hotels released a technology solution that allows all hotels in its group to share customer preferences, thereby giving customers a more personalized experience. It’s important for people on the front line of any business to have customer information, especially about their preferences. How easy do you make it for your employees to know the customers they interact with on a regular basis? Try Before You Buy: Almost 25% of the retail space in Decathlon stores in Canada is dedicated to letting customers try before they buy. Customers can “play” golf, basketball, archery and more in areas dedicated to playing versus selling. They even have changing rooms for their customers. Do you give your customers the opportunity to “test drive” or “play” with whatever you sell? Real Life Simulation: This is somewhat similar to Try Before You Buy (above), but it takes the “test drive” to another level. Canada Goose has put “Cold Rooms” in several of its stores. These rooms are set at negative 25 degrees Celsius (negative 14 degrees Fahrenheit), so the customer can experience just how warm those Canada Goose coats really are. What real-life simulation can you offer your customers to try out your products? Obviously, not all of these work for everyone reading this article, but if nothing else, they will make you think. There’s some common sense here, and then there are some truly forward-thinking examples. Some take advantage of technology, while others rely on old-school ideas. Let’s end with a question: What are you doing to enhance the experience your customers have when they do business with you?"
Being Everything To Somebody Is A Recipe For Disaster,www.forbes.com,Remy Blumenfeld,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/remyblumenfeld/2019/05/26/being-everything-to-somebody-is-a-recipe-for-disaster/,"If you've ever been envious of couples who work together, play together, are each other's best friend, confidante, gym buddy and spiritual adviser, don't be. It may seem like a beautiful idea, but being everything to somebody is a recipe for disaster. And if the person you're being everything to is also your life partner, the first thing to suffer will be your sex life. I recently attended the most magical wedding of two close friends. Both the bride and groom are strong, independent people with their own careers, interests, and circles of friends. They are also clearly excited by one another. In the wedding speeches, several of their friends spoke of how they hoped the pair would in time become everything to one another. I silently hoped they would not. My wish for them is that they preserve their autonomy and separateness enough to keep the excitement they have for each other alive.
I've experienced the pitfalls of trying to be everything to somebody first hand. For many years, I cohabited with a wonderful man who started off as my lover and ended up as my best friend. In our case, the mistake we made was thinking we could combine being colleagues, mother/father and child to each other as well as best friends, while still having a romantic relationship. In the long run, it's just not possible, for reasons I'll explore here. Fortunately for me, my ex and I have remained great friends.
Esther Perel is one of the world’s most original and insightful voices on personal and professional relationships. In her brilliant book, Mating In Captivity she explores the paradox of intimacy and sexual desire and explains how lust and domesticity are unnatural bedfellows. You wouldn't, after all, want to have sex with your best friend, would you?
“Love enjoys knowing everything about you; desire needs mystery,"" says Perel, ""Love likes to shrink the distance that exists between me and you, while desire is energized by it. If intimacy grows through repetition and familiarity, eroticism is numbed by repetition. It thrives on the mysterious, the novel, and the unexpected.""
Intimacy, suggests Perel, is about being close; desire is about wanting to be close. ""An expression of longing, desire requires ongoing elusiveness. It is less concerned with where it has already been than passionate about where it can still go. But too often, as couples settle into the comforts of love, they cease to fan the flame of desire. They forget that fire needs air. Today, we turn to one person to provide what an entire village once did: a sense of grounding, meaning, and continuity. At the same time, we expect our committed relationships to be romantic as well as emotionally and sexually fulfilling. Is it any wonder that so many relationships crumble under the weight of it all?”
Like Perel, the philosopher John Gray does not believe that we can be everything to anyone, especially our romantic partner. In his book, How To Get What You Want And Want What You Have Gray defines 10 very distinct forms of love, which he describes as ""Love Tanks."" Unlike vitamins, which can be synthesized and combined into one multi-vitamin, John Gray makes a persuasive case for why the 10 kinds of love which humans need to feel fulfilled and contented, cannot and should not be combined.
Nature, God or The Universe . The only way to get this, says Gray, is through meditation or prayer of one sort or another. Love and support from parents . You don't need biological parents to exchange this kind of love. You could find this love from a wise person in your life such as a friend or a trained counselor. Ultimately, this is about finding the generous, kind parent in yourself so that you can give your inner child the unconditional love you need. Love and support from family and friends. When your life feels too heavy and serious this is the tank that needs filling. P eer Support. Freelancers sometimes lack the love of peers. However, it's not just colleagues who can offer this professional love. You can get it by belonging to clubs or associations. Love of Your Self. To fill this tank you have to make sure that you come first in your life. Say 'no' to things that don't bring you joy or fulfillment. Experiment by saying yes to unusual proposals and going to unexpected places S exual Love. This is about reciprocity in your primary sexual relationship, with someone who is not your work mate, best friend or a relative. Love of a child or dependent. This doesn't need to be your biological child. This could be someone who you mentor or even a dog. Love of Community. Filling this tank is about giving back some of what you have received to a community. The World . Perhaps you already have a global cause with which you are aligned. God. I interpret this as being about serving your purpose and living according to your values. Although I have one friend who deliberately avoids becoming intimate with all his 'partners' for as long as possible, from fear of losing sexual desire, it is of course possible, to have sex and intimacy, love and romance with the same person, so long as you are able to outsource the other kinds of unsexy love to friends, family and colleagues.
If you are able to maintain a romantic and intimate relationship with a sexual partner, you are already pulling off something extraordinary. Don't reach for the impossible by expecting them to be your best friend, colleague or carer as well.
After all, when you've argued with your boss, it's important to have a colleague with whom you can let off steam; When you've had a lovers' quarrel, it's useful to have a best friend to hang out with. And, of course, if you're not even a little in love with yourself, no one can fix that, except you.
Take this quick quiz to discover which of your love tanks are full or empty."
Three Visions For U.S.-China Trade Relations,www.forbes.com,Phil Levy,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/phillevy/2019/05/26/three-visions-for-u-s-china-trade-relations/,"A key reason that U.S. trade policy toward China appears devoid of any sort of strategic clarity is that Trump administration officials have never presented a vision for how they would like the United States and China to coexist in the world. The result is U.S. policy that shoots off in directions that are later revealed to be undesirable or untenable. Prominent recent examples occurred with the Chinese telecommunication giants ZTE and Huawei. In each case, the Trump administration pursued drastic legal actions that seemed poised to crush the companies, or at least shut them out of the United States. In the case of ZTE, this was because the company was accused of violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea. In the case of Huawei, the executive order was linked to protecting America from “foreign adversaries.”
In each case, the stance initially appeared clear: doing business with China, at least in telecommunications, posed an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security.
Yet, in each case, the Trump administration quickly relented. For ZTE, a year ago, President Trump soon tweeted :
President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!”
Then, for Huawei this past week, the Commerce Department followed up the executive order by granting the company a temporary license. Then, President Trump said that he might resolve the Huawei dispute as part of a trade agreement with China.
So, an alternative message becomes clear: it is diplomatically and commercially costly to disentangle from China, so the United States will seek out a compromise. The only problem with this clear message, of course, is that it directly contradicts the initial clear message that China was an unacceptable partner.
It may help to sort out the confusion by considering what a consistent vision of the U.S.-China economic relationship might look like. We can start with two admittedly-extreme cases.
China Compliant . This is a vision in which China does whatever the United States says, both politically and economically. This may seem absurd – the United States does not enjoy such a relationship with any independent country. Yet U.S. demands for Chinese reform reached deep into China’s political system. They also covered issues ranging from Chinese macroeconomic policy to trade barriers to state-owned enterprises to China’s ability to apply subsidies. (The Trump administration opposes subsidies , except when they are politically necessary to maintain support in the United States). Further, the recent breakdown in trade talks with China reportedly followed a dispute over whether China would write U.S. demands into Chinese law. Responding to such demands, Chinese state media just accused the United States of trying to “colonize global business.” China Apart . This seemed to be the goal of the initial telecommunication excommunication. It was consistent with official administration statements about how it was a mistake to let China into the World Trade Organization in 2001. This was also the tone of the National Security Strategy of 2017, which said China was a strategic competitor that aimed to challenge American power, influence, and interests, and erode U.S. security and prosperity. Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, initially caught the President’s attention through his book Death by China . In this extreme vision, the United States tries to wall off China. The problem with the first extreme is that China will not accept it. The problems with the second are manifold . China is far too big and important an economy to ignore. And none of the major trading partners of the United States have any interest in quarantining China, though they often share major U.S. concerns. If the United States were to shut out China, U.S. firms and farmers would be at a severe disadvantage to other countries’ businesses who could operate without such barriers. At least for businesses dependent on global supply chains, this could soon increase pressure to move operations out of the United States.
Further, when the United States takes an extreme and impractical stance, it becomes impossible to rally erstwhile allies to join in the effort. They might well join if the Trump administration set aside these two extremes and devoted careful thought to the sort of compromises that could serve commercial interests while addressing national security concerns.
To return to the telecommunications example, Holman Jenkins argues in the Wall Street Journal that “Shutting out Huawei does not solve any security problem…Banning Huawei from the U.S. market only increases China’s incentives for recklessness in the cyber sphere.” He suggests instead that the U.S. should have worked to foster a competitive market that would have included a suitably-policed Huawei along with other firms.
A third vision of China relations would work to shape Chinese behavior in a constructive and effective way, as through the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would work to set global rules on intellectual property protection, cyber attacks, subsidies, and state-owned enterprises that would be enshrined in multilateral agreements. China’s record of keeping its promises at the WTO has actually been on a par with most major countries – not perfect, but decent. Yet President Trump abandoned the TPP and his administration has nearly brought the WTO to its knees.
Perhaps after a period of careening ineffectively between the two impossible visions of a China relationship, the United States can work to craft a viable vision that lies in between."
In Defense Of Wealthy Students Who Get Extra Time On The SAT,www.forbes.com,Christopher Rim,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherrim/2019/05/26/in-defense-of-wealthy-students-who-get-extra-time-on-the-sat/,"This week, the Wall Street Journal published an article detailing their analysis of over 9,000 public schools. They analyzed how many students in each district received “504” accommodations — special allowances for mental health reasons, especially extended time on tests due to attention and/or anxiety disorders. These numbers roughly correlate to the number of students getting extended time on the ACT and SAT, although getting extended time on these standardized tests is a separate process. The takeaway: that an increasing number of students are getting 504 accommodations and extended time on the ACT and SAT, and that a disproportionate number of these students are from wealthy school districts. This has understandably led to a backlash—the majority of respondents to the in-article poll called to eliminate extensions for all students or to tighten up rules for granting extensions. In the context of the recent college admissions scandal , this disparity smells of ‘snowplow parenting,’ and some parents involved in the scandal did seek extended time despite their children having no legitimate need for it. Still, I would argue that making these accommodations less accessible would lead to far more harm than good and, if anything, the accommodations should be easier to come by, not harder.
The most recent statistics (2015-2016) in the Wall Street Journal article indicate that 2.8% of students at public schools receive 504 accommodations. In wealthy schools, that number is 4.2%, while in poorer schools it’s only 1.6% of students. Compare those percentages to these: the CDC estimated that in 2016, 9.4% of children had ADHD, and 5.2% were taking ADHD medication. Nearly twice as many students are taking medication for ADHD than are receiving accommodations in school—so why are we assuming the issue is that wealthy students are over-diagnosed or getting accommodations for disorders they don’t have?
Now, I may be a bit biased as a professional in the education consulting industry that works with primarily high-income families (as well as a number of low-income students through our scholarships). However, the students I work with who do receive accommodations (not as many as you might think) have very obvious and real problems that impact their lives far beyond standardized tests. And yes, their backgrounds make them more likely to get diagnosed and treated—but that doesn’t delegitimize their struggles. A wealthy child with ADHD is still a child with ADHD and deserves treatment.
If you’re not convinced that wealthy students have legitimate diagnoses, you don’t have to take my word for it. Take a look at this New York Times article that shows a near-direct correlation between an area’s average income percentile and the number of mental health drugs purchased at area pharmacies. The article suggests that “richer patients are more likely to have private insurance or extra money to pay for psychiatric care that is not covered by insurance. And some people in lower-income communities may feel more stigma around mental health diagnoses.” Or consider how race is a factor as well—the authors of a prominent study examined the racial disparity in the diagnosis of ADHD and concluded that, rather than white children being over-diagnosed or over-treated for ADHD, the primary cause of the disparity was that African-American and Latino children are under-diagnosed and under-treated . I think it’s fair to argue that something similar is happening in terms of children in wealthy and poorer school districts.
So yes, wealthy students are more likely to get extended time on the SAT and ACT and on tests in school—because they’re more likely to get diagnosed with legitimate mental health disorders. Extended time on the SAT is not a zero-sum game: one student receiving accommodations doesn’t prevent another student from receiving the same accommodations. We should address this disparity, but not by eliminating accommodations or increasing the restrictions and requirements (something that will be more of a roadblock for under-resourced students than the wealthy, by the way). Instead, more should be done to increase the diagnosis, treatment, and accommodations for mental health disorders in underserved communities."
Five Ways Your Job Search Should Change If You Want To Land Temp Jobs,www.forbes.com,Caroline Ceniza-Levine,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecenizalevine/2019/05/26/five-ways-your-job-search-should-change-if-you-want-to-land-temp-jobs/,"Interviewing for temp jobs Getty The hiring process for temp jobs (or freelance gigs or contract roles) is different than for permanent jobs. Never mind that there is no such thing as permanent – people change jobs an average of 12 times during their career. When employers hire for permanent roles, they imagine a longer runway to onboard and train the new hire. .
Given the different hiring expectations for temp jobs vs. permanent jobs, you need different job search tactics. Here are five ways your job search should change if you want to land temp jobs:
1. Broadcast your interest in temp jobs
It is not obvious, especially if you are coming from a permanent job, that you are open to temp work. In fact, when I recruit, I always assume the opposite and don’t pitch my temp openings to candidates currently employed in a permanent role or coming off of a permanent role.
Put “available for temporary, contract and freelance work” in your online profile and resume. In networking meetings, mention that you’re open to hearing about and being considered for temp jobs. Indicate your specific availability – sending a note to your contacts that you are finishing a current project next week is networking outreach that puts you top of mind and signals your availability for temp jobs.
2. Emphasize experience specific to temp jobs
If you already have temp experience, highlight this in your marketing and networking. . It is often not obvious on a resume if jobs are temp or permanent, so specify this by including the word, contract or temp, after the employer or title. In addition, highlight which roles were temp or permanent in an interview.
If you don’t have temp experience, highlight when you have worked on short, discreet projects and the results you were able to achieve. Give examples of when you have parachuted into new situations and had to adapt quickly. These may not be official temp jobs, but this experience is directly relevant.
3. Break down your skills to expand the temp jobs you qualify for
Your permanent experience likely encompasses a lot of different responsibilities, but temp jobs by their nature will be more siloed. Therefore, you want to break down your broader roles into specific skills and qualifications that can funnel into a variety of temp jobs.
For example, if you work in marketing, you might be able to fill temp roles in market research, competitor analysis, revenue forecasting, direct mail, or even copywriting. However, each one of these skills may not be broken out on your resume. The recruiter searching for a copywriter may skip over your general marketing resume unless you break down the different areas. Where you list your interest and availability in temp jobs, you can also list your different areas: Available immediately for temp, freelance, or contract jobs in copywriting, market research, competitor analysis, etc.
4. Tap your personal network
You should emphasize networking in both a temp and permanent job search. However, the referral process is slightly different with temp jobs. The hiring process is typically faster and word-of-mouth can really tip the scales in your favor because the employer has less time to sift through candidates.
In addition, your networking contacts may be more comfortable referring you for temp jobs than permanent because the commitment is smaller. Your personal network already knows, likes and trusts you, and if they hear of a temp job and know that you are looking, it is an easier referral to contact the employer and say, “I know someone who’s great overall. You’re in a pinch, and I trust this person.” Unlike a permanent job where the referrer has to think about long-term fit and a broader range of responsibilities (this makes the referral stakes seem high), a temp job is a smaller scope and therefore a smaller imposition on the referrer.
5. Tailor your selling points for temp jobs
Don’t just wait for people to refer you, however. Contact employers who could use your background on a project basis, and pitch yourself as a temp solution. For temp jobs specifically, highlight immediate problems that you can solve and deliver quick results. Remember that the upcoming summer months could mean more temp jobs to cover for permanent employees on vacation.
Highlight your unique characteristics that make you suitable to temp jobs. In addition to temp-relevant experience (see point 2), focus on temp-relevant qualities -- you adapt quickly, you can work with lots of different people and in different environments.
You can look for temp jobs and permanent jobs at the same time, and working temp jobs is a great way to buy more time to hold out for the ideal permanent job. Remember that the hiring for temp jobs is different, and your job search should reflect that.

It’s also easy to want to invest in just a few relationships and make big efforts to nurture those specific connections. However, I’ve learned over time that to challenge yourself, you have to extend your network beyond that. I recently experienced the truth of this with the launch of Calendar, my new venture with my business partner. This isn’t just a company that’s important to me in terms of success ; it feeds my passion to help people understand their return on investment when it comes to how they use their time (or ROIT, as I call it). But the reactions I received in response to the launch surprised me.
I thought some people I’d known for years would jump at the chance to be helpful. These were people whose books I’ve promoted and who I’ve done multiple favors for — I’ve even sent business their way. I haven’t been a stranger with referrals. Yet I haven’t heard anything or seen any efforts from them to support my new venture.
On the other hand, people I’ve met over the past year — or people I didn’t have a “close” relationship with — have welcomed the opportunity to connect me with potential investors, customers, and partners. They’ve introduced me to anyone they felt might be valuable to the company’s purpose. It was a great reminder that support doesn’t always come from the corners we expect.
People Can — and Will — Surprise You
This experience has also been a great reminder to engage a wide variety of people. I’m not recommending befriending every person who walks by, but remember that your network can help you overcome challenges, power past barriers, and create opportunity that wouldn’t otherwise exist. A narrow network full of people in the same industry or with the same background isn’t nearly as helpful as connections across the spectrum.
In your time of need — professional or personal — surprising people will rise to the occasion. Good people come from all walks of life. Here are five things I’ve learned about identifying people worthy of joining your circle:
1. Don’t blow people off because you don’t think they’re important.
Some of the most helpful people you’ll meet aren’t CEOs or well-known influencers. They have a sister who’s an exec at a large brand in need of your product, and they thought it was a good fit. They ran into somebody at a conference and mentioned your name. They’re engaging people who may not have big titles, but they carry influence nonetheless.
Focus on the quality of the people you encounter and how you can help each other, not on who has the biggest name. I’ve had some amazing people without big names connect the dots to offer a lot of value. Letting your ego prevent you from circulating in groups below the C-suite can hurt you — and prevent you from meeting some really great people.
2. A personal content strategy helps you nurture large groups.
I recently had somebody I’d never met connect me to an investor who was an amazing fit. This “stranger” simply said, “I’ve read your content for years and knew you two would hit it off.” This person helped me more than some people I’ve known for years and approached for intros. He felt connected to me through my writing , despite never shaking hands.
Content allows you to reach a larger audience of potential helpers. As long as you’ve communicated what’s valuable to you, you’ll have an army of people looking out for you. They’ll also have lots of details about what’s relevant and what’s not, without even asking.
3. Don’t assume anything about anybody.
I made the mistake of assuming a couple of people I knew would be incredibly helpful. In reality, I could tell they’d just quickly nodded and agreed to help a lot — the fake nod may even have been a habit by that point. They sent one tweet and moved on.
Others preach about the importance of helping others, but I’ve noticed they don’t actually do anything, even when somebody they care about is doing something she considers important. Look at people’s track records to anticipate how truly helpful they’ll be. Assess how they treat their spouse, friends, and business partners. That’s a (best-case scenario) foreshadowing of how they’ll treat you.
4. Remember the people who are helpful, and reciprocate.
I’m not suggesting you should set up a quid pro quo arrangement or only trade in favors. However, you need to remember the people who’ve been there for you so you can grow together. Just like in a solid personal relationship, reciprocation is important when building a helpful network.
Make a note or reflect on the people who’ve helped move the needle for you. Keep an eye out for opportunities to do something for them. Always show appreciation, and ask how you can help the other person in the future. Sometimes, simply modeling this behavior can trigger others to pay it forward — and that’s a good thing for the whole entrepreneurial ecosystem.
5. Get OK with asking for help.
For years, I avoided asking for help . My previous company was doing well, and I was in a place where I was traveling a lot and could help others frequently. Now, I’m about to launch a new company in uncharted territory, where I will need others’ help. As well as things are going, it’s at the beginning when help is most needed.
I’ve had to remind myself that it’s OK to let people be helpful. A lot of leaders are taught that showing vulnerability is dangerous. If people see cracks in your armor, they’ll pounce. But this type of thinking blocks you from getting the things you can’t achieve on your own, and it prevents people from feeling helpful . Showing vulnerability helps others do the same — they may need your help and be afraid to ask for it.
I know I’m not alone in my experience. Every day, we’re surprised by the people who let us down — and the people who come through. To avoid being caught off guard, build a network of good people with a variety of strengths and interests. When the time is right, you’ll be able to help each other find success ."
Do-Over.Me: Guiding People Through Life Makeovers,www.forbes.com,Richard Eisenberg,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2019/05/26/do-over-me-guiding-people-through-life-makeovers/,"The problem with career counseling for people in their 50s and 60s is that it’s often mostly about reworking your résumé and LinkedIn profile and developing a ""personal brand."" But what if it was more holistic? A process where you and your adviser worked together not on finding a job — but more of a life makeover based on your needs and goals? That idea is being put to the test, successfully and intriguingly, at a Geneva, Ill.-based not-for-profit company called do-over.me . Founder Cynthia Wade launched it in 2014 as her own life makeover.
The Real-Life Makeover That Led to do-over.me
In 2013, Wade had turned 60, lost her recruiter job unexpectedly, underwent total shoulder replacement surgery and became an empty nester. “That was my summer of do-over,” she told me. “I thought: ‘What the hell just happened? And what the hell am I going to do now?’”
Also on Forbes:
After what she calls “a lot of self-medicating,” Wade decided she needed to take some positive steps with her life. She got a roommate and a dog and began taking improv classes. “All of a sudden, things started to turn around,” she recalls. That’s when Wade, who’d spent the first 18 years of her career in marketing, came up with the idea of launching do-over.me.
“I said to myself: ‘I’m going to take my marketing skills and run a program to help people figure out how to get on with the next chapter of their lives',” says Wade.
Changing a Career and a Life
People like Julie Francis — one of Wade’s former clients — and about 200 others.
When Francis came to Wade for advice, she was a self-employed, divorced Feldenkrais (body manipulation exercise therapy) practitioner in nearby Glen Ellyn, Ill., and going through a major life transition. Francis felt her grown daughter Andi, who has cerebral palsy, needed more help than she could provide and that closing her business and relocating with Andi to upstate New York (near Francis’ youngest sister) would be useful. But, she wondered, what could she do there that would give her time with her daughter plus an income?
Meeting with Wade, Francis says, ""was enormously helpful. In the process, we started identifying jobs that I felt would match my personality strengths. And Cynthia helped me find my strengths as well as the things that are important to me, and then focus in on them.” One of those strengths: Francis’ background and interest in science.
During the advisory sessions, Francis realized that rather than look for a full-time, high-paying job with huge responsibility managing people and projects, she’d be better off with something part-time. That would give her time with Andi, too. “There’s only so much of me to go around,” Francis jokes.
These days, she’s a part-time pharmacy tech at a Wegman’s supermarket in upstate New York, filling prescriptions, working with health insurers and supporting the pharmacists. “It allows me to keep my sanity and help support my daughter through her next phase,” says Francis. “And there’s always the possibility at some point in the future I can do whatever I want.”
'It Totally Changed My Life'
Another of Wade’s clients was a man in his 50s who came in to do-over.me shaking, because he'd lost his job unexpectedly. After consulting with Wade’s team, the man took a job he wound up not liking and ultimately returned to the career advisers for assistance. That led to a position he now loves, at a small retailer. Wade recalls him saying that with do-over.me, “I learned so much about myself and what’s important to me and who I am. It totally changed my life.”
Which goes back to Wade’s “do-over” practice. After clients pay a $50 annual registration fee, they get free introductory and networking sessions, followed by one-on-one and group sessions. At the moment, do-over.me is limited to suburban Chicago, though Wade hopes to expand nationwide.
The do-over.me Process
The way the process works is that clients first complete a Plan for Success document identifying their personal definition of success; their short-, intermediate- and long-term goals; their greatest assets and their biggest challenges.
After that come First Things First classes ($200 total) or a one-hour Jump Start class ($100) to begin working towards a goal, then creating a Plan for Success (base price: $75). Fees are on a sliding payment scale (the discount is as large as 75% for people with incomes below $35,000; Veterans are free). Says Wade: “Everybody should have access to professional practical resources to find meaningful employment.”
The program sometimes involves helping clients build self-esteem and self-confidence. “Those soft skills are important,” says Wade. “But we are coaches, not counselors.” In some cases, Wade and her team will suggest a client go to therapy.
Job Hunting, 2019-Style
Wade says some of her clients haven’t looked for a job in decades and need help learning the ropes. “You can’t do it the old way, circling newspaper ads,” she notes.
Sometimes, she meets strong resistance when telling them the tech techniques necessary to job-hunt successfully these days. “People say: ‘Why can’t I just do it like I used to do it? No matter how much I explain that it’s a different world, they don’t want to hear it,” she says.
That leads to her thoughts on age discrimination by employers and the perception of it by older job seekers. “When people talk about age discrimination, it’s not really about how old they are. It’s about their attitude,” Wade says. “If you’re continually learning and challenging yourself to stay current, you won’t have as much of a problem getting a job as if the employer senses from the things you say or do or from your résumé that you’re closed-minded and looking for a placeholder until you can retire.”
What's Your Gift?
Wade likens her services to the classic Jimmy Stewart film, It’s a Wonderful Life . She asks clients: “What’s the gift you were given to share with the world and where the world wouldn’t be the same if you weren’t here to share it?""
By helping them find that, and then take the next step in their career, Wade notes, “”we help them move along and teach them a few things about life and living.”
About eight in 10 clients who stick with the do-over.me process get jobs, says Wade. “Sometimes it happens it less than five weeks; sometimes it takes over a year,” she adds."
Here Are Some Of The Best (And Worst) Ways To Protect Yourself Online,www.forbes.com,Kevin Murnane,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/05/26/here-are-some-of-the-best-and-worst-ways-to-protect-yourself-online/,"Wes O'Donnell Online security should be a prime concern.
In some ways, online is like the wild west of days gone by. It’s an exciting place to visit, but you place yourself at risk every time you go there. Taking steps to keep yourself safe online should be as automatic as fastening your seat belt when you get into a car, but many people take only rudimentary safety precautions. It’s foolish, but it’s had the beneficial side effect that attention has focused on building security measures that are simple to use and fairly non-intrusive. Google evaluated six security measures to see how they fared against three common security threats. Examples of man-in-the-middle targeted spear phishing attacks.
The threats
Google detects and blocks hundreds of thousands of attempts to hijack user accounts every day. The threats come from phishing attacks and bots armed with user passwords that were obtained from corporate security breaches. X
Phishing attacks are as common as dirt because they’re easy to carry out and surprisingly effective. Phishing generally involves sending an email that invites the recipient to click on a link that leads to a malicious but harmless-looking website. The website can launch an immediate threat like a ransomware attack or surreptitiously inject code that steals passwords in order to break into the recipient’s accounts.
Most phishing attacks are sent in bulk to tens or hundreds of thousands of users. They’re usually fairly easy to spot and it’s surprising that so many continue to fall for them. Spear phishing is more insidious and harder to detect. Spear phishing targets individual users. The email often appears to come from a government office, someone the user knows or a trusted source like Google or Amazon. The image at the head of this section shows several examples of man-in-the-middle targeted spear phishing attacks that try to elicit user information by mimicking Google.
Bots are programs that run autonomously. They can make things easier by automating repetitive tasks but they can also be used for malicious purposes. For example, bots can sit quietly in a user’s system until a network of them are simultaneously activated to launch a denial-of-service attack. Bots can also be a more direct threat by stealing passwords, account and credit card numbers, and other information that needs to be kept secure. Device-based security measures are the way to go.
Security measures
Google evaluated the effectiveness of three device-based security measures and three knowledge-based measures it uses to protect user’s accounts. The device-based measures were a prompt sent directly to the user’s device, an SMS message sent to the user’s phone, or a security key attached to the device. The knowledge-based measures were sending a message to a secure secondary email address, calling a phone number the user has identified as trusted, and comparing the current and most recent sign-in locations. The graphs at the top of this section show how each of these security measures fared against bulk and targeted phishing attacks and automated bots.
As you can see, the device-based security measures were far more effective than the knowledge based measures. Security keys were rock solid providing 100% protection against all three threats.
Google’s on-device prompt system came in second with 100% security against automated bots, 99% success against bulk phishing and 90% success against targeted phishing. The old standby SMS two-factor authentication was strong against automated bots and bulk phishing but was only 76% effective against targeted phishing.
The knowledge-based security measures didn’t do nearly as well. A message sent to a secure secondary email address was the best of the lot but it was also the only security measure that didn’t provide 100% protection against automated bots. The other two are better than nothing but not by much. Create a unique password that’s easy to remember and hard to guess.
What can you do to increase your online safety?
The data tell the story. If you want premier security, attach a security key to your device. Google sells a Titan Security Key that protects Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, GitHub, Salesforce and other accounts along with the Android and Chrome operating systems.
If you have a compatible Android phone, you can set it up to receive on-device security prompts from Google. If you don’t have an Android phone or don’t want to receive the on-device prompts, set up some form of two-factor authentication for your important accounts.
There’s another simple thing you can do that makes accounts much more difficult to hijack or hack. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess for all your accounts. Everybody knows this but a lot of people don’t do it. For example, the National Cyber Security Centre in the UK analyzed passwords found in public databases of breached accounts and discovered that 23 million people used “123456” as their password . It’s a pretty safe bet that most of these people used it for more than one account as well.
People often don’t use unique passwords because they think it will be difficult or impossible to remember different passwords for all their accounts. It doesn’t have to be. Here’s a system for creating unique passwords that are easy to remember and hard to guess .
Many people ignore online security until it’s too late and they discover just how damaging identity theft or a hijacked account can be. Don’t be one of those people. Take some basic security precautions to protect yourself while you’re online. Do it now while you’re thinking about it.

Unpatched Apple macOS vulnerability lets malicious apps run -- what you need to know,www.forbes.com,Davey Winder,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/05/26/unpatched-apple-macos-vulnerability-lets-malicious-apps-run-what-you-need-to-know/,"AppleInsider reports that a vulnerability first disclosed to Apple three months ago remains unpatched and now the security researcher who found it has gone public. Filippo Cavallarin has published details of how the vulnerability enables a user to be tricked into running malicious applications, bypassing the Gatekeeper function in the process. Gatekeeper is the Apple mechanism that has, since 2012, been enforcing the code signing and verification of application downloads. If a user were to download an app outside of the Mac App Store then Gatekeeper would kick in and prevent it from running without the express consent of the user. In theory anyway.
Cavallarin says that, on macOS X version 10.14.5 (Mojave) and below, it is possible to ""easily bypass Gatekeeper in order to execute untrusted code without any warning or user's explicit permission."" According to Cavallarin, he contacted Apple February 22 and the vendor is aware of the issue. It was, he says, ""supposed to be addressed, according to the vendor, on May 15, but Apple started dropping my emails."" As a 90 day disclosure deadline, which he says Apple is aware of, has now passed, Cavallarin has made details of the vulnerability public.
How can the vulnerability be exploited?
The vulnerability itself is a design issue that revolves around the fact that Gatekeeper considers external drives and network shares as being ""safe locations"" allowing apps they contain to be run. By combining this fact with the automount feature to mount a network share using a ""special"" path and the feature that means zip archives can point to automount endpoints and decompress them without checking on these symbolic links, the vulnerability can be exploited. Cavallarin uses the example of an attacker crafting a zip file with a symbolic link to an automount endpoint under their control and sending this to the victim who downloads and extracts it following that symbolic link. ""Now the victim is in a location controlled by the attacker but trusted by Gatekeeper, so any attacker-controlled executable can be run without any warning"", Cavallarin states. There's a video here that shows the exploit in action.
What is the risk level?
Given that macOS X version 10.14.5 was only released a couple of weeks ago, there are going to be plenty of people who are yet to update their systems or are running much older versions of macOS and so are at risk. ""As an attacker you still need to trick the victim in to downloading the malicious payload first,"" ethical hacker John Opdenakker told me, ""it's a good reminder though that you always keep your OS patched.""
Is there a fix?
As previously stated, this vulnerability has yet to be patched by Apple and so there is no fix for the average user out there. Cavallarin suggests a possible workaround of disabling automount, but it certainly isn't for non-technical Apple Mac users. Apple, meanwhile, has yet to respond to my request for advice to users. If that changes, I will be sure to update this story accordingly. Security researcher, and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Scotland chapter leader, Sean Wright , told me in conversation that he's calling out companies that fail to act appropriately. ""In many cases companies acknowledge the issue and agree it needs to be fixed, but unfortunately this doesn't seem to happen, or it does without any appropriate communication with the reporter of the issue,"" Wright said, ""with the recent Windows 0days, and now this, attackers have great tools for their arsenal."" Wright concludes by agreeing with Opdenakker that it relies on the user doing something, so advises users should, ""be vigilant and only download and install software from trusted sources..."""
You Make This Much Prize Money,www.forbes.com,John Isner,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnisner/2019/05/26/you-make-this-much-prize-money/,"People often come up and tell me how much money I make in a year, which is funny because I don’t think it's something I’ve ever said to someone. They’re rarely accurate, but it happens so often that I think it’s worth explaining exactly how pro tennis players make money (to be followed by a much different, sadder post called: Expenses). My hope here is that pulling back the curtain a bit on my revenue streams will help explain some of the dynamics of the tennis industry, and maybe pro athletes in general, both with regards to how players earn but also in terms of where brands see value and choose to invest. The obvious one is prize money. I earned approximately $4 million in prize money in 2018. I won the Miami Open, I made the semifinals of Wimbledon; this was the best year of my career and I finished #10 in the world. Clearly, this was a great prize money year. The only catch is that at the beginning of each season you’re guaranteed none of it. There isn’t a salary in tennis. There’s no base + commission structure. No year-end bonus (though, more on that below). I know a lot of my friend’s jobs would have a different feel if they had to battle colleagues every day to see who earns an income. Additionally, my 2018 was a Top 10 year, but on the ATP Tour when you drop down into the Top 50, Top 100, the economics of prize money become very different.
The second revenue stream we have is sponsorships. Tennis sponsorships differ from, say, a basketball sponsorship in that each player is a franchise that can be branded on his or her own. For me, sponsorships encompass everything from Fila, which I work with on apparel and footwear, to Ebix and Tamko, with whom I have patch deals. I’ve played with Prince racquets my entire career. The way I view it, sponsors work with me so they can be a part of the important moments in my career. They invest in (and, I want to be clear, they also support) the promise that I’ll reach the big rounds of tournaments, get to the primetime matches on center court, and earn the TV and media exposure to give them a strong ROI on their investment. They put a marketing valuation on some combination of my game, my personality, my appeal, my audience reach, and they invest in me to provide value to them. There’s risk, of course. If I bow out early at a major suddenly their logo doesn’t get shown to millions of people around the world, but then when I play the longest match in the history of tennis their logo lives on forever in a museum. I think it works out.
Sponsorship deals come with incentives and reductions, as well. If I fall out of the Top 20 I might trigger a reduction in the base sponsorship compensation, though in that same contract I’ll also have bonus incentive for reaching the finals of a Grand Slam (which would be valued differently than the bonus for reaching the finals of an ATP 1000 event, or an ATP 500, etc.). The markets and audience appeal is important, and for American players these deals often put a higher incentive on US-based events.
The way I see it, the prize money is a reflection of my on-court performance, but the sponsorships are something more personal, connected more to people and fans, and to my values. A tournament pays me to show up because the fans want to see me and I move the needle at the box office? That’s amazing. It’s good for tennis, good for me and good for the event. If a sponsor wants to pay to put their company name on my shirt because they think I’m a strong ambassador for their brand? Heck yes. It’s an honor, you know?
What I try to remember is that once I retire in 2035 (just kidding), my revenue streams will change. Prize money disappears. My sponsorships and appearance fees suddenly have a different look. The revenue I generate today needs to be robust, and considering the risk involved with a tennis player’s income, it also needs to be diverse.
Plus, did I mention expenses?"
A New Windows Patch Is Causing PCs To Freeze...And Other Small Business Tech News This Week,www.forbes.com,Gene Marks,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2019/05/26/a-new-windows-patch-is-causing-pcs-to-freeze-and-other-small-business-tech-news-this-week/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Entrepreneurs I write about technology developments for small business owners. Share to facebook Share to linkedin Getty Here are five things in technology that happened this past week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?
1 — Windows 7 patch warning: antivirus clash causing PCs to freeze.
Just like in April when the Windows 7 update clashed with several antivirus products, the May 2019 Windows 7 updates are problematic for users of McAfee and Sophos security products. Sophos recently posted an alert about problems for users who installed the May 14 monthly rollup KB449164 and the security-only update KB4499175. And Microsoft confirmed startup issues with several McAfee security products, saying the updates might cause the system to have slow startup or become unresponsive at restart. (Source: ZDNet )
Why this is important for your business:
If this information is affecting your business than you’ve got a problem. No, not the antivirus clash. It’s that you’re still running Windows 7! If you’re having a decent year – as many small businesses are – it’s a good time to reinvest that money in upgrading your network to the most recent version of Windows. Microsoft is still supporting Windows 7 but c’mon, you know their passion lies with Windows 10. You should get your company current before their support runs out. (My company, The Marks Group PC, is a Microsoft partner).
2 — Bill.com launches an upgrade to their business payments platform.
This week, financial process automation leader Bill.com introduced what they say is the industry’s first platform that uses AI to provide end-to-end financial workflow automation. Its new Intelligent Business Payments Platform streamlines and controls payment processes while saving small and medium-sized companies time and reducing human error. Since many SMBs today still spend 23% of their workday manually managing many back office processes, there is a huge demand for automation of such processes, which has—until now—only been available to enterprise companies. (Source: Bill.com )
Why this is important for your business:
As I recently wrote on Inc.com : My prediction is that many smart businesses owners will be using technologies like these in the not-so-distant future. Why? Because these applications eliminate man-hours. They cut costs. They reduce fixed overhead. And one day that will also be in the not-so-distant future the economy will turn downwards, sales will dry up and the companies with the lowest cost structures will be in a better position to navigate and survive. Those are the companies that are right now automating their back offices while the going is good.
3 — Box revamps its workplace automation tool Relay and debuts new Tasks and File Request features.
In September, 2016, Box—the creator of the non-code, cloud-hosted workflow--introduced Relay—a business process automation tool designed to link recruiting, budgeting, and sales activities across a range of systems. Now, the company has announced a Relay redesign, which features a supercharged workflow engine, streamlined dashboard, and menus of new triggers and conditions. The tool can now route content based on metadata attributes like date, dropdown, multi-select, and open text fields, and its enhanced dashboard shows history, allowing process owners to see exportable lists of who created, updated, or deleted workflow or to elect users to create and manage their own workflows. (Source: Venture Beat )
Why this is important for your business:
Once a competitor, Box has now become a strong partner to other collaboration systems like Office 365 and Google’s G-Suite. The company offers a single platform for managing content, documents and workflow and counts more than 41 million users and 85,000 businesses as customers. True, the platform is mostly geared towards larger enterprises, but if your business has complex filing, security and workflow needs you may want to consider the investment.
4 — Zendesk acquires Smooch and doubles down on support via messaging apps like WhatsApp.
This week, customer support specialist Zendesk acquired Smooch—a startup that claims to be an ‘omnichannel messaging platform’ allowing companies’ customer care teams to interact with people over messaging platforms like WhatsApp, WeChat, Line and Messenger, as well as text and email. One of the first partners for the WhatsApp Business API, Smooch has also been a longtime partner of Zendesk. The deal between the two underscores the big impact of messaging apps in customer service. Even though phone and internet are huge points of contact, Zendesk says messaging apps are one of the features its customers request most. (Source: Tech Crunch )
Why this is important for your business:
My best clients are neurotic about keeping up with customer issues, incidents, complaints and problems. No, it’s not fun. But the faster these get resolved the happier customers are which means higher retainage and less churn. Also, being on top of issues helps many identify other opportunities. That’s the reason behind Zendesk’s growth over the past few years: many businesses have figured out that a strong support system is the backbone of a strong customer service operation.
5— Google sees Gmail as a key to its collaboration plans.
In last month’s issue of Google Cloud Next, the company said it sees the future of its team messaging tool Google Hangouts Chat as intertwined with Gmail, which allows users to switch into Chat without changing apps. Google believes that combining chat and email enables conversations to be pushed to the most fitting channel. Whereas team chat is best for ad-hoc discussions with colleagues, email is better for more formal interactions. (Source: Computer World )
Why this is important for your business:
If your company uses G-Suite then bear in mind the direction Google is going: in short, it’s all about Gmail. And that makes sense, because most of our communications still and will continue to revolve around our email.

Adam’s first startup, General Assembly started as a co-working space. Yet, due to the demand for information, they built their first classroom. Classes turned into courses. Courses turned into workshops. Then Fortune 2000 companies began approaching them to develop their enterprise education product.
As with many great startups, it was an incredible bank shot, that started out as one thing and curved to somewhere else. Today, Adam still feels starting an enterprise business through a consumer business is a really interesting way to build a company.
Adam enjoyed a lot of great help in launching and building General Assembly. He had as cofounders Brad Hargreaves, Jake Schwartz, and Matt Brimer. Matt was really good at bringing all kinds of people through by doing all kinds of events, happy hours and dinners. They also found the benefits of engaging the community and getting the community to promote itself.
They also received great advice from Aileen Lee to use OKRs to manage a team (the topic of John Doerr’s most recent book). She was at the time at Kleiner Perkins and coined the term ‘Unicorn’. She then went on to start Cowboy Ventures and landed on the Times 100.
Mimi Chun who had actually interviewed Adam to hire him at IDEO actually ended up becoming the first employee at General Assembly. She brought her expertise in human-centered design.
General Assembly scaled to around 500 employees and raised about $100 million in venture capital, before being acquired. Their investors included Bezos Expeditions, GSV, Maveron, and IVP. The startup was reportedly acquired by the Adecco Group for more than $400 million.
Moving The Ball Down Field
Following up from his last victory, Adam decided to just get the ball in play, start developing a number of brands, and let the path make itself clearer. Adam says that he saw social media driving a proliferation of consumer products thanks to being more easily discoverable.
At the same time, consumers began to become more interested in understanding the contents of those products, the supply chain of those products, and where those products came from.
Factories around the world were beginning to allow developing brands to do smaller runs of goods to micro-target people, essentially using social media. While local brands gained the ability to be global because of e-commerce.
Adam believed the enterprise infrastructure layer would have to undergo a massive transformation in order to power all of these new brands.
As a result of this thought process, Assembled Brands was born becoming a new way to finance companies and a new approach to building brands. It does this through financing in the form of credit, rather than just equity. Because if you use all equity as an entrepreneur you're probably going to get diluted out.
Secondly Assembled Brands has collected data on 3,500 brands over the past 18 months. That enables them to help these brands benchmark themselves, gain business insights about where to improve, and creates models for underwriting credit.
Thirdly, they provide a network of vendors who can help brands improve their metrics.
Important Startup Lessons Learned Along the way
1. Look for upside potential, with limited downside.
Adam found a big believer in Oaktree Capital Management, who wrote them a $100 million check to keep growing. Oaktree is a large global private credit company with a family of funds with about $100 billion in capital under management.
In March 2019, Brookfield took a 62% stake in Oaktree.
2. Loyalty is incredibly important
Loyalty can be measured by a customer buying your product over and over and over again. If they're doing that, your business actually looks like a subscription business.
If you've launched a subscription-looking business in a capital efficient way, that's a very powerful combination for value creation. You're going to grow organically, and you're not going to spend that much money on customer acquisitions relative to the return on that ad spend. Plus, investors like it a lot.
3. The next Microsoft didn’t look like Microsoft
A lot of people want to be the next of what was big last time. Yet, the next evolution often looks quite different. The next Microsoft was Google. The next Google was Facebook. The next Facebook probably won’t look anything like the social networks you are used to. The next $100 billion LVMH might look like Assembled Brands.
4. Focus less on the outcome
Adam’s advice for new startup founders is to really enjoy the process, and building deep and meaningful relationships, and be a little less focused on whatever the ultimate outcome is.
Life is too short to be miserable on the way, and how your startup ends up evolving could just be even better than the original goals you had.
The Evolution of Consciousness
Adam believes that every product in every category is being reinvented. People now care about what's inside of whatever they're consuming; what the contents are, where that comes from.
They care about the community around that product and the drive of people. People are interested in consuming local brands from all over the world that are best in the breed for whatever it is being sold. If he’s right about this evolution of consciousness, powered by the transparency of the internet, big incumbent conglomerates have a lot of work to do.

Whitney Biennial Offers 'Snapshot' Of American Contemporary Art Of America,www.forbes.com,Chadd Scott,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2019/05/26/whitney-biennial-offers-snapshot-of-american-contemporary-art-and-of-america/,"How do you know the curators of the Whitney Biennial , America’s most important gathering of contemporary art, have done a good job? By the criticism. According to critics, this Biennial is simultaneously political, not political enough, political, but possessing politics insufficiently radical–“a raised fist in an opera glove” according to The Wall Street Journal – political only under close inspection and superficially political.
The Whitney Biennial became synonymous with politics and the culture wars long before Trump took office and many critics were anticipating a full-frontal assault on his presidency. His direct image appears nowhere here. How often his influence can be felt beneath the surface rests on the viewer.
You can read critiques saying the Biennial has more painting than usual, not enough painting, that the paintings are inferior generally and that, “some (are) rather good.”
One critic complained anonymously to The Art Newspaper he couldn’t find anything to hate in the show.
In the completely subjective world of art, criticism as scattered and groping as that received by the Whitney Biennial, which opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York on May 17th, tells us the exhibit’s curators, Jane Panetta and Rujeko Hockley, hit the mark with their selection of works and artists.
“We were interested in work that was strong and resonant, but were also committed to including a broad range of artists who had not been part of previous Whitney Biennials,” Panetta and Hockley jointly responded when questioned by Forbes.com via email. “Understanding what a difficult moment it is for emerging artists, and accordingly what an important opportunity and platform the Biennial provides, we were really conscientious about this.”

Image courtesy the artist and James Fuentes Gallery, New York. Photograph by Jason Mandella Putting this exhibit together, the longest-running survey of American art, is a big job. An important job.
Panetta and Hockley not only serve as the two most important tastemakers in contemporary American art, their taste becomes codified by what goes on display. Inclusion in the prestigious Whitney Biennial defines careers–not only of the artists, theirs as well–and steers the art historical cannon.
It also serves as a time capsule.
“Each installment serves as a snapshot of art in the United States at a particular moment, which means that the exhibition as a whole holds a special place historically,” the curators said. “When we look back at past iterations, we are able to glean something unique about what was happening in not only American art at that time, but American culture and society at large.”
The Whitney Biennial dates back to 1937. Its almost 4,000 alumni include Edward Hopper, Georgia O’Keeffe , Jackson Pollack, Mark Rothko , Roy Lichtenstein, Ellsworth Kelly , Jean-Michel Basquiat and Jeff Koons, along with virtually every other American artist of major significance over the past 80 years.
More than half of the invitees to this year’s Biennial are women, minorities and under 40-years-old. The curators also leaned heavily on first time participants.
“A really wonderful aspect of putting together the Biennial was getting to travel to new places, meeting artists and our peers in the field across the country,” the curators said.
Panetta and Hockley conducted over 300 studio visits before selecting the 75 artists included in the show, a process which took “almost exactly a year” according to them.
Their job is to scour every nook and cranny of American art from high-profile, high-end, white-cube, New York galleries to ramshackle roadside stands in the rural South and say, “this is the best, that is not.”
No wonder it’s been called “the American art world’s most-argued-about event.”
A title befitting the Biennials’ prestige. If it didn’t matter so much, it wouldn’t be worth nitpicking.

Photograph by Brad Farwell “The exhibition is intentionally broad in scope, but it does explore key themes, including the mining of history as a means to reimagine the present or future, a consideration of questions of equity along financial, racial, and gender lines, and explorations of the vulnerability of the body,” the curators said. “Artists in the exhibition are also engaged with notions of community.”
The Whitney Biennials’ “community” is America and whether or not the nation’s current political climate induces a feeling of dread inside you, that’s not the mood the curators are going for. They are shooting for “hopeful.”

In Defense Of Wealthy Students Who Get Extra Time On The SAT,www.forbes.com,Christopher Rim,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherrim/2019/05/26/in-defense-of-wealthy-students-who-get-extra-time-on-the-sat/?ss=healthcare,"This week, the Wall Street Journal published an article detailing their analysis of over 9,000 public schools. They analyzed how many students in each district received “504” accommodations — special allowances for mental health reasons, especially extended time on tests due to attention and/or anxiety disorders. These numbers roughly correlate to the number of students getting extended time on the ACT and SAT, although getting extended time on these standardized tests is a separate process. The takeaway: that an increasing number of students are getting 504 accommodations and extended time on the ACT and SAT, and that a disproportionate number of these students are from wealthy school districts. This has understandably led to a backlash—the majority of respondents to the in-article poll called to eliminate extensions for all students or to tighten up rules for granting extensions. In the context of the recent college admissions scandal , this disparity smells of ‘snowplow parenting,’ and some parents involved in the scandal did seek extended time despite their children having no legitimate need for it. Still, I would argue that making these accommodations less accessible would lead to far more harm than good and, if anything, the accommodations should be easier to come by, not harder.
The most recent statistics (2015-2016) in the Wall Street Journal article indicate that 2.8% of students at public schools receive 504 accommodations. In wealthy schools, that number is 4.2%, while in poorer schools it’s only 1.6% of students. Compare those percentages to these: the CDC estimated that in 2016, 9.4% of children had ADHD, and 5.2% were taking ADHD medication. Nearly twice as many students are taking medication for ADHD than are receiving accommodations in school—so why are we assuming the issue is that wealthy students are over-diagnosed or getting accommodations for disorders they don’t have?
Now, I may be a bit biased as a professional in the education consulting industry that works with primarily high-income families (as well as a number of low-income students through our scholarships). However, the students I work with who do receive accommodations (not as many as you might think) have very obvious and real problems that impact their lives far beyond standardized tests. And yes, their backgrounds make them more likely to get diagnosed and treated—but that doesn’t delegitimize their struggles. A wealthy child with ADHD is still a child with ADHD and deserves treatment.
If you’re not convinced that wealthy students have legitimate diagnoses, you don’t have to take my word for it. Take a look at this New York Times article that shows a near-direct correlation between an area’s average income percentile and the number of mental health drugs purchased at area pharmacies. The article suggests that “richer patients are more likely to have private insurance or extra money to pay for psychiatric care that is not covered by insurance. And some people in lower-income communities may feel more stigma around mental health diagnoses.” Or consider how race is a factor as well—the authors of a prominent study examined the racial disparity in the diagnosis of ADHD and concluded that, rather than white children being over-diagnosed or over-treated for ADHD, the primary cause of the disparity was that African-American and Latino children are under-diagnosed and under-treated . I think it’s fair to argue that something similar is happening in terms of children in wealthy and poorer school districts.
So yes, wealthy students are more likely to get extended time on the SAT and ACT and on tests in school—because they’re more likely to get diagnosed with legitimate mental health disorders. Extended time on the SAT is not a zero-sum game: one student receiving accommodations doesn’t prevent another student from receiving the same accommodations. We should address this disparity, but not by eliminating accommodations or increasing the restrictions and requirements (something that will be more of a roadblock for under-resourced students than the wealthy, by the way). Instead, more should be done to increase the diagnosis, treatment, and accommodations for mental health disorders in underserved communities."
Why Trade Shows Are Still Important,www.forbes.com,Henry Devries,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/henrydevries/2019/05/26/why-trade-shows-are-still-important/,"If someone tells you trade shows are yesterday’s news, they are making a gross miscalculation. There are no bad marketing strategies. Everyone is unique, and everyone needs a mix that works for them. “All you need is online marketing” is one of the world’s three great lies (the other two are “This won’t hurt as much as you think” and “I’m from the government and I am here to help.”)
ADVERTISEMENT In marketing, the magic is in the mix. When I ranked marketing tactics during a ten-year lead generation study I conducted, networking at trade shows finished in the top five. The best marketing tactics are educational in nature, and a trade show let’s you educate prospects face to face (or “belly to belly,” as one of my mentors used to say).
According to statistics compiled by the website spingo.com, “The cost of a face-to-face meeting with a prospect at a trade show is $142. The cost of a face-to-face meeting at a prospect’s office is $259. By displaying at an expo, you find a much more cost-effective way to have face-to-face conversations with potential prospects.”
I had a phone chat with trade show expert Alice Heiman, co-founder of TradeShow Makeover, and asked her for the key to trade show success. She said one word, “Preparation.” Then she added some other great words.
“The key to success with any event is preparation and yet, it’s where people spend the least time and effort,” said Heiman. She explained that everyone prepares. “They think they have done all the prep needed but truly most of them have left out several important pieces.”
Here are six ways Heiman says that will lead to trade show success.
“Start planning early. Once the exhibit space has been purchased determine who will be the lead for the show and make a timeline that counts down what has to be done each week until the show.” “Research. Learn everything about the show, the speakers, exhibitors, attendees, topics, trends and anything to help you plan your messaging for email and conversations. Choose a thread you can use before, during and after the show that will be memorable. Best if you can show impact by tying what you do to an industry trend.” ADVERTISEMENT “Prepare all of the messaging. The messaging is based on the information found when you researched. The pre-show message, should flow into the show message which should flow into the post show message. Same with the images to go with your message. They should be memorable and match your online presence. The art on your emails and booth should match the art on your website so that people are not confused.” “Schedule appointments. Your team should contact customers and prospects and schedule appointments to meet during the show.” “Plan every detail of what your booth staff will do at the show. What will they wear, what is the schedule, what they should do when they are not in the booth? What questions will they ask? ” “Plan your follow up. Put time on your calendars to do the follow up and plan all of it in advance. After the show, sort the leads and give them out. Each team will have their follow up ready to go.” As obvious as these seem, Heiman says that most companies don’t do these basic things or “they don’t do them consistently and with rigor.”

Ranked: The Ten Countries With The Most Endangered Species In The World,www.forbes.com,Duncan Madden,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/duncanmadden/2019/05/26/ranked-the-ten-countries-with-the-most-endangered-species-in-the-world/,"It’s tough to argue with the fact that humankind is having a dramatic – and terrible – impact on the animal kingdom. Industry, pollution, agriculture, deforestation, air travel and decreasing habitats are conspiring to make it very hard for thousands of species to survive, let alone flourish. And that truth stretches to every corner of the world, be it forest, mountain, reef, ocean, city or savannah.
The hawksbill turtle is just one of more than 27,000 species listed as endangered and decreasing in population on the IUCN Red List.
Getty The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List has been the world’s foremost information source on the global conservation status of animal, fungi and plant species since 1964. It currently lists an astounding 27,000 species as at risk of extinction, which is an even more astounding 27% of all species we currently know about. That means more than a quarter of all species are threatened with going the way of the dodo.
Broken down by species, the IUCN details 40% of all amphibians are at risk, followed by 34% of conifers, 33% of reef corals, 31% of sharks and rays, 27% of crustaceans, 25% of mammals and 14% of birds.
40% of all amphibians are at risk, including the tiger leg monkey tree frog.
Getty A critical indicator of the health of the world’s biodiversity – and so the health of the world as a whole – this data has been broken down by Alpha Travel Insurance to establish the countries with the highest number of endangered species, as well as those with the most amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles at risk of extinction.
I’ll warn you now, it makes for depressing reading. But if you’re a wildlife lover interested in conservation and preservation by actively helping stem the tide, or merely wish to tick off a bucket list animal before it becomes too protected or too rare, this ranking of the top ten endangered species countries might help you decide where to visit next.
Mexico's ongoing and excessive deforestation has propelled it to the top of the endangered species list.
Getty Taking the top spot no one wants is Mexico with 665 endangered species. Broken down, that includes 71 bird species, 96 mammals, 98 reptiles, 181 fish and 219 amphibians. This is largely put down to the massive deforestation program Mexico has embarked on (it has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world ) to accommodate agricultural land that can cater to its ever increasing food demands. It’s estimated the country will need to double its food production by 2050 to keep up with a burgeoning population.
Indonesia's extraordinarily abundant and diverse wildlife is particularly fragile thanks to the nation's minimal landmass.
Getty Indonesia takes second spot with 583 endangered species but has the highest number of endangered mammals with 191 species listed and the second highest number of endangered birds with 160 listed. Particularly catastrophic, Indonesia occupies just 1% of the world’s landmass yet 12% of the world’s known mammal species and 17% of bird species are indigenous – a level of biodiversity matched by few other countries that makes it hugely susceptible to the smallest climate shifts.
Of the continents it’s perhaps unsurprising that Asia is home to the most endangered species, with 3,330 at risk across 10 countries.
Sadly, the USA also appears in the top ten, occupying sixth spot. Despite its robust (if at risk under current governance) wildlife conservation program, it’s still home to 475 species on the endangered list.
America's enormous commercial fishing industry is a big factor in it taking top spot for the number of endangered fish species.
Getty This is primarily down to the number of endangered fish, where it has the most globally at 251 species. Look at the numbers and you soon see why though – the US has the fifth largest fisheries harvest in the world with more than five million caught annually. It’s the fourth biggest fish and seafood exporter globally, shipping more than $5 billion worth a year. Clearly, these kind of levels are not sustainable.
Here then are the top 10 countries with the most endangered species

LaFleur-Rodgers Marriage The No. 1 Key To Packers' 2019 Season,www.forbes.com,Rob Reischel,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2019/05/26/lafleur-rodgers-marriage-the-no-1-key-to-packers-2019-season/,"Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has never been a natural fit with many Wisconsinites. Rodgers is California cool. The last person from Wisconsin described as cool was “The Fonz”, and that was on a fictional sitcom more than four decades ago.
Rodgers doesn’t eat cheese or dairy. On the flip side, Wisconsin produces more cheese than any state in the country (27%).
And folks from the Badger state take a strange pride in the fact they consume more beer than anywhere else in America. Rodgers, on the other hand, was butchered on social media — and across the state — last week after his feeble attempt to slam a beer at a Milwaukee Bucks playoff game.
At the end of the day, though, it’s irrelevant whether Rodgers “fits” in those random categories. What matters now is that Rodgers fits with Matt LaFleur, his new head coach.
Green Bay has gone just 13-18-1 in the last two seasons (.422), including 6-9-1 in 2018. A big reason for that was the dysfunction that existed between Rodgers and former head coach Mike McCarthy.
Rodgers didn’t buy into an offense he believed had grown stale, and simply ignored McCarthy’s play calls at times. Packers president Mark Murphy sided with Rodgers, fired McCarthy late in the 2018 season, and hired LaFleur in early January.
If Green Bay is going to become relevant again, Rodgers has to buy what LaFleur is selling. To date, both men say, “so far, so good.”
“I think it’s going great, man,” LaFleur said during Green Bay’s organized team activities last week. “He’s fun to be around. You can see how much fun he has out on that field, but we’ve had a lot of good conversations and I think we’re growing together. The more time that we can spend together, I think we’ll have a better feel for each other. Certainly it’s been a lot of fun up to this point.”
Rodgers agreed with his new coach.
“We’re constantly communicating,” Rodgers said. “I’m not worried about the development of the relationship. It’s going to naturally get to where it needs to go.”
The 39-year-old LaFleur doesn't have a lengthy track record of success. So in many ways, the Packers — and Rodgers — must take a leap of faith believing LaFleur can help Green Bay’s offense return to greatness.
LaFleur was a non-play calling offensive coordinator with Sean McVay and the Los Angeles Rams in 2017, a year the Rams led the league in points per game (29.9). LaFleur became Tennessee’s offensive coordinator in 2018 and had total control of the offense, but the Titans finished 25 th in total offense (312.4), 27 th in scoring offense (19.4) and 29 th in passing offense (185.9).
Prior to that, LaFleur was an offensive assistant in Houston in 2008 under coach Gary Kubiak and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan. In 2010, LaFleur began a four-year stint as quarterbacks coach in Washington under Mike Shanahan where he worked with players such as Donovan McNabb, Robert Griffin III and Kirk Cousins.
After spending the 2014 season coaching quarterbacks at Notre Dame, LaFleur was hired as Atlanta’s quarterbacks coach in 2015. The following year, Falcons’ quarterback Matt Ryan won the MVP and Atlanta reached the Super Bowl.
Today, LaFleur is installing an offense that’s worked at his previous stops, and making sure his quarterback is on the same page every step of the way.
“His system, it works,” Rodgers said of LaFleur. “It’s worked in L.A. It worked in Washington. It worked in Atlanta. It works in San Fran, we saw that last year against us. It’s a copycat league. There’s a lot of the same concepts. It just comes down to matching up that up terminology wise and trying to figure out what I’m doing first so I can start to help the other guys.”
Rodgers won't have the same pre-snap freedoms he did under McCarthy. But he will be given his fair share of decision making power.
Earlier this offseason, LaFleur told reporters that roughly 20% of the time he will send in two plays — something he calls ‘cans.’ Rodgers will then have the option of calling either play based on what he sees from the defense.
“Depending on the coverage or maybe it’s front-driven, where he’ll – we call them ‘cans’ – and you’ll see him where he’ll ‘can’ to the other play,” LaFleur said. “That’s always been a part of our offense – the offenses that I’ve been a part of, especially more in the last four years. It’s about trying to maximize your plays and try to get to premium-opportunity plays.
“It’s about putting our guys in the best position to have success. That’s going to be a big part of our offense moving forward.”
That element of the offense certainly seemed to excite Rodgers.
“I think it’s an offense that I can infuse creativity and put my stamp on,” Rodgers said.
For the first time since McCarthy arrived in 2006, Rodgers has a new offense to learn. It’s meant less time on the golf course — and more time with his IPad — in May.
There’s a cautious optimism throughout Packer Nation that the LaFleur-Rodgers marriage can succeed, and Green Bay can reach one more Super Bowl before its future Hall of Fame quarterback calls it a career. That optimism is also curtailed, though, by the fact many now view Rodgers as a “coach killer” after what happened to McCarthy.
“I can’t say I’m an expert of this offense at this point,” Rodgers said. “It’s going to be a work in progress throughout the OTAs and minicamp. But it’s been a fun challenge to study more in the offseason.
“I’m spending time watching my iPad, studying my iPad at night, studying my notes and trying to come in here prepared every day because it’s important that I can lead from an aptitude standpoint with the offense even if I still don’t understand the intricacies of certain reads or concepts, being able to get guys lined up in the right spot is an important part of my job.”
So is fitting with his head coach.
Whether or not that happens will be fascinating viewing in Green Bay this season."

Recessions Start When No One Sees Them Coming,www.forbes.com,Chuck Jones,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/05/26/recessions-start-when-no-one-sees-them-coming/,"Pretty much no economist or organization includes recessions in their forecasts. When have you seen more than a handful of economists, stock market strategists or government agencies project the economy shrinking for two quarters in a row? ADVERTISEMENT Late last year there was a lot of speculation that the U.S. economy could enter a recession sooner rather than later, which helped the Dow Jones Industrials and the S&P 500 fall 19% and 20%, respectively. Starting early this year these fears subsided, which has helped these markets rise 10% and 13%, respectively, year to date.
While the March quarter’s reported 3.2% GDP growth was stronger than expected, the underlying growth components did not show a robust economy . The report helped mitigate any talk about a slowdown, but recessions can seemingly materialize from almost nowhere.
Recession's lead times
Taking a look at a recession's “lead time” is worthwhile to keep in mind. Since the business cycle has not been repealed but is probably only in hibernation, using a chart from the Cleveland Federal Reserve to keep an eye out for a slowing economy is worthwhile.
As of the end of April the chart only has the odds of a recession at 13% but growing to 31% a year from now. If the chart’s outlook is correct, then reaching 30% or higher has tended to lead to a recession. The odds don’t even have to get to 50% for the likelihood for a recession to occur.
Probability of Recession Calculated from the Yield Curve
Bureau of Economic Analysis, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Haver Analytics Recession probability chart
There will always be a few pundits that are calling for a recession, but a good number of them continuously do it, which makes them “calling it” not quite worthwhile. The last two recessions are good examples. There was the tech bubble burst that started in 2000, and the housing market collapse leading to the Great Recession in 2008. In both these instances the economy seemed to be in good shape but suddenly turn downward.
ADVERTISEMENT The St. Louis Federal Reserve also publishes a probabilities chart of the U.S. going into a recession. What is very interesting about this chart is it shows the likelihood of an economic downturn can occur when very few are expecting one and that it can start in a manner of a few months. The chart goes back to 1967 and shows the 7 recessions that have occurred since then.
Smoothed U.S. Recession Probabilities
Piger, Jeremy Max and Federal Reserve of St. Louis The St. Louis Federal Reserve website describes the chart, “As the graph above shows, their forecasting method’s past performance is impressive; the predicted recession dates align well with the official NBER recession dates. Of course, it is difficult to compute any forecast in a timely fashion: One has to wait for the appropriate data to be released, and only then can one compute the forecast. In this case, that translates into a delay of about three months.”
The chart’s probabilities are obtained from, “four monthly coincident variables: non-farm payroll employment, the index of industrial production, real personal income excluding transfer payments, and real manufacturing and trade sales.” It appears that over the past 52 years and 7 recessions, that once the probability has passed 20% there has been a recession. Below are the probabilities of the 7 recessions showing that there has typically been around a 6 month lead time from very low odds to reaching a recession.
ADVERTISEMENT August 1969 0.4%
September 1969 4%
January 1970 55% (5 month lag from August)
October 1970 85%
November 1973 0.4%
December 1973 20%
January 1974 26%

November 1974 100% (12 month lag from previous November)
October 1979 2%
December 1979 4%
January 1980 7%
April 1980 100% (6 month lag from October)
ADVERTISEMENT July 1981 3%
August 1981 39%
November 1981 96% (4 month lag from July)
May 1990 1%
August 1990 15%
November 1990 63% (6 month lag from May)
ADVERTISEMENT September 2000 2%
January 2001 19%
April 2001 32% (7 month lag from April)
November 2007 3%
December 2007 10%
February 2008 45% (3 month lag from November)
May 2008 82% (6 month lag from November)
ADVERTISEMENT August 2008 100%
March 2019 2% (the latest reading)
So while the current reading is very low, this is far from being a guarantee that a recession could not occur in a short timeframe. Given the uncertainty created by trade tensions with China along with the positive impacts from inventory and trade reversing, the economy could easily experience one and potentially two quarters of negative growth."

"From Bernie To Warren, Democrats Yet To Successfully Explain Medicare For All",www.forbes.com,Bruce Japsen,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/05/26/from-bernie-to-warren-democrats-yet-to-successfully-explain-medicare-for-all/?ss=healthcare,"Even with two dozen Democrats running for President and most touting an expansion of Medicare benefits to everybody, the public is still unclear how a national single payer health plan like “Medicare for All” will benefit them. ADVERTISEMENT A briefing from experts at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation for health reporters last week revealed there are five general approaches to expanding coverage involving public plans.
Within those approaches are 10 national plans introduced in Congress that include everything from a single payer version of Medicare for All that would uproot private coverage to a “public program with an opt out” that would be offered along side commercial coverage. Other plans would allow Americans to buy into Medicare as young as 50 years old or buy into Medicaid coverage for the poor.
But no matter the effort to expand health insurance coverage, much is to be done to educate the public at large even as single payer supporters like Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris push Medicare for All on the campaign trail.
“Our polling shows some Americans are unaware of how the implementation of a national health plan could impact them,” said Mollyann Brodie , Kaiser’s senior vice president and executive director, public opinion and survey research. “For example, many people (55%) falsely assume that would be able to keep their current health insurance under a single-payer plan.”
Democrats on the campaign trail hoping to challenge President Donald Trump should Republicans nominate him to run for re-election in 2020 see rising support for a national health plan that would make the government the only insurance carrier.
Kaiser data shows 56% favor a national health plan “in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan.” Just 40% favored such a national health plan 20 years ago, Kaiser data shows.
ADVERTISEMENT “Our polls have shown a modest increase in support for the idea of a national health plan,” Kaiser’s Medicare for All presentation showed. Some of these health insurance expansions would be single payer versions of “Medicare for All’ like that proposed by Sanders in the U.S. Senate and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) in the U.S. House of Representatives that would uproot private coverage and replace it with government run Medicare.
Five different approaches introduced in Congress to expanding healthcare coverage involving public plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation ""Medicare-for-all"" Web Briefing. May 21, 2019
Kaiser Family Foundation Other public approaches would involve a “public program with an opt out” known as Medicare for America or a “Medicare Buy in” like that proposed by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan). Other public plans would involve a so-called “federal public plan option” that would be offered along side commercial coverage on a government exchange and there are also Medicaid buy-in proposals being floated in a number of states.

Getty Images ADVERTISEMENT Politically, the lack of knowledge of Medicare for All and public option proposals offers opportunities for both Democrats who favor Medicare for All and Republicans who want to derail a government expansion of health benefits, particular an approach that would essentially replace much of the private system.
""As the public learns more about the implications of each of these proposals, support may increase or decrease,” Kaiser’s Brodie said."
4 Reasons People Fear Science,www.forbes.com,Marshall Shepherd,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2019/05/26/4-reasons-people-fear-science/,"Random things inspire what I write in Forbes Science - current events, extraordinary weather, or the need to debunk bad science. However, the inspiration for this piece was a conversation with a man while sipping Pinot Grigio and munching on lobster cakes at a fancy reception. The conversation began with a very common question that I receive as an atmospheric scientist, ""Do you believe in climate change?"" My answer was the usual, ""science is not a belief system"" followed by a deeper explanation. The conversation circled around to faith. I shared that I saw no inherent conflict between my faith and science. The conversation was interrupted so I really couldn't tell where it was going. However, one topic prompted me to write about what I perceive to be fear of science. Here are four reasons why I believe people might fear science.
An example of robot
CDC A perception of conflict with faith beliefs. As a climate scientist, I often hear statements like it is blasphemous to think humankind can alter weather or climate. I quickly point out air pollution, destruction of the Ozone Hole by chemical products, urban heat islands, and so on. I grew up in a small African-American Baptist church in Canton, Georgia. As a child, I put up a fight about going to Sunday service. Later in life, I actually ended up teaching a class on discipleship. My faith walk is personal and likely different from yours. I respect whatever faith, belief system, or perspective you hold. Increasingly, the scientific method, verified data, and scholarly publications are at odds with what people believe. In a recent TED Talk, I discussed three things that shape perceptions toward science. Biases associated with our ""personal marinades"" are strong. What are personal marinades? - How we were raised, where we were raised, our faith-based upbringing, political alignment, and our circle of peers. Each of these is important and life-shaping. However, none of them should fundamentally be used to undermine science.
It can be hard. Science, technology, math, and engineering (STEM) careers are projected to be the major job base of the future. Even with the prospect of a fertile job market in STEM, many students avoid science. From my lens as a scientist, professor, and parent, I observe that students fear the rigor of science, the prospect of it lowering their grade point average, and the real possibility of it placing lucrative scholarships at risk. For example, a study in the Southern Economic Journal found that students in STEM related collegiate majors were 21 to 51 percent more likely to lose grade-based scholarships than other disciplines. Many states and organizations have recognized this and are now weighting STEM courses. A recent book entitled, "" Student Attitudes, Student Anxieties, and How to Address Them: A handbook for science teachers"" argued that students also bring preconceptions to the classroom about science. They may perceive it is as cold, hostile, or even biased toward certain groups. Many students (and parents) also suffer from "" science anxiety ."" I am always concerned when I hear a parent say, ""I am not a science person nor is my kid."" Such statements train the child to succumb to parental insecurities or biases while setting up a self-fulfilling prophecy. Art Hobson provides some recommendations for overcoming science anxiety in APS News.
If I do not understand it, dispute it . An experience is forever etched in my head. One day at a barbershop I was explaining how much of the summertime rainfall in Georgia actually starts out as snowfall (ice crystals) in the rainclouds . The barbers and some patrons laughed and ridiculed me. As a reminder, I am professor and director of an atmospheric sciences program at a major university and spent 12 years as a research meteorologist at NASA. I sensed that they didn't understand the science so chose to believe that it was not true. I see this through out the landscape of pervasive denialism or skepticism. There are still a lot of people who do not believe astronauts landed on the moon. However, science denial may be more complicated than we think. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation supported a conference in 2018 entitled Science Denial: Lessons and Solutions. Kari Fischer, one of the conference organizers, summarized 6 takeaways from the conference in The Scientist, and some of them may be surprising. My summary of Fischer's takeaways :
The use of the word ""denier"" leads people to dig in more, and confirmation bias (cherry-picking what we already believe) is a powerful motivator. Scientists need to be sure they have checked themselves, the data, and motivations before engaging with others. Listen to those that challenge you and understand that their core values or stories may resonate more with them than a bunch of data and graphs. Relevancy is key when talking beyond your science peer group. For example, climate change impacts on the price of cereal may resonate more than discussions about polar bears. Develop a sense of trust. Remember who you are as scientists. Resist the urge to play ""twitter tennis"" (Back and forth) with trolls but try not to ridicule those that ""don't believe."" Almost 3 years ago, I wrote in Forbes about 9 tips for communicating science to non-scientists. Many of them are quite consistent with this list.
Our own relevance: This last reason is speculative, but I was in a conversation with friends recently about self-checkout systems and self-driving cars. Concerns about automation affecting jobs and opportunity are real and should not be ignored. CNBC reported that 25% of jobs, particularly repetitive functions, are at high risk of automation. One comment that I overheard in the discussion is whether robots will replace us. In that statement, I wondered if part of the fear or skepticism held by some people about science is related to self-preservation.
Agricultural productivity is threatened by climate change.

Fortnite Fortbyte #32 Location: 'Accessible By Wearing Kyo Pet Back Bling At The Northernmost Point',www.forbes.com,Dave Thier,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/05/26/fortnite-fortbyte-32-location-accessible-by-wearing-kyo-pet-back-bling-at-the-northernmost-point/,"Time for another Fortbyte! Like clockwork now that we're fully into Season 9, a little daily ritual of exploring the Fortnite map. Yesterday saw us at a track-side taco shop, visiting one of the older unnamed points of interest on the map, albeit one that saw a significant revamp in Season 5. This one requires you to have gotten a little more into the battle pass than some previous ones: we've had to use battle pass items before, but they've all been from pretty early on. Read on for a map, guide and location for Fortbyte #32: ""accessible by wearing Kyo Pet back bling at the northernmost point"". First off, we'll want to know where we're going. The northernmost point was used in a Season 8 challenge that had players visiting the directional extremes of the map, and it's not that hard to figure out on you're own: just look at the map and try to see what part sticks up the most. You're heading to the northwestern part of the map, due north from the TV studio east of Junk Junction. Here's what it looks like on the map:

Once down there, you will of course need the Kyo Pet back bling, which you get from Tier 28 of the battle pass. I like this little fellow: I tend to like things that can give you some strong contrast with the game's more serious skins, and I've taken to using Kyo with an all-black Blackheart skin for a little pop of color. The objectively best pet is always going to be the gingerbread man, but this one is pretty excellent as well.
The northernmost point is marked by a little sign, so it's hard to miss. The Fortbyte is in a little rock formation to the left, and here's what it looks like on the ground:
Fortnite
Credit: Epic Games So long as you're wearing the Kyo Pet back bling, this will unlock right away and give you one more Fortbyte. This isn't a bad area of the map from which to start a match, either: there's plenty of loot and it's usually fairly depopulated. Also, you've got access to a quadcrasher and driftboard for when you want to zip on down to the circle, which is admittedly usually pretty far away."
The Power Of Purpose: How Thank You Is Empowering Humanity To Choose A World Without Poverty,www.forbes.com,Afdhel Aziz,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/afdhelaziz/2019/05/26/the-power-of-purpose-how-thank-you-is-empowering-humanity-to-choose-a-world-without-poverty/,"Walking into the Melbourne offices of pioneering Australian social enterprise brand Thankyou, you are immediately struck by the good energy humming in the space. A young, diverse team of people are toiling away beneath pictures of the people around the world they are affecting with their work. A giant chalkboard shows the results they are driving: Over $6.2 million to people in need, safe water and sanitation to 500,000, maternal and child health services to 183,000, and many more results to date. But the journey of Thankyou's humble and introspective co-founder Daniel Flynn started in a very different place: in tears, sitting in the docklands of Melbourne as he realized that great disparity between the wealth that surrounded him and the enormous problem of global poverty. "" I'd gone on this journey of really discovering extreme poverty–stories of kids online losing brothers and sisters to waterborne disease. And yet I find myself sitting here in the Docklands in Melbourne and the reason I'm moved to tears is that I had this moment of going 'that yacht there is a $3 million boat, that apartment up there is like $5 million. I'm sitting there going, 'the money's already here.' There is so much money in consumerism and yet we have this extreme poverty and I suppose the feeling was I've just got to find a way to connect this better.""
The Thankuou offices in Melbourne
Thank You Thankyou's goal is to help end extreme poverty by 2030 and their purpose statement reflects that ambitious goal. ""Our purpose is 'empowering humanity to choose a world without poverty.' I think we've taken a long time to develop it. It captures the essence of who we are and it is definitely the hope and the belief. So that purpose is aspirational and we have a plan to get there, but we really see this as an idea that really does empower humanity today, in Australia and New Zealand but hopefully in the future in America across Europe and Asia. This is a universal product idea."" Taking this purpose as a guiding principle, Flynn and his cofounders his then-girlfriend (now wife) Justine Flynn, and his best mate Jarryd Burns, launched in Australia with a unique approach to getting their brand in stores: leveraging the power of their fans and social media to get major retailers like Coles and Woolworths to stock their products. Their fanbase embraced the challenge to such an extent that a couple of helicopter pilots took it upon themselves to fly banners over the head offices of the retailers, leading them to be successfully stocked there.
But in addition to enthusiastic fans, another huge part of Thankyou's success has been their attention to creating a great product and a great brand, with beautiful, minimal aesthetics. ""It comes from a great book ""Do purpose"" which says 'Rule number one, make a great product. Rule Number two, never break rule one. There's a little asterisk above rule one and the fine print just says, 'never use a good cause to sell an average product.' And that is the mantra at Thankyou,"" said Flynn. Their thoughtfulness extends to innovations like a unique Tracker ID on each Thankyou product to see the exact details of the project your product is assigned to fund.
Part of the Thankyou range
Thank You Another fantastic idea from this amazingly innovative brand was the launch of their first book Chapter One with a unique ""Pay what you want"" model and all proceeds going into funding the next stage of the companies growth. ""The book has worked beyond expectation. Part of it was we wanted to get our story in as many in people's hands but we also wanted to raise money because we do have at own self-inflicted problem of raising funds because we don't have any shareholders, we don't have any investors. We're not changing our 100% model. It's awesome. But it does create this funding gap and that the idea was, well Thankyou has been built by people the whole way along and people have solved our greatest problems like getting stocked in the supermarkets. And so we thought what if 'we, the people' could help solve that issue of funding?"" The book blew past the initial goal of selling 80,000 copies, going on to sell 124,000 copies to date, and raising over $ 2.5 million that went toward the launch of their Thankyou Baby line, and their subsequent expansion into New Zealand.
Flynn believes that this is because the brand created a space for their fans to be participants in their journey. ""I think people innately love story but we also love being part of the story and feel like we're contributing our little piece to a bigger story. I think what Chapter One does is that it's an invitation to all of us to go, what part can I play?"" In fact, Flynn reflects on whether the bigger impact of Thankyou may be the inspiration it has been for others to find their own purpose. ""Part of me wonders whether our biggest impact will actually be measurable, whether it will be the effect of other people in organizations seeing some of what we've done and then likely doing it better themselves and beyond."" Flynn has parting words of advice for anyone seeking to create their own social enterprise.""Don't fall into the illusion that the 'enterprise' part will be easy because of the social impact. In fact, the social element can create complexity that the average enterprise may have not have. But it is rewarding, it is satisfying. It is not easy, but it's important. So if that's your dream and vision, chase it, go hard."""

(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/WireImage for Pepsi) Getty While he may be a new artist, Lewis Capaldi had no issue grabbing not only the top spot on the U.K. albums ranking with his debut full-length this week, but he also snagged the largest opening frame of 2019 in the country. The musician’s first studio album Divinely Uninspired to A Hellish Extent opens at No. 1 with just under 90,000 equivalent units, a huge sum for the nation.
Divinely Uninspired to A Hellish Extent is one of half a dozen newly-released titles that kick off their time on the tally inside the top 10, refreshing the highest tier almost completely.
New at No. 2 are American alternative rockers The National, who grab a fourth top 10 with their album I Am Easy to Find . The band’s last four albums have all made it into the top five, including their most recent collection, Sleep Well Beast , which topped the chart in 2017.
After over two decades together, German rock band Rammstein have finally broken into the uppermost region on the chart. The group’s new untitled effort lands at No. 3, easily eclipsing their No. 16 high point on the albums list. One song from the new release, ""Deutschland,"" peaked at No. 98 for a single week, and though that’s not a very impressive ranking, it became the band’s first charting hit in a decade when it was released.
Rapper Tyler, the Creator has enjoyed a steady rise on the U.K. albums chart, as every new album he releases establishes a new best showing he’s previously never achieved, and he continues the trend this time around. Igor , the musician’s fifth proper album, debuts at No. 4, becoming his first top five and his second top 10. He made his first appearance inside the top 10 in 2017 with his acclaimed record Flower Boy , which made it to No. 9.
Down from second to fifth, pushed out of the passenger seat by several new titles, is Billie Eilish’s When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? , which hasn’t fallen far from the top since it debuted there several weeks back."
The Buffs ‘Destiny 2’ Needs For Season Of Opulence,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/05/26/the-buffs-destiny-2-needs-for-season-of-opulence/,"Destiny 2 Bungie Bungie has already hit us with the bad news when it comes to sandbox changes in Season of Opulence, a series of nerfs to the most popular exotics in the game. I’m not here to rehash whether those changes are good or bad (most are bad, a couple are needed), but we know that we are hearing about at least some kinds of buffs headed to the game to offset these nerfs to at least a little extent. Thursday is when we’ll start hearing specifics, but I wanted to chime in before then.
One thing I’m not going to do is go through every single underused or underpowered exotic that needs a buff. There are just…way, way too many right now, and literally 90% of exotic armor isn’t strong enough to be chosen over the super-regen collection of Rigs, Shards, Skull, and a few others, and that may be true even after the nerfs outside of a few exceptions like Lunafaction or Stomps. The same could be said of weapons to a lesser extent, but I feel like there are at least situational uses for a wider range of exotic weapons in the current state of the game, while exotic armor has felt much more limiting. There should be buffs to a bunch of armor and weapon exotics, don’t get me wrong, but I just don’t have time to make an entire list made up purely of suggestions for those.
So what should be buffed? I’m talking more about general categories here.
Swords
Remember swords? Barely, at this point, as you will almost never find an occasion to use them in the heavy slot over anything else that goes there, and the last time I used one was to help me with jump puzzles as a Hunter in the Outbreak quest.
While swords have always been power weapons, it’s clear they don’t need to stay that way. It seems more than viable to move swords into the energy slot when they are essentially just an alternate to shotguns in many ways. There is currently no reason for them to take up the massively important power slot, and this is a situation where you could actually buff something without literally buffing it simply by moving it and making it more accessible. Destiny 2 Bungie
Scouts
Bungie has already buffed scouts a couple of times, and yet they are still not where they need to be. There are a few strong ones that stand out like Polaris Lance, but overall? I feel like we’ve never been back to the glory days of MIDA or Hung Jury in D1 or the original Nameless Midnight in D2.
Bows are essentially now better versions of scouts with their big damage, aim assist and no damage drop off. To compete against both them and pulse rifles, scouts need to be improved even further.
Snipers
Snipers are still improving in D2, and while they’re better now than they were previously, there’s still some work to be done. I think everyone misses more options for short scope snipers, as these hyper zoom options are just almost never worthwhile in the context of a game constantly pelting you with so much flinch. Destiny 2 Bungie
Hand Cannon Bloom
This is a specific problem to a limited class of hand cannons and mainly to console, but it’s something that Bungie seems allergic to fixing. Thorn-style hand cannons have too much bloom to be all that useful on console, which is why players have turned to so few HC alternatives like Service Revolver, Trust or Luna’s/NF. Only a few hand cannons feel like they function like they’re supposed to, and bloom is largely to blame.
Bottom Tree Nightstalker
Bungie has been slowly buffing a number of subclasses in the game, especially old ones, but I believe that bottom tree Nightstalker remains one of the least used classes in the game with its multi-shot tether that doesn’t work with Rigs and doesn’t offer any additional benefits. This needs some major buffs or a total rework.
Code of the Missile
For some reason, Code of the Missile was ignored during all the Arc Week buffs even though the coolest looking Titan class is badly in need of some buffs, particularly the boss damage of its signature move which feels more like shooting a T-shirt cannon at bigger enemies rather than striking them with a missile.
Those are the major categories I wanted to touch on for now outside of exotics. Maybe I will get to those at some point but man, there are so many it’s hard to know where to start, and some just seem conceptually impossible to make good (looking at you, Aeon Cult). More to come.

Why Debt Isn't Killing Netflix Any Time Soon,www.forbes.com,Stephanie Denning,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniedenning/2019/05/26/why-debt-isnt-killing-netflix/,"A recent Wall Street Journal article , "" No Reason for Netflix Investors to Chill,"" is another piece among many claiming that Netflix's reliance on debt is problematic for the company. Netflix detractors often cite the debt the company has accumulated as a key reason the company isn't well-positioned for long-term success. Its reliance, the argument goes, on credit markets as its capital of choice to fund its business is a risky move and potentially a bad strategy.
Creating content is a capital-intensive business; to create more content Netflix will have to continue to borrow, digging itself deeper into a cash-constrained hole. And debt, many argue, is only exacerbating this problem.
As it happens, I had been researching a piece on this very topic.
The Cash Concern
Let me start by confirming that the cash concern is real. Content might be king in media, but cash is king in business. Cash is the lifeblood of any company. And Netflix blazes through cash like a wind-backed fire. In 2019, Netflix is expected to generate a cash loss of $3.5 billion. The driver of its cash problem is hefty content costs. Assuming Netflix content continues to attract more subscribers, all should be well and good. The concern is if it stops growing, it won't be able to meet its debt obligations and it will quickly throw the company into bankruptcy.
When critics complain about Netflix's cash problem they often conflate it with leverage. Content businesses require large capital infusions to create the content. And Netflix, like most companies, spends an inordinate amount on content. There are different ways to fund it and Netflix has incurred a lot of wrath for choosing to fund its capital needs using debt.
But it's worth noting that the credit market isn't concerned. To understand why, we have to look at the whole strategic picture.
Netflix's Capital Efficiency
Netflix's d ebt to equity ratio has been increasing since 2015, reaching 1.81 in Q1 of 2019. Is that a bad thing?
I n its most basic form, debt is the ability to get access to money you wouldn't otherwise have, invest it in something, and come out the other end with more than you would have been able to produce in a debt-free world. Done right, debt is a powerful tool. And taking on debt strategically, in the long run, is better for shareholders.
Financial indicators signal that Netflix is leveraging its capital efficiently. Netflix has increased its return on invested capital since 2017. Compared to competitors, Netflix's ROE is also performing well, an indicator of a company's long-term health and the effectiveness of its current operating structure to generate cash. And i n 2018, it ended the year with a 10% operating margin compared to 7% one year earlier – the primary driver of which was increased revenue.
Optimizing Capital Structure
Netflix chooses to finance its business with more debt to optimize its cost of capital. And, frankly, that's already saying a lot since many businesses don't know or care to calculate their cost of capital.
A s mentioned above, content costs make Netflix a high capex business. Like the capex of any other industry, it serves as a barrier to entry. Netflix spent ~$13.04 billion on content in 2018. In 2018, it expensed $9.97 billion. The ~$3 billion or so difference can be categorized as capex.
As Netflix looks forward to the high capital requirements needed to continue to grow its business, it has to continue to choose financing according to its cost of capital. And Netflix has chosen to finance its content investments both by operating profits and the remaining needs with debt.
Netflix explicitly states that "" in optimizing our balance sheet, we strive for the capital structure that results in the lowest weighted average cost of capital. Given low interest rates, the tax deductibility of debt and our low debt to enterprise value, financing growth through the debt market is currently more efficient than issuing equity.""
A High Fixed-Cost Business
This leads us to perhaps the most important point: the moat Netflix is in the midst of building. The WSJ article states: ""I t is a treadmill that is difficult to get off of. If new content helps gain subscribers, then logically cutting spending, and content, risks losing them too."" What this fails to account for is the fact that Netflix's content is a fixed cost. Like any high fixed cost business, it incurs more costs than incoming revenue until revenue growth eventually tips the scale. The underlying structure of a high fixed cost business model is a volume play – which Netflix is aggressively pursuing.
That shift may be underway. As of 2020, while still negative, free cash flow is expected to improve. As operating margin and profits improve, so will working capital needs. And the way I read their financials, I expect that to be the start of the inflection point.
Digging A Competitive Moat
A high fixed cost acts as a barrier to entry for other businesses trying to enter the space – and in VOD there are many. With TV the last bastion of media revenue as other revenue sources have collapsed, more and more players are trying to tap into the rare alternatives for growth.
The capital Netflix is willing to spend on content compared to its competitors will not only accelerate but also widen the moat Netflix is building. This is why Netflix's business model can't be replicated by other media companies vying for a bite of SVOD. Netflix should be working to maximize subscriber growth.
While I won't dismiss the imperative for Netflix to get cash under control – one speculated reason behind the recent hire of their CFO – I don't believe you can judge Netflix's performance with that metric in isolation. It is critical to look at how Netflix is using its resources within the context of the rest of its strategy and business. If Netflix has proved anything, it's that it's a data-driven company. And if it has made a specific, albeit unpopular, financial choice, we can almost be certain there is a compelling reason behind it."

Ancient Greek Sandals Following graduation, I began work as a product manager within a luxury Italian factory that produced pieces for Chloé and Sonia Rykiel, and it was here that I met the shoe designer, at the time, of Louis Vuitton at the time. He offered me a job as his design assistant at his studio in Paris, and I worked with him for the next 6 years. In 2008, I then moved to Balenciaga for a further two years, before moving back to Greece to set up Ancient Greek Sandals.

Ancient Greek Sandals I would also say that working with a sales agency, Rainbowwave has been instrumental in helping the brand to grow. The team worked closely with us to formulate a growth strategy that was both ambitious and attainable, and we have been lucky enough to achieve global distribution within some of the best retailers worldwide.
2019 is also a pivotal year for Ancient Greek Sandals, as we are working towards the opening of our first store in Athens [opening on the 30th May], which I hope will have a really positive impact on the brand.

Nevertheless, we work as a team, consulting each other and our colleagues regarding all aspects of the business.
Nikolas Minoglou: I give Christina full design control, and focus my attention on the business elements. I work closely with Rainbowwave to manage the global distribution of the brand, as well as working closely with the production team in Athens to ensure deadlines are met and deliveries are streamlined. I’m based in Athens, where our headquarters are based, and manage the team from there.
Ancient Greek Sandals Spring/Summer '19 collection
Ancient Greek Sandals FC: Tell us about your design process...
CM: For me, the most important, and more difficult part of the design process is the initial concepts for each collection. This requires a lot of research into what it is that people will be interested in investing in. Then taking these ideas and turning them into footwear that stays true to our aesthetic. For example, previous collections have been inspired by varied inspirations including myths, jewelry, and architecture. Once the initial concept is clear to me, I sketch out detailed designs that are then sent to the factory to produce the prototypes.
These are scrutinized by us and the commercial teams, and from there we choose hero styles; make recommendations for additions, and modifications are made. Of particular importance to us throughout the process is the choice of color and material, and how these two areas are showcased together for the greatest effect.
Ancient Greek Sandals Spring/Summer '19 collection
Ancient Greek Sandals FC: What influences feed into your designs?
CM: A visit at an archaeological site, or a museum, Mythology, the Greek islands, A trip to Tokyo or New York, Watching tourists walking around in Athens and even just everyday life in Corfu.

Ancient Greek Sandals FC: What's the best piece of fashion advice that you've been given?

"How Rickey Thompson Became An Instagram Hero To Adele, Ariana Grande And More",www.forbes.com,Steve Baltin,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/05/26/how-rickey-thompson-became-an-instagram-hero-to-adele-ariana-grande-and-more/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Arts I write about music and the business of music. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 05: Rickey Thompson speaks onstage during the 11th Annual Shorty Awards on May 05, 2019 at PlayStation Theater in New York City. (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for Shorty Awards) Getty There is a lot of truth in the adage, ""You can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep."" By looking at his company, you can tell actor Rickey Thompson is a superstar in the social media world.
Thompson, who has almost 4,000,000 Instagram followers and counts such musical luminaries as Adele, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Steve Aoki and countless more as friends or followers, recently took home the Shorty Award for Instagrammer Of The Year.
How did Thompson develop such a rabid following? By being himself. The key to his success are short videos where he, in his own words, rants. Like in one where talks about indecisive people.
""You know what, I cannot stand an indecisive person. Y'all b**tches are so annoying . F**, make up your mind! Either you want me or you don't, b**ch."" This goes on for about 50 seconds. When you watch Thompson do it with his hilarious and impassioned delivery, like a great singer, like an Adele or Grande, you feel he is speaking to you and for you.
According to Thompson he gets DMs every day from people who appreciate his yelling out on the things they feel too uncomfortable to speak up about. And all of this is translating from Instagram success to mainstream media.
He is part of the H&M pride campaign with Laverne Cox and has his own online series on Harpers Bazaar called ""Royal Tea With Rickey Thompson."" As Thompson tells me though, that is just the beginning for what he hopes to do with his growing fame and following.
It's part of a conversation that includes how he met Adele, the effect his self-proclaimed ""rants"" are having on people and how people can learn from his success.
Steve Baltin: You have become this star among musicians. I am curious as to the secret to the Rickey Thompson magic for musicians. Do you have a musical background?
Rickey Thompson: I have some of my family members who play in the church choir and things like that. They were really into music and a lot of my cousins would sing and I was in choir as well. So that was my little background music.
Baltin: So when you were doing theater was it mostly musicals?
Thompson: Yes, it was musicals. When I was younger I was really big into musical theater. I thought musical theater was so much fun. It was a way for me to express myself through a musical. That was really cool. I would say musicals are my favorite, regular plays aren't my thing.
Baltin: What is the one part for you? The one that was your favorite or you never got to do that is the dream role now.
Thompson: I feel like my favorite was my very first musical and it was my very first lead. I played Captain Shang from the musical Mulan and I had never sung before, but I took voice lessons and I nailed it. So that was one of my favorite roles.
Baltin: Now that you have these musical friends and visibility are you going to go back in the direction of musicals?
Thompson: I really hope so. After doing my project with Amine I really want to start doing stuff like that. I feel like narrating different types of songs and stuff like that was really cool. I got to put my own personality on a track. That was really amazing and I really do hope and pray more artists will be like, ""Hey, Rickey, hop on this song real quick."" I think it's so cool to be able to do a feature.
Baltin: Given your plethora of musical friends who would be the dream one to work with?
Thompson: I would honestly say Adele. I still can't get over that she's a fan of me. I am still like, ""Whoa! I can't believe that happened."" She loves my videos and stuff like that. So I think it'd be really cool to do something with her since nobody would ever expect it. With Adele her stuff is ballads and beautiful and stuff like that. So it'd be really cool to add like my comedic touch to one of her projects.
Baltin: So how did you meet?
Thompson: I met her through another musical friend, Meghan Trainor, love her. We were hosting this screening together and her manager pulled me aside and he was like, ""Hey, do you mind if I call my friend? She is a really big fan of yours."" And I was like, ""Oh, okay, who could this be?"" And he was like, ""Oh, you know her for sure."" So he called her and in literally one ring Adele answered the phone. I was completely in awe. I could not believe that she knew who I was. She was like, ""Oh my god, Rickey, I'm such a big fan of you. Your videos make me smile. When I'm going through a rough day I can just turn to you. And I just love, love, love you so much."" It was my birthday. I was so obsessed I was talking to Adele I forgot it was my birthday. She took me out to dinner and we've been friends ever since.
Baltin: I interviewed her years ago and she was just a blast, so funny.
Thompson: That's Adele. I thought the same thing as well, that'd she be a very serious person and very strict. But as soon as I met her we were just like really cool homies. We were talking about anything and everything. She's such an amazing person.
Baltin: What have you learned from people like Adele on how to handle fame?
Thompson: I've just been staying true to myself. I don't let anything get me down, I always try to keep my head up and stuff like that. And I think by me being able to be friends with people who are so big in the industry and who are constantly talked about it gives me that feeling if they can do it I can too. I'm just staying true to myself and doing it every day.
Baltin: Are there particular moments where you saw this following develop on social media?
Thompson: I would say I had that moment right when on Instagram I started doing dancing videos and stuff like that. I was like, ""Okay, cool, people love my music taste and stuff like that."" But once I started ranting more it's like, ""Oh, okay, I got this. More people want to really connect with me, more people want to relate with me and stuff like that."" Like I always say, ""I use Instagram as my journal."" I'm just literally being myself. If I'm going through something I 'm gonna rant about it and we'll see how it goes. And ever since I have been ranting everyone has been relating to me. Talking about breakups, fake friends, just living everyday life. And it makes me feel happy that people are really responding to it. I feel like that right there, my whole ranting side is where I got it and I started building that momentum.
Baltin: What do people tell you as to why they do connect so deeply with what you're saying?
Thompson: I get multiple DMs every day where people are like, ""Oh my god, Rickey, you are saying exactly what I'm thinking, but I'm afraid to say it."" And right there makes me so happy because I feel like, ""Okay, cool, I can be the voice for people who are afraid to say stuff like that."" With my stuff I am never that person to say something to offend anybody. I wanna be able to say something about what we're all going through, but do it in a funny way. If you can laugh about it, like, ""Oh my god, I'm going through this awful breakup,"" but still laugh about it, everything is gonna be okay. So I get stuff like that each and every day and I feel like that right there just gives me the drive and inspiration to keep on going.
Baltin: What is the coolest thing you've heard from someone?
Thompson: This girl sent me a DM and she's like, ""I had been going to therapy for about four years and I stopped going because of your page."" And when I read that I was like, ""Wait, what?"" The fact that she's going to a trained doctor who is telling her how you should feel and the fact that she'd go to my Instagram videos and it stopped her from going to therapy really did change everything. I was like, ""Whoa, the fact that I have that power, that they can come to my page and get that instant happiness or they come to my page and they're feeling sad and I'm just being myself makes me feel so big."" It really does make me want to keep on talking and never shut up.
Baltin: Where do you take all this going forward?
Thompson: I definitely want to build up my acting career, that was my main goal when I got everything started. I really wanted to show people that I'm this dramatic person who can really act. By building my following and building up everything I just really want to eventually be able to take that into my acting career and hope for the best for that.
Baltin: What do you hope people take from your success?
Thompson: Growing up I was a shy kid, I was never happy with myself. I tried to be so many different things, but now with all this success from me being myself I just really want to tell people, ""It's gonna be okay, you got this. I know at times it's gonna be real rough and real ugly but I promise if you keep on fighting, keep on putting in that hard work it will get better.""

Theresa May To Stand Aside; 10 Downing Street Claims Another Victim,www.forbes.com,Stephen Pope,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpope/2019/05/26/theresa-may-to-stand-aside-10-downing-street-claims-another-victim/,"Another Prime Minister of the U.K. has been forced to resign. Looking back over history, one must go back to March 16, 1976 to find the last time a British Premier left 10 Downing Street on their own terms. Harold Wilson was that politician who drew down the curtain on his second term as Premier as he turned 60. Since then every successive national leader has been forced out of office on terms that were not of their choosing.
James Callaghan lost the election of 1979; Margaret Thatcher was forced out by her party in 1990 when the Conservatives slumped in the polls over the Community Charge. Her successor John Major won one election in 1992 and lost another five years later to Tony Blair who himself was pushed out by his party after 10 years in office as he was stained by the Iraq War.
Gordon Brown failed to call an election in 2007 when ahead in the polls and eventually lost the popular vote three years later as he was dogged by the financial crisis. David Cameron won two elections, however, having backed the “Remain” campaign he resigned feeling the country needed to be run by a fresh leader. I think he simply cut and ran showing no stomach for the fight.
That led to a situation where one by one, the candidates to succeed Cameron that were favoured to win fell by the wayside leaving Theresa May as the last person standing. So, a politician that had campaigned to remain, found herself leading the challenge of delivering Brexit.
It all started so well, as the woman who had once told the Conservatives they had been seen as the nasty party was accepted as the safe pair of hands that would deliver the U.K. from the European Union (EU) and address the issues of inequality or the burning injustices that she had identified within society.
It all started to fall apart in 2017 when on April 18, Mrs May announced that she would hold a vote in the House of Commons to hold an early general election on June 8. She had previously ruled this out on no less than five occasions over the course of nine months. However, she was seduced by a 24% lead in the opinion polls over Labour. It was her chance to seize a landslide victory, have a large majority and see off the far-left revival of Jeremy Corbyn.
The campaign was not well run. Ground was lost as Labour ran a good campaign and made hay over the Conservatives proposed reforms to social care in England raising the threshold for free care from £23,250 to £100,000. Superficially that sounded wonderful, except for the fact that it would include property in the means test although that would permit deferred payment after death. May criticised the portrayal of the policy by Labour who had termed it a ""dementia tax"". It was a phrase that stuck and dogged the Prime Minister right through to polling day.
The general election in June saw the Conservatives lead over labour fall to just 2.4% when the final votes were tallied and as such, they lost their majority. They were the largest party in a hung parliament and that prompted a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for support on a supply and confidence basis.
What has ultimately undermined Theresa May is, beyond doubt, Brexit; or rather the lack of it.
The arithmetic in the House of Commons boxed the Prime Minister between a rock and a hard place as not only was her withdrawal agreement defeated on three occasions the series of indicative votes also revealed that the nation’s MP’s who did not like May’s deal could not agree on any proposition. On the EU side, despite concern at a lack of progress there were repeated claims that there could be no reopening of the negotiations although the U.K. was given two extensions to its planned departure date.
Reaching out across the political divide to the Labour Party achieved nothing as it appears neither side would concede any ground. Seeking a compromise with Labour was undoubtedly too much for many rank and file Conservative politicians to accept. Certainly, they let their feeling be known to party power brokers. Politics is a cruel game; one id judged by results and once back benchers support was lost Mrs May’s fate was sealed.
Over the past 22 years she has been nothing less than a dutiful constituency MP and a capable Cabinet Secretary of State. I feel the role of Prime Minister at these trying times for the nation would have been too much for any individual. Especially so when they were unable to command a majority in the house. There is a sad irony that in the year of the 40 th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher entering Downing Street, so Mrs May will have to depart.
On that last point, Mrs May has only herself to blame. She threw away a small majority when there was no need to so. Whilst blessed with a hard work ethic and lacking an ego that sought the cameras or the media, she was unable to inspire her party or the nation.
The history books have a habit of restoring some sheen to old political reputations. Sadly, in the case of Theresa May, her tenure at “Number 10” will be forever associated with failing to deliver Brexit.
Whoever becomes the next leader of the Conservative Party and be default the next Prime Minister is not going to have a much easier time in office. The arithmetic of the house is unlikely to yield a consensus unless the change in personnel delivers a new offer from the EU. Labour, ever being opportunistic will press for a motion of no confidence and try again to force a general election.
Serving the U.K. is a tough and exhausting role that carries a weighty responsibility. To all the candidates for the top job in the U.K. I say, “be careful what you wish for”."
"Meet Sagely Naturals, the largest Female Founded CBD Company on the Market",www.forbes.com,Vivienne Decker,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/viviennedecker/2019/05/26/meet-sagely-naturals-the-largest-female-founded-cbd-company-on-the-market/,"As CBD-infused products continue to grow in popularity, Sagely Naturals has established itself everywhere from CVS to Neiman Marcus to Los Angeles’ natural food Mecca Erewhon. The company was founded in 2015 by Kerrigan Behrens and Kaley Nichol, who wanted to create approachable products for consumers utilizing the therapeutic benefits of CBD, without the psychoactive effects of THC. Sagely Naturals employs PhD chemists to create their proprietary medicinal products, like their best selling Relief and Recovery Cream or their Tranquility Roll-On. Buoyed by their own positive experiences with CBD, the founders hope their products make their way into the medicine cabinets of even the most unlikely CBD consumers. “The first time I tried CBD in 2015, it literally changed my life,” Kerrigan Behrens said. “I have been dealing with chronic back pain for years and a friend recommended that I try it to help to alleviate the pain. Someone gave me some CBD honey to try and about an hour after I used it, my back felt better than I could remember in years. In that moment, I really felt like CBD had the potential to change a lot of peoples’ lives for the better.”

Meet the founders of Sagely Naturals, Kerrigan Behrens and Kaley Nichol
Courtesy of Sagely Naturals The next day, Behrens and her soon-to-be business partner Kaley Nichol got medical marijuana prescriptions and went to a dispensary for the first time. They were shocked by how unappealing the CBD products were to them. They left feeling displeased with the branding, and the ingredients — primarily, the fact that all the products contained high amounts of THC.
“With regards to form, the vast majority of marijuana sales in California currently are ‘flower’ (like the buds of the plant that you smoke) and ‘concentrates’ (like vaporizers or shatter—extremely high potency options that you also smoke),” Behrens said. “I personally don’t like smoking and edibles can be really unpredictable so I was left to wonder: Where are the products that I already use in my everyday life?”
Sagely Naturals Products
Courtesy of Sagely Naturals “Also, the branding of the products really turned us off,” Kaley Nichol said. “As women, we felt like all the products were made for men. What if we want something that we can proudly display on our bathroom counters or carry around with us in our purses? There are extremely limited options for this. Most of the branding of products in the cannabis industry continue to be centered around this ‘stoner’ ideal. Instead, we wanted to create an inviting brand that feels therapeutic, familiar, and safe. One that you would see at Target or Whole Foods, not in a typical dispensary. There’s also the fact that women deal disproportionately with pain, stress, and sleep issues, which also happen to be the top three reasons why people are turning to CBD. Even today, there are no female focused wellness brands in this space (only beauty brands) that are specifically addressing women’s needs with CBD.”
The duo made it a priority to make set to make a line of products that you would already have in your medicine cabinet with specific amounts of CBD.
ADVERTISEMENT “Maybe even the most alarming impression we had prior to launch was that the products all contained really high amounts of THC,” Behrens said. “What if we want the therapeutic benefits of the cannabis plant but we don’t want to get high? It seemed to us that there was a huge opportunity to create products that really highlighted CBD instead of THC. So the mission for Sagely was born very early on out of a desire to create products that bring the familiar, everyday form of objects we use in our daily lives into this industry. After all, the majority of Americans aren’t comfortable getting high and the beauty of CBD is that it has all of these benefits with no psychoactive effects.”
Kerrigan and Kaley both had backgrounds working in finance and food industries prior to launching Sagely Naturals.
“Our shared experience working at investment banks not only gave us a foundational understanding of finance, it more important gave us a shared work ethic and drive that has been critical to launching a startup,” Behrens said. “While we didn’t have specific experience in the cannabis space prior to founding Sagely Naturals, our personal drive to help our customers has set us on a mission to bring the benefits of CBD to as many people as possible.”

“We were the definition of bootstrapped,” Behrens said. “Kaley and I didn’t pay ourselves a salary and all we could really afford when we started the business was to launch with one product. We had ideas from the get-go for multiple collections and multiple products but we really had to be focused. At that time, in 2015, no one had heard of CBD so it felt like a huge risk to be putting our savings into a business that was so unfamiliar.”
Drawing on their finance backgrounds, the founders knew that in order to be able to grow, they would either have to turn a profit really quickly or raise money really quickly.

As a small startup, Nichol said they initially struggled to find a contractor that was willing to work with a small initial order but could also scale a quality product.
“We wanted to work with contractors that had extensive experience in skincare as our approach to building Sagely was to create a great product experience that is familiar, enjoyable and can compete with other consumer products on the shelf,” Nichol said. “Luckily, we found a great contractor in Los Angeles that took a chance on us as founders and has since scaled with our business as we’ve launched into mass retail. On the sourcing front, similar to contracting, there weren’t many options for CBD in 2015 given it was such a new industry. It was critical to us to find an extractor that could provide U.S. grown, full-spectrum hemp-derived CBD with 0% THC. Even now, the market was primarily isolate or full-spectrum CBD oil but with small amounts of THC. As it was critical for Sagely Naturals to provide an approachable product that was derived from the whole plant, our CBD source was something we weren’t willing to compromise and we invested a lot of time to source the right product. We have since partnered with incredible farmers in states like Kentucky and Colorado.”
Sagely Naturals products
Courtesy of Sagely Naturals ADVERTISEMENT The duo see the future of the CBD market as one that continues to scale, albeit one that uses CBD in unnecessary categories.
“I see a big trend of adding CBD to cosmetics—like CBD in mascara or CBD in hair products—but I don’t understand the necessity of these types of products,” Behrens said. “CBD is an amazing anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant, but that doesn’t mean that you need it on your eyelashes! I also see big, established CPG brands starting to add CBD to things like food and personal care. I think as the trend continues to grow, we’ll continue to see novel products with CBD in them, however, it’s important to know why the company added CBD to the product and what benefits you’re getting because of it. CBD has so much therapeutic potential and I don’t want to see that meaningful, life-changing value diluted because it’s being added to products with no therapeutic value.”
Sagely Naturals plans to continue to grow but focusing on what they do best, bringing CBD-infused products to medicine cabinets.
“Our focus on topical applications like creams and essential oil roll-ons, has enabled us to become experts in how to formulate these kinds of products so you can definitely expect to see some innovative topical applications from us in the next few months,” Behrens said.

"As ‘Game Of Thrones’ Ends, HBO’s ‘Chernobyl’ Quietly Becomes IMDB’s Highest Rated Show In History",www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/05/26/as-game-of-thrones-ends-hbos-chernobyl-quietly-becomes-imdbs-highest-rated-show-in-history/,"While everyone is still trying to process the finale and final season of Game of Thrones in their own way, one common refrain is “don’t cancel HBO until you at least watch Chernobyl .” Produced with Sky in the UK, it’s a harrowing, gripping account of the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, and three episodes in, it has already hit a pretty stunning milestone . Chernobyl is currently ranked as IMDB’s highest rated TV series in history .
IMDB fan voting has its issues to be sure, but when you look at the list, it’s hard to argue that most of these shows don’t deserve to be on it, and it’s impressive that Chernobyl sits above all them, and is doing so with a not insignificant amount of votes.
Here are the top ten shows of all time according to the site at the present moment. If shows are tied, I assume that the un-rounded average is a bit lower for the other shows.
Chernobyl (9.7 – 52,000 votes) Planet Earth II (9.5 – 71,000 votes) Band of Brothers (9.5 – 317,000 votes) Planet Earth (9.4 – 147,000 votes) Breaking Bad (9.4 – 1,200,000 votes) Game of Thrones (9.4, 1,500,000 votes) Our Planet (9.4 – 10,000 votes) The Wire (9.3 – 244,000 votes) Cosmos (9.3 – 95,000 votes) Blue Planet (9.3 – 19,000 votes)
Rounding out the top 20 are other picks like Rick and Morty, The Sopranos, Avatar: The Last Airbender and Sherlock . Moving into the top 50 you’ll find Firefly, Black Mirror, Arrested Development, Seinfeld, Friends and Stranger Things .
Chernobyl
HBO I don’t know if you can make the argument that Chernobyl is the greatest show ever made after just three episodes, but it’s hard to deny that it’s anything other than an absolutely stunning achievement of filmmaking and deserving the accolades it’s getting. As Game of Thrones went on a quality rollercoaster during season 8, without fail I was dying to watch Chernobyl the next day (err, poor choice of words, perhaps), because even though it’s essentially just a historical documentary, it’s just so damn good that it’s easily one of the best shows on TV right now, and absolutely has the chance to be an all-time great when all is said and done, as it seems unlikely a miniseries like this is suddenly going to suffer from sort of great drop in quality going forward.
The bad news? This is a short series. There are only going to be five episodes total, fewer than the eight or six many were guessing at. And given that it’s, you know, history, there’s not going to be a season 2, no matter how acclaimed it may be.
So enjoy Chernobyl while it lasts and realize that in many ways, you’re witnessing TV history. It may be getting 8% of the viewership of Game of Thrones , but it’s absolutely a reason to keep your HBO subscription a little longer.

Jean-Michel Wilmotte's Overhaul Of The Hotel Lutetia Icon In Paris Propels It Into The 21st Century,www.forbes.com,Y-Jean Mun-Delsalle,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/yjeanmundelsalle/2019/05/26/jean-michel-wilmottes-overhaul-of-the-hotel-lutetia-icon-in-paris-propels-it-into-the-21st-century/,"Renowned French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte describes how he revitalized the landmark Hotel Lutetia on the Left Bank in Paris, uncovering part of its history and reinventing the rest. You are recognized for having built the Russian Orthodox Spiritual and Cultural Center in Paris and the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. What are the challenge s of designing a hotel?
In this particular case, two separate elements are at stake: designing a hotel and designing Le Lutetia, which is undoubtedly one of the Paris Left Bank’s grandest hotels. Bringing it up to code and reviving it was vital. Our challenge was to rejuvenate a place while respecting its roots, identity, originality and personality. We needed to start with the origins. The building was built by the Boucicaut family to accompany Le Bon Marché, their department store. The year was 1910, a period when art and architecture were transitioning from Art Nouveau to Art Deco. So this was our starting point. Then, we concentrated on the architectural quality of this building. We discovered impressive ornamentation work on the windows, cornices and balusters. But the interior was substantially altered: successive stages of refurbishment and especially a stratification of initiatives by architects, interior designers and decorators had caused it to lose its personality. Our perception of the building was false. When we emptied it, we realized that nothing was consistent. It was just a decor.

What were your goals in renovating the Lutetia?
The angle was to work on a strong image, so that this five-star hotel would become the Palace of the Rive Gauche. Thus, it was not only essential to bring the hotel up to Palace standards, but also to upgrade it to the level of services and amenities of the hotel group, The Set Hotels, and its benchmarks in Amsterdam and London. Hence, the first thing to accomplish was to get the Lutetia to operate like a Grand Hotel from the 2020s. We totally remodeled the space layout. The number of rooms went from 233 to 184. We had to recompose each and every room and suite – we had laid down all the partitions. Another critical side of the project was technology. In the rooms, every piece of technology is fully integrated, and managed by a large dashboard outside the rooms. The hotel has been upgraded on everything from acoustics to electricity, air conditioning and so on. Acoustic comfort, in particular, is critical. The soundproofing blocks the noise from Boulevard Raspail and the courtyard as well as that of the neighboring rooms.
Salon Saint-Germain
Photo courtesy of Hotel Lutetia How have you kept the original identity of the Lutetia?
Beyond the obvious – getting Hotel Lutetia up to the standards requested under current regulations – it was also imperative to preserve and enhance its identity. Among others, this identity played a major role on the ground floor. There, the myth of the “grand salons” still lived on: Salon Saint-Germain, Salon Borghèse... We were so fortunate to find ourselves before a true myth, and to renovate this decor from the past by projecting it into the 21st century. We made a major change on the ground floor. At the time of the competition, we proposed to build a garden in the middle of the Lutetia because it was one of the only Paris Grand Hotels that didn’t have one. To create it, we decided to eliminate one of the existing salons. This open-air garden is appealing in more ways than one: for the daylight it generates and that spreads inside the building; for the outdoor space it creates, which is a prerequisite in a hotel at that level of prestige… It is also an opportunity to discover the outside of the hotel from the interior courtyard. This garden is now the new heart of the hotel, with the Salon Saint-Germain on one side, and the Orangerie on the other. Another small lounge that opens on the garden is the library – an engaging room for book lovers, and that writers from the neighborhood should appreciate as well. As for Salon Borghèse, it is now the bar. The windows of the bar open onto Boulevard Raspail. Thanks to a play on transparency, the place will attract from the outside in, as passersby will be able to catch sight of the bar, the crowd, the lights…
Brasserie Lutetia

The Brasserie had been seriously damaged. We restored the original double-height ceiling from the 1910 building. It used to be a stuffy place. Now it is a generous space. Under dozens of layers of paint, we came across high-quality frescoes. We cleared them, scraped them and, little by little, we brought them back to life. It felt like unearthing a part of the building’s history from 1910. In the Salon Borghèse in particular, the false ceiling was hiding a sizable period floral ornament. In the lobby, both in the main corridor and around the reception desk, we discovered a whole series of friezes and bas-reliefs and highlighted them. The Salon Saint-Germain as well was featuring plaster trellis on its walls. These frescoes, these patinas bring out traces from the past that had died out. In other words, we cleaned up everything that was out of memory and highlighted everything that conveyed some of it.
Deluxe room with balcony
Photo courtesy of Hotel Lutetia How is the design of the Lutetia different from the other palace hotels in the city?
From glass sconces, floor and wall treatments and door handles to washbasins, faucets and lighting fixtures, every element was custom-designed and produced exclusively for the Lutetia. Same with the furniture. We fought throughout the entire project to avoid ending up with standard furniture from a catalog. The reinterpretation of the furniture was particularly exciting. We started off with the old furniture, but used different materials: for instance, wing chairs are back, but we replaced canework with leather straps. We also use perforated metals. It feels like a dialog is beginning between restored traces of the past, recreated new elements and these brand-new 1910-style-inspired pieces of furniture. We also carried through a strong wood theme to add warmth to the entire project. 1910 was the time of the big transatlantic adventures. Our idea was to draw in some of the atmosphere from those big old yachts by using varnished wood in every circulation pathway. Hence, they are similar to passageways on a boat. The goal was to bring about a strong contrast with the very bright rooms.
The undulating facade of Hotel Lutetia
Photo courtesy of Hotel Lutetia Could you share some anecdotes with us?
Knocking down an entire room that we know was once the suite where General de Gaulle spent his wedding night – we wanted to keep track of this. We also know there used to be an Arman suite: the day we had to tear it down was not an easy one. Ditto for the César Suite, Hiquily’s, etc. We tried to infuse those emotions right back in because they belong to the history of the building. There is the full history of the place, built over more than a century, and then, there is a second layer of history that overlaps the first one, from the ’60s and ’70s, when the hotel was the HQ for artists, the place where they would spend the night – their second home. Artists and fashion designers alike. We tried to resuscitate all that. Yet, these are no anecdotes; these are facts of life that the hotel has lived. A new life is ready to unfold here, and it is good to see all these layers coming into view.

I think there are two types of customers. There is the customer who lives nearby, schedules all his appointments here or has a drink here in the evening. Typically, he or she would probably be a book publisher from the neighborhood. I would like him or her not to feel too out of place here. This customer will be happy to see the place all spruced up while instantly finding his or her marks. As for foreigners, they will return to a highly Parisian spot – the most Parisian spot ever. We imagined a place with an experience that no other Paris hotel will ever be able to offer. That’s the reason why we only developed specific objects and custom-made treatments. I believe that people from the neighborhood will easily get accustomed to their favorite address again, tourists will discover something genuinely new and the dream of the Lutetia will start again.

"Rob Stone, Alexi Lalas Debate Pros, Cons Of 48-Team World Cup",www.forbes.com,Shlomo Sprung,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shlomosprung/2019/05/26/rob-stone-alexi-lalas-debate-pros-cons-of-48-team-world-cup/,"Fox held a blowout Women's World Cup sendoff party for its broadcasters and media Thursday at the Consulate General of France in New York City, and the opinions were flowing as freely as the champagne and Bordeaux. And just after the news broke that a 48-team Men's World Cup won't be introduced for the 2022 version in Qatar, we asked Fox Sports' Rob Stone and Alexi Lalas to discuss and debate the pros and cons and the merits of having a 48-team tournament as opposed to the current 32-team format.
This discussion has been edited for length and clarity
Lalas: I’m against it in 2022. It’s going to be a very different and unique World Cup from a number of different perspectives, not the least of which is you’re having a World Cup in a country the size of Connecticut. Why would you expand the field in a place that’s never had the World Cup before? A place that already over the last four years since it’s been awarded the World Cup, been fraught with problems and potential problems out there.
Why try to change the formula right now? Especially since in 2026, you have a World Cup hosted by three of the biggest countries in the world which have all hosted World Cups before. Why would you want to change it [now]? Do it when it’s big. Because there’s going to be nothing bigger in 2026 just because of geography, and certainly in the amount of money that’s generated, that’s when you drop the 48-team World Cup.

Eight stadiums scattered in a 30-mile radius that will host 32 teams from across the planet are in various stages of development, most of them trying to walk the treacherous line of paying homage to the region's history while simultaneously avoiding becoming an expensive and unused relic once the party ends and everyone else goes home.

Stone, a Connecticut native: How dare you soil the Nutmeg State like you did? Are you saying New Haven, Fairfield, Hartford and Storrs, Connecticut couldn’t handle a World Cup, Alexi Lalas?
I like the idea of branching out the World Cup. And I agree with you. I think it’s premature for three years from now, with all the issues Qatar has already gone through. We’ve changed the rules so many times for Qatar already, where you’re almost like ‘sure, why not?’ And I’m getting nauseous of it. I’m sick of it. And you’re right. The big reveal, the big drop, should be — and obviously we’re a little selfish— when it’s at the U.S. We can handle it, they’ve got enough time to plan for it, the infrastructure’s completely different.
But then they’re gonna have three-team groups, which I think is nauseating. It’s horrible. I think that’s gonna be counter-productive if that’s the way they do it. The group stage is fantastic. Don’t kill the baby that gets you there.
Lalas: Correct me if I’m wrong, I went to Rutgers. But you can still in a 48-team World Cup have groups of four, right, Rob?
Stone: Yes! But they’re talking about groups of three! Which I hate. What’s a group of three?
Lalas: It fundamentally changes…
Stone: The way you approach everything.
Lalas: The tactics of a four-team group scenario are different than the tactics of a three-team group. That is ridiculous to me.
The other side of it is we’re not bashing Qatar for the problems it may or may not have or that it has right now. But — and this is where I’m going to give Connecticut some love— having a World Cup in the form that it is right now, 32, in the size of Connecticut means you’re going to get to multiple games in a day. It’s going to be a festival.
Stone: A soccer lover’s dream.
Lalas: A music festival where you can get from stage, to stage, to stage, to be able to do that and get to multiple games.

Getty Stone: You’ll have one hotel for the entire tournament and say ‘where are we going today?’ And I hate two countries hosting tournaments. I get why they’re doing it in 2026 with the U.S., Mexico and Canada. And that’s going to be a challenge. The travel demands on fans is going to be extraordinary.
And I’ll ask you this simple question: Where do you base your show for a World Cup that’s jointly hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico? If you’re us, now you’re saying L.A. or New York? You’re probably debating between those two, and then you’re asking who hosts the final? That new stadium in L.A. that [Stan] Kroenke is building is gonna turn some heads.
So where do we go? Do we go to Times Square and have our studio there? I don’t know where you go to Downtown L.A. to see that you’re here in America, in L.A. unless you’re in Beverly Hills with the Hollywood sign as your backdrop and smog might be coming in.
Weird digression in TV and things we’ve gotta deal with, but having the tournament in a small area and not being shared and not having to deal with all the political ramifications that already come with the political ramifications and the fact that the rules have been bent so many times, just keep it the way it is.
What I’m really worried about is that we really love World Cup qualifying. I 100% enjoy World Cup qualifying games. You and I, when we’re not working them, we will find a place [to watch] and we get to be a fan. And we get to yell and scream and complain about tactics and rosters. And that is going to be taken out of our grasp a little bit with the growth of the field. We already know the U.S. has qualified for 2026 as one of the host nations. They haven’t said it yet, but you know all three are going to be there.
Lalas: If six teams are going from CONCACAF...
Stone: But going down the road, trips to Honduras or El Salvador aren’t going to matter as much. That tricky date in Panama City, ehh, we’ll figure it out because so many teams are going already. That hurts me. And it probably hurts you more because you’ve been there and played there. [What] I love as a fan has been marginalized [in a 48-team field].

Getty Lalas: I think and I remember just last summer for example, watching Panama play. And seeing the pride in that moment, not just for the players, but for that country to be able to represent themselves on the world stage. And I wouldn’t want to deny anybody that. And I know it is diluting it a little bit, and it should be something special to celebrate. But we also know that there’s a lot of teams that unless something ridiculous happens have very little chance of advancing.
Stone: They know it’s three games and they’re done. You’re right. But when we watched Panama come out and the tears, and the emotions.
Lalas: And zero chance.
Stone: And you want that, and that country needed it. And it’s good for us. It’s good television. We feel it as soccer fans. And look, I cover college basketball. I cover college football. I want to see the football field expanded, because I want more moments. I want more magic. I want more memories of ‘do you remember when these two teams played?’ And a bigger tournament will give you that. And college basketball is fantastic. And it’s in the 60s. And that’s just our country. And it doesn’t disappoint. And if there’s a snoozer here or there, guess what? Every World Cup, men’s or women’s, has a snoozer here and there.
Lalas: And we’re dealing with CONCACAF, which doesn’t have a whole lot of countries over there. In an expanded World Cup...CONMEBOL for example, three-quarters of the teams are going to go. They’re going to have a problem there with that kind of tournament, too.
So you’re right. The qualification process, that at times provides incredible drama, theater, excitement and entertainment, is going to go away.

Getty Stone: And one other point on that, is the casual fan gets upset sometimes and says ‘why can’t the U.S. ever make noise?’ And still to this day, I tell people you don’t realize how hard it is just to qualify for the World Cup. This is the best of the best. They went through hell and beyond just to get here. And it should be a reward, that you made it here and you’re one of the glorious children walking around Russia, or Qatar or the U.S., Canada or Mexico. You earned that right.
I don’t think any nation would say if they get to the expanded tournament that they didn’t earn our right. But you know it’s been sullied a little bit. You know they’ve been given a little hall pass here and there. But I think that’s more on us, where we’re going to take a period of transition for us to realize this is what the great world is now and like that, we’re going to snap our fingers and say this is what it is and we’re going to love it and embrace it. And I guarantee you that one, if not three, of those nations that never would have made a World Cup are gonna make some noise and they’re gonna make some type of history. And we will thank FIFA for expanding it."
17 Monthly Dividends To Buy And Hold Forever,www.forbes.com,Brett Owens,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2019/05/26/17-monthly-dividends-to-buy-and-hold-forever/,"Mortgage payments. Car payments. Cell-phone bills. Power bills. Water bills. Credit card bills.
What do they all have in common?
Nobody likes them, of course. But more importantly, they all arrive relentlessly month after month.
That’s fine when you have a normal job that pays you every couple of weeks or every month. But that regular bill routine becomes considerably more daunting once you hit retirement, when much of your regular income is coming from your portfolio of dividend paying stocks … which pay out every quarter , not every month.
Investors in turn often build complicated dividend calendars that get knocked out of whack whenever they ever have to cut back on certain stocks. May’s dividend check might be enough, for instance but June won’t be, forcing the investor to withdraw from his retirement fund, shaving away future income-generating potential.
But those in the know have it so much simpler thanks to the rare but revered breed of monthly dividend stocks .
Today, I’ll show you how to make the most convenient dividend payers on the planet send you more than $2,600 each and every month.
Why Monthly Dividends Just Make More Sense
Monthly dividend payers that truly have their finger on our pulse as income investors. These companies know that many of their investors require these passive payments. They also know that the electric company doesn’t start sending you bills every three months when you hit age 65.
It’s not difficult. Traditional quarterly dividend stocks will, every three months, announce a future payment with amount and dividend dates. Some monthly dividend stocks will do the same thing, just every month. Some, like Main Street Capital (MAIN) , will “pre-plan” in three-month increments so that it dishes these monthly dividends: Contrarian Outlook Contrarian Outlook
There’s nothing stopping companies like Coca-Cola (KO) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) from doing the same thing. They just don’t .
By the way: Even if you’re decades away from retirement, monthly dividend stocks have a little something for you. They compound faster: Contrarian Outlook Contrarian Outlook
If all else is equal, you’ll come out slightly better with a stock that pays you more frequently. So why not favor the monthly payers?
Who Pays Monthly Dividends?
While just about any company that wanted to could distribute income to shareholders each and every month, it typically boils down to a few specialty assets: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): REITs are among the most income-friendly assets out there just by virtue of waking up in the morning. But several of them are monthly dividend payers – including “the Monthly Dividend Company” itself, Realty Income (O) . Business Development Companies (BDCs): BDCs are extremely similar to REITs in that they were created by Congress and are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends. The business is obviously different – BDCs help provide financing to small and sometime midsize companies, which often will have difficulty obtaining liquidity from larger financiers. They also tend to sport massive yields , often in the high single digits and low double digits. Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs): Most people immediately think “pipelines” when they think about MLPs, which is fair considering most of them are indeed energy transportation companies. But the structure extends to companies of all sorts, from private equity and asset management firm Blackstone Group LP (BX) to Carl Icahn’s diversified holding company Icahn Enterprises LP (IEP) to even roller-coaster specialist Cedar Fair LP (FUN) . Yes, MLPs can be an enormous tax headache, but they often sport stellar yields , and from time to time, they pay their dividend-esque “distributions” monthly. Royalty Trusts: Royalty trusts are as niche as they come. These companies simply exist to own the mineral rights to things such as oil fields and iron mines. They collect royalties from the operations, which they then distribute to shareholders, typically until the trust itself expires or a certain amount of proceeds are distributed. There’s only a handful of these companies, and they exist primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Preferred Stocks: These stock-bond “hybrids” are an income-happy asset that represent ownership in a company. They pay out dividends like a stock, but they’re fixed, more like a bond’s coupon payments. They also trade around a par value like a bond, so most of their returns come from their massive payouts, often between 6% and 7%. You can invest in individual preferreds, but investors typically opt to own them through … Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Closed-End Funds (CEFs): Hundreds of ETFs and CEFs distribute income every month. But while a handful of these funds are simple baskets of stocks, the lion’s share of monthly dividend-paying ETFs and CEFs hold either bonds or preferred stocks.
None of these include mega-cap blue chips, but that’s OK. These still are ample hunting grounds for high-quality high yields.
How to Start Collecting $2,629 Every Month
Let me quickly introduce you to 17 “first-level” stocks and funds to give you an idea of just how powerful monthly dividend payers can be.
Each of these stocks yields more than the benchmark – occasionally by a little, but typically by more than double and up to four times as much . In all but a couple cases, their returns have handily beat basic benchmarks … and a few of them have outright walloped them. Contrarian Outlook Contrarian Outlook
And look at what this group of dividend dynamos is delivering. The average portfolio yield is 6.31%, which is well more than 3x the S&P 500 right now. That translates to $2,629.17 every month on a mere $500,000 portfolio.
Not to mention you’re getting outstanding diversification. You’ve got bonds. You’ve got preferreds. You’re exposed to BDCs that act like mini-private equity firms invested in dozens of industries. You’re even tapping the income potential of 7-Eleven and driving ranges.

Disney's 'Aladdin' Tops Box Office With Huge $114 Million Weekend,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/05/26/disneys-aladdin-tops-box-office-with-huge-114-million-weekend/,"Aladdin earned an estimated $86 million over the Fri-Sun portion of its projected $105 million debut weekend. That’s no record, but it’s higher than the over/under $90 million pre-release tracking. It’s also a better debut than last year’s Disney’s Solo: A Star Wars Story . That Han Solo prequel earned $84 million Fri-Sun and $103 million over its Fri-Mon debut weekend. The problem was that reshoots and a director swap sent that film’s budget soaring to around $275 million. While $183 million for Aladdin isn’t cheap, it’s cheaper than $275 million and there’s little reason not to presume that Aladdin will perform a lot better overseas than the mostly ignored Star Wars Story . ADVERTISEMENT Presuming Disney isn't under-estimating the Sunday/Monday numbers, it will have earned a 3.38x four-day weekend multiplier, just below Alice Through the Looking Glass (3.45x in 2016) and above almost every recent “opened on a Friday” Memorial Day weekend release save for Alice 2 and Men In Black 3 ($69 million from a $17.6 million Friday) back in 2012. The film received mixed reviews but strong audience polling results. Warts and all, the film delivers on its promises of a big-scale live-action redo of Aladdin and mostly works as a blustery and colorful live-action musical with a fine cast and strong production values. The script’s a mess, but it works as surface level entertainment no matter your feelings about its source material.
Yes, there is a lot of family-friendly entertainment ( Secret Life of Pets 2 , Toy Story 4 , Men in Black International ) and at least one potentially huge musical ( Rocketman ) on tap over the next few weeks. However, let's presume that the Mena Massoud/Naomi Scott/Will Smith/Marwan Kenzari/Nasim Perdrad musical romance plays like a normal Memorial Day biggie. For reference, the outliers in both directions are X-Men: The Last Stand ($234 million from a $122 million Fri-Mon debut in 2006) and Men In Black 3 ($179 million from a $69 million debut in 2012). An “average” 2.11x multiplier ( Days of Future Past with a $233 million cume from a $110 million debut in 2014) gives Aladdin a $222 million cume.
An upper-level multiplier ( Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Alice Through the Looking Glass ) gives it a 2.29x multiplier and an over/under $241 million domestic cume while a lower level multiplier of around 1.97x ( Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End and X-Men: Apocalypse ) still gives it a $207 million domestic finish. Yes, Memorial Day releases tend to be relatively front-loaded in terms of earning much of their money in the first four days (or five days, depending on when it opens) of domestic release. That’s why it’s a big deal for Walt Disney that the much-discussed Guy Ritchie flick over performed this weekend.
With a $121 million overseas debut, that gives the flick a $207 million global opening, not yet counting whatever it will earn in North America and overseas on Monday. That's a 41/59 domestic/overseas split, and that's with a ""meh"" $18.7 million debut weekend in China. Not every big movie can count on hitting pay dirt in China, but Aladdin is doing well enough here and in the rest of the world that it won't need a bail out from the biggest overseas market in the world, albeit on that usually only gives the studio 25% of a given ticket sale.
Disney may have another live-action biggie that isn’t a superhero movie, and it does somewhat break their curse of doomed Memorial Day weekend releases ( Prince of Persia , Tomorrowland , Alice Through the Looking Glass and Solo ). While it may not end up earning that much more in North America than Solo: A Star Wars Story ($213.5 million), it’s probably going to do better overseas. Alice 2 earned 75% of its money overseas, Dumbo recently earned 67% of its (mediocre) $347 million global cume overseas. A 40/60 split (like Beauty and the Beast ) from a $220 million domestic cume (same legs as Solo ) gets it to $580 million.
That’s no Sultan’s ransom, but it’s 3.21x the $183 million production budget. That’s presuming it doesn’t really leg out and/or over perform overseas. Will Smith will help in that department, as he helped get Suicide Squad to $745 million without China in 2016, while both Men in Black 3 in 2012 and Hancock in 2008 overcame bad pre-release buzz to earn $624 million global. Being stupidly optimistic, a $259 million domestic total and a 35/65 split (right between The Jungle Book’s 37% domestic portion of its $966 million global cume and Alice in Wonderland ’s 33% domestic portion of its $1.025 billion worldwide gross) gets this one to $740 million worldwide.
ADVERTISEMENT Yes, Aladdin could crash and burn after opening weekend, or perhaps just not be that big of a deal overseas even with Will Smith as the Genie. But now that the film has opened and is playing to big crowds of mostly satisfied customers, the hard part is over. For what it’s worth, the film is yet more evidence that onscreen inclusivity either helps with big movies that folks were going to see anyway or is not remotely any kind of deterrent. I can’t say yet whether more folks showed up to Aladdin due to the ethnic makeup of its cast, but it sure as hell didn’t scare anyone away."
Toronto Raptors Are Making Magical Moments That Will Last A Lifetime,www.forbes.com,Curtis Rush,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtisrush/2019/05/26/toronto-raptors-are-making-magical-moments-that-will-last-a-lifetime/,"TORONTO -- Nobody truly saw this magical moment coming, and that's why Toronto is in shock today. Confetti has been dropping from the sky and gold dust is lining the streets. The Raptors are going to the NBA Finals. And the excitement is being felt throughout the country.
You couldn't have written this story for Hollywood because nobody ever dreamed this big. This demonstration of pride and joy hasn't been seen here since Joe Carter's blast gave the Blue Jays their second consecutive World Series title in 1993.
It's so crazy. This moment wasn't supposed to belong to the Raptors. This moment was supposed to belong to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
If you had said 25 years ago that the Raptors would get to the NBA Finals before a Canadian hockey team would get back to the Stanley Cup Finals, you would have been called crazy.
This is a hockey country. That's why we harbored shame in admitting that the last Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup was the Montreal Canadiens in 1993.
But a turning point seemed upon us. This was going to be Toronto's year, when the hockey egos were going to be restored. The Maple Leafs were finally good, and they were going to give this city its first Stanley Cup championship since 1967.
The storyline in the opening round was similar to what happened in this Eastern Conference basketball final, except for the climax.
The Leafs had taken a 3-2 series lead against the Boston Bruins with Game 6 at home in Scotiabank Arena. But then somebody ripped up the script. The Leafs lost the next two games and the city's fans went into crisis-mode, calling for heads to roll.
But who knew that, weeks later, the Toronto Raptors would take our pain away, that they would advance to the Finals for the first time in franchise history? The Raptors weren't on anybody's list to achieve greatness. They were good, but the Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis Antetokounmpo were clearly the class of the East.
Yet, improbably, the Raptors stole this moment for themselves and gave this city a celebration that they had craved for so long.
It was easy to doubt the Raptors. No only were they down 2-0 in the series, but they were down by double-digit scores in the final two games before storming back to win.
The list of sporting heroes with championship pedigree in this country is short. Other than Joe Carter, we have Sidney Crosby, who gave us our golden hockey moment in the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Hockey was once king in this town. And so was baseball. But there's a new superstar in town, and his name is Kawhi Leonard.
In the midst of these celebrations, you have to feel for DeMar DeRozan. He was traded to San Antonio for Leonard before this season. DeRozan was a very good and loyal Raptor, and this moment should have been his to celebrate too. But Leonard is a once-in-a-lifetime talent, and sometimes hard decisions have to be made in the interests of winning.
You also have to feel for Dwane Casey, the coach of the year who was fired last year and replaced with his assistant, Nick Nurse. Casey couldn't help the fact that LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers were in the same conference.
You have to feel for the city of Milwaukee too. The Bucks haven't been to an NBA Finals since 1974, and they seemed destined this year. They had an emerging superstar in Antetokounmpo, who is likely going to win the MVP this season. But he is young and he will learn from this experience.
You also have to feel for Danny Green. He came to Toronto in the Leonard trade, and all season, he was a terrific defender and three-point shooter.
But somehow in this series, he lost the touch, lost his nerve. After scoring zero points in Game 5, you wondered if Nurse would bench him for Game 6.
But there he was in the starting lineup on Saturday, throwing up more bricks and putting this already nervous city on speed dial for 911. Finally, Green was taken out of the game, and Norman Powell and Fred VanVleet stepped in get Toronto back in contention.
While fans can keep this celebration going for days, Nurse and the Raptors can't allow this giddy feeling to persist too long.
There is business to take care of. The powerful Golden State Warriors will be here on Thursday for Game 1 of the NBA Finals, and the Raptors are already massive underdogs.
Nobody knows, obviously, how this is going to turn out. In this city's wildest dreams, the Raptors will go on to win the NBA title and Kawhi Leonard will finally answer the question that's been haunting the city all year: Does he love the city and will he stay? ""Yes,"" will be his answer to both.
But even if those dreams don't come to pass, the Raptors have already done something special this postseason. They have made magical moments that will last a lifetime."
What If Rockstar Just Made A $60 ‘GTA 5’ And ‘Red Dead Redemption 2’ Story DLC Combo?,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/05/26/what-if-rockstar-just-made-a-60-gta-5-and-red-dead-redemption-2-story-dlc-combo/,"I have written more articles than I can count about how puzzling it is that Rockstar has refused to make story DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5 , arguably the best-selling game in history, and more recently, Red Dead Redemption 2 , another critical and sales smash hit. ADVERTISEMENT The rationale at this point is obvious, that Rockstar would much rather focus on building out GTA Online and RDR Online than investing in pricier single player, story DLC content. Though while that may have made some amount of sense for the ultra-popular GTA Online , Red Dead Online has hardly caught fire in the same way. And regardless, when a game sells 100 million copies maybe yeah, you should consider making some true DLC for it.
I have kind of a wild idea as to how Rockstar could kill two birds with one stone. I don’t know what huge game they’re coming out with next in a few years, but until that happens, I think they could do something entirely unusual and create a standalone story DLC combo back that fulfils the request for both games to have DLC at the same time.
GTA 5
Rockstar It’s something they could sell for $60, like they would a traditional release, even if the total content inside wasn’t as much as either game had originally. No one really ever expects say, $20 DLC to be as much content as a third of the base game anyway, unless we’re talking about CD Projekt Red.
But this would allow Rockstar to use its existing games and engines to build new story content for both GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 , and selling it as one bundle would be enough to probably outsell many actual games in a given year.
GTA 5 may be a distant memory for some now, but more people have played it than practically any other individual game on earth short of Minecraft and Tetris . And millions of those people would return to the world for story DLC based on the events of the original game.
ADVERTISEMENT The same is true for Red Dead 2 , which is much more fresh in people’s minds, and there are plenty of options for story DLC there, whether that be another Undead Nightmare type outing, some side adventure with a character like Sadie, or going even further back in time to the antics of young Hosea, Dutch and Arthur.
Red Dead Redemption 2
Rockstar To me, this would theoretically solve a lot of problems. Fans would get the story DLC they’ve been asking for, Rockstar would get a decently major $60 release in stores without having to make a fully new game. There are teams still working on both GTA and Red Dead content, and I think it would be prudent to bolster them to make something like this, even if we’re just talking about DLC on the level of Ballad of Gay Tony or the original Undead Nightmare. Big projects, sure, but not insurmountable. And the Online stuff can continue to be released alongside it.
This may sound like a pretty out-there idea, but at this point I’m running out of ways to try and convince Rockstar to further flesh out these games, as it seems like a win-win for everyone involved. And every time I see new GTA Online/RDR Online update, I get mad about this all over again.
ADVERTISEMENT I doubt Rockstar will run with my suggestion, but tell me why they shouldn’t or couldn’t? I just don’t get it, and never have.

Weekend Box Office: James Gunn's 'Brightburn' And Olivia Wilde's 'Booksmart' Both Open Below $10 Million,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/05/26/weekend-box-office-james-gunns-brightburn-and-olivia-wildes-booksmart-both-open-below-10-million/,"Sony and Screen Gems released Brightburn over the holiday weekend to middling results. The James Gunn-produced and David Yarovesky-directed chiller, which turns the Superman origin story into a gruesome R-rated horror movie, earned mixed-positive reviews but didn’t get much in the way of buzz heading into the weekend. As such, a $7.535 million Fri-Sun/$9 million Fri-Mon debut isn’t a surprise. The $7 million-budgeted Elizabeth Banks vehicle had the bad luck of ramping up its marketing just as Disney fired Gunn from Guardians 3 over some unearthed tweets. Disney hired him back, but Sony delayed Brightburn from Thanksgiving 2018 to Memorial Day 2019. ADVERTISEMENT That wasn’t fatal, as it’s not like a cheapie like this needed a saturation campaign. After the first teaser played well enough online, the overall marketing frankly got kind of quiet. Sony may have just spent the bare minimum needed to get a $7 million-budgeted movie into the black (it’ll probably tap out at $18 million domestic). Come what may, this wasn’t the summer counter-programming event it was presumed to be after that first teaser. Still, the Mark and Brian Gunn-penned movie is a fascinating little deconstruction, examining toxic masculinity through a superhero origin while ironically taking the Superman myths closer to their roots as a Moses parable.
United Artists Releasing released Booksmart into 2,505 theaters on Friday. The Olivia Wilde-directed teen comedy, sold (somewhat accurately) as a Superbad for girls, has earned mostly rave reviews and strong buzz coming out of its SXSW debut this past April. But when it’s just as easy to for folks to stay home and binge episodes of (the excellent) Pen15 on Hulu, getting audiences into theaters for an R-rated, female-centric future classic like this is an uphill battle. To be fair, it’s not like The Do-To List in 2013 or The Edge of Seventeen in 2016 were huge hits, as wonderful as they are.
Even so, a $6.512 million Fri-Sun frame and a projected $8 million Fri-Mon debut weekend is not great. The marketing was mostly digital, so this may not be a catastrophe. The overall low number, we’re probably looking at over/under $20 million even if it legs out, is still a tragedy for this kind of movie. Once again, if you want more movies like this in theaters, you actually have to see them in theaters. Writing, reading and sharing publicity or coverage of movies like Widows , Little or Searching is fine, but it’s useless if the general moviegoers don’t show up when those movies open in theaters.
The sad truth is that Hollywood still makes and/or releases the kinds of movies we all claim Hollywood doesn’t make anymore. But in a Netflix/VOD era, audiences ignore those films and only go to theaters for the “event movies.” There are consequences for this mentality. It’s why Disney shut down Fox2000 and has cut Fox’s annual slate in half while seemingly using the studio mostly for its catalog and IP. Call Disney evil, but Fox’s entire 2018 slate of adult, star-driven, diverse and/or non-IP fare was mostly ignored last year. Vote with your wallet, not with your hashtag."
Augmented Reality Options By Second Spectrum Added To ESPN App For NBA Playoffs,www.forbes.com,Simon Ogus,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonogus/2019/05/26/augmented-reality-options-by-second-spectrum-added-to-espn-app-for-nba-playoffs/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin An example of what the AR integration on the ESPN App looks like utilizing Second Spectrum technology. (Photo Courtesy of ESPN & Second Spectrum) With the NBA Finals now set between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors, ESPN has launched a new alternative viewing experience for its app, which debuted during selected games of the NBA postseason coverage.
ESPN’s Branded Full Court Press, with Second Spectrum, allows viewers to watch various isolated broadcasts of the game on the ESPN app and on ESPN3. The options also include a Coach Mode, which is “a heavy X’s and O’s analytical presentation of the game, featuring on-court diagrams of the live action”.
There is also a Player Mode that offers “above-the-rim cameras and graphics displaying the scoring probability of all five offensive players on the court throughout each possession, changing in real time” and a Mascot Mode that features “a fun, entertaining presentation featuring special graphics treatments, including a fire graphic on the basket when a team goes on a scoring run, a 3D on-screen brick if a player misses badly, and more.”
Stephanie Druley, EVP, Event and Studio Production at ESPN, says : “We’re excited to present a completely distinct and innovative way to watch a highly anticipated NBA game to fans. There are several ways to tell the story of a basketball game, and through this collaboration with Second Spectrum and the great work of our production team, we can offer new ways to reach all NBA fans.”
The Disney-owned sports network will be launching its alternative viewing experience, in conjunction with sports data intelligence company Second Spectrum, which is introducing augmented reality (AR) focused content to ESPN and ABC’s NBA Playoff coverage and has created continuous on-court graphics titled “ESPN Mode”, which is being added to the long list of ESPN digital offerings.
The new features debuted during three of the NBA’s Western Conference Finals games between the Portland Trail Blazers and Golden State Warriors. The platform integrates in-game stats with ball movement diagrams as well as player identifications that intertwine with continuously updated stats throughout the broadcast.
Second Spectrum is the company behind the Los Angeles Clippers CourtVision, technology which allows fans, during the broadcast of a game, to choose between three different streams and combine it with AR graphics for a completely different viewing experience.
As fans’ expectations for their viewing experience evolve, companies like Second Spectrum have a leg up in the development of graphics for content providers, like augmented reality and other additions become more commonplace to the broadcast experience. While Second Spectrum is officially partnered with the Clippers, it is likely that many more teams and broadcast networks will utilize this technology in the near future.

Wine USA Road Trip: Special Memorial Day Edition (Part One Of Two),www.forbes.com,Cathy Huyghe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhuyghe/2019/05/26/wine-usa-road-trip-special-memorial-day-edition-part-one-of-two/,"Maybe it's the sun warming our shoulders and faces for the first time in months. Maybe it's the open windows in the car with the wind gushing through.
Maybe it's the longer hours of daylight that pull us outdoors, to inhale fresh air and exhale the stale breath of winter once and for all.
Whatever it is that inspires you about summer, it's the time of year that many of us in the US start dreaming of (and actually doing) a road trip. They get us up and moving, and they shake out the cobwebs of colder weather. They shift the landscape of our perspective, literally. They lead us through unfamiliar towns and down meandering roads, as we explore areas of the country that we probably have no ""official"" reason to visit.
They're places where we don't have to go. They're places where we want to go.
That's a world of difference. And there is no better time -- and no better summer -- to let those want-to-go places be about wine. Here's why.
You've probably heard by now that every one of the US' fifty states grows grapes and makes wine, which in itself is pretty cool. But speaking pragmatically, this means two significant things for you as a road-tripper.
First, the landscape of your perspective on wine will undoubtedly shift, thanks to the vista that hybrid grapes will open up before you. Hybrid grapes are typically bred by crossing European grape species (i.e., the grapes we're likely to recognize) with native US grape species (i.e., the grapes we're less likely to recognize so far). They're bred in order to survive winter temperatures and climates in states we haven't historically associated with the words ""wine region,"" such as Vermont and Minnesota. Second, there's a destination at the end of those meandering roads. Destinations, that is, that have been designed with visitors in mind by owners and developers who recognize that the wine itself may very well not be THE reason to seek out their winery. Experience-seeking visitors can come for the view, for example, or the event venue, or the farm-to-table restaurant that jives with the theme of local agriculture. Madeline Puckette of Wine Folly has created this "" 50 States of Wine "" map that is a perfect place to start envisioning your wine USA road trip, very close to home no matter where home is for you.
Many other wine writer colleagues and friends have also given careful consideration to the ""wine scene"" in off-the-beaten-path states, and I'd like to gather their articles as a resource for you here. To be most up-to-date, I'm including three references from three states, that have been published within the last three months.
Note: Today's post is the first of two in this series, and is clustered in the mid-Atlantic region. The following post will be dedicated to wineries further afield, including Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, Texas and Vermont.
Driving on a countryside road
Getty Pennsylvania -- As my own home state, I'm more familiar with local agriculture here being oriented around corn, wheat, soybeans and mushrooms. More recently, however, financial incentives have been offered to farmers to diversify their crops and that has given the state's grape and wine industry a boost. Check out Mike Veseth's article from just last week , for a ""small is beautiful"" look at Pennsylvania's historical and recent forays into wine.
Maryland -- As a judge earlier this year during the TEXSOM International Wine Awards , I sat on a panel that tasted American wines outside the major producing states of California, Washington, Oregon and New York. The lone silver award we gave that day went to a 2016 cabernet franc reserve wine, made by Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard in Dickerson, Maryland, located northwest of Washington DC and just east of the border with Virginia. Earlier this month, Dave McIntyre of the Washington Post explored whether Maryland can produce an iconic red wine , along with the family at the helm of Old Westminster Winery near Clarksburg.
New Jersey -- Robin Shreeves, in an article for Vinepair about New Jersey's wines coming into their own, highlights the two distinct wine regions located within a 90-minute drive of both Philadelphia and New York city. Shreeves includes recommendations for five state wines, which are available for purchase online, if you'd like to try before you visit."

Congress Is Making Big Changes In Retirement Planning,www.forbes.com,Bob Carlson,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcarlson/2019/05/26/congress-is-making-big-changes-in-retirement-planning/,"Share to linkedin Getty Divided government in Washington isn’t stopping all action Even the President’s declaration that he won’t work with Congress as long as it is investigating him hasn’t put a hold on all work.
The House of Representatives Thursday voted 417-3 in favor of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019. A similar bill, titled the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act (RESA) is in the Senate Finance Committee. Under current law, when a beneficiary inherits an IRA, the beneficiary generally can choose to have the IRA balance distributed in required minimum distributions based on his or her life expectancy. Making maximum use of the IRA’s tax-deferred compounding like this is known as a Stretch IRA.
Under SECURE, in most instances an inherited IRA would have to be fully distributed within 10 years of the original owner’s death. There are exceptions, such has for minor children and disabled beneficiaries. The Senate version has a different provision that still would terminate most Stretch IRAs. I’ll have more details about how to respond to the likely end of the Stretch IRA in a future post.
SECURE aims to increase retirement savings in a number of ways. Employers would be allowed to increase the automatic 401(k) plan contribution amount to 15% of employee pay from 10%. Part-time workers with at least 500 hours of employment in each of three consecutive years would have to be allowed to participate in 401(k) plans. Getty
Also, the age limit for contributions to traditional IRAs would be eliminated. Current, contributions aren’t allowed after age 70½. Likewise, required minimum distributions from traditional IRAs would be deferred to age 72. (The Senate RESA would raise the age to 75.)
SECURE makes it easier for employers to band together to form multi-employer retirement plans. Currently, employers generally have to be in a similar industry to form a multi-employer plan. Under SECURE, unrelated employers can potentially reduce costs and offer better retirement plans by joining multi-employer plans.
Small businesses would be allowed a tax credit of up to $500 to help pay for the cost of establishing and maintaining retirement plans for employees.
It also would be easier for retirement plans to offer annuities to retiring employees under SECURE. Plans also would be allowed to give employees an annual estimate of the income that would be generated by the current balance in their 401(k) accounts.
Many other provisions in SECURE are technical but are designed to reduce the paperwork and cost of establishing and maintaining a retirement plan for employees. Congress hopes this will encourage more employers to offer or improve their retirement plans.
The Senate’s RESA isn’t identical to SECURE, but key senators hope to speed the legislative process by having the Senate pass SECURE by unanimous consent.

"Tesla On Autopilot Slams Into Stalled Car On Highway, Expect More Of This - plugilo.blog",www.forbes.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/05/26/tesla-on-autopilot-rams-into-stalled-car-on-highway-expect-more-of-this/,"Here’s a driving situation that I’m guessing most of us have all experienced at one time or another. You are driving along on a highway or freeway, moving at a relatively fast clip (say 60 miles per hour, the prevailing speed and as matched with other nearby cars), surrounded by a mild amount of traffic, but nothing so onerous as to bog down the overall flow of vehicles. A car to your left unexpectedly decides to dart into your lane, cutting down on the distance you had from the car directly ahead of you. It’s one of those situations wherein the driver seems to want to swiftly go across multiple lanes of traffic, perhaps belatedly realizing that there is an off-ramp coming soon that they want to reach, and they had not been astute enough to gradually make their way over to the rightmost lane. The driver then makes another lane change, doing so into the lane to your right, now clearing the path ahead of you. Keep in mind that all of this is happening in a matter of a handful of seconds, everyone moving at 60+ mph during the course of this series of eye-blinkingly brief events.
Upon the driver having shifted into the lane to your right, you can now see more readily what’s ahead of you in your particular lane. Here’s the rub. Turns out that there is a car in your lane, up ahead of you, which has either come to a crawl or might even be entirely halted, possibly stalled on the highway or freeway. Because the other car had somewhat momentarily blocked your view, you had not been able to see that this stalled car was a menace-in-waiting to you and your car.
You don’t know whether the driver that had cut in front of you might have seen the stalled car and decided to make a quick escape, or whether they were merely completing their effort to get over into the rightmost lane for purposes of exiting at the next off-ramp. Either way, that driver has left you now holding the bag (a dangerous one, for sure!).
Essentially, you’ve been handed a hot potato. As recap, you were zooming along in your lane, and there is a car sitting in your lane, motionless, waiting to get smashed into by you, which you had not detected until the last moment, partially due to an interloper.
This is the moment that many drivers hope will never arise, yet it likely happens to many drivers, possibly with some substantial frequency, particularly if you are a daily driver that puts ample mileage on your car while commuting to work (I encounter these kinds of situations about once or so every two weeks, during my hour and a half long commute each day, each way, for work).
Typically, you maneuver out of the situation, often barely, by the skin of your teeth, though with about 6,300,000 car accidents occurring annually in the United States, some proportion of car crashes are undoubtedly due to this kind of inadvertent setup.
In a reported recent incident , a Tesla on Autopilot (according to the driver) rammed into a stalled vehicle on a highway, doing so while the Tesla was moving along at a speed of around 60 mph, and the crash occurred in a manner akin to what I’ve just described as a driving scenario.
According to the driver of the Tesla, another car cut in front of him, staying there fleetingly, then moved rapidly over to the next lane, and within moments it became apparent that a car was stalled up ahead, and he and his Tesla were going to ram right into it, full force. He and his Tesla did so, and luckily he lived to tell the tale.
It might be instructive to consider how this kind of a crash occurred and what it portends for Tesla drivers using Autopilot , along with ramifications for autonomous self-driving driverless cars in general.
Diagnosing What Happens In Stalled Car Crashes
Let’s take out our Sherlock Holmes magnifying glass and try to ferret out salient characteristics of these kinds of automobile-based death-defying (though sometimes death resulting) incidents.
As I earlier suggested, sometimes you can maneuver out of the situation, while other times there is not any viable recourse and you get pinned into ramming into the stalled car.
Consider these two key elements:
• Specific context in the moment . The context of the specific driving predicament is a big factor in what will transpire since it determines what options might be viable and which ones are not.
• Driver mindset and actions. The thinking processes and actions of the driver are another crucial consideration for how the circumstance will play out.
If you try to hit your brakes, the question arises as to whether you can come to a stop in time, though even if you cannot come to a halt soon enough to prevent ramming of the stalled car, at least if you can ratchet down speed off your car you are going to reduce the likely amount of danger and resultant damage that can occur when you rear-end the other vehicle.
Beyond dealing with the speed of your car, you might perhaps swerve into another lane, either to your left or to your right, allowing you to either avoid entirely the stalled car, or maybe only sideswiping it, rather than plowing into it head-on.
Of course, the swerving action might be blocked by other cars that are to your left or right. Or, you might be able to do the swerve, yet other cars in the left or right lanes will then be disrupted by your movement into their lanes, possibly getting them directly involved in the pending crash. This often results in a domino-like cascade of cars hitting each other, doing so to avoid the sudden swerve that you made.
From the driver’s perspective, it is important to consider how much time did they have to take a potential avoidance kind of action and were they cognitively attune to have been able to use that time as best possible.
In other words, a human driver can be caught off-guard, and even if there was sufficient time to do something, the person might either become mentally confounded or be shocked into a state of being frozen, not sure of what to do, and potentially wasting those precious few seconds when an action might have made a significant difference to the outcome.
Now, let’s add into this scenario the use of automation, focusing on Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), and see how that changes the picture.
Semi-Autonomous Cars And The Co-Shared Driving Task
When reviewing an incident involving ADAS, and especially for those cars that are considered semi-autonomous, meaning they are not yet at a true autonomous level, not being at Level 5 , and in the case of the Tesla Autopilot being at a considered Level 2 , you need to imagine that there are essentially two drivers of the car, the human driver and the semi-autonomous automation.
What did your co-shared semi-autonomous driving “partner” do?
In theory, the Tesla Autopilot should not have been susceptible to a mind-freeze that a human being might have and would have unemotionally and computationally calmly calculated the matter. This would involve detecting the object ahead, and interpreting that the object was not moving, and ascertaining that the Tesla was moving toward the stalled object and would intersect (badly) with it, and then try to figure out what action to take.
According to the reported incident, the Autopilot did not engage the brakes. If so, we should be asking, why not? As a minimum, at least the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) should presumably have engaged .
Also, apparently the Autopilot did not try to swerve the car and avoid or reduce the head-on impact, which once again we are left to ask why it did not do so ? Was it because it failed to consider utilizing any quick-maneuver options? As a side note, the Tesla manual warns that the Autopilot might not well handle these kinds of situations, though I have more to say about that aspect in a moment herein.
This incident further raises the question as to whether or not Tesla ought to be using LIDAR , a mash-up of light and radar that is a sensory device used by nearly all other autonomous car makers . Would a LIDAR device have potentially aided in detecting the stalled car? It is possible that a LIDAR unit, especially if positioned on the top of the vehicle, would have had an added chance of detecting the upcoming calamity, providing what I refer to as an essential omnipresence capability for the automation attempting to aid in driving the car.
On another notable facet of the incident, the human driver says that there was insufficient time for him to react.
Let’s make clear that this does not give the Autopilot a freebie in terms of suggesting that it too did not have time to react. The human driver might genuinely believe that he had insufficient time (he might be right, he might be mistaken), but the automation, working at the speed of onboard computers, could potentially have had time to do something. Plus, we’re removing the human mental coagulation time out of the equation when considering what the Autopilot automation system might have had time to do.
There is also a chance that the human driver might have assumed that the Autopilot was going to aid in the driving , doing so at this key or decisive moment, and thus the human driver might have instinctively delayed their own actions, spurred consciously or subconsciously under the assumption that their co-shared automation-based “driver” would come to their rescue.
Conclusion
Tesla typically points out in these kinds of incidents that it is the human driver that is responsible for the car, no matter what the Autopilot automation does or doesn’t do.
That’s a seemingly easy means to swipe away any possible limitations of the automation.
Plus, for human drivers, it is difficult to continually keep a mindset that you are presumably the captain of the ship, retaining ultimate responsibility , which is somewhat mentally undermined when you know that you have your second-in-command running things for you, the Autopilot, and then all of sudden, bam, turns out that you were supposed to be the one handling the controls (a Catch-22, as it were).
Furthermore, this kind of setup of Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) belies the aspect that the human driver might believe that the automation is going to do something, in spite of the human driver being informed possibly long-ago or as found in some owner’s manual that they cannot rely upon the automation. Human nature cannot be so readily overturned by merely telling someone to ignore their instincts or overcome what might have become an ingrained habit.
I have repeatedly forewarned that as we encounter the emergence of Level 2 with ADAS and Level 3 semi-autonomous cars coming into the marketplace, there will be a lot more of these kinds of incident s involving a co-shared human-machine driving effort that inevitably falters or fails to take what might have been suitable action to avoid or reduce a car crash.
Regrettably, get ready for more of this and brace yourself accordingly."
Intel Announces Shock Core i9-9900KS AMD Ryzen Killer And Most Powerful Mainstream CPU Ever,www.forbes.com,Antony Leather,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/05/26/intel-announces-shock-core-i9-9900ks-amd-ryzen-killer-and-most-powerful-mainstream-cpu-ever/,"The 2019 CPU war has just started as Intel has announced a surprise and unexpected CPU - the Core i9-9900KS Special Edition. The new CPU is essentially a speed-binned Core i9-9900K , but instead of having an all-core turbo frequency of 4.7GHz and a base frequency of 3.6GHz, the new speed king can reach a massive 5GHz all-core boost and has a base frequency of 4GHz too. That's out-of-the-box performance, yet that's what you'd largely expect from overclocking a Core i9-9900K. The best news is I already have performance numbers for a 5GHz all-core overclock for the 9900K, which you can see below and these should be a good reference for comparing against any performance data we hear from AMD tomorrow.
Intel's chief performance strategist Ryan Shrout announced the Core i9-9900KS as part of Taiwan's Computex technology show today.
Antony Leather ADVERTISEMENT We're yet to find out what AMD's Dr Lisa Su has in store for us tomorrow in terms of confirming the many leaks and rumors about 16-core CPUs and 5GHz frequencies, but Intel has just returned fire with the fastest and most powerful mainstream desktop CPU ever.
The Core i9-9900K already has AMD beat in every area thanks to the fact it offers higher frequencies (and admittedly higher price) than the Ryzen 7 2700X (in fact it's faster than the Threadripper 1920X in Adobe Premiere Pro), but the higher all-core boost will mean it will add a significant amount of performance to multi-threaded applications.
AMD has is widely expected to reveal its 3rd Generation Ryzen plans tomorrow at the Computex Keynote and Intel's CPU is clearly designed to steal its thunder. That's a little unlikely given the Ryzen hype train over the last few weeks, but in this case, I already have my own performance numbers to share for Intel's new CPU since I've overclocked the Core i9-9900K for my review back in October.
Below you can see my original results for the Core i9-9900K, but it's the overclocked figures you'll want to focus on as they will match up with the Core i9-9900KS.
Intel's Core i9-9900KS will perform roughly the same as an overclocked Core i9-9900K
Antony Leather
How much faster a 4K Adobe Premiere Pro export will be with the Core i9-9900KS versus 9900K
Antony Leather
What Far Cry 5 will look like with the Core i9-9900KS versus 9900K (see the overclocked 9900K data)
Antony Leather ADVERTISEMENT The CPU will still have integrated graphics as well as Intel's solder thermal interface or STIM and Intel said that availability will be better than the Core i7-8086K Anniversary Edition.
This is an interesting move from Intel and everything will rest on just how fast AMD's 3rd Gen Ryzen processors are and how it has priced them as to whether Intel's move is a drop in the ocean, or a real threat to AMD. I'll be reporting on this weeks announcements so make sure to follow me at any of the social media links below for more news."
Google's Pixel 4 Can Beat OnePlus 7 Pro With Two Features,www.forbes.com,Jay McGregor,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/05/26/googles-pixel-4-can-beat-oneplus-7-pro-with-two-features/,"The OnePlus 7 Pro has the Pixel 3 beat in a few ways - not least on battery life and memory management. The latter being a serious issue for Google’s flagship smartphone. On the other hand, OnePlus - and seemingly no other company - can match up to Google’s camera tech. But Google can’t ride its superior snapper forever, and it doesn’t paper over the other issues the Pixel 3 has. So how can Google improve on the Pixel 3 and beat one of its main Android competitors, the OnePlus 7 Pro?
Promos
Price is fast becoming the new battleground, and the OnePlus 7 Pro is winning at the moment . There’s increasingly little justification for charging up to, or over, $1000 for a device (Google doesn’t really do this, though), but OnePlus has shown it’s not necessary .
Google’s Pixel line is one of the cheaper top-end ranges out there, and it has operated below the top two smartphone makers - Samsung and Apple for a while. But Google will have to consider how it brings the cost of its Pixel 4 down if it wants to compete.
Pixel devices aren’t strangers to fairly dramatic price cuts, either. The Pixel 3 was discounted the month after launch, plus there were Black Friday and Christmas price drops (alongside intermittent deals throughout the last 6 months). Perhaps Google should build that into the launch price instead?
Also, Google has a host of other shiny gadgets at its disposal that it can bundle in with a Pixel phone. It already did this with the Pixel 3A at the UK Google store - selling a Nest with the mid-range device. A Pixel + free Nest hub would be a very attractive deal and further entrench buyers into Google's ecosystem.
Basic improvements
One potential consequence of the Huawei Android ban could be that consumers feel a little less comfortable about buying less established Android devices, especially from a Chinese manufacturer. Of course, the current situation is specific to Huawei but that might not have filtered down to the general public. On the day the news broke about Huawei, I saw a handful of tweets asking ‘what about OnePlus?’.
If trends do head that way, then the more established names - like Google - will benefit. But Google needs to make a lot of basic improvements to its current top-range Pixel devices if it wants to capture OnePlus fans. Namely, sorting out the memory management issues, which are still ongoing despite updates, which renders the phone sluggish to the point of unusable in some cases.
Also, the poor battery life on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL isn't good enough. The Pixel 2 had the best battery life I’ve used on a smartphone with similar power demands, but whatever combination of specs and software Google cobbled together for the Pixel 2 - it didn’t translate Pixel 3. Considering that battery, price and camera are the top three most important features to consumers, Google is in a good position to capture the market that has been ceded by Huawei and, ultimately, see off OnePlus.

Running Deep Learning Models On Intel Hardware? It's Time To Consider A Different OS,www.forbes.com,Janakiram MSV,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2019/05/26/running-deep-learning-models-on-intel-hardware-its-time-to-consider-a-different-os/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Enterprise & Cloud I cover Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin When it comes to training deep learning models, NVIDIA may be getting all the attention. However, Intel is not sitting quietly, just staring at the massive AI opportunity. It is moving fast in delivering end-to-end hardware and software platform optimized to run AI and ML models. Xeon Scalable Processors Intel
Firstly, Intel has done extensive work to make the Xeon family of processors highly optimized for AI. The Intel Xeon Scalable processors outsmart GPUs in accelerating the training on large datasets.
Intel is telling its customers that they don’t need expensive GPUs until they meet a threshold. Most of the deep learning training can be effectively done on CPUs that cost a fraction of their GPU counterparts.
Beyond the marketing messages and claims, Intel went onto prove that their deep learning stack performs better than NVIDIA GPU-based stack. Recently, Intel published a benchmark to show its leadership in deep learning. Intel Xeon Scalable processers trained a deep learning network with 7878 images per second on ResNet-50 outperforming 7844 images per second on NVIDIA Tesla V100.
Intel’s performance optimization doesn’t come just from its CPUs. It is delivered by a purpose-built software stack that is highly optimized at various levels. From the operating system to the TensorFlow framework, Intel has tweaked multiple layers of software to deliver unmatched performance.
To ease the process of running this end-to-end stack, Intel has turned to one of its open source projects called Clear Linux OS . Clear Linux project was started as a purpose-built, container-optimized, and lightweight operating system. It was started with the premise that the OS running a container doesn’t need to perform all the functions of a traditional OS. Container Linux , the OS developed by CoreOS (now a part of Red Hat) followed the same philosophy.
Within a short span, Clear Linux gained popularity among open source developers. Intel kept improving the OS, making it relevant to run modern workloads such as machine learning training jobs, AI inferencing, analytics and edge computing.
Clear Linux has become the foundation of Intel’s optimized software stack. Recently at the Open Source Technology Summit, Intel announced two reference architectures based on deep learning and advanced analytics stacks.
The Deep Learning Reference Stack is an integrated, highly-performant open source stack optimized for Intel Xeon Scalable Processors. This stack includes Intel Advanced Vector Extensions 512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX 512 VNNI) and is designed to accelerate AI use cases such as image recognition, object detection, speech recognition and language translation. Customers can use this to train complex neural networks meant for advanced use cases. Deep Learning Stack Intel
The Data Analytics Reference Stack was developed to help enterprises analyze, classify, recognize, and process large amounts of data, built on Intel Xeon Scalable platforms using Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. Data Analytics Stack Intel
These stacks are built on the foundation of Clear Linux that run the containerized workloads. When running in distributed environments, Kubernetes is used as the preferred orchestrator.
Apart from deep learning and analytics, Intel’s Clear Linux can be used to run applications at the edge powered by AWS Greengrass.
Clear Linux OS can be even run on developer desktops. Jason Evangelho, a fellow contributor at Forbes, published an excellent review of this OS.
Before you switch to expensive hardware and software stacks to run deep learning jobs, give Intel’s Clear Linux a chance. Janakiram MSV Contributor

A summary of the play is as follows:
It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children.
While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.
In a joint statement, Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender said:
Each new production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is magical in its own unique way. With each city we open our show in, and with each company of actors, we uncover something new and exciting. We can’t wait to see what surprises the Toronto production will bring.
""Toronto, with its rich history of culture and the arts, is the perfect city in which to stage our magical production in Canada. We’re especially thrilled to be producing the Canadian premiere with David Mirvish and his company and that the historic Ed Mirvish Theatre - which will be specially refurbished for our show - will be Cursed Child’s Canadian home.
The production opened in Summer 2016 at the West End's Palace Theatre, and has since made its debut at the Lyric Theatre on Broadway, and at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, Australia. The play will also open in San Francisco, Hamburg and now Toronto over the next year.
David Mirvish said on the latest addition to the play's global debuts:
Since it first opened in London in 2016, only three years ago, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has established itself as one of the most accomplished and remarkable productions in theatre history. In fact, it is more than a play: it is an event that has already galvanized audiences in London, New York and Melbourne.
The show will soon do the same in upcoming productions in Hamburg and San Francisco. I can’t express strongly enough how honoured we are that Sonia and Colin have chosen Toronto to be the next location for their magnificent production.
The Harry Potter stories have already touched the lives of millions and millions of people through the books and movies. I’m very excited about how this play has managed to continue the story on the theatre stage. Furthermore, because it has been brilliantly created by some of the world’s top theatre artists, the play has brought more and more people to live theatre, giving them an experience of pure theatricality that cannot be replicated in any other medium.
The play shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon, continuing to break sales records across the board. In the week ending December 30th 2018, the play grossed over $2.5 million in ticket sales, passing its own record set in November for highest grossing play in Broadway history. After winning nine Olivier awards and six Tony Awards, the show will no doubt continue to expand. The West End production's fourth cast had its first performance this week, and the play's award-winning score by composer Imogen Heap made its debut as an official album last November.
ADVERTISEMENT Cursed Child 's Canadian premiere will be the sixth production of the play. Its debut in Germany will see the cast perform the play for the first time in a language other than English, and it will be interesting to see if the play will continue to venture beyond English-speaking audiences in expected future expansions."
"The Brain Can Give Birth To New Cells Throughout Life, Study Finds",www.forbes.com,Alice G. Walton,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2019/05/26/the-brain-can-give-birth-to-new-cells-throughout-life-study-finds/,"Share to linkedin Getty Researchers used to think that after adolescence, people were pretty well stuck with the brain cells they’d already formed. No so anymore. Discoveries in recent years have shown that neurogenesis—the formation of new neurons—can occur much later than this, well into adulthood. And now, a new study from the University of Illinois at Chicago finds that brain cells can form into one’s nineties, even if one has cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (though at a much decelerated rate). The question is how the late-in-life growth of new neurons fits into what’s already known about degenerative diseases.
The study was published last week in the journal Cell Stem Cell.
The researchers looked at the postmortem brains of people aged 79-99, some of whom had had cognitive decline or Alzheimer’s disease. They targeted markers for two kinds of burgeoning cells—neuroblasts (stem cells that would one day give rise to neurons), and immature neurons—in the hippocampus, the brain area that's most affected in Alzheimer’s disease.
People who had died without cognitive problems had proliferation of both kinds of cells in their brains. People with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s also had evidence of the cells, but in much lower numbers. Lazarov, neurogenesis study Courtesy, Orly Lazarov, et al.
""We found that there was active neurogenesis in the hippocampus of older adults well into their 90s,"" said study author Orly Lazarov in a statement. ""The interesting thing is that we also saw some new neurons in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment.""
What was interesting was the finding that people who had scored higher on tests of cognition during their later lives had more neuroblasts in their hippocampi, compared to those who’d scored lower—and this was independent of the level of degeneration that was visible in the brain.
""In brains from people with no cognitive decline who scored well on tests of cognitive function, these people tended to have higher levels of new neural development at the time of their death, regardless of their level of pathology,"" Lazarov said. ""The mix of the effects of pathology and neurogenesis is complex and we don't understand exactly how the two interconnect, but there is clearly a lot of variation from individual to individual.""
The finding is intriguing since it’s long been known that a person’s level of brain ""gunk"" (the plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease) doesn’t always correlate with their cognitive and behavioral symptoms. So it’s possible that these new findings helps explain why this disconnect exists—perhaps the level of neurogenesis matters as much or more than the amount of plaques and tangles that develop. If that’s true, then the big question would be how to harness this for therapeutic purposes.
""The fact that we found that neural stem cells and new neurons are present in the hippocampus of older adults means that if we can find a way to enhance neurogenesis, through a small molecule, for example, we may be able to slow or prevent cognitive decline in older adults, especially when it starts, which is when interventions can be most effective,"" said Lazarov.
More research will obviously be needed to understand all of this, but preventing cognitive decline and dementia is probably the way to go, especially since medications to treat Alzheimer's after the fact have fallen flat in recent years. In the meantime, the study is encouraging on another level: Certain lifestyle habits—most notably exercise—have consistently been shown to boost neurogenesis. The findings suggest we’d do well to pick up exercise, and other brain-healthy habits, and engage in them for as much of our lives as we can, as regularly as we’re able.

"Devin Haney vs. Antonio Moran, Herring Vs. Ito Video Highlights, Weekend Fight Reviews",www.forbes.com,Josh Katzowitz,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshkatzowitz/2019/05/26/haney-vs-moran-herring-vs-ito-video-highlights-weekend-fight-reviews/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Devin Haney (left) delivered a knockout of the year candidate vs. Antonio Moran. (Photo by Will Newton/Getty Images) Getty Devin Haney finished Antonio Moran in fantastic form. Jamel Herring got emotional after his fight vs. Masayuki Ito. And neither Austin Trout nor Terrell Gausha got any satisfaction.
But let’s go a little deeper, and let’s watch (or rewatch) some of the tape. Here’s everything you might have missed in boxing this weekend.
Notable weekend fights:
--In his debut on the DAZN streaming service, Devin Haney (22-0, 14 KOs) looked spectacular, knocking out Antonio Moran (24-4) in the seventh round with a walloping right hand. Originally, Haney was supposed to be fighting Luke Campbell for a vacant lightweight title. Instead, Vasiliy Lomachenko—who’s No. 1 on my pound-for-pound list —got that fight. So, Haney made the best of his new opponent, knocking Moran down with a body shot in the fifth. Replays showed that Haney stepped on his feet while landing a punch, and the knockdown probably should have been ruled a slip. But later that round, Haney appeared to legitimately hurt Moran. Then, in the seventh, Haney’s right hand ended the fight.
Haney didn’t get his chance at a title vs. Campbell. But he’ll likely get a shot at a belt soon enough, and the 20-year-old is definitely dangerous enough to win it.
--In an extremely emotional victory, Jamel Herring (20-2, 10 KOs) won his first world title by outboxing and outpointing Masayuki Ito (25-2-1) to take his junior lightweight belt by unanimous decision. Herring, the former Marine fighting on Memorial Day weekend, was also remembering his late daughter, Ariyanah, who died as a baby from SIDS and who would have turned 10 years old on Saturday. And he simply out-classed Ito for most of the fight with an accurate jab and by slipping many of Ito’s attempts with solid defense. Afterward, Herring was nearly speechless with emotion. But Miguel Berchelt, the ruler at 130 pounds, came into the ring for the post-fight interviews, to congratulate Herring and to challenge him to a title unification fight. Herring would be the underdog vs. Berchelt, but keep in mind that he was also a slight +165 underdog vs. Ito. The final moments of this World Title Fight. Who do you have winning? #ItoHerring | @ESPN pic.twitter.com/hgxpMc4UzA

Afterward, Herring gave Ito back his belt. Boxing can be a brutal sport but in the end it’s a sport. Thank you @masayukiito0630 for the opportunity, you’re a good champion, but better person and you will be a world champion again! #SemperFi #TheJudge pic.twitter.com/XDecmqYXzV
— Jamel Herring (@JamelHerring) May 26, 2019
--Though it appeared Terrell Gausha (21-1-1, 10 KOs) did enough to pull off the biggest win of his career vs. Austin Trout (31-5-1, 17 KOs), the judges ruled it a split draw. The judges scored it 99-91 for Gausha, 96-94 for Trout and 95-95. In his biggest fight previous fight before Saturday, Gausha lost a unanimous decision to Erislandy Lara in 2017. He probably should have gotten his big win on Saturday. Unfortunately for him, not all the judges saw it that way. Though Trout said he’d like a rematch, Gausha doesn’t seem interested. “I feel like I want to do bigger and better things,” he said, via Premier Boxing Champions . “I feel like I won the fight.”

Box Office: 'Avengers: Endgame' Tops $800 Million Domestic And Nears $2.7 Billion Worldwide,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/05/26/box-office-avengers-endgame-tops-800-million-domestic-and-nears-27-billion-worldwide/,"Marvel and Walt Disney’s Avengers: Endgame earned an additional $17.2 million (-43%) over its fifth Fri-Sun weekend frame and $22.4 million over the Fri-Mon holiday. That gives the Russo Bros.’ comic book superhero sequel a new 32-day domestic cume of $803.73 million. So, yeah, it’s over the $800 million mark in a month of domestic release, becoming just the second movie in history (sans inflation) to do so after Star Wars: The Force Awakens . And that $803.7 million cume puts it just above the adjusted-for-inflation totals of Raiders of the Lost Ark ($797 million), The Sting ($803 million) and The Lion King ($803 million). That puts the MCU flick in 19th place on the list of inflation-adjusted domestic earners. Presuming it makes it to at least $850 million, it’ll end its domestic run in 16th place between Return of the Jedi ($847 million) and Avatar ($877 million).
If you remove the films that have only sold more tickets than Avengers 4 ’s presumed $850 million total due to theatrical reissues (sorry Empire Strikes Back , 101 Dalmatians and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ), that will put it in 13th place on the adjusted list. However, if it continues to play like Avengers: Infinity War, which had earned 92.4% of its $679 million cume by the end of Memorial Day weekend, it’ll end up at around $869 million. That would be more than the inflation-adjusted total for Avatar sans its brief August-of-2010 reissue.
So, no, Avengers: Endgame is not going to get anywhere near the $937 million domestic total of Star Wars: The Force Awakens . The perfect storm of a long-dormant franchise, rave reviews, terrific word-of-mouth and those unbeatable Christmas-to-New Years’ legs just can’t be replicated no matter how high a movie opens.
I guess if Marvel and Disney want a shot at that milestone, they have to hope that Avatar 2 over performs or perhaps they can slot Avengers 5 for that key pre-Christmas weekend. Of course, Disney just went and slotted Avatar sequels and Star Wars movies on that weekend for every Christmas from 2021 to 2027, so that’s probably not going to happen. So I guess it’s up to Avatar 2 to take a crack at it, to say nothing of threatening Avatar ’s $2.788 billion milestone by virtue of expanded overseas markets.
Nonetheless, Avengers: Endgame is near the $2.7 billion mark after this weekend, with a likely cume of $2.685 billion after Monday. It will soon be (obviously) the second movie to do so aside from Avatar . It’s still something of a coin toss as to whether Avengers: Endgame passes the $2.788 billion global cume of Avatar . Inflation means that Avatar and obviously Titanic sold a lot more tickets back in their respective days. Overseas expansion means that Endgame had the opportunity to earn a lot more overseas than the James Cameron flicks, but I digress.
Nonetheless, to state the obvious, a likely $850-$870 million domestic total and a presumed over/under $2.79 billion global cume is a massive win no matter which milestones it does or doesn’t reach and/or which records it does or does not break. That said, it will be a little easier for Walt Disney (which now owns Fox) to market Avatar 2 in 2021 if they can still sell it as the biggest movie of all time. So that’s a good news/bad news scenario."
Does Greed Drive Deutsche Bank Other Banks Not To File Suspicious Activity Reports?,www.forbes.com,Mayra Rodriguez Valladares,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/05/26/does-greed-drive-deutsche-bank-and-other-banks-not-to-file-suspicious-activity-reports/,"The more information comes out in dribs and drabs about and from Deutsche Bank, I remain convinced that something is truly rotten there. But is that the only bank that has these operational risk management problems? David Enrich of the New York Times, wrote recently that reportedly, five current and former Deutsche Bank, anti-money-laundering professionals found in 2016 and 2017 that multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by Donald Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, set off alerts in a computer system designed to detect illicit activity. These alerts reportedly led compliance staff members to review the transactions and to report suspicious activity reports (SARs) to senior managers that they believed should be sent to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ), a US Treasury Department that polices financial crimes.
U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio
A good outcome has been that Enrich’s article led Senators Sherrod Brown and Chris Van Hollen to write Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing with a number of important questions about Deutsche Bank’s SARs processes. With any luck, Herr Sewing will respond by the requested date of May 30. Other bank executives would benefit by taking a good luck at Brown's and Van Hollen's letter.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.
When I match Enrich’s account with the good step-by-step explanation by Bloomberg’s Yalman Onaran of how SARs are supposed to work, “ What’s Suspicious? Here’s How Banks Apply the Smell Test ,” the compliance officers did what they are supposed to do. Why then did Deutsche Bank executives ignore the advice of compliance officers both in 2016 and 2017 and not file SARs reports? And if this happens at Deutsche Bank, what assurances do we have from bank risk managers and bank regulators that Deutsche like behavior is not happening on a daily basis at other big banks?
According to Ross Delston , a lawyer and international anti-money laundering expert, alerts that arise at any financial institution (FI) must be followed up by the FI. Further, after an alert is investigated and the FI verifies that suspicious activities are confirmed, a SAR must be filed. The failure to do either or both can have serious consequences. “In such cases, there should be an investigation by the Feds as to whether there were willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), including the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program requirements and SAR reporting requirements, which if willful, could be a criminal offense, and if not willful, a civil violation, that in either case could lead to millions in fines and penalties.”
Ross Delston
Ross S. Delston Law Office Importantly, now that this information is out in the public domain, we should all be asking what are American and European off-site supervisors and on-site bank examiners with responsibility for Deutsche Bank, and for that matter other internationally active banks, going to do? The European Central Bank, German regulator BaFin , and the German central bank, Deutsche Bundesbank, are responsible for the consolidated supervision of Deutsche Bank. In February of this year, BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank to review its risk management processes in correspondent banking in order to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. BaFin has expanded the mandate of a special monitoring representative it had appointed on September 2018 .
In the U.S. the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York Department of Financial Services are responsible for supervising and examining Deutsche Bank’s activities in the U.S. The Federal Financial Examination Institutions Council’s, Suspicious Activity Overview of the Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual states that “FinCEN and the federal banking agencies recognize that, as a practical matter, it is not possible for a bank to detect and report all potentially illicit transactions that flow through the bank.” Yet the online manual clearly states that “Examiners should focus on evaluating a bank’s policies, procedures, and processes to identify, evaluate, and report suspicious activity. However, as part of the examination process, examiners should review individual SAR filing decisions to determine the effectiveness of the banks’ suspicious activity identification, evaluation, and reporting process.” In other words, the Federal Reserve Bank’s examiners can ask for all the documentation with the SAR filing decisions taken in respect to Trump and Kushner and analyze whether all processes and procedures were followed correctly. Remember, Fed examiners are not investigators. That is the job of FinCEN. Yet examiners, can make sure that rules and guidelines around anti-money laundering and SARs filings are being followed.
Given that rules for banks and procedures for bank examiners related to SARs are clear, why do banks sometimes fail to file SARs? When I spoke to Delston, he explained that investigation of alerts resulting in a decision to file a SAR should lead to a series of actions by the bank, including –
Conducting Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) on the customer; Comparing expected transactions to actual transactions to see if there are anomalies between what was disclosed by the customer at the onboarding with the customer’s usage of the account; Raising the customer’s risk rating, which would cause more frequent Customer due Diligence (CDD)/Know Your Customer (KYC) refresh, typically annually for the highest risk category; Heightened monitoring; and Depending on all of the above, could ultimately lead to a decision by the bank as to whether they should keep the customer. Due to the amount of personnel, time, and costs involved to follow the steps outlined by Delston, I cannot help but wonder whether the desire to save on compliance costs and the obsession not to lose potentially profitable clients, convinces senior management and executives not to do the right thing, not only at Deutsche Bank, but possibly at other financial institutions. It is critical that bank and financial regulators, as well as legislators, research and investigate these media reports seriously. In addition to outstanding questions about money laundering, there is still the unanswered question of whether Trump committed bank fraud when he requested multiple loans from Deutsche Bank. In a piece I wrote in April this year, I included the questions that bank supervisors and bank examiners typically should ask when trying to determine if an individual committed bank fraud. If Trump inflated his net worth, then the banks and federal authorities should be looking into this with serious urgency.
Until Deutsche Bank can accurately answer questions about its anti-money laundering and fraud detection processes and procedures, as I wrote in April, Deutsche Bank needs to increase its capital for operational risk to sustain unexpected losses due to breaches in the day-to-day running of a firm due to people, processes, systems, and pay higher fines in order to stop its money laundering and fraud recidivism. Taxpayers should not bear losses that could end up happening due to Deutsche Bank’s weak operational risk."
About The MacBook 'Butterfly' Keyboard Problem: I've Had 5 Keyboards,www.forbes.com,Brooke Crothers,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2019/05/26/about-the-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-problem-ive-had-5-keyboards/,"I've had five Apple ""butterfly"" keyboards. Let's see, two 12-inch Retina MacBooks: first*- and second-generations, a 15-inch MacBook Pro (mid-2017), a 13-inch MacBook Pro (mid-2017), and 2018 Retina MacBook Air.
So, in short, I've used every generation of butterfly keyboard on five different MacBooks save the very latest on the updated 2019 MacBook Pro announced May 21.
tl;dr: I've never had the problem described widely in the media (e.g., keys that aren't responsive or failure in general ) with any of the Butterfly keyboards on the MacBooks listed above.
I used all of the MacBooks above extensively but I submitted the first-gen 12-inch MacBook and mid-2017 15-inch MacBook Pro to special abuse, i.e., hauling them around the country, using them on planes/at airports, in coffee shops/restaurants, in the car, in the mountains/desert etc.
Plenty of opportunity for dust, dirt, mud, food, liquid to break the Butterfly mechanism or render the keyboard unusable. Maybe I just got lucky. Or maybe there are other people like me out there that haven't had a problem.
The obvious disclaimer is, I'm not saying that MacBook owners haven't had issues with the Butterfly keyboard. AppleInsider said it "" found out in April 2018 the failure rates were double that of previous mechanisms .""
I'm just saying I've been using the butterfly keyboards since the very beginning and not had issues. So it shouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker if you're considering a new MacBook.
Finally, I will say that I typically clean my laptop keyboard every few days. Nothing major -- t akes two minutes. With a vacuum, I gently suck out (or blow it out if I don't have access to the vacuum) all of the dust, dirt, food, or whatever has landed in the keyboard over the course of a few days. And then clean it with a special cloth. More tips here .

*T he 2015 first-gen 12-inch MacBook was the first keyboard with a Butterfly mechanism from Apple. All new MacBooks now come with keyboards with the butterfly mechanism.
My Retina MacBook Air (2018) and 13-inch MacBook Pro (mid-2017). Both have 'butterfly' keyboards.

What The Heck Is NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr. Doing At The Indy 500?,www.forbes.com,Dave Caldwell,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davecaldwell/2019/05/26/what-the-heck-is-nascars-dale-earnhardt-jr-doing-at-the-indy-500/,"NBC will telecast the Indianapolis 500 for the first time Sunday, and, just to hammer home the point that NBC is taking this a lot more seriously than ABC did or Fox is with its tired NASCAR coverage, the broadcast team will include two extremely high-profile former NASCAR drivers: Danica Patrick and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Before she jumped from Indy cars to NASCAR in 2010, Patrick became famous for becoming the first woman to lead the Indy 500 and wrapped up her career (she says) by driving in the Indy 500 last year for the eighth time. So she is a known open-wheel commodity at the Brickyard.
Dale Jr.? He drove 17 times in the Brickyard 400, NASCAR's slowpoke answer to the Indy 500, but the Indianapolis 500 is a completely different event. It is the world's biggest auto race, contested for the 103d time Sunday.
For nearly two decades, the Indy 500 took a back seat to the Coca-Cola 600, the NASCAR race held later the day before Memorial Day, but the Indy 500 is bigger again, with a terrific buzz.
Between 2006 and 2014, the NASCAR race in Charlotte had better TV ratings than the Indy 500 except for one year. A year ago, the last Indy 500 to be televised by ABC out-drew the Coke 600, 4.91 million viewers to 4.09 million viewers.
Now NBC is pushing its first telecast of the Indy 500 hard, cross-promoting the race with other shows on the network and adding Earnhardt and Patrick as analysts. It will be difficult to recapture all the viewers who walked away, b ut NBC has injected some excitement into the biggest day for auto racing in America, and the Indy 500 will be worth at least a peek.
Earnhardt will serve again as the analyst for NBC's NASCAR telecasts over the second half of the season, but NBC has been shrewdly using him to promote all of its sports telecasts, like the Super Bowl, Kentucky Derby and the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Fox still has the Coke 600, one of NASCAR's biggest races. But NBC has one of NASCAR's biggest names, and he will be 585 miles from the Charlotte Motor Speedway.
""It’s going to be a lot of emotion, a lot of energy,"" Earnhardt said Thursday on a conference call with reporters. ""It’s going to be something like I’ve never witnessed before, and I can’t wait to have fun on Sunday during the show.
""Pre-race is going to be a lot of fun, at least for us as we move around, and I’m going to be able to see this race for the first time from such an incredible perspective as part of this broadcast team. Just coming out here — I would be here anyway whether NBC sent me or not. But this will be from a perspective like no other.""
Earnhardt will drive the pace car for the race, and he will be roaming the Indianapolis Motor Speedway with Rutledge Wood, the NBC reporter who covers offbeat angles of NASCAR, filing reports on quirky stuff, like maybe the ""Snake Pit,"" the speedway's sometimes unruly mosh pit. ABC did a little of that, but NBC will be leaning on Earnhardt. He really does sound enthusiastic about this assignment.
"" NBC has been sending me all over the place for the last several months to experience a lot of new things, and this is another amazing trip, and I can’t wait to get to work with my buddy Rutledge and see what the Indianapolis 500 is all about,"" Earnhardt said. ""It’s going to be a lot of emotion, a lot of energy. It’s going to be something like I’ve never witnessed before, and I can’t wait to have fun on Sunday during the show.
""Pre-race is going to be a lot of fun, at least for us as we move around, and I’m going to be able to see this race for the first time from such an incredible perspective as part of this broadcast team. Just coming out here — I would be here anyway whether NBC sent me or not, but this will be from a perspective like no other.""
Pay attention. Earnhardt will be helping to provide a taste of how NBC will carry auto racing in the future, relying heavily on personalities to bridge the gaps when the cars seem to be just going around in circles. NBC covered new ground with a documentary earlier this month on Mario Andretti, the immigrant from Italy who won the 1969 Indy 500.
""I don’t think everyone had a full understanding of where he came from and what he was able to accomplish from these very humble roots,"" Sam Flood, the executive director of NBC Sports, said in the conference call.
""And that story is symbolic of what we try and do at NBC, make you care about people, take you inside a story at a different level, and that’s the training we have here for years, and we’re hoping we can tell those same kind of stories on Sunday and get more people to come back beyond the 500.
""We hope if the fans can fall in love with some of these drivers in this sport and this event that they’ll join us the following weekend in Detroit for the double-header there. And that’s part of the job is welcoming the entire sports fan world to this and not just the race-car fan."""
Box Office: Keanu Reeves' 'John Wick 3' Tops 'John Wick 2' As 'Pikachu' Passes $350 Million,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/05/26/box-office-john-wick-keanu-reeves-pickachu-pokemon-hathaway-hustle-intruder-dogs-journey/,"In holdover news for the weekend that isn’t about Avengers: Endgame, John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum earned $24.7 million (-57%) in its second Fri-Sun weekend. That’s a better hold than Deadpool 2 (-65%) but not as strong of a hold as Pitch Perfect 2 (-55%) and Mad Max: Fury Road (-43%) on this same weekend. Nonetheless, that still gives the $75 million-budgeted threequel a $100 million ten-day domestic cume. We can expect a $30 million Fri-Mon holiday haul for a $107 million 11-day domestic total. That easily pushes John Wick 3 over the $92 million cume of John Wick: Chapter 2 . Its new $181 million global cume is just above the $171 million cume of John Wick: Chapter 2 . We’ll see if it can stick around long enough to become the rare non- Hunger Games / Twilight Lionsgate release to top $300 million worldwide. But it’s still in the realm of possibility. The real “holy crap” milestone is if it legs out to $184 million (not likely) and $342 million (less likely) to top the domestic and global gross of John Wick 2 , essentially having a trilogy where the first two sequels doubled their respective predecessors.
Still, even legs like Pitch Perfect 2 and Deadpool 2 after Memorial Day gets the R-rated actioner to $155 million domestic. And if it continues to play 57/43 domestic/overseas, it’ll end up with $269 million worldwide. That will still be a 57% jump from the first sequel, which is darn-near unprecedented (I need a few hours to do the research) for a threequel to a sequel that essentially doubled the grosses of its predecessor. Again, we’re talking Captain America- sized jumps, without any added-value Avengers to spice up the stew. This is just a case of John Wick growing as an IP.
Warner Bros. and Legendary’s Pokémon: Detective Pikachu earned another $13.3 million (-47%) in its third weekend of domestic release, giving it a $116 million 17-day cume. It’ll be past $120 million by tomorrow, with its sights set on the $131 million (unadjusted) domestic cume of Tomb Raider . That will make Detective Pikachu the biggest domestic earner ever for a video game movie. The Ryan Reynolds/Justice Smith comic fantasy earned $24 million overseas for a new $236.8 million overseas and $352.9 million global cume. That puts it behind only Rampage ($428 million) and Warcraft ($433 million) among all video game movies.
It’ll still probably reach the mountaintop, but just barely. And next weekend, it must contend with another very expensive WB/Legendary release, Godzilla: King of the Monsters . And with a $150 million budget, it’s more of a “halfway decent earner” as opposed to a runaway hit, although that it earned a lot more of its money in North America as opposed to China works in its favor. A sequel is still a coin toss, but the notion of dropping a little domestically but increasing overseas isn’t the worst scenario if the budget remains at or below the $150 million mark.
Universal/Comcast’s A Dog’s Journey earned $4.09 million (-49%) over the Fri-Sun of its likely $5.4 million Fri-Mon holiday weekend gross. That’ll give it a $16.241 million 11-day cume, or still under A Dog’s Purpose ’s $17 million opening weekend. Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson’s The Hustle earned $3.812 million (-38%) over the Fri-Sun portion of its likely $5 million Fri-Mon weekend. That’ll give the $21 million-budgeted con artist comedy a $31 million 18-day domestic cume but a robust $66 million worldwide total (mostly thanks to Universal/Comcast). Sony’s The Intruder continues to leg it out with a $2.265 million (-44%) Fri-Sun/$3.13 million Fri-Mon fourth weekend for a $32.8 million 25-day domestic cume."
Can Israel Become A Nation Of Startup Marathoners?,www.forbes.com,Peter Cohan,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/05/26/can-israel-become-a-nation-of-startup-marathoners/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin TEL AVIV, ISRAEL - CIRCA MAY 2018: Beautiful view of Tel Aviv in Israel circa May 2018 in Tel Aviv. Getty Having returned a week ago from Israel, I remain impressed by its strengths as a place to start companies.
Yet Israel strikes me as somewhere in the middle of a transformation -- from a nation that starts and sells companies to the likes of Google and Intel to one that hosts its own publicly-traded world-transforming industry leaders -- on the order of Facebook and Google.
My visit to Israel was part of a Babson College Israel Startup Strategy Elective Abroad for 22 undergraduates. The first part of the course was classroom learning focused on three questions: Why does private capital flow more to some countries than others? (based on Capital Rising , which I co-authored with Srini Rangan) Why do a few regions host most of the startups and what should the rest do about it? (based on my 13th book Startup Cities ); and Why do a few startups succeed while most fail? (based on my 12th book, Hungry Start-up Strategy ).
The second part of the course -- which wrapped up May 19 -- was a visit to Israeli startups, investors, accelerators, and government officials -- along with cultural activities.
In the third part of the course, student teams conduct six week consulting projects with startups in a startup incubator called 8200 Impact who are seeking help with their growth strategies.
How Israel Changed Its Narrative
Israel's Startup Nation narrative has been well-established in many minds -- due in part to the success of the 2009 eponymous book. To counter the image of the country as a source of endless conflict, many now see Israel as an extraordinary entrepreneurial success story, Mike Bargman, CEO of Headline Media, a Tel Aviv-based PR firm said during our May 15 meeting.
The 71 year old nation of nine million people has in the space of a few decades turned itself into a country with more IPOs per capita than any other.
Since most everyone enters the military before starting university, Israel trains people to lead others and -- for the elite who are selected for its 8200 and 8100 units (analogous to our NSA) -- gives them deep knowledge of technologies that can form the basis of new companies.
Israel's leading universities and research institutes -- such as the Technion, the Weizmann Institute, Hebrew University, and Tel Aviv University -- also supply intellectual property that finds its way into startups.
Israel faces many handicaps -- it has a small local market, it's surrounded by hostile countries, it lacks natural resources, and it has limited venture capital -- particularly to fund the growth needed to go public.
Yet it has overcome many of these challenges. By developing technology in Israel and bringing on talented country managers, its companies have been able to gain share in huge markets for cybersecurity. On May 16, Andy David of Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that 20% of the world's 2,200 cybersecurity companies are in Israel.
The Israeli government continues to fund research partnerships with countries around the world to bring more corporate and venture capital into Israel. For example, the Israel Innovation Authority spends $500 million a year to fund innovation, Les Abelson told us on May 16.
That money -- which is matched by partners in other countries -- is paid out in $400,000 grants to startups -- in industries including cybersecurity, life sciences, and nanotechnology. For every $1 invested, Abelson believes that the Israeli economy gets back $5 to $10. As he said, ""We lose 70% of the money we give out -- which creates valuable learning -- but 30% we get back in royalties.""
I have been following one of Israel's early public technology companies, cybersecurity technology provider Check Point Software , for nearly two decades.
As I wrote in April 2018, Check Point CEO, Gil Shwed told me that he wants the company to grow faster than its 7% five year average. But over a year later there is more work to be done. In the latest quarter , Check Point reported 4% revenue growth -- though Shwed seemed happy that its ""subscriptions including advanced solutions for Cloud and Mobile as well as SandBlast Zero day threat prevention"" were up 13%.
We also visited with website development service, Wix , which grew at an impressive 27% rate in the latest quarter. On May 20 I wrote about why its organization and management processes bode well for its future.
People we met were proud to discuss the sale of Israeli companies to U.S. giants. Examples include Google's 2013 acquisition of mapping service Waze for an estimated $1.3 billion and Intel's $15.3 billion takeover of autonomous vehicle control technology supplier Mobileye .
Can Israeli Entrepreneurs Run the Marathon?
This brings me to what I believe is the most significant transformation that Israel must undertake -- from a creator of business leaders whom I call sprinters -- who can turn an idea into a company that gets acquired -- to a nation of marathoners -- who take such companies public, generate revenues in the billions of dollars, and keep growing at 20% or more. (I spelled out the differences between such leaders in my new book, Scaling Your Startup ).
This matters because if Israel can produce more marathoners, it can host more pillar companies -- locally-headquartered, public companies that invest in local startups -- to create more local jobs and provide tax revenue to help fund the build-out of infrastructure needed to reduce the traffic and housing crunch that accompanies Israel's current economic success.
Is Israel Germinating the Next Amazon or Facebook?
This is hard to do -- and at the moment there seems to be a lull in new Israeli marathoner candidates. As Bloomberg reported, the number of recent Israeli IPOs has tailed off. After 17 in 2014, there were only six in 2016 and eight in 2018. As of March 2019, there were seven -- in payments, cybersecurity, ride sharing, and other fields -- that Bloomberg considered to be in the IPO pipeline.
Indeed, since then one of the companies -- cybersecurity supplier Tufin Software -- has gone public. On April 12, Tufin sold shares on NASDAQ at $21 -- about where its stock sits now -- yielding a $698 million market capitalization on 2018 sales of $85 million up 30% from the year before and a $4.3 million loss, according to YahooFinance .
Another IPO aspirant, Gett Taxi, a ride-hailing service -- recently raised $200 million at a $1.5 billion valuation, according to TechCrunch , and expects to go public in 2020. It would probably be better for Gett if by then shares of Uber and Lyft have risen from their current dismal levels.
In March 2018 I met with Shlomo Kramer, who helped found many Israeli companies that went public including Check Point, Imperva, and Palo Alto Networks. Kramer -- co-founder and CEO of a new startup, Cato Networks-- told me that Israel is trying to build companies to last -- and to that end he is mentoring first-time Israeli entrepreneurs.
Meanwhile, Israeli startups are germinating in fields such as ""transportation, foodtech, femtech [technology for women's health and other needs], and cannatech [cannabis-related startups],"" said Bargman.
While there do not seem to be any Israeli companies in the making with the potential to scale like Amazon, Facebook or Google, $900 million venture capital firm, Vertex Ventures, has funded some other big winners with a more narrow focus.
For example, as Emanuel Timor, General Partner, pointed out in a May 15 interview, Vertex has backed publicly-traded solar energy electronics supplier, SolarEdge -- which sports a $2.6 billion market capitalization on sales of $937 million, up 54% in the last year, and a 14% net profit margin. And Vertex backed anti-vehicle hacking supplier, Argus Cyber Security, was acquired in 2017 for $400 million by German automobile industry supplier, Continental.
Timor sees opportunity in many areas. As he said, ""We are investing in cloud platforms, security, big data, digital transformation, automotive, fintech, digital health, and AI.""
Attacking Global Markets Through Critical Infrastructure Control
Of all the companies we met, it strikes me that mPrest, a maker of complex control systems used in an array of industries, could become a large company that leads the world.
As a private company, I don't know its revenues or growth rate. But since it has raised $30 million in rounds led by GE Capital and New Zealand energy utility, Vector, according to CrunchBase , rather than venture capital firms, I am guessing that the company does not want to cede control to investors.
As I wrote last July , mPrest is best-known for providing key technology for Israel's so-called Iron Dome -- a system intended to keep missiles headed to Israel from harming people or property.
I am impressed that mPrest has been able to extend its expertise in such control systems to other industries. As CEO Natan Barak said on May 15, mPrest's technology is used in ""border control, critical facilities, water, smart agriculture, connected cars, smart cities, power, and oil and gas."" Barak's mantra is ""flexibility is the name of the game.""
While mPrest has competitors, it often wins against them. As Barak said. ""We beat Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for a contract award in the UK. That's because the commercial world is looking for a cloud-based application. Our competitors require customers to take out the old and install the new. Our solution [is better and more cost-effective] because it works on top of what they have already.""
mPrest has technological expertise that's useful to many industries around the world. Yet its investors are not venture capital firms -- who typically seek rapid growth followed by a quick exit. And Barak was not clear about the company's exit strategy.
If more Israeli startup marathoners such as Shwed emerge, I will be excited to talk with them. In the meantime, it remains to be seen whether the CEOs leading Israel's 2019 crop of IPO candidates will be among them.

Cal Stamenov Of Lucia At Bernardus Lodge Is One Of the Top 10 Chefs In California,www.forbes.com,Kim Westerman,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimwesterman/2019/05/26/cal-stamenov-of-lucia-at-bernardus-lodge-is-one-of-the-top-10-chefs-in-california/,"Lucia Restaurant at Carmel Valley's Bernardus Lodge & Spa is not exactly a hidden gem — the dining room is always full, and the adjacent bar is hopping all night long. So, why isn't Cal Stamenov a household name? His quiet, confident presence in the various iterations of the destination inn's kitchens he's helmed for 20 years, and his freedom to explore his own culinary intuitions, make him, in my book, one of California's top 10 chefs. There's something magical about a world-class restaurant inside a hotel. It's a context that inspires relaxation, leisurely meals, and sensory exploration beyond the bounds of the dining space. You never know what you might find when you sit down at Stamenov's table. It happened to be truffle season last time I visited, and he made an off-menu gnocchi in a rich butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano sauce with translucent shaved truffles on top.

The restaurant has one of the best wine lists in the country, curated from the property's 25,000-bottle cellar. Despite all the choices at every price point across the globe, I always try to stay as local as possible. You can get no more local than wine from grapes grown in Bernardus' own vineyards. The 2016 estate-grown Rosella's Vineyard Charndonnay would go with almost anything on the menu except the biggest meat dishes.

Kim Westerman Stamenov also farms two acres of organic fruits, vegetables and herbs on the grounds, and he recently installed three bee boxes with domestic and Italian honeybees. Their honey makes its way into the bar's innovative cocktail program.

Kim Westerman The deeply rooted native-California chef also loves to travel, and his most recent trip was to Spain, where he fell in love with famous aged ribeye steaks and the emphasis of a range of jamón.
When I asked him what have been the highlights of his career, thus far, he said, ""Cooking for Presidents, especially Nancy and Ronald Reagan at the home of the owner of the Washington Post. It was an extremely intimate dinner with only three cooks and about 100 secret-service agents.""
He also recalls working with the legendary Julia Child, cooking for 3,000 people at a rural vineyard near Pinnacles, California.
His favorite restaurants in California other than his own are Providence and Republique in Los Angeles, The Village Pub in Woodside, Chez Panisse in Berkeley, and Sierra Mar at Post Ranch Inn .
What does the future hold for Stamenov and and his ever-evolving Lucia? He wants to visit under-the-radar food destinations in Mexico and Portugal, and he sees his own cooking continuing to trend toward seafood- and olive oil-based dishes that pair well with higher-acid white wines and lower-alcohol reds. Whatever he does, he'll certainly remain true to his values, which include pushing classic technique into more creative realms and using the bountiful ingredients within close reach."
Legendary Packers Quarterback Bart Starr Dies At 85,www.forbes.com,Rob Reischel,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2019/05/26/legendary-packers-quarterback-bart-starr-dies-at-85/,"Before there was Joe Montana or Tom Brady, there was Bryan Bartlett Starr, known affectionately as Bart. Accurate. Composed. Precise. Flawless.
Starr was the perfect leader for a Green Bay Packers team that had it all and won five world titles in the 1960s. And at the end of the day, Starr will be remembered as one of the greatest quarterbacks — and winners — in NFL history.
Starr died Sunday in Birmingham, Ala. He was 85.
“We are saddened to note the passing of our husband, father, grandfather, and friend, Bart Starr,” his family said. “He battled with courage and determination to transcend the serious stroke he suffered in September 2014, but his most recent illness was too much to overcome.
“While he may always be best known for his success as the Packers quarterback for 16 years, his true legacy will always be the respectful manner in which he treated every person he met, his humble demeanor, and his generous spirit.
“Our family wishes to thank the thousands of friends and fans who have enriched his life – and therefore our lives – for so many decades and especially during the past five years. Each letter, text, phone call, and personal visit inspired him and filled him with joy.
“His love for all of humanity is well known, and his affection toward the residents of Alabama and of Wisconsin filled him with gratitude. He had hoped to make one last trip to Green Bay to watch the Packers this fall, but he shall forever be there in spirit.”
Starr led the Packers to World Championships in 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966 and 1967, including victories in the first two Super Bowls. Starr was arguably the greatest postseason quarterback ever, compiling a 9-1 playoff record with wins in his last nine games.
Starr won MVP honors in both Super Bowl I and II. He was named to four Pro Bowls, led the NFL in passing three times and was the league’s MVP in 1966.
Starr’s name often gets overlooked in discussions regarding the greatest of all-time because he didn’t have the gaudy statistics so many passers of today compile. But Starr’s résumé matches anyone who has ever played the position.
Starr also helped guide Green Bay to a 74-20-4 regular-season record between 1961 and 1967, for a .776 winning percentage.
“You couldn’t find a quarterback better suited for our offense than Bart,” former running back Jim Taylor said of Starr during a 2010 interview. “For my money, he’s the best quarterback of all time.”
Green Bay was always a run-first operation under head coach Vince Lombardi. But when the Packers needed a play by air, Starr rarely let them down.
“Bart almost never made a mistake,” said Jerry Kramer, the Packers right guard at the time. “He was a caretaker for the offense, but he could be more than that if we needed him to be. Bart was exactly what we needed at that position.”
Fifty years after his career took off, it still seems remarkable that Starr is even in the discussion of greatest quarterbacks of all-time.
Starr missed much of his junior and senior seasons at the University of Alabama due to back injuries, and with NFL brass leery of him physically, he wasn't chosen until the 17th round of the 1956 draft.
Starr endured three rather nondescript seasons in which he played under coaches Lisle Blackbourn and Scooter McLean and threw 13 touchdown passes and 25 interceptions. He also could never win the starting job outright in that time.
Then Lombardi was hired, and Starr's career took off.
The son of a career Air Force master sergeant, Starr had the mental fortitude that was perfect for the fantastically demanding Lombardi. By the end of Lombardi's first year, Starr had won over his new coach with sensational performances in victories over the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers to help Green Bay close the year 7-5.
“In Bart Starr, we're going to have one of the great quarterbacks in football,” Lombardi told Frank Gifford on his radio show following the season.
Lombardi was right. While Starr's arm was far from cannon-like and he didn't scare anybody physically, few have ever been smarter. He understood every intricacy of Lombardi's offense, recognized all the complexities a defense could deliver and almost always made the right decision.
Starr led the Packers to the 1960 NFL Championship Game, where they lost to Philadelphia, 17-13. It would be the only postseason game Starr would ever lose.
Over the next seven seasons, Green Bay dominated the NFL unlike any team in history. There were World Championships. The Ice Bowl. And later Super Bowl titles.
And at the center of them all was the steadying hand of Starr.
“The reason we had success is because that was a great football team,” said Starr, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977. “I was just one part of a great team.
“You look at the quality players and look at the leadership we had, and it's easy to understand why we won. I was just so blessed to be in Green Bay when I was and to be led by a gentleman (Lombardi) that's difficult to describe.”
Starr retired following the 1971 season. But four years later, he returned as coach and general manager of a franchise heading south in a hurry.
Unfortunately for Starr, the Packers never changed directions during his nine-year tenure. In that time, Green Bay went 52-76-3 and qualified for the playoffs just once. After the Packers' third 8-8 season in four years, Starr was replaced following the 1983 campaign.
“Going back to coach in Green Bay was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life,” Starr said. “I was approached by the organization and it turned out to be an enormous mistake. I was extremely disappointed. I disappointed the Packers and their fans.
“I accept all responsibility. I just didn't get it done. I haven't ever really sat down and analyzed what went wrong. Early on, my inexperience hurt us, but in the later years, we had some good draft choices and we were beginning to make progress. But I don't want it to sound like I'm making excuses. I just didn't get it done.”
Those who enjoyed Starr's legendary playing career know he almost always got it done on the field. That’s why the most vivid memories of Starr are still from his terrific playing days — and the gentleman he was off the field.
“I would hope people remember the playing days first, and not the coaching years,” Starr said. “Being part of a team that was so unselfish was amazing. What we were able to accomplish was very meaningful, and the fact we were able to get it done as a team.”
Thanks largely to one of the greatest triggermen of all-time."
Bart Starr's Heroics In 'The Ice Bowl' Will Never Be Forgotten,www.forbes.com,Rob Reischel,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2019/05/26/bart-starrs-heroics-in-the-ice-bowl-will-live-in-infamy/,"The greatest game in Green Bay Packers’ history was decided and defined by a final dramatic drive. A march that culminated with arguably the most memorable play in NFL history: Bart Starr’s quarterback sneak into Lambeau Field’s south end zone.
The touchdown with 13 seconds remaining lifted the Packers to a 21-17 win over the Dallas Cowboys for the 1967 NFL Championship — a game later dubbed ""The Ice Bowl."" When the Packers won Super Bowl II two weeks later, Green Bay achieved NFL immortality with its third consecutive title.
Starr, the hero of that game and the leader of Green Bay five NFL Championships in the 1960s, died Sunday in Birmingham, Ala. He was 85.
“Bart was rarely the best quarterback in the league on a statistical basis,” teammate Jerry Kramer said. “But for three hours each Sunday, he was — almost always — the best quarterback in the game in which he was playing.”
Mike Ditka, a standout tight end and later the head coach of the Chicago Bears, fully concurred.
“Bart Starr was a winner and a gentleman, period,” Ditka said. “It was (Vince) Lombardi’s team, but Bart Starr was the quiet glue that held the whole thing together. He was a great leader.”
Never was that more evident than in the Ice Bowl.
The temperature at kickoff was 13 degrees below zero and minus-46 with the wind chill. The game was played on a sheet of ice after the field’s $80,000 heating system broke — or was turned off by Packers coach Vince Lombardi — as some believe.
The referees’ whistles froze. One fan died due to exposure and several others were treated for frostbite.
Making it even worse, Lombardi wouldn’t allow anyone except linemen to wear gloves.
Steve Sabol, former president of NFL Films, had a sideline view of the historic contest, filming the game with his father, Ed.
“I think it’s the greatest football game of all time,” Sabol said in a 2008 interview. “The game conditions, the back and forth, the competitiveness, the high level of play, the dramatic ending, a third straight championship … and that final drive. It was something to witness.”
Kramer called it a flawless drive, a 68-yard march in 12 plays that perfectly illustrated the teamwork and precision of the team under Lombardi.
“We weren’t moving the ball too well in the second half,” Kramer said. “But we knew what we had to do on that last drive. And Bart was calling the plays.”
The game-winning march engineered by Starr was even more impressive considering the Packers’ offense had been stymied in the second half — by both the Dallas defense and the bitter cold.
In the third quarter, Green Bay had three possessions that resulted in minus-1, 13, and minus-2 yards. The Packers did no better in the fourth quarter, losing five yards in four plays on their first possession before gaining 20 yards in four plays on their next attempt.
Green Bay trailed, 17-14, as it huddled on its own 32-yard-line with 4:54 remaining. Starr did not have to utter a single syllable to motivate his teammates.
He just knew.
“It was not necessary for me to say a word,” Starr said during a 2009 interview. “When I looked in their eyes, there was a look of confidence and, ‘Let’s call the plays and go get this done.’ ”
On the first play, Starr threw for six yards to Donny Anderson in the right flat. Fullback Chuck Mercein then bolted seven yards around right end for a first down at the 45.
Starr went back to the air to keep the Cowboys off balance, targeting Boyd Dowler for 13 yards over the middle as the drive gained momentum. It was halted momentarily as Cowboys defensive end Willie Townes burst through the line to tackle Donny Anderson for a 9-yard loss on the next play.
Facing second-and-19 from the Green Bay 49-yard-line, Starr hit Anderson with passes of 9 and 12 yards — both in the right flat — for a crucial first down.
Thirty-nine yards now separated the Packers from the Cowboys’ end zone and its mission for championship trifecta. One minute, 35 seconds remained in the game.
Mercein turned a short pass into a 19-yard gain, down to the Dallas 11.
Then came what Starr termed “the best call of my career.” The Packers quarterback had been saving this play for right situation — and the time was now.
Mercein shot up the middle for 8 yards on a trap play that took the Packers to the Dallas 3-yard line with 54 seconds left. The play worked because Cowboys defensive tackle Bob Lilly pursued down the line of scrimmage to stop the Packer sweep he had anticipated.
Lilly’s greatest strengths were his quickness and pursuit. But thanks to intense film study, Starr used those skills against Lilly.
“We called it a ‘Give’ play because Coach Lombardi didn’t like to call it a ‘sucker’ play,” Starr said. “Our left guard, Gale Gillingham, pulled and followed him wide. (Defensive end) George Andrie slid down to close the hole, but Bob Skoronski made a great block on him and Chuck had a big hole.”
Mercein, a New York Giants’ castoff signed by Lombardi late in the season, accounted for 34 yards on the drive. While he lacked speed, Mercein’s plodding and no-frills running style was ideally suited to the slippery field.
“People shouldn’t forget what Chuck Mercein meant to us that day,” Starr said. “We don’t win that game or we’re certainly not in position to win that game if it’s not for Chuck Mercein.”
Anderson had the next three attempts at the end zone, but was denied by the icy surface and a stiff Cowboys defense.
On Anderson’s first attempt, he gained two yards to the 1 for a first down. On the second, the Dallas defenders stuffed Anderson for no gain. On the third, he slipped after receiving the handoff from Starr, nearly fumbling the football.
It was now fourth and goal. Sixteen seconds remained. Starr then called Green Bay’s last timeout.
“When I called the final timeout, I asked the lineman if they could get their footing for a wedge play, which was our main short-yardage play,” Starr said. “That play had worked well for us twice, for a minimum of two yards, earlier in the game.”
Starr jogged to the sideline and spoke to Lombardi, a scene captured on television for posterity.
“There was nothing wrong with the play,” Starr said. “But the backs are slipping and can’t get to the line of scrimmage. I said, ‘I’m upright and can just shuffle my feet and lunge in there.’ ”
Lombardi had a blunt response — and no thoughts of kicking a game-tying field goal to extend the contest any longer. It was all or nothing.
“All he said was, ‘Then run it and let’s get the hell out of here,’ ” Starr said. “It was just so typical of this man. It’s so bitter cold and it’s down to our last play. He was blunt and right to the point.”
Starr was chuckling as he ran back to the huddle and called the play: “Brown Right 31 Wedge.”
The offensive unit thought Mercein would be carrying the ball. No one was more surprised than the Packer fullback when he did not receive it.
“I knew the play was for me, so I was pretty excited,” Mercein said. “I had a few big runs and a pass reception on the drive, and they gave it to Donny twice down by the goal line. So I thought it was my turn to put that cherry on top of the sundae.’”
Another plan was in place, and Mercein only cared that it resulted in a touchdown.
“It just goes to show you how smart Bart Starr is,” he said. “The prudent thing to do was not take a chance that I would slip. He took all those potentially disastrous things out of the equation. There was no need to tell me I wasn’t going to get the ball.”
Starr improvised and the gamble paid off. The rest is history."
Inside How Silicon Valley Helps Keep The Golden State Warriors At The Cutting Edge,www.forbes.com,Patrick Murray,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmurray/2019/05/26/inside-how-silicon-valley-helps-keep-the-golden-state-warriors-at-the-cutting-edge/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. SportsMoney I focus on the strategy, salary cap and business side of the Warriors. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin The Golden State Warriors new home in the heart of Silicon Valley is scheduled to open next fall, bringing with it a wealth of new opportunities. (Photo by Jane Tyska/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images) Getty The Golden State Warriors rank as the third most valuable team in basketball , with Forbes ’ latest valuation standing at $3.5bn. As they take aim at their fourth NBA title in five years, they’ve leveraged their historic success on the court into lucrative partnership opportunities elsewhere. Their upcoming move to downtown San Francisco and Chase Center is reportedly poised to bring in more than $2bn in new revenue, making the unprecedented luxury tax bills that they would face in keeping this team together entirely affordable .
But these partnerships aren’t just about generating the income they need to keep the team together, and more. As the Bay Area’s team, they’re leveraging their place in Silicon Valley to ensure they stay at the cutting edge of technological innovation. Prior to joining Facebook as their Sports Partnerships Lead for Teams and Athletes nearly four years ago, Kevin Cote worked in digital marketing at the Warriors for over a decade. He’s seen it from both sides, describing the Warriors place in Silicon Valley as their “competitive advantage.” While he was at the Warriors they made a conscious effort to maximize the benefits of their proximity to the tech world, with Cote outlining the Warriors pitch as “we’re not Hollywood, we’re not the lights of New York, but we’re Silicon Valley.”
So how do they approach leveraging this competitive advantage? Kirk Lacob, the Warriors Assistant General Manager, reaches to the classic Douglas Adams novel, Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy , to explain. “They built the computer to tell them the answer to life, the universe, and everything. And that computer told them the answer but then told them you have to build a better computer to essentially ask the right question. So we’re always thinking like that - what is the right question to be asking?”
How to better utilize data?
One such question that is at the forefront of the Warriors' collective minds is something that will be familiar to many businesses the world over - how to best use your data? For Lacob, who leads the charge for the Warriors on data analytics, that question of “practical application” remains the most critical issue, emphasizing “it really doesn’t matter how good your data is or how well you’ve done your analysis, but if you can’t get it to the person who needs it or it’s not actionable, it’s just not that useful.” LAS VEGAS, NV - JULY 06: Assistant general manager Kirk Lacob (L) and head coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors attend a 2018 NBA Summer League game between the Warriors and the Los Angeles Clippers at the Thomas & Mack Center on July 6, 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The Warriors' competitive advantage in Silicon Valley is helping them answer this question through a new deal with Google Cloud. As well as providing platform services in Chase Center, the aim of the partnership is that it will help the Warriors make better use of the wealth of data that is generated nowadays in basketball, such as data on player health that can be used to prevent and manage injury .
Lacob details what that will look like. “We want more complex problems to be solved. We have a number of different data inputs that we’re receiving, a number of different places where we’re gathering data, and [different] types of data, but we really want to be able to house it in a way that is easily dispersed and easily readable.” Ultimately, as Lacob outlines, the goal is to make all that data ""a little more approachable for the quote-unquote layperson in the organization to be able to use.""
Lacob explained how the deal came about “It was really a terrific, organic fit because we had already gotten into discussions with them about how we were going to revamp our serving equipment as it relates to data capture and analysis, and data housing."" By Lacob’s own admission the Warriors are playing catch-up a little here, but they’re hoping the new partnership will really push them forwards. “We had focused so much of our energy and our resources on how we were going to communicate that data but we hadn’t really focused yet on really structuring that data to be it’s most efficient state for us to utilize… I don’t think we’ve been at the forefront on that one but we’re going to be now. By waiting and finding the perfect partner we’re really set up to have terrific infrastructure and analysis.”
How can technology enhance the customer experience?
Like any good business, the Warriors are also asking the question of how technology can provide new ways to connect with their customers. Their latest example of innovation in this space is their use of 4DReplay’s camera technology, sponsored by Zoom, one of their corporate partners.
Here’s how it works. Around the upper bowl of Oracle Arena a ring of 140 custom-configured, linked cameras capture every highlight from almost every angle. The input is fed into the control room up in the heights of their arena where a team of two operators and a producer create 270-degree rotating highlight plays. The clips can be turned around in 8-10 seconds, for all-around replays of the games biggest plays broadcast on Oracle’s scoreboard. The highlights are also used for the “Zoom play of the game” shared on social media.
— Golden State Warriors (@warriors) May 1, 2019
The Warriors had originally seen the cameras in action at a San Francisco Giants game. After a successful pilot last season, including in the NBA Finals, it’s been fully implemented this year. Janine Pelosi, Zoom's Chief Marketing Officer, explained how their involvement came about. “Especially here in the Bay Area we try and not take a cookie-cutter approach to anything that we do. The Warriors have such a fun group to partner with that we’re able to align our teams and come together. They bring us wacky ideas, we bring them wacky ideas and then they end up with something really special. But at the end of the day it has to bring in the product in an authentic way and I think that’s what we were able to bring to life.”
Chase Center will offer a whole range of new opportunities to innovate even more. One potential option is to offer the 4DReplay camera output to broadcasters, making the traditional telestrator look positively prehistoric. Beyond that, there’s talk of an app that would allow fans to view clips from any angle they want to. It’s a product that fits with an increasing demand for more personalized viewing experiences and new camera angles, which the NBA is experimenting with at a league level . But again, thanks to their presence in Silicon Valley and their penchant for innovative ideas, the Warriors are right at the forefront of this new technology.
What does the future hold?
As befitting a team based in Silicon Valley, the question of what the future holds is occupying plenty of time and energy. Lacob is also responsible for leading the Warriors work on e-sports, one of the newest frontiers in the sports and entertainment world. He describes this side of the business as both “ serving as sort of a petri dish for us” and a “legitimate arm to our business.""
Just as the Warriors are winning on the basketball court, so too are they enjoying success in the gaming world. A couple of weeks ago Warriors Gaming Squad (WGS), their NBA 2K League affiliate team of the Golden State Warriors, defeated 76ers Gaming Club 58-39 to win the NBA 2K League’s THE TURN Tournament. Earlier in the year they became the first team to draft a female player, Chiquita “Chiquitae126” Evans, into the NBA 2K League.

Lacob strikes an excited tone about the potential opportunities on the business side. “I think that e-sports can be absolutely humongous...Sports already is a cross-cultural tool, a social connector. When something like e-sports, where it’s built into the digital age and it’s the age of connectivity, there’s the opportunity to really bridge those physical barriers in a way we’ve never been able to before.”
The biggest opportunity Lacob highlights is in being involved in something from the ground up. “I think what’s also very exciting about this whole industry is that it is so nascent and in a way it is so new that there are changes we can make at a foundational, fundamental level to the way the sport works. So we’re excited about the ability to build something from scratch that doesn’t come with all the baggage of human history.”
What insight can innovation generate for the wider business?
With something so new, there are plenty of lessons that can be applied across the wider business. In particular, Lacob highlights how they're hoping that getting in early on e-sports will give the Warriors a headstart in learning how to engage the next generation of customers. “I think we’re learning a lot about new demographics. Everybody in the world is having the same issue in reaching and engaging with this new generation of… people who want to be able to see anything and everything personalized on mobile, and often for free, and use adblockers and things like that. I think one of the exciting things about e-sports is born in a digital age so those problems are inherently built in, or they’re never even born.”
The Warriors' eyes are on a larger prize than just basketball. With Chase Center opening, they’re thinking big about the possibilities of an expanded sports and entertainment business , potentially branching out into becoming not just a content company, but their own platform too. E-sports is also helping them think through some of the possibilities, as Lacob explains “e-sports at a very simple level is content, but it is a new form of content. As a platform we’re gaining fans, we’re gaining users, we’re finding new ways to engage with them but I think that this is going to challenge the status quo.”
For some of those new users, e-sports will be their first contact with basketball. Indeed Ted Leonsis, owner of the Washington Wizards and chairman of the NBA’s media committee envisages it as one of the big potential growth areas in introducing a new generation of fans around the globe to the traditional sport. Lacob highlights how the NBA 2K league is ""a great beta test to try to understand where some of those overlaps can occur and how we can inform some decisions made in traditional sports on e-sports, but frankly how e-sports can inform some of the things we can change in traditional sports as well.""
A meeting of minds
Ultimately that inquisitive mindset is at the heart of building successful partnerships and innovating with new products, technology, and markets. Lacob’s description of the Warriors approach as “we learn quickly, we fail quickly, we respond quickly and hopefully we succeed in the end” is classic Silicon Valley. It’s not hard to see how these two neighbors have come together so successfully.
As the Warriors move to a state-of-the-art building in Chase Center they’ll be plenty of new opportunities for new deals to bolster the bottom line. But if the Warriors continue to be successful in finding the right questions, then those partnerships will also catapult them into the future.

Cisco Will Benefit From U.S. Attack On Huawei,www.forbes.com,Jon Markman,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2019/05/26/cisco-will-benefit-from-u-s-attack-on-huawei/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Investing Analyzing tech stocks through the prism of cultural change. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin The Commerce Department's announcement last week that it would require all U.S. companies doing business with Huawei and its affiliates to get a special license was a dramatic move designed to get China to surrender in the trade war. But chances are it won't. Huawei is a font of Chinese national pride. By most accounts , it currently makes the best telecommunications gear, with a clear lead in 5G development. Bangkok, Thailand - May 23, 2019: Huawei phones with decoders on artificial wood flooring in the home, Huawei security issues, business crises, Huawei logo screens Getty
Its systems, thanks to close integration with American semiconductor firms, are more advanced than competitors from Nokia and Eriksson. Plus, they are cheaper.
Global telecos, ever eager for competitive advantages, have been lining up to buy Huawei’s switches and network components.
And the stakes are high. Very often, investors assume fifth-generation wireless is about smartphones and download speeds between 10x and 1,000x faster than 4G.
That is short-sighted.
5G is about the future of connected things. Higher-capacity networks with lower latency — the time it takes between initiating an action and it actually happening — will open up all sorts of new technologies.
Connected and self-driving cars, remote robotic surgery, smart cites and factories are only the beginning of what is possible.
The company that wins the 5G race is going to reap untold riches.
The Trump administration wants to make sure Huawei is not even in the running.
The directive from the Commerce Department effectively bans the sale of semiconductors from U.S. firms. This kneecaps Huawei in the worst possible way.
There is no easy way for the company to build 5G products without that intellectual property.
Huawei depends on Qualcomm to make its smartphones. Building out 5G infrastructure will be impossible without the field gate programmable array FGPA intellectual property that Xilinx and Intel are developing.
FPGA is ideal for 5G because it allows the integrated circuit to be programmed after it is manufactured. Software-defined hardware is key to building flexible base stations and towers.
The Commerce Department claims the ban is a matter of national security. It points to longstanding concerns Huawei is merely a front for the Chinese government. Making the company ground zero for 5G, therefore, is tantamount to building-in a spy network.
And there is some precedent for concern …
The Chinese government pledged in 2006 to build the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The $200 million project, completed in 2012, featured a state-of-the-art computer and networking system supplied by Huawei.
Le Monde Afrique reported in 2018 that, for two hours every night, African Union servers began transferring data back to Shanghai … 5,000 miles away. The breach was discovered by chance, according to a BBC story , when a scientist working late one evening discovered unusual server activity.
Huawei claimed no wrongdoing. However, the firm has close ties to the Chinese state government. Ren Zhengfei, its 74-year-old founder, began his career as military technologist in the People’s Liberation Army.
Ren has become a symbol of Chinese entrepreneurial spirit. He started Huawei in 1987 with an investment of only $5,000. The company began modestly. As a reseller of telecommunication switches. Early employees worked, ate and lived in a small Hong Kong office. Today, the Shenzhen firm is the largest telecommunication firm in the world, with $108.5 billion in sales.
According the corporate website , the firm has 180,000 employees in 170 countries and has built 1,500 telco networks, connecting one-third of the world’s population.
Now Washington wants to make it the first victim of the Sino-American trade war.
This is an important escalation. Attempts to kill Huawei will not sit well with Chinese political leaders. They have made it a vital part of longer-term plans to move the country from a supplier of inexpensive electronics to a technology leader in artificial intelligence, robotics, self-driving cars and aerospace.
In the technology space, there is plenty of gloom. Huawei is a major customer for U.S. technology companies.
For example, Quartz reported in 2016 that China imported $160 billion worth of semiconductors, making the tiny bits of silicon even more valuable to its economy than oil.
One company that seems to have anticipated the trade war escalation is Cisco Systems . It’s also a logical beneficiary of a weaker Huawei.
Executives told CNBC they have mitigated the effects of the move to 25% tariffs on many Chinese goods by moving part of the supply chain to other countries.
The global maker of teleco equipment has been transitioning to network services like security. The company has fiscal 2018 sales of $49.3 billion, a 2.7% increase year over year.
Shares trade at 16.5x forward earnings, for a market capitalization of $251 billion.
Longer-term investors should consider buying a pullback to the low $50s.

Why Business Schools Are Shutting Down Their MBA Programs,www.forbes.com,John Byrne,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/poetsandquants/2019/05/26/why-business-schools-are-shutting-down-their-mba-programs/,"I run PoetsandQuants.com, which covers news about business schools. University of Illinois’ Gies College of Business Courtesy of Gies College
The University of Illinois’ Gies College of Business has become the latest school to announce that it is getting out of the full-time, on-campus MBA market. Instead, Gies will focus more aggressively on its online MBA option, the $22,000 iMBA, which has seen big growth since being launched in 2015 (see Illinois To End Full- And Part-Time MBA Programs On Campus ).
Why is Gies giving up on its full-time MBA? For one thing, the school admits it is losing money on the program. While it may surprise many observers given how high tuition rates are for MBA programs, many of these programs are actually loss leaders or “show” programs to get a U.S. News ranking. Secondly, applications to most MBA programs have been declining for years, evidence that there is less interest in the degree.
Just look at the numbers at the University of Illinois’ full-time MBA, ranked in the top 50 by U.S. News . Applications to Gies’ full-time program fell to 290 this year from 386 in 2016. The school actually enrolled fewer than 50 full-time students in each of the past three years. Even when apps were nearly 100 higher in 2016, Gies was only able to enroll a class of 47 students.
There are a surprising number of schools in this same predicament. They have sub-optimally-sized programs that cannot support the expenses required to deliver a quality program. And that is why we have seen a number of schools drop out of the full-time MBA market. The list includes the Univesity of Iowa, Wake Forest University, Thunderbird School of Global Management, Virginia Tech, and Simmons College.
Many are putting more resources behind their undergraduate business programs, specialty master’s in business, and online MBA programs. Today, nearly 32,000 students are studying for an online MBA at the 25 largest programs in the U.S. At the same time Gies experienced declining interest in its full- and part-time MBA programs, interest in its online MBA has exploded. Applications to its iMBA are expected to hit 3,200 this year, up from 1,099 in 2016, even though the program isn’t yet ranked among the best online MBAs in the U.S.
You can blame four things for the fact that there are fewer MBA applicants in the full-time pipeline:
1. The strong U.S. economy.
2. The rising cost of MBA programs and the unwillingness of many Millennials to go into substantial debt to get the degree.
3. Donald Trump, who has scared off thousands of international candidates who had been helping to offset a continual decline in domestic applicants for a number of years.
4. A greater number of shorter, cheaper alternatives to a two-year, full-time MBA program, from one-year and online options to specialty master’s degrees in such subjects as data analytics and entrepreneurship.
The irony to all this is that business schools are still flourishing because of the demand for other programs. So while more schools are expected to drop their full-time, on-campus MBA experiences, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that alternative business programs are growing and will continue to grow.

Must Watch: The Untold Story of the 2008 Financial Crisis,www.forbes.com,Roger Valdez,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2019/05/26/must-watch-the-untold-story-of-the-2008-financial-crisis/,"Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)
ASSOCIATED PRESS Anyone who has an interest in economics, public policy, and housing simply must take some time out and watch the Vice documentary on the 2008 economic meltdown, Panic: The Untold Story of the 2008 Financial Crisis . It has been more than a decade now since the events in the film unfolded and even today people are assessing the impact. The film is both very entertaining even knowing the outcome but also puts together. The movie gathers into one place interviews with all the players who talk about their late night phone calls and personal interactions during the meltdown. One thing that makes the film stand out is the fact that it doesn't take sides or take a condescending tone: it is good old fashioned journalism. What is true though is that the housing discussion in the country was reshaped profoundly in three ways.
First, the collapse of the economy unfolding in real time tapped deep rooted American populism on both the left and the right. On the left, this populism took the form of the Occupy Wall Street movement, an atavistic return to the socialism of the 1930s. It's almost amusing to think back to the days when the word ""socialism"" was whispered about Obama and was considered widely as a smear, something to be rejected as strongly as questions about his birth. Today, the left is embracing socialism. On the right, the Tea Party movement sunk the legacy of Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay -- finance and infrastructure -- behind nativism and paranoia.
This is the second shift, the Jeffersonian and Jacksonian mistrust of finance; the use of credit to keep the economy moving. I recently took a trip to visit the historic sites of Ashland, Henry Clay's home in Kentucky and the Hermitage, the home of Andrew Jackson. It is easy to forget history from just a decade ago, but it is important to remember that our country is just as deeply suspicious of banking and Wall Street in it's third century as it was in its first. The disputes between Hamilton and Jefferson and later Clay and Jackson are emblematic of that suspicion. But even through all of that, the country's growth and advancement is indisputably linked to the way our economy really works as opposed to the way politicians say they want it to work.
And lastly, we now have a politics of scarcity. Politicians on both left and right, but especially the left, build their campaigns on the resentment of wealth and fear people have about losing their status and standing in the economy. The left pushes resentment taxes and promises entitlements using redistributive means and the right wants to seal the border from immigrants that are going to ""steal your job."" Neither view reflects how the economy of our country is thriving and expanding wealth; people are better off now than they have ever been regardless of arbitrary income ratios touted by the left (e.g. ""CEOs make X percent more than their employees!"")
This has meant that the housing discussion has become about how to squeeze money for entitlements for housing, a rejection of industry expertise in favor of academic finger wagging, and a view that holds that somehow economic growth and new jobs cause suffering and homelessness . In Seattle and Chicago, this urge to pander to fear and suspicion has led to actual socialists being elected. Nationally, we see the same trend. It is as if the cold war never happened. How do we turn this around?
In an upcoming series here starting tomorrow, I'm going to offer some ideas on that topic. Watching the film is as good as any introduction to the topic as any. If we continue to make housing policy based on suspicion and fear, the problem of housing inflation won't go away, it will get worse. Somehow we've got to shift the focus back to the practical need for more housing supply and opportunity. Homeownership is still a worthy pursuit and can be possible for families but only if we see housing abundance -- and yes people will make money making that abundance happen -- as our goal, not rationing.
Roger Valdez is Director of Seattle For Growth , an advocacy organization for more housing supply, choice, and opportunity in Seattle.

Did The Internet Kill The 'Romance' Of Travel?,www.forbes.com,Nina Angelovska,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaangelovska/2019/05/26/did-the-internet-kill-the-romance-of-travel/,"The Internet transformed almost all aspects of our lives. Millions of users can not imagine their lives without it and also millions were born with it and don't even know how it was before the internet era. One of the things that is completely transformed is the way we travel—from scratch and from ""start to finish."" My parents used to travel during that era when it took 20 hours and 3 flights to get to a city that is a 2-hour direct flight today—and when plane transport was not as nearly affordable as nowadays and airline tickets were complicated paper documents issued by a travel agency. I was a little kid during this ""pre-internet era,"" so during our Sunday lunch I ""traveled"" with my mom back in time and had her tell me how it used to be.
They would pack the car and depart on their holiday adventure without knowing the final destination or which countries they would end up visiting, which from a present-day point of view, sounds kind of romantic. ""We would head to Germany, for instance, and we would make stops on the way visiting different cities. We had a map and if we got lost we would ask people to guide us. When we decided to spend the night in a city we liked we would stop at a hotel we would see on our way and directly book a room at the reception.""
Once they knew where they would like to go—and they would get the idea either from a catalog from a travel agency or hotel they picked up from somewhere or a recommendation from a friend—they had to visit the travel agencies to book the flight and hotel.
""We had to call, visit the travel agencies, we picked up catalogs and took them home... then we would go back again to ask if something was not clear. To compare prices we had to visit more agencies and decide on the best offer. For flights, we had as well to go to an agency and we were dependent on the skills of the agency worker to find us the best option that again we couldn't compare. Payments had to be done at the travel agency so usually, this was our third or even fourth visit at the agency we chose for our travel. We would find out about the weather conditions from the captain in the plane. We would visit the info desk to get directions on how to get to the hotel. We would rely on the receptionist's recommendations on what to do or visit in the city. When we would come home we would be inviting our friends over dinner or drinks to share the experience. However, before having them, I would have the photos printed and sorted into a photo album. We also had one of those big cameras that I would take with me everywhere to make video recordings. I was well-organized organized, once we got back I would make a VHS titled with the place and the date.""
I can't imagine that this was a reality only 15 years ago. Today, for all of these things, all we need is internet access and smart device.
Choosing a place to visit— Google, ads, Facebook, email marketing and other apps booming us with ""information on the next place we should visit"" instead of catalogs from agencies and hotels. Booking flight and hotel— Travel apps instead of travel agents. If before the internet travel booking and reservations were only possible by visiting travel agencies or ordering by phone now we can book our travel at any time, from any location while saving money and time. The disintermediation brought by the internet cut the travel agents and the reintermediation introduced the new form of intermediaries—algorithms replaced the travel agents who can do their job better and at unprecedented speed. We are our own travel agents today. We can get the best possible deals and be able to make well-informed decisions. We can check the credibility of airlines and hotels by reading reviews from others who have been there, done that. We are able to plan every single detail of our holiday beforehand and know exactly how every single coin will be spent on the trip. And it is super-easy, no need to be an expert to make online bookings. Booking accommodation or flight has become an almost automated series of actions: go online, compare prices, choose, read some reviews. Fill in the form. Choose a seat or room. Pay. Add it to your smartphone. Navigating during traveling— Google Maps instead of traditional maps. ""Directions"" instead of ""Excuse me, Sir, How can I get to ....?"" Google knows better than a local. I once asked a local to reconfirm the bus number that Google gave me. He told me that I can also use number 3 instead of 3G, I decided to take the advice from the local and that ended up being a mistake as I had to walk for 15 minutes with my suitcase, instead of waiting for 5 more minutes for the 3G route. However, the consequence is that millennials don't have any sense of orientation if our phone runs out of battery we are lost, not knowing where east and west is. Collecting memories and sharing with friends— Dozens of Facebook and Instagram posts shared with thousands of people who don't care shared in real-time versus one printed photo album shared with close friends and family after the trip. We are now coming back from a two-day trip with more photos than our parents did during their two years of travels. And if we don't post any of those on social media chances are they won't even be seen in the next few years until they are ""lost somewhere in the cloud."" A friend of mine jokes: ""We have to lure friends with dinner and drinks so that we can play the slideshow of 500 photos from our exotic travels. Otherwise, no one except our parents would look at all those photos."" There is no doubt that all these new technologies enable us to do all the things faster, quicker, easier with more convenience... And yet I wonder why it feels like we have less and less free time. It feels like we are in a constant hurry. Are all those available choices the reason? Do we make decisions slower? Do we spend precious time and hours on decisions like:
Which hotel should I choose?— Browsing and looking at 20 hotels, versus trusting a travel agent with the only one he has or recommends. What photo should I post?— Taking 30 photos from the same spot and deciding which one is the best to share versus taking a photo you'll get to see once you come back and there is no decision left for you to make except if you will put it in the photo album or you will tear it on pieces. Where should we eat?— Googling, searching through apps like Trip Advisor, Foursquare, Yelp, filtering by distance, by rating and finally choosing one (for which we will later say ""Should have gone to that other one we were looking"") versus enjoying the city and choosing the one on the way that looks good. Apps have replaced the people standing in front of the restaurants inviting us to choose theirs. Instead of asking the waiter for a recommendation or ""what's the best"" we turn to our apps to see what others said and make the decision based on the collective taste and experience (And why wouldn't one when given the opportunity?) We became less social in the social media world. All those available options we have nowadays made us pickier. The ""Choice Economy"" we live in today made us less decisive. All that waiting for ""a person paid to do find us the best or the only available option"" used to make people more patient—nowadays we get irritated if it takes more than a few seconds for Kiwi's algorithms to find us the best possible flight connection using that an army of travel agents can't.
We devote precious time and energy to make the best, informed decisions, and still, we end up being ""less happy travelers"" than the ""old-school travelers"" were. And it is because of expectations. We have seen the room that we will stay in, we know the view of the room, we know exactly how many minutes we need to get to the city center, we know the meal we will have in the plane, we made plans for every single day of the trip, we booked a cruise on the river, we know how the breakfast will look like (we have seen all the photos there were to be seen—from the hotel, form other travelers from all different angles), we know that the hotel has a welcome gift for us and we know that it is a bottle of wine (we have seen it all!).
There is nothing unexpected except the unpleasant ""surprises""—there was no welcome gift as the maid forgot to put it, the weather forecast was not accurate and it's cloudy instead of sunny, the boat you booked for your cruise is late while the other arrived on time, the restaurant we chose with 8.9 rating did not meet our high expectations and we end up with ""Should have picked the other restaurant. Should have booked the other hotel. Should have posted the other photo..."" And what we really should do is regret less and ENJOY more!"
Why Outrage Over The New SAT 'Adversity Score' Is Misplaced,www.forbes.com,Natalie Wexler,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliewexler/2019/05/26/why-outrage-over-the-new-sat-adversity-score-is-misplaced/,"Recent reports that the SAT will provide an “adversity score” for applicants have spurred a wave of criticism. But the real risk is that the move will send the false message that we’ve done all we can to improve K-12 education for disadvantaged students. ADVERTISEMENT For the past several years, the College Board—the company that administers the SAT—has been quietly developing a new kind of assessment: the Environmental Context Dashboard, which it plans to include in reports of test results to colleges and universities. The ECD is an attempt to bring more equity to the admissions process by providing a measure of the different challenges faced by students. It gathers information not about individual applicants but about their environments: poverty and crime rates in their neighborhoods, for example, or average SAT and AP scores at their high schools. Colleges will see a score ranging from 1 to 100 for each applicant—the more adversity, the higher the number.
In the ten days since the Wall Street Journal broke the story about what has become known as the “adversity score,” critics have piled on. Affluent parents, concerned their children will lose coveted spots to applicants who appear to have confronted more adversity, are panicking . Commentators have argued that that the nuances of individual experience can’t be boiled down to a single number. For example, the algorithm assigns more weight to those who live in lower-income neighborhoods. But what about the child of a working-class family that has scrimped and saved to buy a relatively cheap house in a “good” school district?
More fundamentally, some have seen the ECD as a tacit admission that the SAT is hopelessly flawed—that while it purports to select for merit, in reality it only reflects existing racial and socioeconomic inequalities. Other measures, they say—like high school grades—are better predictors of success than test scores. As scandals have tarnished the test’s reputation and as more universities decide not to require it , cynics see the innovation not so much as an attempt to compensate for societal inequity as a last-ditch effort by the College Board to boost the dwindling demand for its services.
While some seemingly legitimate concerns have been raised—why not let students see their own adversity scores?—much of the criticism appears overblown. Admissions officers from the 50 institutions involved in an ECD pilot, including Yale and Florida State University , say it helped them identify promising applicants they might otherwise have overlooked—and a study of the pilot backs them up. It’s not as though the “adversity score” is the only thing admissions officers will consider. In fact, the study found the ECD had the greatest impact when colleges engaged in “holistic” admissions decisions. Much of the information can already be gleaned from the application itself or other sources, but the ECD provides it in a way that makes comparisons easier.
David Coleman, chief executive of the College Board, illustrated the potential value of the ECD with the following example: a student at an obscure rural high school in Mississippi had an SAT score that was about average for applicants at one college participating in the pilot. But looking at the ECD, admissions officers were able to see that her score was 400 points higher than that of any other student at her school. That sort of comparison, Coleman argues, spotlights students who show the kind of “resourcefulness” that could predict success in college.
True, the ECD won’t always capture the nuance in applicants’ personal experiences. But a lot of nuance is missed under the current system as well—for example, the student who attends school in an affluent neighborhood but goes home every night to one ridden with crime. In any event, bringing out that kind of nuance is, at least in part, what college essays are for.
ADVERTISEMENT As for the argument that the SAT is inherently flawed, no test is perfect. But there’s quite a bit of evidence that test scores do predict an applicant’s college and ultimate career success. And alternative predictive measures have their own problems. Standards for high school grades vary widely from school to school. At a high-poverty school, good grades may simply show that a student has demonstrated grit and conscientiousness by showing up and handing in assignments. Those are important qualities, but they don’t necessarily translate into readiness for college-level work.
In the short-term, the ECD could well be a useful tool for identifying students—like the one in Mississippi—who have somehow managed to reach levels of achievement that are rare for students in their circumstances. The danger is that it may also be seen as a permanent substitute for undertaking the kind of fundamental change that could ensure that such students aren’t so unusual.
Like its well-intentioned program to provide free SAT prep through Khan Academy, the College Board’s ECD won't provide much of a boost for most disadvantaged students. Khan Academy claims that 20 hours of practice on its website “is associated with an average score gain of 115 points,” but some studies have found much lower gains from test prep, with the typical boost on the verbal section only eight to ten points.
The problem is that passages on the reading test —and to some extent, the math test— assume a level of background knowledge and vocabulary that many students from disadvantaged backgrounds haven’t had the chance to acquire. Test prep can acquaint students with test-taking tips and mechanics, but it can’t make up for crippling gaps in knowledge that have accumulated over years. From my own experience as a volunteer tutor and from interviews with teachers at high-poverty high schools, I know it’s not unusual for students to be unfamiliar with words like admirable , to be unable to find the United States on a map of the world, or to be unaware of events like the American Revolution. Without this kind of knowledge, students are not only deeply unprepared to do well on the SAT, they’re ill-equipped to handle even high school-level work, let alone college.
ADVERTISEMENT This isn’t the fault of students or their teachers. It’s the result of an education system that not only overlooks what science has discovered about how children learn but also encourages practices that fly in the face of those findings. One of the most pernicious is the mistaken but nearly universal focus on teaching children illusory reading comprehension “skills,” like ""making inferences,"" rather than building the kind of knowledge that could actually boost their comprehension. Children from better educated families are likely to pick up that kind of knowledge at home, but others rely on school to get it.
Every year that American students stay in school, the gap between what wealthier and poorer kids know only grows wider . By the time they take the SAT, it’s become a canyon that neither test prep nor an adversity score will do much to narrow. What can work is teaching students to write about what they’re learning, in a way that gradually increases the challenge posed by assignments. Still, even that might not be enough to significantly boost scores on a test like the SAT, because the topics of the reading passages draw on general knowledge rather than anything students have learned in school.
A fairer approach would be to test students on what they’ve actually been taught, as happens with Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate exams—both of which are graded not by students’ own teachers but by outsiders, allowing for greater reliability. When students at struggling schools have been explicitly taught to write , scores on such exams have sometimes increased significantly . In one case , an AP US history teacher had only two of her 23 students do well enough on the final exam to qualify for college credit, earning the minimum score of three. Three years after the school adopted a method of teaching writing across the curriculum, 26 of her 28 students passed the test, most with scores of four and five. (Disclosure: I am the board chair of an organization that disseminates that method of writing instruction, The Writing Revolution .)
If used wisely, the ECD could make a big difference for a relatively few “resourceful” disadvantaged students. It may also slightly increase the number of arbitrary decisions in what is already an imperfect admissions process. But it shouldn’t be accepted as an acknowledgment that the K-12 system has done all that is possible to level the academic playing field. The outrage that has greeted the ECD would be better directed against pervasive teaching methods that have made it so hard for the vast majority of students living in adversity to demonstrate their academic potential.

Understanding The First American Financial Data Leak: How Did It Happen And What Does It Mean?,www.forbes.com,AJ Dellinger,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajdellinger/2019/05/26/understanding-the-first-american-financial-data-leak-how-did-it-happen-and-what-does-it-mean/,"Pick your home. Group of multicolored houses on sale. Getty Memorial Day weekend got off to a rough start for millions of Americans when security researcher Brian Krebs reported the discovery of more than 885 million sensitive documents exposed online by insurance giant First American Financial . Those files stored on the company's website, firstam.com, contained bank account numbers, bank statements, mortgage records, tax documents, wire transfer receipts Social Security numbers and photos of driver's licenses. All of that information, which dated back to 2003, was available without any sort of protection and could be accessed without so much as a password—as long as a person knew where to look.
When a data leak like this occurs, it can be hard to tell just how severe it is. Without question, it's a troubling occurrence and does not inspire confidence in First American's capabilities to protect customer data. What makes it challenging to fully understand how widespread the effect of this leak is the fact that this information simply sat exposed online. There wasn't a clear breach of the company's servers or evidence that a malicious third-party gained access to files without permission. This isn't an Equifax situation, though it certainly has the capacity to be every bit as devastating if someone with bad intentions discovered this data first.
What happened in the case of First American Financial is a relatively common website design error called Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), according to Dave Farrow, Senior Director of Information Security at Barracuda Networks . Essentially, a link to a webpage with sensitive information is created and intended to only be seen by a specific party, but there is no method to actually verify the identity of who is viewing the link. As a result, anyone who discovers a link to one document can view it—and can discover any of the other documents hosted on the site by simply modifying the link.
"" No end user compromise is necessary,"" Farrow said. ""The hacker has simply identified an authorization error in the website and walked through the front door.""
Even after discovering the IDOR issue, accessing documents manually is a time-intensive task that requires a bit of guesswork and pattern identification—though, given the information that is exposed here, it may well be worth the time for an attacker to put in that labor. However, things get significantly easy for an attacker (and significantly worse for potential victims) if the information is somehow mass harvested.
It's possible that information from First American could have been collected and indexed by bots. Done carelessly, such an effort might tip off the defenses of First American and result in the company deflecting the malicious attempts to access documents. But carried out through a ""low and slow"" attack, which uses fewer requests to avoid detection, it's possible that someone could have scooped up a considerable chunk of the sensitive documents hosted on the site.
According to data provided by Distil Networks , advanced persistent bots (APBs) are often used to carry out these types of attacks. They also made up 73.6 percent of all ""bad bot"" traffic in 2018. According to the company, these bots often avoid typical triggers that malicious attacks would hit, like failed login attempts and excessive traffic from a single IP address. While Krebs said in his report that there is no clear indication such an attack did happen, he noted that even a ""novice attacker"" could carry out such a scheme and could go undetected.
Even if this information existed online, undetected by anyone, at least some of it was still captured by search engines. According to First American , cached versions of at least 6,000 exposed documents were still readable online. The company is making efforts to remove them, but those documents simply exist online with sensitive information readily available to anyone who finds them.
With a considerable amount of valuable information both still online and potentially collected by a bad actor, there now looms the threat that someone may use that information in a malicious way. That will most likely manifest in a Business Email Compromise (BEC), according to Barracuda Networks' Farrow. These types of attacks are typically phishing and social engineering schemes used to gain access to a company's network or other sensitive information.
With a trove of customer data out there, it wouldn't be difficult for an attacker to impersonate a First American client and either attempt to change details or an agreement, ask for additional information that could lead to financial gain, or even redirect a wire transfer to their own account. Barracuda Networks estimates these types of attacks represent over $12 billion in losses to businesses.
Farrow explained: We are seeing an increasing trend in BEC attacks where hackers take over legitimate accounts, learn about organizational details and any deals in process. They then launch a well-timed BEC attack from compromised accounts asking for wire transfers or introducing last minute changes to account details to defraud organizations. Because these attacks originate from legitimate accounts and often target internal employees many email security solutions will struggle to detect and block the attack. The trouble with a data exposure like the one at First American is that it's hard to pinpoint exactly how many people are actually affected. If everyone got lucky, this huge cache of sensitive files sat online, undetected and most everyone is in the clear. But the worst case scenario is that every last one of those files was captured, saved, and could be used in the future to target individuals and companies. First American has yet to provide any assistance to help its customers protect themselves. If you've done business with First American at any point since 2003, it may be best to freeze your credit at major credit bureaus for the time being. Doing so will prevent any unauthorized parties from taking out loans or starting a line of credit in your name without your permission.

Are you a victim of irrational loyalty? Branding maven Deb Gabor certainly hopes so.,www.forbes.com,Daniel D'Ambrosio,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieldambrosio/2019/05/26/are-you-a-victim-of-irrational-loyalty-branding-maven-deb-gabor-certainly-hopes-so/,"Deb Gabor of Sol Marketing in Austin, Texas, coined the phrase, “irrational loyalty,” for the title of her second book on branding and marketing.
Deb Gabor, author of ""Irrational Loyalty.""
Photo by Austin Photographer, Matthew Lemke ADVERTISEMENT Irrational loyalty, Gabor explains, is when a customer is so bonded to a brand, she would feel like she was cheating on the brand if she bought anything else.
“When someone says, I’m a Coke person, or a Chevy person, or for 15 years I only drove Audis, that’s irrational loyalty,” Gabor said. “You know there are other products that can serve your needs, maybe even better, but you like the brand so much you’ll buy it time after time.”
Gabor says her business is built around helping her clients identify the levers they need to pull to create the conditions for irrational loyalty. Listen to Gabor explain the concept in a recent blog post:
“A great example of a product that inspires irrational loyalty is the Apple iPhone. I’ve owned every model of an iPhone since the beginning of iPhones. I’ve had iPhones that heated up in my hand and burned the side of my head when I tried to talk on them. I have broken half a dozen iPhone screens, which I think are too delicate. And the iPhone costs about one thousand dollars! For a phone!
“I believe there are more durable, technologically superior and better-functioning products out there. But I don’t care. I won’t switch to a different brand because I’m irrationaly loyal to the iPhone. I once looked at a gorgeous Samsung phone with a big beautiful screen. I caressed it in my hands and lusted after it. But after about a minute of pure animalistic attraction to the sexy device, I ran out of the store because I felt like I was cheating on Apple. Sad, I know. But that is the definition of irrational loyalty.”
Gabor in action, working with a class.
Courtesy Sol Marketing Given Gabor’s description of her illicit attraction to a Samsung smartphone, you won’t be surprised to learn the title of her first book: “Branding is Sex,” with the subtitle, “Get your customers laid and sell the hell out of anything.”
ADVERTISEMENT “That one flies off the shelves,” Gabor says of her first book.
She says the rather crass title came out of her frustration with trying to get through to clients in the tech industry, like Dell and Microsoft.
“I’ve worked with a lot of tech CEOs who were very analytical, came up through the tech ranks and went on to build gigantic companies,” Gabor said. “All this squishy, emotional stuff we talk about in branding sometimes doesn’t land very well with highly analytical people.”
One day, Gabor said, in a fit of frustration when trying to get the point across that the people who make tech purchases are not nameless, faceless androids, she asked, “How does this blade server or work station get that guy laid?”
“The client is like, ‘Oh, I get that,’” Gabor said. “It’s crass but it’s the one thing I said that opened up potential for companies. A blade server is not a Ferrari, but if it delivers unmatched performance and keeps that IT guy in a place where the CEO isn’t calling him to ask why the database is down, we’re making that guy feel like he has the world on a string.”
ADVERTISEMENT Gabor says when she works with clients on their brand identities, the first thing she and her team of about 10 employees does is try to understand who is the human being behind the purchase.
More marketing and branding talk with Deb Gabor.
Courtesy Sol Marketing “This is work that doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” Gabor said. “When we work with clients, we call it discovery. It’s basically research, formal or informal, designed to tell us who is the purchase decision maker we have to influence with this brand? What’s important to them? What attributes of the brand will ensure you deliver to them a promise that gets them to buy?”
Gabor says she felt validated recently when University of Chicago professor Richard Thaler won the 2017 Nobel Prize in economics for his work on behavioral economics. As the Washington Post reported, the Nobel committee called Thaler a “pioneer on integrating economics and psychology,” adding that he had made economics “more human.”
“It’s all about humanity,” Gabor said. “People have to feel something to do something.”
