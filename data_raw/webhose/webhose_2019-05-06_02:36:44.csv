Why Designating the Iranian Rev. Guards Terrorists Would Paint a Big Red Target on US Troops in Iraq,www.commondreams.org,Juan Cole,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/07/why-designating-iranian-rev-guards-terrorists-would-paint-big-red-target-us-troops,"Iraqi Shiite militias close to the IRGC are essentially the hosts and protectors of the some 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq

The Trump administration is considering designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. This is an old Joe Lieberman idea from 2007, and it is a very bad idea. It keeps being done rhetorically (2007, 2017), and then announced again out of amnesia. It is illogical, but it is also practically speaking a potential disaster if it were actually thoroughly implemented.
The notion is illogical because the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a state actor, not a non-state actor. Terrorists are civilians who commit violence against other civilians to achieve some political goal.
The IRGC is sort of like the U.S. national guard. It isn’t the formal army, but it is an adjunct to it.
If the U.S. has a problem with IRGC actions, they should accuse the Iranian government of war crimes. States commit war crimes. There are international laws and institutions for dealing with war crimes.
But the practical side of the issue is that Iraqi Shiite militias close to the IRGC are essentially the hosts and protectors of the some 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq.
Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Saturday for the Iraqi government to expel U.S. troops from Iraq as soon as possible, lest they become entrenched. Iraqi PM Adel Abdul Mahdi is on a state visit to Iran. Iran is proposing dozens of joint projects, despite the US increasingly severe sanctions on Iran.
When ISIL took over 60 percent of Iraqi territory in 2014, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani called for Iraqis to mobilize against the terrorist organization. Many Shiites took this call to mean they should form militias, since the formal Iraqi army had collapsed.
The Shiite-led Iraqi government reached out to the IRGC for help with training and logistics, and the IRGC appears to have sent a small number of troops into Iraq.
The IRGC planned out and helped execute the first major campaign against ISIL, at Tikrit. The U.S. initially declined to join in because it was an Iranian-led campaign, but in the end, when the Iraqi forces got bogged down, the U.S. offered air support. IRGC offered strategic advice, but a lot of the heavy lifting was done by Shiite militiamen who formed a strong bond to the IRGC.
The formal Iraqi military is still small and week, and the Shiite militias are increasingly powerful, having formed civilian political parties, and having done well in elections.
So security is provided to U.S. troops, essentially by the friends of the IRGC.
The Trump administration is painting a big red X on the backs of those troops.

3 Questions That 'Created Havoc' in Betsy DeVos' Department of Education,www.commondreams.org,Jeff Bryant,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/07/3-questions-created-havoc-betsy-devos-department-education,"My latest brush with the education policy edifice's imperviousness to outside inquiry occurred while researching the Education Department's Charter School Program
by Jeff Bryant 0 Comments Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill, June 5, 2018 in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is famous for giving a nonresponse to fairly straightforward questions. More than one commentator has had fun with her contorted evasions, but her inability to explain the rationale for current education policies isn’t confined to her own personality and ideology.
It’s actually been endemic in the education policy world for years, particularly in how the federal government continues to hide its agenda to further privatize the nation’s public school system by creating and expanding charter schools.
Arne Duncan, who served as secretary for the longest period of time before DeVos, was famous for being the consummate non-listener , often talking over people with his prepared remarks and ignoring the advice of teachers and education experts .
This is not a partisan issue. Teachers demanded Duncan’s resignation, and Republican members of Congress have complained that DeVos’ department isn’t responsive to requests for information.
Of course, any comparison between DeVos and Duncan can find some very big differences, but a constant throughout both administrations has been to ignore, wall-off, or obfuscate when confronted with any inquiry aimed at the federal government’s efforts to create and expand charter schools.
A History of Hiding My latest brush with the education policy edifice’s imperviousness to outside inquiry occurred while researching and writing a new report on the Education Department’s Charter School Program (CSP). I coauthored the report Asleep at the Wheel: How the Federal Charter Schools Program Recklessly Takes Taxpayers and Students for a Ride with Network for Public Education executive director Carol Burris.
Burris and I found that up to $1 billion awarded by the CSP—in more than 1,000 grants—was wasted on charter schools that never opened or opened for only brief periods before being shut down for mismanagement, poor performance, lack of enrollment, and fraud.
During our investigations, we came across a previous report published by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) in 2015, during the Obama presidential administration, that found similarly disturbing results, where federal grants had gone to hundreds of charter schools that had basically taken the money and run.
To compile its report, CMD had submitted 33 Freedom of Information Act requests with the Department of Education and was told these records would be forthcoming. The promised records never came.
The department also refused to provide CMD with public records regarding communications between federal and state officials about charter school grants and oversight. The largest grants by far had gone to state education agencies (SEAs) to disburse in subgrants to charter school startups and expansions. Federal officials claimed releasing such information would “constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
After CMD repeated its requests, the department released a list of some charter schools receiving the SEA grant money in a PDF that was “partly illegible.” Other information CMD requested related to the applications for the state grants never came. CMD concluded in its report summary, “Public information about funds received and spent by charters is severely lacking.”
The information CMD was eventually able to piece together came out in its report in October 2015, receiving widespread coverage by education policy blogs and community organizers .
Two months after the CMD report appeared, the Charter School Program released a dataset showing all grants awarded between school years 2006–07 and 2013–14, with information on grants given to start-up, replicate, and expand charter schools. The dataset was released on Dec. 23—just two days before the holiday break—to minimize attention.
Also in the same year, perhaps in anticipation of the CMD report, the department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to SEAs emphasizing the importance of financial accountability for charter schools receiving federal dollars. The letter recommended SEAs conduct regular independent audits and strengthen authorizing practices. And the department provided an “Overview of the 2015 CSP SEA Review Process” explaining how the program awarding charter grants to states is administered.
Given the department’s 2015 efforts to disclose information on charter school grants and provide guidance in how the grants should be administered, it seemed only fair, before issuing our report, to ask the agency what had been done since, especially under this new administration.
Three Seemingly Simple Questions Consequently, on March 8, I sent emails to contacts provided for three CSP grant programs that were the subject of our report. The three emails repeated basically the same three questions, but the email I sent to the contact overseeing the SEA grants, now called “Grants to State Entities,” follows:
This is to inquire about the current grant application review process used for the Charter Schools Program Grants to State Entities. Specifically, in 2015, the Department published an “Overview of the 2015 CSP SEA Review Process.” My questions:
Can you provide a similar document describing how the grant review process is currently being conducted for the Charter Schools Program Grants to State Entities? If not, can you briefly comment on how the grant review process used for the Charter Schools Program Grants to State Entities aligns with or varies from the Overview referenced above? Regarding a “Dear Colleague” letter sent to State Education Agencies in 2015 emphasizing the importance of financial accountability for charter schools receiving federal dollars, was there any follow-up by the Charter School Program to ascertain how many SEAs complied with this request and what was the nature of the new systems and processes put into place by SEAs to provide for greater accountability? On March 15, I received a voicemail message from an official in the public affairs division of the department asking me to call her back. The message started out nice enough but then veered toward criticism. “Apparently you have sent his request to multiple people ,” she said (emphasis original), “and that just creates havoc for everyone.”
When I immediately called her back, I explained I had merely sent my inquiry to the contacts provided on the relevant sections of the department’s website. “That’s understandable,” she replied, but for “future reference” I was told to send inquiries to “a director”—though I’m not sure who that is. And I was told again my questions had “created havoc” in the office but that department staff members were “working on it” and would “take a few days.”
As of this writing, I’ve yet to receive any other replies.
One Thing Clear What followed my phone exchange with the department official was, among other things, a very bad, awful day for the secretary when news of our report broke on page A4 of the Washington Post on the very same day she had to appear on Capitol Hill before a House committee hearing.
During the hearing, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat of Connecticut, referred directly to our report, citing the $1 billion stain on the department’s charter school grant program, and told DeVos, “This budget is full of cruel cuts to education programs, and it baffles me that you found room for a $60 million increase to the Charter School Program... especially when you consider recent reports of waste and abuse in the program.”
When Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, asked DeVos what was being done to recover the $1 billion in alleged financial mismanagement involving charters, DeVos said she “would look into the matter.”
On the issue of how a federal agency could allow charter operators to rip off American taxpayers with impunity, and generally suffer no adverse consequences for their acts, DeVos acknowledged that waste and fraud in the charter grant program had been around for “some time.”
That much is true.
It was under Arne Duncan’s watch that the federal charter grants program was greatly expanded, states were required to lift caps on the numbers of charter schools in order to receive precious federal dollars, and the administration Duncan served in insulted public school teachers by proclaiming National Charter School Week on dates identical to what had always been observed as Teacher Appreciation Week.
And most of the wanton charter fraud we detailed in our report that ran rampant during the Duncan years is now simply continuing under DeVos, with little to no explanation of why this is allowed to occur.
So at least we have that clear.

For as long as climate change has been a part of America’s national consciousness, it’s been talked about in dire terms, evoking images of some hellish, Mad Max-style dystopia. The title and much of the content of David Wallace-Wells’s recent book is a variation on the same theme, stirring up hundreds of pages of images worth of an “Uninhabitable Earth” to make the case that the conversation has not been dire enough.
If you buy scientists' claims that an economy-wide mobilization is the only thing that can stave off full-blown catastrophe, there are some obvious reasons to believe that a Green New Deal... will make us happy.
In describing the nature of the problem, drastic terms are of course necessary. Annihilation looms, and the chaos it threatens to bring about—stronger storms, more fearsome floods, unbearable heat—is truly the stuff of nightmares. But the apocalyptic framing of the problem has also shaped how we talk about solutions to it. From carbon taxes to consumption cuts, climate policy has long been framed as an issue of stiff-lipped sacrifice: What will we have to give up to save our skins? The right takes this characterization to extremes, accusing climate hawks of wanting to ban cars and hamburgers and throw civilization back into the Dark Ages.
While its critics like to pretend otherwise, the Green New Deal—an economy-wide mobilization to decarbonize the United States as soon as possible—turns that question on its head, asking instead where we need to invest society’s vast resources.
But could a plan to curb emissions also make us happier? Could the things we cut back also be the things that make us miserable?
If you buy scientists’ claims that an economy-wide mobilization is the only thing that can stave off full-blown catastrophe, there are some obvious reasons to believe that a Green New Deal—the only call for that on the table—will make us happy, at least in the long run. Averting civilizational collapse, that is, is a happier outcome than the alternative. Provisions like a federal job guarantee, improved public transportation, and reining in pollution could improve millions of lives in the shorter term. A growing body of research, though, points to some more unexpected reasons why a Green New Deal could make us more cheerful.

Canadian Youth Fight Back Against Governments That Limit Their Choices,www.commondreams.org,Tiffany Gooch,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/07/canadian-youth-fight-back-against-governments-limit-their-choices,"These young people are a tidal wave intent on shaping the direction of our country. They are watching, they are activating and organizing, and they are taking notes for how they will do politics differently

Last week, young people across the country sent powerful messages to Canadian federal and provincial politicians: We have you on watch, and we will not be dismissed.
We saw 338 young women take their seats in the House of Commons on Wednesday and make forward thinking statements as a part of the Equal Voice Daughters of the Vote initiative. They talked about action on climate change, they spoke of intersectional feminism and Indigenous rights, and they boldly and brilliantly challenged the status quo of Canadian political discourse.
On Thursday we saw thousands of students across Ontario walk out to protest proposed education cuts. Premier Doug Ford made the mistake of underestimating the influence and autonomy of these young people with flippant remarks aimed to minimize their efforts.
The resistance to policy changes and the political status quo alike—like many throughout history—will be led by young people who choose to see through partisan talking points and demand that government work for them.
These young people are a tidal wave intent on shaping the direction of our country. They are watching, they are activating and organizing, and they are taking notes for how they will do politics differently.
They give me hope.
And this is a moment in Canadian history when hope for our political systems is much needed.
In Quebec, the Legislative Assembly is debating what is, in the words of Montreal philosopher Charles Taylor, “An unneeded answer to a problem that doesn’t exist.”
The Quebec government has tabled Bill 21, aiming to ban public sector employees who are deemed to serve in positions of authority from wearing religious symbols. This would apply to teachers, police officers, prison guards, and judges who wear head coverings such as hijabs or turbans.
It is, simply put, an egregious limit on the rights of Canadians to practice their faith. Regardless of the intention of the bill, it disproportionately negatively impacts hijab wearing Muslim women who work, or hope to work, in public service roles.
Proponents of the bill argue that matters of religion should be private. So should be a teacher’s decision each morning to cover herself the way she chooses. There are many in favor of the bill who do not think it goes far enough, believing it should apply to those in positions of political leadership as well.
Take a moment to think about the consequences of that.
Premier François Legault has asked for calm and respect as his government works to limit debate in an effort to expedite the bill, which goes as far as invoking the notwithstanding clause to override potential federal blocking. He considers Bill 21 to be a widely supported and reasonable compromise, but there are some issues for which a compromise should not be reached.
History has taught us that even majority support for political direction does not always make it right.
This isn’t about a few people being upset. It’s about thousands of Canadians, mostly girls and women, being disenfranchised and discriminated against by their government. These are unreasonable restrictions on the rights of one group in an effort to appease another.
While the bill is likely to pass, resistance is mounting. Municipalities and school boards across Quebec are uniting in opposition, some going as far to suggest they will not enforce it. Legal professionals are also sternly warning against the pre-emptive use of the notwithstanding clause.
In the words of John Lewis, “We have to continue to fight. And sometimes you have to fight some of the old battles over and over again for the next generation, for generations yet unborn. You, too, can make a contribution, and you must.”
A woman’s professional qualifications have nothing to do with how she chooses to cover herself, regardless of her reason. We need teachers who can help young people reach their full potential and inspire a belief that their efforts can change their circumstances. We need good police officers and guards. We need fair and wise judges.
The Canada we build should be one of potential without limits. Our governments should be endeavoring to remove barriers, not moving to create new ones.
Every girl in Canada, hijab wearing or otherwise, should be empowered to lead.

""Compassion is not weakness, and concern for the unfortunate is not socialism.""
—Hubert Horatio Humphrey, A Remark
It’s no one’s fault but it does pose something of a dilemma for citizens trying to impart meaning to current events.
The dilemma presented itself shortly after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was interviewed on The Christian Broadcast Network . The interview took place a few days after Mr. Trump had said it was time to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. During the interview, Mr. Pompeo was asked: “Could it be that President Trump right now has been sort of raised for such a time as this... to help save the Jewish people from the Iranian menace?” A beaming Pompeo responded: “As a Christian, I certainly believe that’s possible,” and he continued by saying he was “confident that the Lord is at work here.”
Although Mr. Pompeo was referring to Mr. Trump’s comments about the Golan Heights, it seems obvious that if God had raised Mr. Trump to take that action, as Mr. Pompeo suggested, he would not have cut him loose with respect to his other activities.
And that brings us then, to the question for this week. Is God making his wishes known through Mr. Trump, or, through Pope Francis? The question is presented because both men addressed similar problems during the last week of March, and had quite different ideas as to how they should be addressed. The problem the two men confronted was immigrants crossing borders.
On March 29, 2019, Mr. Trump announced steps he intended to take to deal with the thousands of immigrants seeking to enter the United States on its southern border. He believed it necessary to announce the new steps because of the unfavorable publicity he was receiving for his treatment of those seeking to enter the United States. Most notable, at the time of his declaration, was the fact that the United States was holding hundreds of men, women, and children who were fleeing terrible conditions in their home countries under a bridge in El Paso, Texas, an enclosure surrounded by fencing and razor wire. According to reports of conditions under the bridge, children were forced to sleep on gravel covered with trash, and they and the adults were sleeping outdoors as nighttime temperatures were as low as 40 degrees. In some instances, the detainees were deprived of sleep, access to medical care, and adequate food and water. Conditions for thousands of other immigrants, though not housed under a bridge, were hardly better.
Mr. Trump attributed the need to impose those conditions on immigrants, to the lack of a border wall to keep the immigrants out. And since there is no border wall and immigrants continue to come in vast numbers, he has said he will withhold aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, countries from which most of the problem immigrants are fleeing. By withholding aid to those countries, he believes, those countries will be more aggressive in restricting the flow of immigrants to the United States. Furthermore, he has often said that if there were a long, impenetrable wall along the southern border, all of the problems posed by illegal immigrants would be solved.
At the same time as Mr. Trump was announcing his proposals for addressing the problem of immigration in the United States, Pope Francis was on a trip to Morocco during which he hoped to support immigrants and establish closer ties between his Church and moderate Islam. In an address in Morocco to 10,000 people, many from sub-Saharan Africa, he told the crowd, “I encourage you to continue to let the culture of mercy grow, a culture in which no one looks at others with indifference, or averts his eyes in the face of their suffering.”
On the return trip to Rome, the Pope spoke with reporters accompanying him on the plane. In response to a reporter’s questions about steps the Spanish government was taking to keep immigrants out, the Pope responded that using barbed wire to keep out those seeking to enter Spain in search of better lives, as the Spanish government had done, was not only cruel, but “not a way to resolve the grave problem of migration.”
One reporter observed that much of Europe was responding to the Pope’s appeals to policymakers and government leaders to protect and help migrants, by doing the opposite. The Pope responded that the leaders were gripped by fear and fear is the beginning of dictatorships. He said that there is all of Europe in which to distribute migrants and it must be done with “an open heart, that accompanies, promotes and integrates.”
Addressing one of Mr. Trump’s favorite solutions to keeping out immigrants, the Pope disputed the value of building walls. He said that one of the phrases from Ivo Andrich’s novel The Bridge on the Drina had always stuck with him. It says that the bridge is made by God with the wings of angels so that men can communicate. Walls, the Pope said, are against communication and are for isolation and, as a result those who close the borders of their country to those seeking better lives “will become prisoners of the walls that they build.”
Here is the question for my readers. If God is addressing the worldwide problem of immigration, who is his spokesperson? Mr. Pompeo’s Trump or Pope Francis?

President Moon's Unenviable Task,www.commondreams.org,Kevin Martin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/07/president-moons-unenviable-task,"Trump should heed the sage advice of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has much more riding on this peace process than Trump does

When President Moon Jae-in of South Korea meets with President Donald Trump at the White House this week, he may find himself fighting the urge to pour cold water all over Trump, because that’s what Trump did to the Korea peace process when he met with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi.
Moon has staked his presidency on advancing permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and Trump has staked his bloated ego on the interconnected goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
Moon has staked his presidency on advancing permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and Trump has staked his bloated ego on the interconnected goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Moon’s task in upcoming and future talks with Trump can be adequately simplified as painting a glamorous picture of the promised land, wherein Trump can claim his largely undeserved credit for a peaceful, denuclearized Korea—but only, Moon may suggest, if Trump embraces the more incremental, reciprocal negotiating posture that diplomacy needs to succeed.
After reminding Trump of all he has to gain from a comprehensive nuclear agreement with North Korea, a relatively easy task, Moon could try to convince Trump that the administration’s current maximalist approach is doomed to fail. It is doomed because North Korea knows the storied past of U.S. regime change, in particular the story of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, who negotiated away his country’s nuclear program only to be brutally murdered by rebels in the wake of a U.S.-backed NATO bombing campaign designed to remove him from power. It is doomed because North Korea’s leaders know that if they don’t secure irreversible security guarantees, they could meet a similar fate. It is doomed because North Korea will not disarm without those security guarantees and without sanctions relief that its people desperately need, all of which will require incremental diplomacy to secure.
Next, Moon could try to turn Trump against one of his own. National Security Advisor John Bolton was widely blamed for torpedoing the Hanoi talks, where he reportedly pushed for an all-or-nothing style agreement . Among other unrealistic demands, Bolton insisted that North Korea sweeten the deal that working groups had all but finalized ahead of the summit by throwing in full disclosure of its chemical and biological weapons stockpiles. Of course, disclosure and eventual dismantlement of those programs are worthwhile goals, and are not unreasonable asks within a broader process of reciprocal diplomacy. But as eleventh-hour demands at the tail end of a high-stakes summit, they look more like torpedoes than goals.
Even a cursory look at Bolton’s track record reveals his disdain for diplomacy, and underscores the danger of giving him a seat at any negotiating table. Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement as well as his planned withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty can both be traced back to Bolton. So can the demise of the 1994 Agreed Framework, which froze North Korea’s nuclear program in place for the better part of a decade before collapsing on the Bush administration’s watch. Writing in his memoir, Bolton shamelessly recalled that North Korea’s efforts to secure a uranium enrichment capability were “the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework.” In other words, rather than seeking to address North Korea’s troubling activities by strengthening the agreement, Bolton swung his hammer. Anyone who takes such pride in destroying hard-won arms control agreements should have no role in negotiating them.
Finally, Moon could try to convince Trump that he can employ the incremental approach needed to make any real progress while still claiming credit for a major agreement with North Korea. Ironically, the perfect template for the structure of such a deal already exists. The Iran nuclear agreement , also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), evolved from an interim agreement called the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA). The interim deal, signed in November of 2013, was a huge deal in and of itself, freezing Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for partial sanctions relief. Notably, it took until April of 2015 for negotiators to secure a framework agreement, the outlines of the final deal, and then until July of 2015 to sign the final agreement, so Moon may also need to extol the virtues of patience to his decidedly impatient counterpart.
Ahead of the Hanoi summit, negotiators appeared to have lined up a series of agreements that, taken together, could well have been billed as an interim agreement, or in Trumpian terms, a terrific deal that no one else could have negotiated—if only Bolton hadn’t brought his trusty hammer. The agreements on the table included the opening of joint liaison offices in Pyongyang and Washington, D.C.; partial sanctions relief in exchange for closure of a centerpiece of North Korea’s nuclear program, the Yongbyon facility; the return of more U.S. service member remains from the Korean War; and last but not least, a declaration of the end of the Korean War, an important step toward signing a long-overdue peace agreement to formally end the Korean War and toward meeting North Korea’s desire for security guarantees.
Between the photo ops and fanfare, Moon will likely be urging Trump to put Humpty Dumpty back together again—to go back to the table with North Korea and trust his working level diplomats to give him a similar package of agreements that can be touted as a big deal in its own right, and as a critical step toward a comprehensive deal, which it would be. Trump should heed the sage advice of President Moon, who has much more riding on this peace process than Trump does.

'Bigotry Is Deadly': Warnings of 'Normalized Hate Speech' After Latest Threats Targeting Rep.

by Jessica Corbett, staff writer 0 Comments Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) listens during a news conference on Jan. 10, 2019 at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)
Advocacy groups, progressives, and politicians are warning about the dangers of ""normalized hate speech"" and Islamophobia after the latest round of threats targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee and one of the first Muslim congresswomen.
""The political environment, led by an Islamophobe in the White House, has normalized hate speech and emboldened bigots in their actions.""
—Afaf Nasher, CAIR-NY
""The political environment, led by an Islamophobe in the White House, has normalized hate speech and emboldened bigots in their actions,"" Afaf Nasher, executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), said Saturday.
""The rising threat of Islamophobia and white supremacy must be taken seriously,"" he added. CAIR is the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group.
Nasher expressed relief that law enforcement tracked down Patrick Carlineo, of Addison, New York, who was arrested and charged on Friday with threatening to assault and murder Omar, a Democrat who represents Minnesota.
In a phone call to Omar's office last month, the 55-year-old allegedly told one of her staffers: ""Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she's an (expletive) terrorist. I'll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull.""
While being questioned by the FBI after the incident, ""Carlineo told the agents he is a patriot, that he loves President Trump, and hates radical Muslims in government,"" the Elmira Star Gazette reported Friday, citing the complaint .
""Never forget: bigotry is deadly. We saw it at Tree of Life, we saw it in Christchurch. And we're seeing it here.""
—Abdul El-Sayed, progressive activist
News of Carlineo's arrest came after The Blast reported Wednesday that, according to court records, Omar was the target of an unrelated bomb threat in mid-March when she was the featured speaker for a CAIR event at a Los Angeles hotel.
A female caller, who dialed from a blocked number, reportedly left a voicemail saying: ""What would you do if I told you your hotel was going to be bombed. That is exactly what's going to happen if you allow the likes of Ilhan Omar into your hotel. She is a danger to American society and your hotel. You are not to allow her foot into there if you value your own safety. Do not allow her in there. Cancel the event.""
The newly reported threats provoked sympathy and support for Omar, including from activist Linda Sarsour and the advocacy group Jewish Voice for Peace:
Most will never understand what it feels like to get death threats, especially as a mom. It’s horrific. You don’t have to want to kill people you don’t agree with. That’s sick. Feeling triggered. Sending love to Congresswoman Omar. May God protect this woman. https://t.co/191HhWvqL8

Fellow freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) took to Twitter on Saturday to call out Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro, who recently suggested on her show that Omar may be more loyal to her religion than she is to the U.S. Constitution because the congresswoman wears a headscarf.
""Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this,"" said Ocasio-Cortez, referring to the threats levied against her colleague.
Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this.

Verbal attacks aimed at Omar have ramped up in recent months as the congresswoman has repeatedly criticized the Israeli government and the influence of pro-Israel lobbyists on U.S. lawmakers and policy.
Despite the recent threats to Omar's safety, President Donald Trump continued ""using her as fodder for ridicule,"" as Rolling Stone senior writer Jamil Smith put it , during a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas on Saturday.

Former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed , a progressive Muslim activist and physician, was among those who called out Trump for his mention of Omar.
""Words have consequences,"" Abdul El-Sayed tweeted at the president, pointing to recent mass shootings that targeted Jews in Pittsburgh and Muslims in New Zealand . The suspect in the Christchurch attack praised Trump as ""a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose"" in a manifesto he posted online.
""Never forget: bigotry is deadly,"" El-Sayed added. ""Prayers for security for all our public servants, especially those serving under threat.""

I decided that it’s a really appropriate day for a good news posting. Do we need it!
I know I had said I would report again after Shabbat concerning the situation in Gaza. But that report will have to keep a bit longer. That is not only because (as usual) matters are still in flux; it is, even more so, because the information I have acquired makes me sick to my stomach. We are not at war. This is obvious. But what I want to say is, “What the hell is going on?!”
So…for the moment we will focus on the good. It is there, if we seek it out. And here we have a chance to achieve perspective:
“Two exciting new discoveries made during archaeological excavations in the City of David, Jerusalem, were released to the public on Sunday (March 31). The finds—a blue agate seal and a clay seal impression—are circa 2,600 years old and were uncovered by Israeli archaeologist Yuval Gadot’s team during the ongoing Givati Parking Lot excavation.
“…the burnt clay seal impression has attracted the most interest. The inscription reads: “Belonging to Nathan-Melech, Servant of the King” The name Nathan-Melech appears only once in the biblical account (2 Kings 23:11)—he was an official in King Josiah’s royal court. The bulla dates to the same time period.” That is seventh century BCE.

“Israeli researchers revealed on Thursday (March 28) that an area near the Dead Sea is home to the world’s longest salt cave…
“…an international group led by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HU)’s Cave Research Center (CRC)…along with 80 cavers from nine countries, say they have successfully mapped the Malham salt cave in Mount Sedom,..170 meters below sea level at the southwestern tip of the Dead Sea.
“At 10 kilometers long, the Malham salt cave is now the world’s longest salt cave…
“’The Malham Salt Cave is a river cave. Water from a surface stream flowed underground and dissolved the salt, creating caves – a process that is still going on when there is strong rain over Mount Sedom about once a year,’ said Professor Amos Frumkin, director of the CRC at HU’s Institute of Earth Sciences. In this way, the Malham Salt Cave is ‘alive’ and continues to grow.
“In addition to its length, the Malham Cave contains a stunning array of salt stalactites and salt crystals within its chambers.”

I thought this was interesting:
It was discovered not so long ago that Israeli children had fewer peanut allergies because of the ubiquitous Israeli snack Bamba, which has a peanut component. For the last 12 years, it has been Israel’s most popular snack, used regularly by 90% of Israeli households.
The snack started getting serious attention when it was mentioned in health reports, such as the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study. Its findings were supported by the very prestigious National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.
It was found that exposing infants to peanuts within their first year (usually via Bamba) helped prevent peanut allergy by as much as an astounding 81 percent. Bamba, which has a maize base, is soft, easy to handle and to ingest.
“The results have the potential to transform how we approach food allergy prevention,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Director of NIAID, said.
Now Osem, which manufactures Baba, has opened in new factory in Kiryat Gat, which is producing a million bags a day to meet the international demand.

“Researchers at Tel Aviv University will join a group of European academics in a four-year, €7 million effort to create a robot — the GrowBot — that can climb like ivy or a vine plant to overcome hurdles…
“The low-mass and low-volume robots that the consortium hopes to develop will adapt to their surroundings, as do climbing plants, and will be able to negotiate voids and maneuver on uneven surfaces where existing robots would get stuck or fall, the consortium says on its website.
“’Robots with wheels or legs that exist today, many of which have been inspired by animals, are able to move across surfaces, but have difficulty dealing with obstacles – such as stairs, rocks, fissures and pits,’ said Tel Aviv University’s Yasmine Meroz of the George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, who will lead the Israeli team in the consortium.”

“Israel is now one of the leading countries in the world for nature accessibility,” says Yuval Wagner, president of Access Israel, an advocacy and awareness nonprofit he founded in 1999. Paralyzed in a 1987 helicopter accident, he is now able to enjoy a variety of sites in his wheelchair.
Facilities for greater accessibility have been installed in approximately 70 national parks, archeological and heritage sites administered by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) as well as in 300 forests managed by Keren Kayemet LeYisrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF).
Accessibility covers everything from parking to trails, restrooms to picnic areas.
Some of the most ambitious adaptations took place even before the 2008 accessibility laws came into effect, says Zeev Margalit, director of conservation and development at INPA.
“The first two sites prepared for people with disabilities were Masada and Tel Dan, 20 years ago. This was very challenging but it was a great thing.”

The hospital, “affiliated with Tel Aviv University, includes centers for nearly all medical divisions and specialties, and serves over 1 million patients per year.”

Judge rules New York county can't bar unvaccinated children from public places,thehill.com,Zack Budryk,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/437765-judge-rules-new-york-county-cant-bar-unvaccinated-children-from-public-places,"Judge rules New York county can't bar unvaccinated children from public places By Zack Budryk - 04/07/19 03:49 PM EDT
A state judge has ruled a New York county cannot ban unvaccinated minors from public spaces amid a measles outbreak, according to The Washington Post .
“Children are hereby permitted to return to their respective schools forthwith and otherwise to assemble in public places,” Judge Rolf Thorsen wrote in the Friday decision. ADVERTISEMENT
The ban was announced in March in Rockland County after more than 150 measles cases were reported. It barred any resident of the county under 18 who had not yet been given the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine from public places such as schools and parks until either the end of the 30-day emergency declaration or until they received the vaccine.
In response, a group of parents filed a lawsuit calling the emergency declaration “arbitrary and capricious” and writing it had led “children to be denied attendance at nursery programs and schools and has effectively prohibited their movement and denied them the right to congregate and assemble in public places.”
Dori Reiss, a professor at U.C. Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, told the Post the declaration was for a short enough period that it would likely not be worth the effort to fight the court ruling.
Last week, New York lawmakers proposed legislation that would eliminate non-medical religious exemptions for vaccinations. There have been nearly 400 confirmed cases of measles in 15 different states between January 1 and March 28 of 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most Popular"

According to CryptoCompare, “The features below are implemented in Decred and will be available in full at launch. For a deeper description, please consult the Decred Technical Brief. Novel hybridized proof-of-work/proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system – A decentralized lottery is used to select PoS miners to vote on PoW blocks. The PoW and PoS subsidies account for 60% and 30% of each total block subsidy, respectively. This system is based on that of MC2, which is very similar to, but developed independently from, Proof-of-Activity (PoA) by Iddo Bentov, Charles Lee, Alex Mizrahi and Meni Rosenfeld.Cold staking and decentralized stake pooling – The ability to generate new coins without the risk of having your coins online when PoS mining. The PoS mining system has also been engineered with distributed, decentralized stake pooling in mind, so that even those with small amounts of stake can participate in network validation.Internal voting system for the addition of new features and hard or soft fork selection – Both PoW and PoS miners can vote for features and issues through bit flags, providing a sensible mechanism for resolving disputes about the features of the blockchain.Immutable transaction hashes (“transaction IDs”) by separating transaction signatures from the rest of the transaction data – A permanent fix for transaction hash malleability has been implemented that prevents mutability of the transaction hash by separating it from its input signatures. This allows more efficient SPV validation. Fraud proofs have also been added.Elliptic curve cryptography over secp256k1 with optional Curve25519 support – The Bitcoin scripting system has been modified to allow for simple, drop-in addition of new elliptical curve digital signature algorithms.Schnorr signatures with threshold n-of-n support – In addition to supporting Schnorr signatures, groups of signers can now jointly sign transactions off-chain in constant size signatures, ensuring higher privacy and less blockchain bloat.Script enhancements and new OP codes – New OP codes have been added to the existing Bitcoin scripting engine, and extensions for the plug-in use of future scripting engines have been added.PoW mining using BLAKE256 hash algorithm – Inspired by Bernstein's Chacha stream cipher, SHA3 finalist BLAKE256 offers speed as well as high security.Compatibility with Bitcoin transaction scripting system – Decred's scripting system has been derived from Bitcoin's with care in ensuring that all future updates to the Bitcoin transaction script will be easily extensible to Decred. Further, any newly created functionalities will also be devised with backwards compatibility with Bitcoin in mind.Modularized, easy-to-use Golang btcsuite codebase – Thanks the to the codebase inherited from btcsuite, adding new features to the daemon or wallet will be facile. Decred will episodically sync updates from btcsuite, so that it benefits from the latest developments in Bitcoin.Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets – Wallets use a seed to deterministically generate addresses, so your wallet can be restored from a single BIP0032 seed.Transaction expiration – Transactions have a new expiration field to prevent inclusion into the blockchain after a certain height.Patches for intrinsic Bitcoin bugs – Extra push for multisignature scripts has been removed, SIGHASH_SINGLE behavior has been corrected.Approximately 21 million coins – Exponential decay in subsidy or the number of coins generated per year.Self-funded development via block subsidy – In order to have an ongoing source of funding for development work, a consensus rule has been added to allocate 10% of each block subsidy to a development organization. This entity is transparent and responsible for funding development work performed by current and new developers so that the project remains sustainable without a funding dependence on outside forces in the future. Decred therefore improves with growth in a sustainable way and is accountable only to its users. “
