Mr Rees-Mogg, chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), told Sky News that Mrs May would be “held to account” for her decisions to delay Brexit as well as for her decision to invite Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for talks over a possible compromise Brexit deal.
Rees-Mogg warned that the decision to meet with the hard-left opposition leader “risks giving a degree of credibility” to Jeremy Corbyn and of “undermining the general thrust of the Conservative argument that he is a Marxist who would be dangerous to this nation’s interests”.
The ERG chief is not the first Brexiteer to condemn the Prime Minister’s meeting with Mr Corbyn, with Leader of the House of Commons and Leave supporter Andrea Leadsom claiming that the party was working with Labour “through gritted teeth”.

Former Foreign Secretary and Vote Leave campaign frontman Boris Johnson was Quote: d as saying, “If Corbyn gets his way, we remain in the Customs Union so that we can’t control our trade policy, huge areas of law-making we can’t control, and Brexit is becoming soft to the point of disintegration .”
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose 10 MPs prop up the Conservatives’ minority government, said in an official statement that Theresa May’s handling of Brexit was “lamentable” and that she was “sub-contracting out the future of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn”.
Mrs May has responded to the criticism by claiming she had “no choice” but to offer to work with the Labour leader, although it many believe it was and is within her power to deliver a No Deal Brexit on March 29th.

Mr Corbyn has reportedly been waiting on the Prime Minister to move her infamous “red lines” on the type of Brexit she will accept, which have been sticking points in negotiations, in order to reach a compromise deal — but it appears so far that negotiations have not made progress.
Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has said that “we are currently waiting for the Government to come back to us now to state whether they are prepared to move on any of their red lines.”
“The sad thing is at the moment we haven’t seen overall any real changes to the deal, but we are hopeful that will change in coming days,” she added.
Britain 'Officially Ready' for No Deal Brexit, Reveals Govt Minister Responsible for Plans https://t.co/iwJVx1bM00
 April 6, 2019
The United Kingdom was due to leave the European Union on March 29th but Mrs May sought an extension until April 12th. With the deadlock unbroken, she is now looking to seek a longer extension until June 30th, with the option to leave earlier if a deal can be reached. Such a move would mean Britain having to contest European Parliamentary elections, due to begin on May 23rd.
According to a Sky Data poll, a plurality of Britons would be “angry” if Britain took part in the elections after voting to leave the European Union nearly three years ago.

As it stands, the United Kingdom should officially leave the EU on April 12th without a deal if an extension is not granted by the EU, unless it revokes the Article 50 procedure for leaving the bloc altogether.
One former Conservative Minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, who resigned over Mrs May’s handling of Brexit has said that Britain is officially ready for a No Deal situation, suggesting Prime Minister had been kept in the dark about the country’s level of preparedness.

The Barr Mystery: Why Would Someone Seek Out a Chance to Disgrace Himself?,bluevirginia.us,Andy Schmookler,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://bluevirginia.us/2019/04/the-barr-mystery-why-would-someone-seek-out-a-chance-to-disgrace-himself,"4
Now that William Barr is acting — rather openly, if not admittedly — as Donald Trump’s accomplice in the obstruction of justice, I find myself baffled by the man.
For a while, around the time of Barr’s confirmation hearings, I entertained the idea that – once installed in the position of Attorney General – Barr would prove to be a man of integrity. Maybe he’d “snookered” Trump, fooling the President into thinking that he’d be his protector, while planning that, once appointed, he would play the national hero by protecting the rule of law. (Which he’d know could not be assumed the next Attorney General — picked by Donald Trump — would do.)
It’s now clear that was not the case. Instead what we see is a man performing the disgraceful function for which a disgraceful President selected him, and for which he will doubtless stand disgraced in the judgment of history.
The guy who signed on for this job was a man who had been Attorney General before, and therefore had no unfulfilled dreams of being near the center of power; who apparently enjoyed a considerable degree of respect in the legal world, and therefore had a reputation he could lose; and who at 68 years old is presumably playing the last major role in his career, and therefore likely knew his historical legacy was at stake.
What kind of person, in William Barr’s position, would go out of his way to obtain a position in order to play a role that would make him an ignominious figure in American history?
It has been notable how many people — even among those who have been critical of how Barr has handled the Mueller Report –have said something along the lines of, “I’m not questioning his integrity.”
But how can one not question the integrity of this Attorney General who – despite having just sworn his oath of office — has taken it upon himself to do whatever he can to protect the President from the rule of law?
What integrity is there in Barr’s distorting – as recent reports have strongly indicated – the contents of the Mueller Report, presenting falsely a less “troubling” picture of Trump?
What integrity is there in an Attorney General who inappropriately interposes himself – by stalling, by assuming the authority to choose what even the fully authorized members of Congress will not be allowed to see – to keep the fruits of this vital investigation from reaching their constitutionally appropriate recipients?
And where’s the integrity in an AG — a political appointee of the President — arrogating to himself the right to pass judgment on the matter of obstruction of justice, thereby defeating the whole purpose of establishing a Special Prosecutor, independent of political influence?
(So Barr declares, No, the President is not guilty of obstruction.)
Some have suggested that Barr’s judgment represents his own actual legal opinion on the question of obstruction: not a lack of integrity there, they suggest, but just an extreme view of executive powers.
These people cite the unsolicited 19-page memorandum that Barr sent to the Trump administration. (This is a document universally interpreted as a job application for the Attorney Generalship — a position that was known would be opening up after the 2018 election, once AG Sessions was fired for the sin of recusing himself as required by the policies of the Justice Department, rather than sacrifice the law for the sake of the President.)
In that document, Barr argues that a President cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice, because all federal law enforcement falls under his constitutional authority as chief executive. So it’s no surprise, people say, that given Barr’s view of executive power he would absolve Trump of a crime he could not commit.
But that assumes that Barr believed his own argument– an assumption that seems untenable because the argument is so transparently bogus, and because Barr is not regarded as so stupid as to buy such a flimsy argument. Barr’s stated position requires ignoring the important concept of “abuse of power.”
Presidents have various undisputed powers, but they are not allowed to exercise them with “corrupt intent.”
Sure, the President can fire the Director of the FBI. But to fire him in order to protect himself from a legitimate (and vitally important) investigation is an abuse of power. And so one finds among the articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon the offense of his abusing his presidential powers.
Far more likely than that an intelligent man like Barr would believe his own flimsy argument is that he was willing — in his memorandum — to speak falsely in order to get Trump to him to make him Attorney General.
So Barr wanted the job, was willing to make a bogus case to tell Trump he’d protect him, and has proceeded – upon receipt of the Mueller investigation – to do a whole series of things that amount to the latest phase of Trump’s obstruction of justice.
Why would anyone who was in Barr’s position just months ago – having already had the experience of holding that important position as America’s “top law enforcement official,” being widely held in at least a reasonable degree of esteem by the people in his professional world, nearing the end of his professional life – strive to get a job he would fill in a way that would cement for himself a place of disgrace in the eyes of history?
(It’s not like he was already AG and this odious obstructive task unexpectedly fell to him; he sought it out in full knowledge of what it likely would entail.)
Even if we suppose that Barr has the same indifference to how future generations of Americans will regard him as Rudy Giuliani expressed (“I don’t care about my legacy,” Giuliani told the New Yorker . “I’ll be dead.”), what kind of man would seek out the opportunity to place such a shameful role?

"Trump Tax Returns: Mick Mulvaney, White House Chief of Staff, on Fox Says Democrats Will ‘Never’ See Them",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-tax-returns-mick-mulvaney-white-house-chief-of-staff-on-fox-says-democrats-will-never-see-them,"LINES DRAWN White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney On Fox: Americans Will ‘Never’ See Trump Tax Returns Democrats in Congress demanded six years worth of the president's personal and business tax returns from the IRS last week. 04.07.19 11:04 AM ET Fox News
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday morning that the House Democrats will “never” see President Trump’s tax returns , setting the White House stance on an issue that has roiled Washington over the past week.
Pushing back in what could be a losing battle, Mulvaney added, “Nor should they. That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway.”
Last week, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, a Democrat, wrote a letter to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig and demanded the agency deliver six years wroth of the president’s personal and business returns.
Neal gave the IRS a deadline of April 10, citing a federal tax quote that states the Treasury has an obligation to turn over the records upon such a request.
The president maintains that he cannot deliver the tax returns because of an ongoing audit. “We’re under audit, despite what people said, and we’re working that out,” Trump told reporters last week. “I’m always under audit, it seems. But I’ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you’re audited.”
Mulvaney said that Democrats “know they're not going to get the tax returns.”
“They just want attention on the issue because they don’t want to talk to us about policy,” he said.
“They know one of the fundamental principles of the IRS is to protect the confidentiality of you and me and everybody else who files taxes,” Mulvaney added. “They know that. They know the terms under law by which the IRS can give them the documents, but ‘political hit job’ is not one of those reasons.”
Democratic Representative Dan Kildee, who is on the committee seeking Trump’s returns, told ABC News that the president and his lawyers are wrong about the law.
“This is a legitimate authority that the Congress has,” Kildee said. “This president, by the way, is the least transparent president that we’ve had in half a century.”
Kildee said that the president would not have the final word on whether his tax returns are released. “It is not up to President Trump, it is not up to some lawyer that President Trump hires, to determine whether his tax returns can be sought,” Kildee said. “This is not an autocracy. The president does not get to decide for himself and for Congress what a legitimate subject of inquiry might be.”"

""I think that is absolutely the direction we should go,"" Sanders said at a town hall in Muscatine, Iowa, when asked if more states should extend the vote to felons currently behind bars, according to the Des Moines Register . ADVERTISEMENT
""In my state, what we do is separate. You’re paying a price, you committed a crime, you’re in jail. That's bad,"" he said. ""But you’re still living in American society and you have a right to vote.
""I believe in that, yes, I do.”

Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann Warren Sanders to roll out updated 'Medicare for all' proposal Wednesday Booker to introduce bill to form study commission on reparations Dem senators call for Trump to restore release for pregnant migrants MORE (D-Mass.), said recently that she endorsed enfranchising felons who have served their sentence, but did not go as far as the Vermont senator regarding voting rights for those currently behind bars, the newspaper noted.
""While they’re incarcerated, I think that’s something we can have more conversation about,"" she said in Storm Lake, Iowa, according to the Register.
Iowa, along with Kentucky, is currently one of two states in which felons can only vote with the governor’s permission, according to the newspaper. In late March, the state House passed an amendment endorsed by Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) that would automatically re-enfranchise felons once their sentences are complete but the measure was voted down by the state Senate, it added.
