Two teen girls arrested for 'plotting nine murders' in Florida - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47994306,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US classroom (file image) Two teenage girls have been arrested in the state of Florida for allegedly planning to murder nine people, US media report.
The pair from Avon Park Middle School, both aged 14, were arrested on Wednesday after a teacher found a folder detailing their alleged plans.
In eight sheets of notes, the girls allegedly laid out plans to obtain guns and move and dispose of the bodies.
They are both being held in custody, pending a trial hearing.
Each suspect faces nine counts of conspiracy to commit murder and three counts of conspiracy to commit kidnapping.
The teacher reportedly noticed the girls acting ""hysterical"" whilst looking for the folder, and allegedly overheard one of them say ""I'm just going to tell them it's a prank if they call me or if they find it"".
The teacher later found the folder, which had been labelled as ""Private info"", ""Do not open,"" and ""Project 11/9"".
Inside, handwritten notes outlined a list of names and included detailed plans about how to carry out the killings, according to the broadcaster NBC.
The documents talk about obtaining firearms and destroying evidence by burning and burying their victims' bodies.
Another note also addressed what clothing the teenagers would wear for the task.
""NO NAILS,"" it reportedly read.
""NO Hair Showing from the moment we put on our clothes"".
""It doesn't matter if they thought it was a joke,"" said Scott Dressel, spokesperson for Highlands County Sheriff's Office , Quote: d by Fox47 news channel.
""There's no joking about something like this. You don't make a joke about killing people."""
Egypt referendum: Opposition fear return to Mubarak era - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Sally Nabil Bbc Arabic,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-47974724,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Banner in central Cairo urging Egyptians to ""say yes to the constitutional amendments"" Walking across Cairo, you can't miss the huge banners calling on Egyptians to support constitutional amendments that would keep President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi in power until 2030.
Egyptians began voting on Saturday in a three-day referendum on the proposed changes, a few days after they were approved by a sweeping majority inside parliament.
""Say yes to stability and security,"" reads one banner in central Cairo. The new amendments will extend the presidential term from four to six years, and the president can only be re-elected once.
But Mr Sisi is being given special treatment.
Not only will his current term be extended to six years, but he will be allowed to run for a third term as an exception.
The military-backed president, who took office in 2014, was originally meant to leave in 2022 after his second term expires.
Why did Egypt want President Sisi interview pulled? ""We are rebuilding through these so-called amendments the state of the single ruler,"" says Khaled Dawood, a liberal opposition figure. He believes Egypt will go back to ""square one, the same autocratic rule it experienced before the 2011 revolution"".
The changes will give President Sisi tight control over the judiciary, with powers to appoint the prosecutor general and all high level judges.
""This ends the hopes of millions of Egyptians who took to the streets in January 2011, wishing to have a rotation of power and a president who can be held accountable,"" Mr Khaled adds.
Growing apathy? Mr Sisi has not issued any statements regarding the amendments or the referendum.
The speaker of the parliament has made it clear the proposals have been put forward by the majority bloc. But the parliament is full of the president's loyalists, and it has been repeatedly criticised for being a rubber stamp.
The president's supporters argue he should remain in power to carry on with his economic reforms.
MP Mohamed Abu Hamed believes it's the people who have the final say.
He says the amendments will not annul any future elections, adding: ""If President Sisi decides to run again, he might be challenged by another candidate who is more appealing to voters.""
Image copyright EPA Image caption Egypt's parliament, packed with Sisi supporters, approved the constitutional changes last week Following the 2011 revolution, Egyptians were politically very active.
They queued for hours in front of the polling stations in the first presidential elections staged a year after the revolution. These elections brought Mohamed Morsi to power, the country's first civilian president.
A year later, he was overthrown by Mr Sisi, the defence minister at the time, following mass protests.
Many Egyptians, today, seem to have lost a lot of their enthusiasm.
""What kind of a difference would my vote make? Whether or not I take part in the referendum, these amendments will pass,"" a young man, who preferred to remain anonymous, tells me.
Other priorities Some people are concerned about their livelihoods, more than anything else.
""I haven't heard much about these changes, but I am certain they are made for the powerful not the people,"" says a middle aged lady, who also did not want to be identified.
She has decided not to vote because ""everything is going wrong. Prices are high and our living conditions are dire"".
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Rights groups have questioned the haste at which the vote was organised - in just a few days For a considerable number of voters, stability remains an important priority.
""Look at what's happening in the region. At least we feel safe here,"" Mohamed, a man in his 50s tell me. He believes the president is investing in infrastructure by building ""new bridges, tunnels and roads"".
""If he leaves no-one can continue what he started,"" he adds.
The Sisi government takes pride in bringing back a long-missed stability.
Tourism, for example, a lifeline for the economy, has benefited from the stable status quo. Official statistics show that visitors are coming back and growth rates in this vital sector are on the rise.
Militarising the state? The amendments will boost female parliamentary representation, allocating a quota of 25 per cent of seats to women. They will also introduce a second chamber to parliament, in addition to appointing one or more deputies to the president.
One significant change is related to adding extra powers to the army.
For decades, the military institution has been a key player in Egyptian politics, and economy. Now it has been appointed as ""the guardian of the constitution and civil state"".
Critics say this will open the doors wide for militarising the Egyptian state.
But MP Abu Hamed says the army had sided with the people to unseat Hosni Mubarak in 2011, and to oust Mr Morsi in 2013.
He believes this change is ""not inventing a new reality, it is just legitimising it. The army always acts upon people's wishes"".
Opposition cyber campaign 'stifled' Opponents say the authorities are leaving them no room to hold any public campaign against the amendments. ""Members of our parties are arrested, and we are banned from all local media,"" Khaled Dawood says.
Meanwhile, Netblock - an NGO that monitors cyber security - says internet providers in Egypt are blocking access to an estimated 34,000 internet domains ""in an apparent bid to stamp out an opposition campaign under the slogan Void"".
The monitoring group says the campaign's website was blocked after it had reportedly gathered 60,000 signatures in a few hours.

Hundreds of news websites, which the authorities accuse of supporting terrorism, have been already blocked in Egypt over the past year.
""There is no press, no media, nothing but the government voice,"" says Mokhtar Mounir, a human rights lawyer, who paints a very grim picture of Mr Sisi's rule.
""We have a huge number of political prisoners, people dying of medical neglect behind bars, and women sent to prison for trivial charges,"" he adds.
President Sisi ratifies law tightening control over websites The president has repeatedly said there are no prisoners of conscience in Egypt, insisting on the independence of the judiciary.
For now, things are apparently calm and it's up to the Egyptian voters to decide.
But the concern is if President Sisi tightens his grip on power further, public anger could erupt as it did less than a decade ago."
Ministry building under attack in Kabul - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47996762," Hundreds of people were evacuated from the area near the communications ministry Seven people were killed in an attack on the Afghan ministry of information in Kabul, officials said.
An explosion was heard at 11:40 local time (07:10 GMT) and sporadic gunfire continued for over six hours before officials declared the incident over.
A ministry source said one of the attackers got inside the building.
The attack comes a day after talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban were suspended, but the Taliban said they were not behind the assault.
Among the dead were four civilians and three police officers, while another eight civilians were wounded.
Although Kabul still sees fighting, this attack follows months of relative calm.
What's happening on the ground? The attack happened in a busy area of central Kabul, near one of the city's most popular hotels, a couple of other ministries, and the presidential palace.
There were four attackers in total - all of whom were eventually shot dead by police officers.
Why is Afghanistan more dangerous than ever? Will talks with the Taliban bring peace or chaos? 'We can't go back': The Afghan women determined not to lose The Serena Hotel, which is heavily fortified, is one of the few still used by foreign visitors.
At 18 storeys high, the information ministry building is believed to be one of the tallest in Kabul.
About 2,000 people were feared to have been stranded inside for hours, until they were eventually freed.
Footage broadcast on local TV showed a small cloud of smoke rising near the tower block, while people climbed out of the windows of one of the lower levels, AFP news agency reported.
Hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the building, the ministry said, but eight people were injured and taken to hospital.
Image copyright EPA Image caption The attack happened in a busy area of central Kabul Who is responsible? The Taliban's spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the organisation was not behind Saturday's attack.
The Afghan branch of the Islamic State group has carried out a number of deadly attacks in Kabul but has not so far said it was behind this one.
Where are we with peace talks? The US and the Taliban have been involved in attempts to negotiate a peace process. The sides have held five rounds of direct talks since October 2018, and are now in the middle of their sixth.
A conference between officials from the militant group and about 250 Afghan politicians had been due to take place in the Qatari capital Doha on 20 and 21 April.
But the meeting was abruptly called off on Thursday after the Taliban complained about the size and status of the Afghan delegation.
In a statement, the Taliban accused the Afghan government of ""sabotaging this conference and peace efforts"".
Image copyright Reuters Image caption The building is believed to be one of the tallest in Kabul The goal is to resolve Afghanistan's civil conflict and negotiate the withdrawal of US forces in the country.
The US also wants the Taliban to guarantee that Afghan territory won't be used by foreign militants, and that they won't pose a security threat to the rest of the world.
In 2001 a US-led military coalition overthrew the Taliban for sheltering al-Qaeda, the militant group behind the 9/11 attacks.
US officials say the conflict in Afghanistan now costs them about $45bn (¬£34bn) a year.
The Taliban currently control and influence more territory than they have at any point in the past 18 years."
India chief justice accused of sexual harassment - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47996468,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ranjan Gogoi was appointed chief justice last October India's Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi has been accused of sexual harassment by a former Supreme Court employee.
The 35-year-old woman has filed an affidavit alleging two instances of misconduct in October last year, shortly after Mr Gogoi was appointed.
She says her family was victimised after she refused the advances.
A statement said Mr Gogoi, 64, ""totally denied"" the ""false and scurrilous"" accusations. He has labelled them an attempt to ""destabilise the judiciary"".
What does the woman allege? The allegations were filed in a sworn affidavit that has been sent to Supreme Court judges.
In it the married woman, who cannot be named under Indian law, alleges the misconduct occurred on 10 and 11 October at the offices in Mr Gogoi's residence.
She alleges Mr Gogoi ""hugged me around the waist, and touched me all over my body with his arms"" and pressed his body against her.
When he did not stop, she says she ""was forced to push him away from me with my hands"".
The woman says Mr Gogoi then told her not to mention what had happened or her family ""would be greatly disturbed"".
The woman alleges she was transferred three times, then fired in December. She says her husband and brother were both suspended from their jobs.
In March a resident of the city of Jhajjar filed a complaint alleging she had kept money she had taken as a bribe to get him a job at the court.
She denies the accusation and says she attended a police station with family members in March where they were subjected to abusive treatment.
""It now seems like the harassment, victimisation, and torture will not stop unless I speak out about the origin and motive for the harassment,"" she alleges in the affidavit.
What has Mr Gogoi said? The first response came in a statement from the secretary general of the Supreme Court on the chief justice's behalf.
It says the allegations are ""completely and absolutely false and scurrilous and are totally denied"".
It says the woman ""had no occasion to interact directly with the chief justice"".
The statement refers to the criminal case of bribery lodged against the woman, saying: ""It appears that these false allegations are being made as a pressure tactic to somehow come out of the various proceedings which have been initiated in law.""
It says the employee was dismissed ""as per procedure"" after an incident of ""inappropriate conduct"".
Mr Gogoi himself addressed the issue in front of a special bench of the Supreme Court on Saturday.
""I don't want to stoop so low as to answer these charges,"" he said. ""All employees of the Supreme Court are treated respectfully by me.""
He added: ""There are forces that are trying to destabilise the judiciary. There are bigger forces behind these allegations hurled at me.""

PSNI investigated 59 slavery,www.bbc.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-47979219,"PSNI investigated 59 slavery/human trafficking cases last year 20 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption Law enforcement agencies have appealed for public help to identify victims and suspects Almost 60 cases of suspected modern slavery and/or human trafficking were investigated by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) last year.
A total of 59 potential victims were identified in Northern Ireland through the UK-wide National Referral Mechanism (NRM), set up to support those at risk.
The Department of Justice said it was a ""significant increase"" on the previous year when 36 such cases were examined.
The data forms part of the department's latest modern slavery strategy . No convictions
""Sadly, some of the victims who are being abused, exploited and denied their human rights can be found in our local cities, towns, villages and rural areas,"" the department said in a statement.
The strategy states that during the 2018/19 financial year, officers from the PSNI's Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Unit (MSHTU) made 11 arrests, compared to eight arrests during the previous 12-month period.
One person was charged with modern slavery/human trafficking-related offences during 2018/19, and three others were reported to the Public Prosecution Service.
No convictions for this type of offence were secured in Northern Ireland throughout the course of last year. Public vigilance
However, the strategy document states that two people who had faced prosecution for human trafficking offences were subsequently convicted of ""other serious offences"".
The Department of Justice said there was ""no quick fix"" to the complex challenges posed by modern slavery and it appealed for the public's help in identifying people at risk of exploitation.
""We all have a role to play to ensure we have a safe community where there is no place for modern slavery and human trafficking abuses to take place,"" said its director of safer communities, Anthony Harbinson.
""Law enforcement and other partner organisations are making a difference but need the support and vigilance of the public in general.""
Mr Harbinson called for a ""whole societal approach"" and said this was central to the department's latest strategy document.
""Working in tandem, we can improve the ways we pursue the criminals who are exploiting vulnerable people,"" he said.
""We can develop how we protect and support victims and target efforts to prevent others from falling prey to the criminals involved in this appalling crime.""
The 2019 -2020 modern slavery strategy is the third such document to be published in Northern Ireland.
Its strategic priorities are summed up with the phrase ""pursue, protect and prevent.""
The aim is to pursue offenders and bring them to justice; protect and support victims of slavery and trafficking and prevent the circumstances which cause people to become vulnerable to exploitation in the first place. Related Topics"
Ku Klux Klan killing: Wife admits murder of Missouri leader - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47996476,"Image copyright St Francois County Sheriff Image caption Malissa Ancona was sentenced to life after admitting second-degree murder The wife of a Ku Klux Klan leader in the US state of Missouri has admitted shooting him dead two years ago.
Malissa Ancona, 47, was sentenced to life after pleading guilty to second-degree murder and other charges.
She had initially said her son, Paul Jinkerson, carried out the killing but in court on Friday said this was not the case. He still faces trial.
Frank Ancona, a self-styled ""imperial wizard"", was shot dead in a bedroom and his body dumped next to a river.
In a deal with prosecutors, Ancona pleaded guilty on Friday at St Francois County Circuit Court to second-degree murder, tampering with evidence and abandonment of a corpse, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
Image copyright TAKKKK Image caption Frank Ancona was a member of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan ""I fired both shots that killed my husband,"" Ancona told Judge Wendy Wexler Horn, the paper reported.
She admitted cleaning the walls of the room in Leadwood, Missouri, and removing bedding before dumping the body in nearby Belgrade in February 2017.

Dr Jordan Peterson- 'Anti-Islam shirt' behind fellowship U-turn,www.bbc.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47694921,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dr Jordan Peterson's offer of a Cambridge University visiting fellowship was rescinded last week Cambridge University rescinded a visiting fellowship offer to Dr Jordan Peterson because he was pictured with a man wearing an anti-Islam shirt, its vice-chancellor said.
A two-month offer to the psychology professor was removed last week.
Dr Peterson labelled the decision a ""serious error of judgement"".
But Stephen Toope said the university was prompted to rescind the offer due to the picture of a man wearing an ""I'm a proud Islamophobe"" shirt.
University of Toronto professor Dr Peterson, whose views on gender have been condemned by critics, was set to spend a period in autumn at Cambridge's Faculty of Divinity.
He claimed in a blog post that he planned to collaborate with the faculty on a lecture series on the Biblical book of Exodus.
Visiting fellows are not paid but can make use of the libraries, attend seminars and engage in research, according to the university. Image caption Visiting fellowships are ""a courtesy extended to some academics from other institutions""
Professor Toope said the offer of the fellowship was granted on an academic basis but, ""as a consequence"" of becoming aware of the image, the invitation was rescinded.
""The casual endorsement by association of this message was thought to be antithetical to the work of a Faculty that prides itself in the advancement of inter-faith understanding,"" he said.
Dr Peterson has previously said he refuses to comply with Canadian laws compelling him to use the gender-neutral pronoun of an individual's choice, and in 2016 released a video lecture series questioning political correctness.
He also took aim at a campus culture of ""social justice warrior, left-wing radical political activists"" .
Last week, Dr Peterson said he had not heard about the rescinding of the offer from the faculty, which announced its decision on Twitter, and said it publicised the decision ""in a manner that could hardly have been more narcissistic, self-congratulatory and devious"".
The BBC has contacted his representatives over the vice-chancellor's claims. Related Topics"

The analysis by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) found 123456 was the most widely-used password on breached accounts.
The study helped to uncover the gaps in cyber-knowledge that could leave people in danger of being exploited.
The NCSC said people should string three random but memorable words together to use as a strong password. Sensitive data
For its first cyber-survey, the NCSC analysed public databases of breached accounts to see which words, phrases and strings people used.
Top of the list was 123456, appearing in more than 23 million passwords. The second-most popular string, 123456789, was not much harder to crack, while others in the top five included ""qwerty"", ""password"" and .
The most common name to be used in passwords was Ashley, followed by Michael, Daniel, Jessica and Charlie.
When it comes to Premier League football teams in guessable passwords, Liverpool are champions and Chelsea are second. Blink-182 topped the charts of music acts.
People who use well-known words or names for a password put themselves people at risk of being hacked, said Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the NCSC.
""Nobody should protect sensitive data with something that can be guessed, like their first name, local football team or favourite band,"" he said. Hard to guess
The NCSC study also quizzed people about their security habits and fears.
It found that 42% expected to lose money to online fraud and only 15% said they felt confident that they knew enough to protect themselves online.
It found that fewer than half of those questioned used a separate, hard-to-guess password for their main email account.
Security expert Troy Hunt, who maintains a database of hacked account data, said picking a good password was the ""single biggest control"" people had over their online security.
""We typically haven't done a very good job of that either as individuals or as the organisations asking us to register with them,"" he said.
Letting people know which passwords were widely used should drive users to make better choices, he said.
The survey was published ahead of the NCSC's Cyber UK conference that will be held in Glasgow from 24-25 April. Related Topics "

Voters face a stark choice between tycoon Petro Poroshenko, the incumbent president, and television comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, new to politics.
The TV celebrity is favourite in the polls, having dominated the first round of voting three weeks ago when 39 candidates were on the ticket.
Polling stations opened 08:00 (05:00 GMT) and will close 12 hours later.
A court in the capital, Kiev, has rejected a lawsuit calling for Mr Zelensky to be barred from standing.
A man had complained that the distribution of free tickets for a presidential debate by Volodymyr Zelensky's candidacy amounted to bribery.

Mr Poroshenko said the election was no less important than that of 2014, which followed the ousting of a pro-Russian administration.

After voting, Mr Zelensky said: ""Today it will be the victory of Ukrainians, the victory of Ukraine, and - I hope - the victory of a fair choice.""
On Friday the two candidates appeared at Kiev's Olympic stadium to debate for the first time.
The televised event was their first face-off after an unusual campaign where Mr Zelensky has primarily used social media to communicate with the voting public.

The position holds significant powers over the security, defence and foreign policy of the country.
Who are the candidates? In Ukraine Mr Zelensky, 41, is best known for starring in a political satirical drama called Servant of the People.
Ukraine rivals trade taunts and media tricks Comedian v president in rare stadium event In it he plays a teacher who accidentally becomes Ukrainian president after his rant about the nation's politics goes viral on social media.

Despite this, he won the first round with more than 30% of the vote - almost double what Mr Poroshenko got when he finished in second place with 15.95%.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption The country prepared on Saturday, during a day of silence when last-minute campaigning is prohibited The incumbent president, who has been in power since 2014, described the result as a ""harsh lesson"".
Mr Poroshenko, 53, is a billionaire who made his fortune primarily through his confectionery and TV businesses.
He was elected after an uprising overthrew the country's previous, pro-Russian government.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber those of his rival on Friday The stadium debate between the candidates on Friday was much-anticipated in Ukraine, after the comedian challenged the president to the unconventional event.
After his acceptance, there was a public disagreement between the pair over when it would be held.
Last week, Mr Poroshenko turned up and debated an empty podium after his opponent was absent at the date he suggested.
A leap into the unknown? Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev
The choice Ukrainians are facing is whether to stick to what they've had for the last five years in Petro Poroshenko or take a leap into the unknown with the comedian candidate, Volodomyr Zelenksy.
Mr Zelensky is a well-known entertainer but quite what, if anything, he stands for politically has not become clear during the election campaign.
He has however demonstrated that he can act presidential - by playing the part in a TV series.
Ukraine is fighting a war against Russian-backed forces in its east and President Poroshenko has repeatedly stressed the need for someone with political experience.
Unfortunately for him, all the surveys show that Ukrainians are fed up their politicians who are widely regarded as corrupt and in the pockets of rich oligarchs.

Blasts reported at churches in Sri Lanka - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48001720,"In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks
It comes as the country's prime minister admitted there may have been prior intelligence about the attacks.
Officials says 36 foreign nationals are thought to be among the dead, including 25 yet to be identified. How did the attacks unfold?
The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 (03:15 GMT) local time - with six blasts reported close together at churches and luxury hotels.
St Sebastian's church in Negombo was severely damaged in one explosion, with dozens killed at the site.
Images from inside showed blood on the pews and the building's ceiling shattered.
There were also heavy casualties at the site of the first blast in St Anthony's, a hugely popular shrine in Kochchikade, a district of Colombo.
Robert Tyler, who has lived in Sri Lanka for six years, told the BBC that at least two of the hotels appeared to have had their restaurants targeted at a busy time for breakfast.
Two further explosions were reported as police tried to find those involved. One blast hit near the zoo in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and an eighth was reported near the Colombo district of Dematagoda during a police raid, killing three officers.
The government has said most of the attacks are thought to have been carried out by suicide bombers. Image copyright AFP Image caption The streets of Colombo were far quieter than usual as the curfew came in Who are the victims?
The vast majority of those killed are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals, including dozens who were attending Easter church services.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says five British people - including two with joint US citizenship - are among the dead . The US State Department has said ""several"" Americans have been killed.
Three Danish citizens, two Turkish nationals and one person from the Netherlands were also killed, their governments have confirmed.
Sri Lankan officials say three Indian nationals and one Portuguese citizen are also among the dead.
They say 25 more fatalities at a Colombo mortuary are also thought to be international citizens awaiting identification.
Airlines have said people are still able to travel to the airport under the curfew if they produce their boarding pass and identification at checkpoints.
Travellers are being advised to arrive at the airport four hours before their scheduled flight time. Image copyright AFP Image caption A bomb goes off as Special Task Force personnel raid a home near Dematagoda in Colombo What have officials said?
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the media on Sunday evening.
During the briefing, he referred to allegations that officials had been in possession of intelligence suggesting an impending attack.
""We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the Ministers were kept informed,"" he said.
""For now the priority is to apprehend the attackers,"" he added.

Sunday's attacks are the deadliest seen in Sri Lanka since the end of the country's civil war in 2009.
The civil war ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, who had fought for 26 years for an independent homeland for the minority ethnic Tamils. The war is thought to have killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people.
The nation has seen some sporadic violence since. In March 2018 a state of emergency was declared after members of the majority Buddhist Sinhala community attacked mosques and Muslim-owned properties."

Dumfries Ice Bowl first staged one of the events in 2012 and has held another six since then.
The most recent one concluded earlier this week with Great Britain's women's team taking a silver medal.
Dumfries and Galloway Council said the seven championships had had a ""minimum economic impact"" of ¬£170,000 each.
The local authority's events champion, Adam Wilson, said the latest event had maintained the town's status in the sport. 'Strength to strength'
""Dumfries continues to shine in the eyes of the ice hockey world,"" he said.
""The organisation, goodwill and atmosphere at this world championship was exceptional, and the sport is going from strength to strength in our region.
""The dedication of our staff, volunteers and the Ice Hockey UK team to make this world championship such a great success merits recognition.""
Andy French, general secretary of Ice Hockey UK, said everyone had been delighted with the facilities and support they had received.
""All the players, from all the nations, appeared to enjoy the experience of playing in Dumfries and were buoyed by the hundreds of schoolchildren who attended the day-time matches,"" he said.
The latest competition brought nearly 200 players, coaches, officials and volunteers to the town, delivering the economic boost. 'Secondary spending'
""The ¬£170,000 is the actual new money that enters the Dumfries and Galloway economy from all tournament spending on accommodation, services, food and visitor spending,"" said a council spokesman.
""A formal economic impact study would identify secondary spending in the economy from this injection of finance.
""This is done by applying a 'multiplier' to the ¬£170,000 which would end up reporting that, overall, the tournaments create more than ¬£200,000 of added value for the regional economy.""
In addition, he said it also had other benefits including developing the skills of Ice Bowl staff, increasing attendances at ice skating and the promotion of the sport for health and leisure. Related Topics"

The blasts came as members of Sri Lanka's peaceful Christian minority prepared to attend church services for Easter Sunday. Julian Emmanuel
Dr Emmanuel is a 48-year-old physician. He grew up in Sri Lanka, and now lives in Surrey, UK, with his wife and children.
They were in Colombo this week to visit some of their relatives who still live in the city. They were asleep in their room in Colombo's Cinnamon Grand Hotel when one of the bombs went off.
""We were in our bedroom and we heard this huge explosion which rocked our room, I think it was about 8:30,"" he said. ""We were then ushered to the lounge in our hotel, where we were asked to evacuate through the back.

Sudan crisis: Protesters gather for announcement of civilian council - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48006015,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The protesters have demanded a transfer to civilian rule Sudan's military government has told protesters to take down their road blocks in the capital, Khartoum.
Demonstrators have been manning barricades leading to the military HQ, which has been the focus of the protests that helped lead to the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir.
On Sunday, protest leaders said they had ended contact with the military council that removed the president.
They accused it of being composed of ""remnants"" of Mr Bashir's regime.
The military says it is committed to handing over power and will consider a joint military-civilian council.
But it insisted that it was responsible for security in the country.
Sudan stand-off after president ousted Why Omar al-Bashir was overthrown Timeline: How Sudan got here ""It can't continue like this,"" said the head of the military council, Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan.
It was not clear if the protesters would respond to the call.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Protesters have continued to stage a sit-in in central Khartoum ""We will carry on manning the checkpoints as usual,"" 23-year-old demonstrator Kawthar Hasaballah told AFP news agency. ""No one, not even the military council, will remove us from our places.""
A mass sit-in outside the military HQ has been taking place since 6 April. Five days later Mr Bashir was overthrown and replaced by a military council that promised it would hand over power to civilians within two years.
Leaders of the protest movement have suspended talks and co-operation with the military. There had been hopes that the talks would lead to civilian rule.
A spokesman, Mohamed al-Amin, called the military council an extension of the old regime and said they no longer recognised it, adding that a civilian administration would be unveiled in the next couple of days.
What now for Sudan's opposition? By Fergal Keane, BBC Africa Editor
The crowds are still large and the cheering is still emphatic. But after more than a fortnight of protests the broad front of groups that makes up the Sudanese opposition finds itself confronted with one of the most fundamental quandaries to face a peaceful protest movement: what to do when those you seek to overthrow refuse to accede?
The protest leaders had been expected to announce their candidates for a civilian council to rule Sudan through a transition to full democracy. But last night - after days of expectation - they failed to do that.
This has prompted speculation about divisions as different groups argue about policy and positions. Instead the opposition said it was suspending negotiations with the ruling military council and called for escalating protests.
For now the generals on the ruling military council seem to have regained some cohesion. They have also been given strong backing - including more than $3bn (¬£2.3bn) in aid - from the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates. There is widespread scepticism among the opposition about any military willingness to hand over power to a civilian-dominated transitional council.
What will the military do? The military council has said protesters must immediately open the roads to allow for the movement of ""essential items"".
It has made such calls before but has not moved to enforce the removal of barricades and checkpoints.
Sudan protests: A campaign of defiance Why the protests started Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? On Sunday it said it would respond to the call for civilian rule within a week, and indicated it might favour a joint council.
It has, however, released political prisoners and on Saturday arrested a number of top members of Mr Bashir's former ruling party.
How did it all begin? In December 2018, the government tried to stave off economic collapse by imposing emergency austerity measures and a sharp currency devaluation .
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Omar al-Bashir was deposed by the military after months of protests Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards , but the anger soon spread to Khartoum.
The protests quickly widened into demands for the removal of President Bashir, in charge for nearly 30 years , and his government.
The Sudanese military toppled Mr Bashir on 11 April but demonstrators have vowed to stay on the streets until there is a move to civilian rule.
Who are the protesters? The economic problems brought Sudanese from all walks of life on to the streets but the organisation of demonstrations was taken on by the SPA, a collaboration of doctors, health workers and lawyers .
A large proportion of the protesters have been women and the demonstrators are mostly young."

"Seventy-six pubs 'shutting per month', but closure rate slowing - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48006903,"Image copyright Getty Images Nearly 1,000 UK pubs shut last year, although the rate of closures is slowing, new research claims.
About 76 pubs a month ""vanished"" from the communities they served in 2018, as people spent less on going out and pubs faced cost pressures, said property firm Altus Group.
But this was down from 138 a month during the previous seven years.
Alex Probyn, of Altus Group, said recent cuts to business rates had helped.
""The increase in the thresholds at which businesses, such as pubs, pay business rates coupled with the pubs discount during the last two financial years has helped ease the decline.""
According to the firm's research, the number of pubs slumped from more than 54,000 to 43,000 between 2010 and 2017.
'Triple whammy' Industry group the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) says more people are drinking at home to save money, while younger people are consuming less alcohol in general.
And pubs have faced a ""triple whammy"" of taxes in the form of high Beer Duty, VAT and business rates.
""Pubs currently pay 2.8% of the business rates bill but only account for 0.5% of total business turnover, which is an overpayment of around ¬£500m by the sector each year,"" it says on its website.
High business rates are also viewed as contributing to the rising number of retail closures on Britain's high streets.
But Altus said government changes to rates were starting to benefit the pubs industry, with the number liable to pay rates at all down by more than 1,500.
It added that new rates relief , brought in on 1 April by the Chancellor, would help further.
""The new retail discount, which slashed rates bills by a third for high street firms with a rateable value less than ¬£51,000, will help independent licensees in small premises,"" said Mr Probyn."

Unbanked 'pay ¬£500 extra a year' for bills and services - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48006905,"Lack of bank account 'costs ¬£500 extra a year' in bills 22 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images People who do not have access to a bank account pay an extra ¬£485 a year for everyday bills and services, research from an account provider suggests.
More than 1.2 million Britons do not have a bank account, so miss out on discounts reserved for those who pay bills by direct debit, said Pockit.
This ramps up the cost of energy bills, broadband and phone contracts, it said.
""For many of us, having a bank account is a basic fact of life,"" said Pockit boss Virraj Jatania.
""Yet the unbanked face a banking poverty premium which can put a real strain on their finances.""
UK Finance, which represents the UK banking industry, said banks took their financial inclusion responsibilities ""extremely seriously"".
""The banking industry is committed to ensuring banking is accessible to all. There are over seven million basic bank accounts in the UK, helping customers across the country access vital banking services,"" it said.
Traditional banks can reject customers applying for accounts if they do not have enough forms of ID, or if their credit rating is poor.
But Pockit, which provides basic account services, said this meant many were being penalised.
It analysed prices from leading service providers and found: Energy and broadband providers offer discounts to customers if they pay by direct debit - a saving which is not available to those without a bank account. Mobile phone companies offer better deals to those paying via direct debit rather than pay-as-you go customers. Those without accounts have limited options when looking for credit, and often turn to expensive cash-in-hand ""doorstep loans"".
In one example, it found two of the UK's three largest broadband providers, BT and Virgin Media, offered a ""super line rental discount"" if you paid by direct debit.
But customers without a current account had to pay using methods such as cash transfers, costing them ¬£38 more a year on average.
On electricity and gas, it analysed Ofgem data and found that those using pre-payment meters paid on average ¬£141.57 more each year than those who paid by direct debit. Related Topics "
Why the US-China rivalry will not end with a trade deal - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Ana Nicolaci Da Costa,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47848861,"Image copyright Getty The two presidents preside over markedly different national economic models A US-China trade deal - if it happens - is unlikely to end the rivalry between the two economic giants.
Both sides have fought a trade war over the past year with damaging consequences for the global economy.
But many say their dispute goes well beyond trade - it represents a power-struggle between two very different world views.
Deal or no deal, that rivalry is only expected to broaden and become more difficult to resolve.
""We have entered into a new normal in which US-China geopolitical competition has intensified and become more explicit,"" says Michael Hirson, Asia director at consultancy firm Eurasia Group.
""The trade deal will moderate one phase of the US-China power struggle, but only temporarily and with limited effect.""
Grappling with China's growing power US-China trade war in 300 words Huawei: The world's most controversial company The US-China rivalry is likely to play out next in the crucial technology sector, analysts say, as both sides try to establish themselves as the world's technology leader.
Issues around technology transfer have been key during trade talks between the world's two largest economies in recent months.
""Every country now correctly recognises that their prosperity, their wealth, their economic security, their military security is going to be linked to keeping a technological edge,"" says Stephen Olson, research fellow at global trade advisory body Hinrich Foundation.
The technology battle Many say the US-China technology battle is already under way - and China's tech giant Huawei is at its very centre.
Huawei has been the focus of intense international scrutiny lately, with the US and other countries raising security concerns about its products.
The US has restricted federal agencies from using Huawei products and has encouraged allies to shun them.
Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the use of Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks.
Image copyright Getty The US government has accused Huawei of being a spying risk, something it strongly denies But Huawei has said it is independent from the Chinese government. Its founder Ren Zhengfei told the BBC in February that his company would never undertake any spying activities.
The dispute reached fever pitch with the arrest of the founder's daughter in December, and more recently Huawei's lawsuit against the US government.
Huawei has also gone on a public relations offensive, placing a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal telling Americans not to ""believe everything you hear"".
""The term 'cold war' is overused in the context of overall US-China tensions, but is increasingly accurate in describing their technology competition,"" says Mr Hirson.
The dispute over Huawei is ""symptomatic of this intensified geopolitical competition,"" he adds.
""This rivalry is far more difficult to resolve than pure trade issues.""
How did we get here? US concerns about China have grown in recent years, along with China's influence around the world.
Its massive Belt and Road Initiative, the Made in China 2025 plans, and the growing importance of companies like Huawei and Alibaba have all contributed to those fears.
US Vice President Mike Pence summed up the mood in a speech in October, saying China had chosen ""economic aggression"", rather than ""greater partnership"" as it opened its economy.
Hopes China would embrace a more Western model has given way to a recognition that China's economy has boomed alongside a state-run system, not in spite of it.
""China has become much more explicit in its ambitions in the last few years,"" says Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China, at consultancy Control Risks.
""Therefore nobody is imagining that China is going to follow a Western liberal democratic model, or converge towards a market economy in the way that people hoped a few years ago.""
Image copyright Getty China's exports have boomed over the past two decades Some analysts think a stand-off between the two sides was inevitable.
Their different systems have always made them awkward bedfellows in the global economy, while clashes between existing and rising powers are common in history.
""What we are dealing with here is friction between traditional free market economics, free trade economics, Washington consensus principles versus - for the first time - a huge, technologically sophisticated, centrally-managed economy that is playing the game by a different set of rules,"" says Mr Olson.
What happens now? As the technology race gathers pace, analysts expect the US to continue to use non-tariff measures to push back against China.
Restrictions on Chinese investment into the US, limits on the ability of US firms to export technology to China, and further pressure on Chinese companies are all tools that could be used, they say.
""Non-tariff measures don't get the attention from markets that tariffs do, partly because their impact is harder to quantify, but they can have far-reaching impact,"" says Mr Hirson."
Campaign to tackle 'botched' cosmetic procedures - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47967968,"Image copyright Rachael Knappier Image caption There have been calls for more regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures, such as lip fillers A campaign to tackle ""botched"" cosmetic procedures is to be launched shortly by the government in England.
It follows a rise in people seeking surgeries such as a ""Brazilian butt lift"" abroad, which has led to deaths .
There have also been warnings about the rise in the use of self-injected dermal and lip fillers, with the risk of causing complications that then have to be treated on the NHS.
One expert welcomed the campaign, but said better regulation was also needed.
Men warned about cosmetic procedures
England's Department of Health told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the campaign, scheduled to launch in the coming weeks, would look to ensure the public was fully informed about the importance of seeking professional advice regarding fillers, Botox and cosmetic surgery.
Botox party mishap left woman housebound Second Brit dies after 'Brazilian butt lift' Is 'Brazilian butt lift' surgery a risk worth taking? It said it also hoped to tackle the number of ""botched"" procedures, and the resulting impact on a person's mental and physical health, as well as the cost to the NHS of treatment following such procedures.
Nora Nugent, a member of the council of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps), said she welcomed the government campaign in principle.
She said the estimated increase in people seeking cosmetic procedures had not been matched by improved education on what the public should expect when accessing treatments, or what could go wrong.
While the rise of celebrities and influencers sharing their procedures online had led to increased uptake, she added, it was also due in part to ""rising availability, better awareness of procedures and relatively more affordability"".
It comes as an online survey of 1,033 women aged 18 to 30, commissioned by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme and Newsbeat and conducted by Deltapoll, suggests 83% would change part of their body if money and health risks were not a concern.
Of those, 63% would change their stomach and 53% their breasts.
Of the 7% of those surveyed who had had a cosmetic procedure, mostly lip fillers and botox:
69% felt more confident 52% felt more attractive 24% felt less attractive 'My face was very distorted' ""Greg"" (not his real name) told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he became addicted to using dermal fillers - injections used to fill out wrinkles and creases in the skin, although they are also often used to increase the volume and definition of lips and cheeks.
He bought them online - as well as Botox - and began self-injecting into his face three years ago.
""You can lose sight of reality of what your face looks like,"" he said.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Greg' used to self-inject dermal fillers into his face, despite the dangers ""There was a point where I was doing it quite a lot and my mum was noticing that my face was very distorted, and I was losing a lot of my characteristics.""
You do not have to be a medical practitioner to administer such treatments, as filler solutions are not regulated like medicines.
But self-injecting can cause swelling and infection, and in rare cases may need to be treated with surgery or medication if it causes lumps to form under the skin. It can also cause blindness.
'Incredibly painful' One of Greg's self-injected lip fillers went wrong when he had an infection.
""I woke up the next morning, they were uneven - one side was bigger than the other,"" he said.
""I had blisters. It was incredibly, incredibly painful.
""I was embarrassed to seek help.""
Greg said he would now advise people not to use fillers, as it is a ""slippery slope"".
""Knowing the complications now, you have to be incredibly careful.""
Ms Nugent, a consultant plastic surgeon, said she had concerns regarding so-called ""cowboy injectors"", such as beauticians, who administer fillers without medical training.
This poses a risk, she said, as many are not qualified to suitably assess patients safely or to spot when complications do arise.
She called for restrictions as to who can perform injectable treatments to be brought in.
The Department of Health said: ""Anyone considering a cosmetic procedure should take the time to find a reputable, safe, and qualified practitioner, and make sure they understand the impact of any treatment on their physical and mental health.
""We're working to improve the safety of cosmetic procedures, through better training and clear information so that people can make informed decisions about their care.""
In March, the Welsh government said it ""may be appropriate in the future"" to consult on adding dermal fillers to the licensing system.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Celebrities like Kylie Jenner have helped popularise lip fillers Save Face, a national register of accredited practitioners, said it received 934 patient complaints regarding unregistered practitioners in 2017-18.
Of these, 616 related to dermal fillers.
Ms Nugent said she was also concerned about people going abroad for cosmetic surgery - where patients may not see the surgeon until the day of the operation, and it is more difficult to have follow-up treatment that could be needed as a result of complications.
She said this included - but was not limited to - Brazilian butt lift surgery, from which two British women have died.

Sri Lanka attacks: Who are the victims? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48002169,"Sri Lanka is in shock after a wave of bombings targeting churches and hotels left at least 253 people dead and about 500 injured. The bombers struck on Easter Sunday in the cities of Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa.
The death toll from Sunday's blasts had stood at 359 but was revised down by more than 100 on Thursday. The health ministry blamed a calculation error.
Most of those killed are Sri Lankans, but officials say at least 38 foreigners are among the dead - including British, Indian, Danish, Dutch, Swiss, Spanish, US, Australian and Turkish nationals.
The government temporarily restricted some social media networks to try to halt the spread of misinformation, so details were initially slow to emerge.
But this is what we know so far about those who lost their lives.
Shantha Mayadunne, a Sri Lankan celebrity chef, and her daughter Nisanga One of the first victims to have been identified was Sri Lankan celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne.
Her daughter Nisanga Mayadunne had posted a picture of the family having breakfast in the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo shortly before the explosion there.
One of their family members later posted on Facebook confirming that both Shantha and Nisanga had died, saying ""no words can describe the pain"".
Five members of the same family in Negombo Rangana Fernando, his wife Danadiri and their three children all died in the attack on St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of the capital.
Image Copyright @yogital @yogital Report Image Copyright @yogital @yogital Report ""Farewell Danadiri and family, we will remember you all in our prayers,"" read a tribute from her colleagues.
""She was a dedicated and diligent worker, but above all a kind and caring soul. She will be dearly missed.""
The couple's eldest child Biola (below, third from right) was six, Leona four and Seth just 11 months.
Unicef says at least 45 of those who lost their lives in the attacks were children.
Four Sri Lankan servers at the Cinnamon Grand hotel Four Sri Lankan staff members at the Taprobane restaurant in the Cinnamon Grand hotel died in the attacks.
""It was a busy morning. It's Sunday morning during buffet breakfast so it's one of our busiest periods,"" the Cinnamon Grand hotel spokesman told the BBC.
""They were servers at the restaurant. One of them was working at the live food stations making hoppers [a Sri Lankan pancake].""
They have been identified only as Shantha, Sanjeewani, Ibrahim and Nisthar.
Four staff members at the Shangri-La The Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo has told the BBC that four of its colleagues were ""fatally injured in the course of their duties"".
No further details are known so far.
Ramesh, the man who saved dozens of lives Sri Lankan Ramesh Raju was at Zion Church in Batticaloa during its Easter service when a stranger carrying a huge backpack tried to enter, saying he wanted to film the service.
But Ramesh told the man he could not enter with a large bag and forced him outside the church. Just after he did so, the bomb detonated.
He leaves behind a wife and two children, all of whom were attending the service with him.
Image Copyright @BBCRajiniV @BBCRajiniV Report Image Copyright @BBCRajiniV @BBCRajiniV Report A Sri Lankan mother Mary Otricia Johnson was at Mass with her family at St Anthony's in Colombo when the attack happened, according to the New York Times.
Her eldest daughter, Sharon Silviya, had taken her son to the front of the church to look at a fish tank. Minutes later, the blast occurred.
Ms Silviya and her son survived the attack.
A brother and sister Twelve-year-old Sharon Santhakumar and his younger sister, 11-year-old Sarah Santhakumar, were among those killed at Zion church in Batticoloa.
They were buried next to each other the day after they were killed.

All three died in the blast at St Sebastian's church in Negombo. A neighbour who was with them and survived says they were standing very close to the person believed to have detonated the bomb, but did not see his face.
Tyronne's friends say they called him Sana. He drove an auto-rickshaw and ran his business from outside Negombo hospital. His wife was unemployed and mostly took care of her mother and 18-year-old son.
He did not attend the Mass with them as he had gone for midnight vigil the previous night.
A newlywed driver who lived near the church Subramani Christopher, 28, was a driver and odd jobs man who died in the blast at St Anthony's church in Colombo.
He was originally from Akuressa in the south of the country, but was working in Colombo, where he lived in a tiny house near the church for which he paid 10,000 ($57; ¬£44) rupees a month.
He had been married only 11 months. He had gone to church with his wife and infant son on Easter. His wife and child survived but he did not.
His mother travelled to Colombo after hearing that there had been a blast at the church. Initially relatives had told her that he had been receiving treatment for a minor leg injury. It was only after she arrived that the truth was broken to her.
Image caption Subramani Christopher had only been married for 11 months ""He was my life. He was my left hand. He loved me so much. Only I know how much he loved me,"" his mother tells BBC News's Ayeshea Perera. ""I can't bear this, how will I bear his loss?""
His wife, neighbours say, has not been told yet that he has died.
""What do we tell her?"" A neighbour asked. ""How can we tell her that he has died?""
His mother says she cannot bear to look her daughter-in-law in the face.
""The only thing I can take comfort in is that he is with Jesus. I swear I will look after his son. It was so funny, but even before his son was born he had told his wife that if anything happened to him he wanted me to look after his child. He had such big dreams for his child, even before he was born. I swear that I will dedicate the rest of my life to bringing up his child and making sure that he has a bright future.""
An entire young family of five Bennington Joseph, 33, was killed in the blast in St Anthony's church along with his wife, Subramaniam Arumugam Chandrika.

Baby Joseph adds that he grew up in Kochchikade, but later moved to a different area of Colombo with his wife and children.
""Even then I went to the same church in search of my almighty. But today in that shrine my children's blood is shed in the floors,"" he says.
A man and four young children attending Mass Sampath, 35, his two daughters aged eight and 10, and two nephews aged six and 10 had gone to St Sebastian's Church in Negombo for the Easter Mass.
His cousin, Sajeewa Fernando who lives in the UK, tells BBC News: ""I was really shocked when I heard what happened in Negombo, my birth place. It's a very peaceful place and for something like this to happen there is unbelievable.""

Gorillas pose for selfie with DR Congo anti-poaching unit - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48011113,"Image copyright Ranger Mathieu Shamavu Image caption The gorillas are apparently trying to imitate humans Two gorillas have been photographed posing for a relaxed selfie with the rangers who rescued them as babies.
The image was taken at a gorilla orphanage in Virunga National Park, DR Congo, where the animals were raised after poachers killed their parents.
The park's deputy director told BBC Newsday that they had learned to imitate their carers, who have looked after them since they were found.
The gorillas, he added, think of the rangers as their parents.
Innocent Mburanumwe, deputy director of Virunga, told the BBC the gorillas' mothers were both killed in July 2007.
The gorillas were just two and four months old at the time.
Poacher killed by elephant then eaten by lions RIP Trevor the duck Hope for mountain gorillas Shortly afterwards, they were found and taken to Senkwekwe Sanctuary in Virunga, where they have lived ever since.
Because they've grown up with the rangers who rescued them, Mr Mburanumwe added, ""they are imitating the humans"" - and standing on two legs is their way of ""learning to be human beings"".
But it ""doesn't happen normally"", he said.
""I was very surprised to see it... so it's very funny. It's very curious to see how a gorilla can imitate a human and stand up.""
Being a ranger, however, is not always fun - it is mainly dangerous work.
Five rangers were killed in Virunga National Park last year in an ambush by suspected rebels, and more than 130 park rangers have been killed in Virunga since 1996.
Eastern DR Congo is mired in conflict between the government and various armed groups.
Some of these armed groups are based in the park, where they often poach animals."

Samsung Galaxy Fold launch events delayed in China - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48013395,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption The Samsung Galaxy Fold was supposed to be released on 26 April Samsung has postponed the release of its folding smartphone, days after several early reviewers said the screens on their devices had broken.
The company said it had delayed the launch of the Galaxy Fold to ""fully evaluate the feedback and run further internal tests"".
In April, several early reviewers found the display on the Galaxy Fold broke after just a few days.
Samsung has not said when the ¬£1,800 device will go on sale.
A new launch date will be announced in the ""coming weeks"".
In a statement, Samsung said it suspected the damage experienced by some of the reviewers was caused by ""impact on the top and bottom exposed areas of the hinge"".
It also said it found ""substances"" inside one of the review devices that may have affected its performance.

The Galaxy Fold was due to be released in the United States on 26 April, and in the UK on 3 May.
The South Korean tech giant has said it is investigating what went wrong with the broken review units.
In some cases, reviewers had peeled off a layer of the screen's coating, mistaking it for a disposable screen protector.
""We will also enhance the guidance on care and use of the display including the protective layer,"" Samsung said in a statement.
Chinese rivals Huawei and Xiaomi are also developing foldable smartphones, but neither company has announced a release date yet. Analysis
by Chris Fox, technology reporter
A phone priced at ¬£1,800 - or $1,980 in the US - was never supposed to be bought by the masses.
But the launch of the Galaxy Fold was meant to showcase Samsung as an innovative and forward-thinking gadget maker, and draw people into its stores.
Now it is turning into a bit of an embarrassment, evoking memories of another botched launch: the ""exploding"" Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.
Samsung has been in a race to launch a folding device ahead of Chinese rival Huawei, which has announced its phone but not let reviewers take one home yet.
Both manufacturers say their folding screens can be opened and closed more than 100,000 times without breaking, based on laboratory tests.

As a result, screengrabs and plot details started appearing online before the official broadcast - which led to fans worrying about accidentally coming across spoilers (which we obviously won't post here).
However, plenty of people had some fun with the leak.

Game of Thrones series eight: Worth the wait? The breakout stars of Game of Thrones A spokesman for AT&T, which owns the service, said: ""Apparently our system was as excited as we are for Game of Thrones tonight and gave a few DirecTV Now customers early access to the episode by mistake.
""When we became aware of the error, we immediately fixed it and we look forward to tuning in this evening.""
Writing in Forbes, Paul Tassi said: ""HBO has to be tearing their hair out that this keeps happening, but this show is so popular and there are so many of these markets to manage, it does almost seem inevitable that something will go wrong.
""At least we're not dealing with people flat-out stealing episodes like we saw in a breach a few years ago, but this is not great either.""

Polish Judas ritual 'anti-Semitic' - Jewish congress - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48012965,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Children kicked the effigy and beat it with big sticks The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has voiced outrage over a Polish town's ritual beating of a Judas effigy which looks like a caricature Orthodox Jew.
The Good Friday ritual in Pruchnik, south-eastern Poland, was filmed and posted by a Polish news website .
""Jews are deeply disturbed by this ghastly revival of medieval anti-Semitism that led to unimaginable violence and suffering,"" the WJC said.
More than three million Polish Jews were murdered during World War Two.
In total, Nazi Germany murdered about six million Jews in death camps in occupied Poland and killing fields in the former Soviet Union.
Image copyright AFP Image caption The straw-filled effigy was later hanged and burned In the Pruchnik ritual - part of Roman Catholic Easter celebrations - children crowded round the effigy beating it with sticks, as adults dragged it through the streets. The mock Judas had a big red nose, black hat and Orthodox-style ringlets.
In the past the Catholic Church in Poland had banned such practices.

Australian father and son lifesavers drown in tourist rescue bid - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48015753,"Image caption The Twelve Apostles are a popular attraction in the rugged Port Campbell National Park, Victoria A father and son who were volunteer lifesavers have drowned while trying to rescue a tourist swept out to sea off the Australian state of Victoria.
The boat carrying Ross Powell, 71, and his son Andrew, 32, overturned as they tried to reach the man near limestone stacks known as the Twelve Apostles.
The 30-year-old tourist was winched to safety by a rescue helicopter along with a third lifesaver from the boat.
Australian PM Scott Morrison paid tribute to the Powells.
""Surf lifesavers are selfless and brave,"" he said on Twitter.
""We thank them all for their service and extend our deepest sympathies to Ross and Andrew's family and friends.""
The incident has shocked the tourist town of Port Campbell, south-west of Melbourne, where the men were experienced members of the local surf lifesaving club. Floral tributes have been left at the club and flags there are flying at half mast, Australian media reported.
The tourist, who has not been named, was said to have got into difficulties while wading at the mouth of the Sherbrook River.
The lifesaving team set off in their boat but it flipped over in the rough surf, local officials said.
Andrew Powell's partner, Amber Griffiths, described the father and son as ""two of the most beautiful people to ever exist - always putting others first"".
The rescued lifesaver is in a serious condition in hospital, Australian media reported. The tourist suffered hypothermia and is in a stable condition.

No-coal power record broken over Easter bank holiday - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48015613,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The government has set a target to phase out coal power by 2025 Britain has broken its record for the longest continuous period without generating electricity from coal.
National Grid said that the coal-free period lasted more than 90 hours before coming to an end on Monday afternoon.
It is the longest period since the industrial revolution and breaks the previous record set in April 2018 of 76 hours and 10 minutes.
The government plans to phase out Britain's last coal power plants by 2025 to cut greenhouse gases.
Duncan Burt, director of operations at National Grid, told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""a really big deal"".
Record Easter temperatures in three nations Britain lasts three days without coal ""It's all about the sunny weather we've been seeing, so energy demand is low. There has been lots of lovely solar power off the panels too.""
Image copyright PA Image caption The sunny weather has led to low energy demand and a boost in solar power In April, 2017 Britain went its first full day without coal since the 19th century.
Coal made up less than 10% of the country's energy mix last year and will be less than that again in 2019, according to National Grid.
However, experts warned that power generated by coal was largely being replaced by gas, another fossil fuel, rather than renewable sources.
They also said a reliance on gas made the UK vulnerable to the whims of international markets, and was not clean enough to meet the UK's legal targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
The 2008 Climate Change Act requires greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050.
Muna Suleiman, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: ""89 hours of coal-free electricity is great but let's make this all day every day.
""Electricity generated by renewable sources is a key part of the fight against climate chaos so it's time to remove all the blockers to renewable energy.
""The government must prioritise the development of sources such as solar and onshore wind."""
Sri Lanka attacks: What we know about Easter bombings - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48010697,"Image copyright Reuters On Easter Sunday, suicide bombers killed at least 253 people and injured some 500 at churches and top-end hotels across Sri Lanka.
Most victims were Sri Lankans, but at least 38 foreigners are among the dead, including British, Indian and US citizens.
The official death toll had reached 359 by Thursday. However, the Sri Lankan government then revised the figure down, blaming a calculation error.
Evidence is mounting that local jihadists linked to the Islamic State (IS) group carried out the attack, and police have made a number of arrests.
What happened? The first reports were at about 08:45 (03:15 GMT) on Sunday 21 April. Six blasts took place within a short space of time.
As it happened: Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday attacks In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Three were at churches - in the Kochchikade district of the capital, Colombo; in Negombo, to the north; and in the eastern city of Batticaloa.

Dispatch: St Anthony's - 'church of miracles' And on Monday another blast rocked a street near a church in the capital. Police were attempting to defuse explosives in a vehicle used by the attackers when it blew up.
According to police sources, an attack on a fourth hotel failed and helped lead police to the Islamist group now blamed for the assault.
On Friday, relatives of the bombers' suspected mastermind, Islamist preacher Zahran Hashim, were among 15 people killed when police raided a house in the eastern town of Sainthamaruthu.
Who are the victims? Hundreds of Sri Lankan families are in mourning. One of the first victims to be indentified was celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne . Other Sri Lankans killed included members of church congregations and staff at the hotels targeted.

Who were the attackers? On Monday Sri Lankan authorities said they believed a little-known local militant Islamist group known as National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) was to blame.
Who are National Thowheed Jamath? Who were the bombers? On Tuesday, IS said it had carried out the attacks, and released video of men it says were the bombers, pledging allegiance to the group.
All but one of the men can be seen with their faces covered. Some are holding knives. The man with his face uncovered has been named as Hashim, who went on to blow himself up at a hotel in Colombo.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Security forces remain on high alert at St Anthony's, and across the country IS said ""members of the US-led coalition and Christians in Sri Lanka"" had been targeted.
BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says that while IS in the past has claimed attacks it was not involved in, this statement is being taken seriously due to the scale of the attacks.
The choice of targets is more in line with IS ideology than with traditional types of communal violence seen in Sri Lanka, he adds.
According to the Sri Lankan government, most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and had come from ""middle- or upper middle-class"" families.
Two were sons of a wealthy spice trader, Mohamed Ibrahim, who was arrested after the attacks.
How has the government responded? The NTJ was banned on Saturday and dozens of arrests have been made since the attacks. A curfew was also imposed.
The government admitted a ""major intelligence lapse"" after it was revealed that an Indian intelligence warning from the beginning of the month about planned attacks was not properly shared by the authorities.
Security services had been monitoring the NTJ, but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said.
President Maithripala Sirisena moved to sack the defence secretary and inspector general of police.
What is the country's religious make-up? Sunday's attacks were the worst ever against Sri Lanka's small Christian minority, who make up just 7% of the 21 million population.
Theravada Buddhism is Sri Lanka's biggest religion, accounting for about 70% of the population. Hindus and Muslims make up around 12% and 10% of the population respectively.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Christians are a small minority in Sri Lanka The attacks are Sri Lanka's deadliest act of violence since the end of the 26-year civil war in 2009.

Ukraine-Russia sea clash- Trump cancels Putin talks,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46386160,"On Thursday he announced that Russians living in Ukraine would soon face restrictions on bank withdrawals, changing foreign currency and travelling abroad. What happened off Crimea?
The incident happened on Sunday, when two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug were sailing from Odessa to the port of Mariupol, in the Sea of Azov - which is shared between Russia and Ukraine.
The vessels were stopped from entering the Kerch Strait and confronted by FSB border guards. After a lengthy standoff, during which the Ukrainian tug was rammed, the ships began turning back towards Odessa, the Ukrainian government says.
The Russians opened fire, wounding at least three sailors, and seized the Ukrainian flotilla.
The Kerch Strait separates Russia from Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by Russia in 2014. Who controls the waters?
Ukraine says Russia is deliberately blockading Mariupol and another Ukrainian port on the Sea of Azov, Berdyansk.

Mr Trump tweeted that ""it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting"" with Mr Putin, adding that he was looking forward to a ""meaningful summit... as soon as this situation is resolved"". Report
Also on Thursday, Ms Merkel accused Russia of restricting access to the Sea of Azov by building a bridge over the Kerch Strait.
Speaking alongside Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman in Berlin on Thursday, she said the latest crisis was ""entirely the doing of the Russian president"" and accused Moscow of violating a 2003 agreement guaranteeing free movement in the area.
""I want the Ukrainian soldiers released,"" she said. ""The Ukrainian side has asked us to act wisely. There is no military solution to these problems."" Image copyright AFP/UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SERVICE Image caption Petro Poroshenko asked: ""What will Putin do next if we do not stop him?"" 'Hardly likely'
Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic and defence correspondent
The call for Nato to deploy warships to the Sea of Azov raises a variety of diplomatic and practical problems.
In strict legal terms, Russia and Ukraine share access to its waters under a 2003 treaty. This, though, specifically states that warships from third countries can only enter the sea or make port visits there with the express permission of the other party.
Russia is hardly likely to give such permission. In practical terms, it could easily block the Kerch Strait as it did earlier this week, by placing a merchant vessel across the channel.
Nato in any case might see such a visit as more likely to inflame tensions.
It's more likely that Nato might seek to boost its naval deployments to the Black Sea, where its members - Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey - are uneasy about Russia's more assertive behaviour.
Indeed, the alliance says that its vessels have already spent some 120 days on patrol or exercises in the Black Sea this year, compared with 80 in 2017. What is Russia's argument?
Mr Putin called the sea clash ""a provocation"" organised by Ukraine's authorities ""in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential election"".
Mr Poroshenko has low popularity ratings. Recent polls suggest that only about 10% of the electorate plans to vote for him next year, with nearly 50% saying they would not vote for him under any circumstances, the Kyiv Post newspaper reported. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high
Mr Putin added that Mr Poroshenko's decision to impose martial law after a mere ""border incident"" was extreme, because it was not even imposed during the conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
Russian state media report that Moscow has delivered a battalion of S-400 surface-to-air missiles to north Crimea, and also plans to build a new missile early-warning radar station there.
Mr Putin insisted that Russia's military response was appropriate as the Ukrainians had ""trespassed"" into Russia's territorial waters."
Housebound Parkinson's patients have movement restored - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Pallab Ghosh Science Correspondent,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47803496,"Parkinson's results beyond researchers' wildest dreams By Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent, BBC News 22 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gail Jardine: ""I can walk, I can turn... it's really helped me"" A treatment that has restored the movement of patients with chronic Parkinson's disease has been developed by Canadian researchers.
Previously housebound patients are now able to walk more freely as a result of electrical stimulation to their spines.
A quarter of patients have difficulty walking as the disease wears on, often freezing on the spot and falling.
Parkinson's UK hailed its potential impact on an aspect of the disease where there is currently no treatment.
Prof Mandar Jog, of Western University in London, Ontario, told BBC News the scale of benefit to patients of his new treatment was ""beyond his wildest dreams"". Image copyright AFP Image caption Scientists monitor their patients' improvement using sensors on a specially made suit.
""Most of our patients have had the disease for 15 years and have not walked with any confidence for several years,"" he said.
""For them to go from being home-bound, with the risk of falling, to being able to go on trips to the mall and have vacations is remarkable for me to see.""
Normal walking involves the brain sending instructions to the legs to move. It then receives signals back when the movement has been completed before sending instructions for the next step. Image copyright BBC News/Western University Image caption The parts of the brain involved with movement (red on the left-hand scan) are not working properly, but three months into the trial those areas are now functioning
Prof Jog believes Parkinson's disease reduces the signals coming back to the brain - breaking the loop and causing the patient to freeze.
The implant his team has developed boosts that signal, enabling the patient to walk normally.
However, Prof Jog was surprised that the treatment was long-lasting and worked even when the implant was turned off.
He believes the electrical stimulus reawakens the feedback mechanism from legs to brain that is damaged by the disease.
""This is a completely different rehabilitation therapy,"" he said. ""We had thought that the movement problems occurred in Parkinson's patients because signals from the brain to the legs were not getting through.
""But it seems that it's the signals getting back to the brain that are degraded."" Countryside walks
Brain scans showed that before patients received the electrical treatment, the areas that control movement were not working properly. But a few months into the treatment those areas were restored.
Gail Jardine, 66, is among the patients who has benefited from the treatment.
Before she received the implant two months ago, Gail kept freezing on the spot, and she would fall over two or three times a day.
She lost her confidence and stopped walking in the countryside in Kitchener, Ontario - something she loved doing with her husband, Stan.
Now she can walk with Stan in the park for the first time in more than two years.
""I can walk a lot better,"" she said. ""I haven't fallen since I started the treatment. It's given me more confidence and I'm looking forward to taking more walks with Stan and maybe even go on my own"". Image copyright Guy Alden Image caption Guy Alden used to rely on a wheelchair but after his treatment he had his first holiday in seven years with his wife, Barb
Another beneficiary is Guy Alden, 70, a deacon at a catholic church in London, Ontario. He was forced to retire in 2012 because of his Parkinson's disease.
His greatest regret was that it curtailed his work in the community, such as his prison visits.
""I was freezing a lot when I was in a crowd or crossing a threshold in a mall. Everyone would be looking at me. It was very embarrassing,"" he told me.
""Now I can walk in crowds. My wife and I even went on holiday to Maui and I didn't need to use my wheelchair at any point. There were a lot of narrow roads and a lot of (slopes) and I did all of that pretty well.""
Dr Beckie Port, research manager at Parkinson's UK, said: ""The results seen in this small-scale pilot study are very promising and the therapy certainly warrants further investigation.
""Should future studies show the same level of promise, it has the potential to dramatically improve quality of life, giving people with Parkinson's the freedom to enjoy everyday activities."" "

Attacks on churches and hotels killed 290 people and wounded nearly 500.
Security agencies had been watching the National Thowheed Jamath jihadist group, reports said, and had notified police about a possible attack.
But the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the cabinet were not informed, ministers said.
On Tuesday, the country is observing a day to ""mourn the senseless loss of innocent lives,"" Mr Wickremesinghe said in a statement posted to Twitter.
""It is imperative that we remain unified as Sri Lankans in the face of this unspeakable tragedy,"" he added.
What we know so far Dispatch: St Anthony's - 'church of miracles' Who are the victims? The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath A 'colossal intelligence failure' The prime minister was not privy to security briefings following a rift last year with President Maithripala Sirisena, cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told a press conference.
Mr Sirisena sacked Mr Wickremesinghe and his cabinet in October and tried to install another prime minister, prompting a full-blown constitutional crisis.
He was forced to reinstate Mr Wickremesinghe under pressure from the nation's supreme court, but apparently kept the prime minister from security briefings.
Mr Senaratne said intelligence agencies had begun issuing warnings about the group on 4 April, after which the defence ministry sent a detailed warning to the chief of police; and on 11 April a memo was sent to the heads of several security divisions.
He said information passed to police included a warning from a foreign intelligence agency about possible attacks by the group, as well as names of members.
US media Quote: Sri Lankan officials as saying both Indian and US intelligence had warned the country about a threat in early April.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Residents gather outside St Anthony's Shrine in Colombo, a day after it was bombed It was not clear on Monday whether Mr Sirisena had been made aware of the warnings. ""Our understanding is that it was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to Mr Sirisena, told the BBC.
He said that the president had appointed a special committee led by a supreme court judge to investigate what had happened.
Rauff Hakeem, the minister for town planning, called the attacks a ""colossal failure of intelligence"".
""It is shameful for all of us. We are all ashamed of this,"" he said.
Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando tweeted: ""Some intelligence officers were aware of this incidence. Therefore there was a delay in action. Serious action needs to be taken as to why this warning was ignored.""
What steps has the government taken? Sri Lankan authorities declared a state of emergency which came into effect at midnight (18:30 GMT) on Monday.
The declaration gives police and the military sweeping powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders - powers that were last used during the nation's civil war.
A curfew also came into effect at 20:00, leaving armed security forces patrolling largely deserted streets in Colombo on Monday night.
The government blocked access to Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram after the blasts.
Police arrested 24 suspects in a series of raids just hours after the attacks, and later said 87 bomb detonators had been found at the Bastian Mawatha private bus station in Petta.

It claims to be ‚Äòa bibliophile beauty pageant‚Äô. View image of (Credit: Massimo Listri/Taschen)
Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (The Vatican Library), Rome, Italy
The Vatican Library has its roots in the 4th Century CE, although in its current form it was established in the 15th Century. In the 16th Century Pope Sixtus V commissioned the architect Domenico Fontana to create new buildings to house the Vatican collections, and these are still used today. The decoration is so dizzyingly luxurious that it suggests a sort of fractal geometry.
Like most of the vast Vatican complex, the library is a display of the spiritual and temporal influence that has allowed the Vatican to constitute itself as a sovereign state. In addition to documents spanning much of human history, the library possesses the oldest known manuscript of the Bible. When the librarian shushes you, you might want to listen: he has the rank of cardinal. View image of (Credit: Massimo Listri/Taschen)
Stiftsbibliothek Kremsm√ºnster (Kremsm√ºnster Abbey Library), Austria
Kremsm√ºnster Abbey was founded in 777 CE and its library holdings include the Codex Millenarius, a famous 8th-Century manuscript of the Christian Gospels that depicts Saint Luke as a flying ox (Matthew, Mark, and John are a winged man, lion, and eagle respectively). Except for a raid in the 10th Century, after which repairs were made by Emperor Henry II, Kremsm√ºnster for the most part escaped sacking, dissolution, and aristocratic expropriation; little wonder, since it sits on a hill like an intimidating fortress.
Like many continental libraries, it was (re)built in the popular Baroque style in the 17th Century, according to which most surfaces (luckily not including the floor) are subjected to exuberant carving, gilding, and frescoes ‚Äì although this library is positively restrained in comparison to some. Books as intellectual and cultural capital were once considered as valuable as jewels, and it made sense for them to be stored and displayed in gorgeous jewel boxes.

Biblioteca Statale Oratoriana dei Girolamini (The Girolamini Library), Naples, Italy
The Girolamini library is part of a large complex founded by the Oratorian religious order. The library hall is an imposing space that rises through three elegant stories: two levels of carved wood shelves, topped with late baroque plasterwork and frescoes. The sheer volume of books on display leaves one in no doubt that this is a place of higher study and research, as well as a warehouse of knowledge. Although it is wide ranging, the collection is particularly strong in music: the Oratorians believe in the importance of music and song in religious contemplation.
This was the 18th-Century philosopher Giambattista Vico‚Äôs favourite library. It is also, sadly, an instance of a historic library being ransacked in the 21st Century: in 2012 it was discovered that a crime ring had been systematically looting and selling its valuable antique texts on the open market, although many of them have now been recovered. This episode is a valuable reminder, if one were needed, that humanity‚Äôs written heritage ‚Äì the ‚Äòmemory of the world‚Äô, as Unesco calls it ‚Äì remains under constant threat of attack.

Biblioth√®que Sainte-Genevi√®ve (Sainte-Genevi√®ve Library), Paris, France
Although we know it is probably older, documentary information about this library first appears in 1148. It was founded as a monastic library, survived the calamitous years of the Revolution intact (although the abbey it was a part of was dissolved and turned into a school), and now serves as the Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne university library. The library‚Äôs holdings expanded with the dissolution of other religious institutions and from confiscation of aristocratic collections.
The new abbey church, built in the 18th Century, has been turned into the famous Panth√©on, the national hall of fame. The current library building was created by the architect Henri Labrouste and opened in 1851. The majestic reading room is like an Industrial Age cathedral; the iron-frame construction brings to mind the other great public cathedrals of the period, the railway stations. In a modern arrangement, desks for readers are at centre stage, with the book stacks standing in graceful attendance. Gas lighting was employed in a monumental hall for the first time.

Klosterbibliothek Metten (Metten Abbey Library), Germany
The Benedictine Abbey at Metten was founded in 766 but was buffeted by the Reformation, war, social unrest, secularisation, and the realpolitik swirling around it. This reached a crescendo in 1803, when the abbey‚Äôs property, including its library holdings, were confiscated and auctioned off. However, under King Ludwig I of Bavaria the abbey was reopened and a new library was established; the site once more became a redoubt of knowledge and education.
Under Abbot M√§rkl the monastery was transformed into a prelate‚Äôs palace, more in keeping with the prestige it commanded. Among its breathtaking official reception rooms are the library, which is designed along a sophisticated theological scheme. The result is a densely saturated and surprisingly playful palate of beautiful materials.
The sculptor Franz Josef Holzinger was commissioned to create the ‚Äòatlantes‚Äô on the central columns to hold up the ceiling (because an ordinary marble column would never do). Christian heroes such as Thomas Aquinas are captured in scenes from their lives in the ceiling frescoes. If there is a problem with this Rococo approach to constructing a ‚Äòtemple of knowledge‚Äô, it is perhaps that one sometimes has to squint to find the books.

Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen (Saint Gall Abbey Library), St Gallen, Switzerland
For a long time, St Gall Abbey was one of the most important intellectual centres in Western Europe, and it incorporates one of the largest medieval libraries in the world. The abbey was founded in the 7th Century by the Irish monk Gallus, and followed the Rule of St Benedict ‚Äì the most bookish of saints, who required of his order the disciplined contemplation of religious texts ‚Äì for more than a thousand years.
A Greek inscription above the library‚Äôs entrance calls it a ‚Äòsanctuary for the soul‚Äô. Today‚Äôs library arose during the Baroque remodelling of the abbey in the 18th Century by the architect Peter Thumb. The decoration befits a place of great cultural capital. There is rich, Rococo ornamentation everywhere, and especially in the stucco work. The carved wooden bookcases completely cover the walls on two levels, while the ceiling paintings depict ecumenical councils and church fathers. The abbey was added to the Unesco World Heritage list in 1983. View image of (Credit: Massimo Listri/Taschen)
Stiftsbibliothek Admont (Admont Abbey Library), Austria
Whatever you think of religion, it‚Äôs clear that monasteries and their libraries were historically the batteries that kept the light of (what we think of as) Western civilisation burning. The Admont Abbey library has been one of the greatest sources of stored cultural energy for almost a millennium. It is the largest monastic library in the world, and it could also be the grandest.
The Benedictine community at Admont goes back to 1074, and it has been collecting books all that time. The abbey currently holds around 1,400 precious manuscripts, of which more than half date from the Middle Ages and the earliest is from the 8th Century. Modelled on the Imperial Court Library in Vienna, which its architect Josef Hueber also designed, it is acknowledged to be a masterpiece.
The baroque interior of the 70m (230 feet)-long library hall is made up of seven circular vaults, divided by a large central vault on the ceiling of which is a fresco of ‚ÄòDivine Wisdom‚Äô by the artist Altomonte. The rooms are dotted with impressive sculptures by Josef Stammel, who worked for Admont for many years. The books are arranged by subject matter, under corresponding frescoes, in accordance with Enlightenment ideals. View image of (Credit: Massimo Listri/Taschen)
Strahovsk√° Knihovna (Strahov Monastery Library), Prague, Czech Republic
The Premonstratensian Strahov monastery was founded in in 1143 and has survived fire, wars, and plundering. Fortunately the holes torn in its collection have been more than made up for over the years by acquisitions and bequests. The library is home to the usual array of religious books, including the exquisite Strahov Evangeliary from the 9th Century, with semi-precious stones embedded in the binding, but its holdings cover a broad range of topics.
In design, the library has two monumental halls. The Theological Hall was commissioned by the Abbot of Strahov in 1671; its riotous stucco work and many paintings and inscriptions (illustrating the principles of faith, study, knowledge, and divine providence) place it firmly in the Bohemian Baroque tradition. The fact that its codices are uniformly bound in white give the hall a pleasingly well-ordered feel.
The Philosophical Hall (shown here) was built starting in 1783, is more neoclassical in design, and is characterised by its magnificent walnut book cabinets, which were salvaged from the dissolved abbey of Louka, in Moravia. After the Communist coup, the monastery was appropriated by the Czechoslovakian State in 1950 to become part of the Museum of Czech Literature. But after the fall of Communism, the collections were given back to the Premonstratensians, who have been working since to repair decades of neglect. View image of (Credit: Massimo Listri/Taschen)
Trinity College Library, Dublin, Ireland
If you still have your sunglasses on, you can take them off now, because the Long Room at Trinity College Library is pleasingly low on ornamentation, and soothingly high on Enlightenment symmetries. Elizabeth I of England founded Trinity College in 1592 as a centre of Protestant scholarship, the idea being to break with the monastic tradition of learning and establish a new framework within the University of Dublin.
Because the university outgrew its first library, a new building was planned by Thomas Burgh. Known as the Old Library, it was begun in 1712 and finished in 1732. It includes a spectacular 65m (215 ft)-long central space known as the Long Room; the original flat roof of the single-storey room was raised in 1858 and replaced with the oak barrel-vaulting that exists today.
The Long Room‚Äôs oak shelves hold 200,000 of the university‚Äôs most valuable books. Among the intellectual worthies whose busts are ranked along the bookshelves are Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett, both of whom once used the library. (There are no women.) The library‚Äôs treasures include illuminated masterpieces such as the Book of Durrow (c 650‚Äì700) and the Book of Kells (c 800).

Supreme Court to hear LGBT workplace discrimination cases - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48017275,"Image copyright Getty/ERIC BARADAT Image caption The US Supreme Court will examine federal protections for LGBT employees in the workplace The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear three cases that ask if existing US job discrimination laws should extend to sexual orientation and gender identity.
Two of the cases involve alleged discrimination of gay men by their employers, and the third examines the discrimination of a transgender person.
The cases will signal the direction of LGBT rights in the US, four years after gay marriage was legalised nationwide.
The 5-4 conservative-majority court is set to examine the cases this fall.
The first two cases have been consolidated as both address the purported discrimination of gay employees.
Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor from New York, and Gerald Bostock, a former county child welfare services coordinator from Georgia, both alleged they were fired because of their sexual orientation.
The top court will also examine the Michigan case of funeral home employee Aimee Stephens, who claims she was fired because she is transgender.
Top US court backs baker's gay cake snub Court backs Trump transgender military ban LGBT India six months after gay sex ruling In its listing of the cases, the Supreme Court cites Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the section that prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex and national origin.
But it does not explicitly reference sexual orientation or gender identity, and lower courts have been divided in recent years on whether the protections should apply to either category.
The US Justice Department under President Donald Trump has supported the employers in each case, arguing that existing federal civil rights protections do not extend to sexual orientation or gender identity.
This marks a change in course from the Obama administration, which supported treating LGBT discrimination as sex discrimination.
Some advocates for LGBT equality celebrated the opportunity for workplace protections to be cemented in law.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gay marriage supporters cheered the June 2013 ruling that struck down a law limiting recognition of the unions ""The Supreme Court has an opportunity to clarify this area of law to ensure protections for LGBTQ people in many important areas of life"", said Sarah Warbelow, Human Rights Campaign legal director, in a statement.
""The growing legal consensus is that our nation's civil rights laws do protect LGBTQ people against discrimination under sex nondiscrimination laws.""
In her statement Ms Warbelow urged Congress to pass protections for LGBT employees, ""regardless"" of the court's decision.
In 2017, the Supreme Court chose not examine a case involving a lesbian working as a hospital security officer in Georgia, leaving a lower court ruling in place which sided with the woman's employer.
The current bench, a 5-4 conservative majority, includes Trump appointees Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh."
'I feel refreshed': Brits embrace multiple careers - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Felicity Hannah Wake Up To Money,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47984295,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Sam Gray Image caption Sam Gray working in security - one of her many jobs More than 320,500 self-employed people in Britain are working two or more jobs, new analysis suggests.
A study by the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) - seen by 5 Live's Wake Up To Money - shows that 7% have launched an additional business.
Some call it a portfolio career or a multi-hyphenate career.
One term that seems to be sticking is ""slashie"", as in: ""I am a chef/blogger/dog walker."" 'A positive choice'
Sam Gray is a so-called ""slashie"", although she dislikes that term and would rather be known as a ""Jack of all trades"". She's a former teacher living in Torquay, and currently works five different jobs.
In addition to her own dog-grooming business, Toodles, Sam works as a private tutor, teaches crochet and sells patterns, works security for nightclubs and bars and works two 12-hour night shifts at a local arcade.
While she initially took on multiple roles by necessity, she says she now enjoys this way of working.
""As a full-time teacher your job never ends. There is this constant feeling that you could and should be doing more. But with lots of different jobs I have to switch off, I have to stop thinking about what I was doing, because I am getting paid to do something else. Image copyright Sam Gray Image caption Sam Gray runs a dog-grooming business, alongside other roles
""It is a positive choice. If I just worked in a dog grooming salon all day I think I'd probably go a little bit mad, dogs aren't great for conversation. And I love teaching, so tutoring really fills that gap for me."" 'Multifaceted by nature'
Working more than one job because money is tight is not new, but many ""slashies"" appear to be doing so for more personal, creative reasons.
It's also a bit different to a side-hustle, which is where someone turns their hobby outside their main job into a money-making venture. Many are successful enough to be able to leave their full-time employment to become a ""slashie"".
Research carried out by Henley Business School found that one in four workers are running at least one business alongside their main careers.
Chlo√© Jepps, deputy head of research at IPSE, says that for most people it is a choice, not a necessity. ""It's to pursue a passion, try something new and get some extra income while doing something they love,"" she explains.
But it's also a way to trial a new business: ""You can test a new idea without leaping straight into it and try things without taking the full risk.""
Emma Gannon believes this way of working simply suits many people better, by giving them outlets for different interests. She's a journalist, podcaster and author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, which provides advice on how to manage multiple careers.
She says: ""In America, it was always cool to have another role on the side, but in the UK there's a stigma around being a 'Jack of all trades'. Image copyright Patrick Balls Image caption Author Emma Gannon helps 'slashies' navigate their working lives
""From school and university, we're told to pick one thing and become an expert, but the job-for-life isn't possible anymore, even if you want that.
""Humans are multifaceted by nature, we have many interests and now we're feeling braver about embracing that.""
Emma is confident that rather than ""working in a way that suits the Victorian era, working at a machine for fixed hours"", many more will choose to have a concurrent careers.
But she says these ""slashie"" pioneers are at risk of burnout.
""The flip side of enjoying your job can be that you end up working 24 hours a day. There's an increasing trend of merging your job and your life, and if you've got a few different gigs then even more so.
""There isn't enough support for people working this way. The admin side of things can be quite intense, more so if you're running more than one business.""
For ""slashie"" Sam Gray, a change is simply as good as a rest.
""I feel refreshed by how I work now,"" she says.
""I don't do anything long enough to get bored with it, everything just feels new."" Related Topics"
More than half of British firms 'report cyber-attacks in 2019' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48017943,"
It said there had been a ""sharp increase"" in the number of cyber-attacks this year, with more than 60% of firms having reported one or more attacks - up from 45% in 2018.
Average losses from breaches also soared from $229,000 (¬£176,000) to $369,000, an increase of 61%.
Despite this, the insurer said the percentage of firms scoring top marks on cyber security had fallen, with UK organisations doing particularly badly.
British firms had the lowest cyber security budgets, it said, spending less than $900,000 on average compared with $1.46m across the group.
They were also joint-least likely with US firms to have a ""defined role for cyber security"" on their staff. In France the proportion was closer to one in ten.
Gareth Wharton, head of Cyber at Hiscox, said the low UK spending could be driven by the large number of small businesses in Britain.
""They may feel like they won't be targeted, as we tend to only read about large breaches in the press. If they incorrectly feel that they won't be targeted, they may be less likely to spend on cyber security.""
However, Hiscox also found the average cost of an attack in the UK was lower than average at $243,000, compared with $906,000 in Germany and $486,000 in Belgium.
New regulation has also prompted action, with eight in ten UK firms saying they had made changes since the introduction of tough new EU data protection rules last year. Related Topics "
Could a computer ever rival Rembrandt or Beethoven? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Eleanor Lawrie Technology Of Business Reporter,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47700701,"Image copyright Christie's Image caption This portrait was created by computer, so is it really art and is it any good? Last year a portrait of Edmond Belamy sold for $432,000 (¬£337,000).
A bit steep, you might think, for a picture of someone you've never heard of. And you won't have heard of the artist either, as the picture was created by an algorithm drawing on a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th Centuries.
And to be honest, it's a bit rubbish.
The sale, which astonished auction house Christie's, raised many important questions. Can a computer, devoid of human emotion, ever be truly creative? Is this portrait really art? Does any of that matter if people are prepared to pay for it?
And as artificial intelligence evolves and eventually perhaps reaches or surpasses human level intelligence, what will this mean for human artists and the creative industries in general?
Algorithms have already created artworks, poems, and pieces of music, but are they merely mimicking rather than creating? Cognitive neuroscientist Romy Lorenz says a lot depends on how we define creativity.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Chinese Go player Ke Jie was eventually defeated by DeepMind's AlphaGo AI program If creativity means finding completely new ways to solve problems, then AI has already achieved that, she argues, citing Google's DeepMind subsidiary.
In 2017, one of DeepMind's AI programmes beat the world's number one player of Go , an ancient and highly complex Chinese board game, after apparently mastering creative new moves and innovative strategies within days.
""Google would say that was creativity - new ways of finding solutions that it was not taught,"" she says.
But is art more than just creative problem-solving?
How can you stop your kids viewing harmful web content? How does it feel to be watched at work all the time? Should cyber-security be more chameleon, less rhino? The nations of the Amazon want the name back What's the new weapon against money laundering gangsters? Games, particularly those which take place within virtual worlds, have been the perfect setting for AI to solve problems creatively.
But asking an algorithm to create without any human input at all actually yields quite boring results, argues New York-based professor of computer science, Julian Togelius.
He cites Kate Compton's ""10,000 bowls of oatmeal"" problem , which suggests that while algorithms can now create infinite worlds, these can be tedious for humans to play in.
An example, he suggests, was the hotly-anticipated release of space exploration game No Man's Sky , which offered 18 quintillion algorithmically-generated planets to explore.
Image copyright Hello Games Image caption No Man's Sky uses ""procedural generation"" to create new worlds automatically ""In No Man's Sky there are more places you could visit in a lifetime, with different flora and fauna. But that game has had mixed reviews - it's a technical masterpiece but it's not super interesting to play,"" he says.
""The question is, can your algorithm generate a world that has meaning to it, and that is particular to the player in terms of place or skill?
""These algorithms are amazing - they can do more and more. But there will always be things us humans want to put in. It's the power of the sensibility and intentionality of the human brain - that's what is hard [to recreate].""
Dr Lorenz points out that true artistic creativity differs from creative problem solving in that it requires a shift in perspective that machines do not appear to have the capacity for.
Image copyright Romy Lorenz Image caption Romy Lorenz says AI has no ""internal world"" from which to create true art ""Artistic creativity is about turning an introspective thought into a medium, whether it's a sculpture or a piece of music. It's about taking an abstract form and making it concrete.
""But AI has no internal world and it has no need to create its desires or fears.""
So rather than letting AI take complete control, results seem to be far more fruitful when human artists work hand-in-hand with machines.
Musician and University of Sussex lecturer Dr Alice Eldridge suggests that we should treat AI as ""just another tool that we have designed, like the wheel, or the combustion engine"".
Image copyright Dr Alice Eldridge Image caption Dr Alice Eldridge (l) and Dr Chris Kiefer (r) play their self-resonating feedback cellos She has helped create a cello that uses a combination of acoustics, electrification and an adaptive algorithm that makes the instrument self-resonate; or essentially, play itself.
""With a classical cello you have to bring the instrument alive with a bow; a feedback cello is already singing, your job as a performer is to shape the sound - it's more like a dance than 'controlling' an instrument in the traditional way,"" she says.
""This creates a different way of thinking about, and designing our relationships with, musical instruments, and technology in general.""
Mick Grierson, at the UAL Creative Computing Institute in London, believes advances in AI will ""lead to better art, new types of artists and new mediums"".
In 2016, Nordic band Sigur R√≥s used his software to create a constantly evolving version of one of their singles , which the band played on a 24-hour road trip around Iceland.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The band Massive Attack have been experimenting with AI to create unique pieces of art Individual musical elements of the song were fed through the software to make a song that, like a live performance, is subtly different with every repetition, and could respond to external prompts.
Innovative composer and producer Brian Eno, who has worked with Roxy Music, David Bowie and Coldplay amongst others, is also a big fan of using algorithms to create music that constantly changes.
Prof Grierson has also worked with Massive Attack on an AI reworking of their Mezzanine album , to mark its 20th anniversary. The album will be fed into a form of AI that teaches itself - a neural network - and visitors to an upcoming Barbican exhibition will be able to affect the resulting sound by their movements.
Massive Attack album stored in a painting using DNA While AI could be seen as yet another threat to artists' livelihoods, he believes machines will never come close to competing.
""AI could be used to reduce human creativity by people who want to make money - but it's people [not technology] who are responsible for doing that.
""The technology is never going to be good enough to generate better culture than people who use it to create their own.""

He led what appeared to be a roadshow on his way to the polling booth in Ahmedabad, the city he lived in during his 13 years as chief minister.
He waved at the crowds that had gathered from an open-top jeep, which had replaced his usual bulletproof car.
Mr Modi is contesting from Varanasi, which goes to the polls on 19 May.
Around 180 million people are eligible to vote on Tuesday - 117 seats spread across 15 states and union territories are up for grabs. It is the largest stage of the whole election, which is being seen as a referendum on Mr Modi, who has been in power since 2014. Report
It's also important for Mr Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as Gujarat is his home state and where his political career began. Mr Modi won his first parliamentary seat from Vadodadara in Gujarat in 2014 - but he vacated it as he also contested and won Varanasi.
On Tuesday morning, Mr Modi first travelled to the capital city of Gandhinagar to meet his mother before going to Ahmedabad to vote.

Kim-Putin: North Korean and Russian leaders 'to meet for first time' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Andreas Illmer Bbc News,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47972954,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Similar 'tough guy' optics from the two leaders but very different agendas North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has arrived in Russia for his first ever talks with Vladimir Putin.
The meeting in the Pacific port of Vladivostok comes soon after the collapse of the Trump-Kim talks in Hanoi.
The international stand-off over Pyongyang's nuclear programme is top of the list of issues to discuss, but both sides are bringing very different agendas to the table.
How much influence does Moscow have over North Korea? The Soviet Union was a major ally of North Korea, offering economic co-operation, cultural exchanges and aid. It also provided North Korea with its initial nuclear know-how.
But since the collapse of the Iron Curtain the relationship has suffered. With weakened ideological ties there was no reason for special treatment and support. And as a regular trading partner, North Korea was not very attractive to Russia, as it was unable to pay international market prices.
Since Russia's gradual estrangement from the West since the early 2000s, relations have picked up somewhat. Moscow has found itself backing countries ""based on the old logic that my enemy's enemy is my friend,"" explains Professor Andrei Lankov of Seoul's Kookmin University.
Image copyright EPA/Reuters Image caption During Cold War times, the two countries were close allies The last North Korea-Russia bilateral meeting was in 2011, when then president Dmitry Medvedev met Mr Kim's father, Kim Jong-il.
Their relationship makes sense geographically - they share a short border not far from the important Russian port city of Vladivostok, where the two leaders are widely expected to meet.
According to Russia's foreign ministry, there are also some 8,000 North Korean migrant labourers working in Russia, sending vital revenue back home. Other estimates put that number much higher.
Under the current UN sanctions, all of these workers will have to be sent home by the end of the year.
What does North Korea want? The Hanoi summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump collapsed without any agreement or progress on North Korea's nuclear programme.
It's an outcome the North Korean leadership had not expected. It had hoped to agree a compromise which would see some easing of the international sanctions which are damaging its economy.
""International sanctions are beginning to take effect and without a change in the US position, it's very unlikely North Korea will be able to get sanctions relief and pick up trade with the outside world,"" says Prof Lankov.
Image copyright AFP Image caption The Hanoi talks in February ended without agreement So North Korea needs to contact everyone who might be helpful in achieving that goal. Anything from real progress to even symbolic diplomatic assistance would be useful to Pyongyang.
Alexey Muraviev, associate professor at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, says North Korea has to show the US ""they're not in isolation"".
""If they can show that major powers are still backing them up, this will give them additional bargaining power to talk to the US and China.""
What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker So Russia is an attractive option.
""Mr Kim needs to be given full credit,"" Mr Muraviev says. ""He is quite skilful in playing high-stakes diplomacy for North Korea's economic interest - and for the survival of his own regime.""
Courting other dialogue partners goes in tandem with renewed missile activity to pressure Washington back to the negotiating table .
""North Korea's strategy always has been walking a tight-rope between the conflicts of the world powers and getting concessions that way,"" Park Young-ja, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told BBC Korean.
""So meeting with Russia could be a card it can play against China and the US.""
What does Moscow want? President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin was somewhat sidelined.
Life in North Korea Tourists swell Pyongyang marathon turnout North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis What it's like to 'vote' in North Korea Rape and no periods in North Korea's army So after the failure of the Hanoi talks, a meeting with Kim Jong-un is a good opportunity for Mr Putin to put Moscow back on the playing field.
Like the US and China, Russia is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state and in the early 2000s was part of the ill-fated six-party talks after Pyongyang withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
But unlike Washington, Moscow wants to accept the status quo: denuclearisation is seen as an unrealistic goal so the Kremlin instead wants talks with Pyongyang aimed at stabilising the situation.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Moscow doesn't think North Korea will give up its nukes Russia's involvement is also a matter of prestige and reputation. Regardless of how the US-North Korea relations will pan out, Russia is keen on being involved at least at some level.
If Mr Putin manages to have at least some say in the situation, he can show that Russia is still present in the region.
And if the Kremlin was to contribute in a meaningful way to solving the North Korea situation, even better.
What's the likely outcome of the talks? By most estimates, there won't be any major agreement or deals struck between the two countries.
Aside from getting some international recognition and leverage for future talks with Washington, North Korea is primarily interested in money.
""The country's economic situation is bad and Pyongyang desperately wants a relaxation in the sanctions so regular trade can pick up,"" says Mr Lankov. ""It also wants free money in the form of aid.""
Yet neither is likely to be forthcoming from Moscow.
 The North sees its nuclear capabilities as key to military deterrence The overwhelming sense in Moscow remains that Pyongyang is an unreliable and unmanageable state it will not spend a lot of money on, Mr Lankov says. And money is what North Korea needs most.
""I don't think North Korea can get much from Russia,"" Lee Jai-chun, a former South Korean ambassador to Russia, told BBC Korean.
""The Russian economy is in a difficult situation after the sanctions over Crimea. The meeting would be a gesture to the Trump administration, and to South Korea.""
A meeting will also have domestic implications, he says. ""North Korea's citizens know that the summit with US was a failure so the meeting with Russia could be a 'show' to the North Korean people.""
In terms of economic ties, Russia is bound by UN Security Council sanctions. ""It will not officially violate those sanctions,"" Mr Lankov says. ""At best Moscow might turn a blind eye to some minor sanctions violations.""
Open violations seen as sanctioned by the Kremlin would only hurt Russia's interests with very little in return: North Korea is not a relevant export market for Russia. And in turn, North Korea has no major products useful for Russia.
""So at most, there will be some small symbolic aid promises,"" suggests Mr Lankov, ""and a lot of words with very little action"".
""Moscow is wary of spending money on a country that's seen as extremely unreliable, especially at a time when Russia itself is suffering from international sanctions.""
So in the end, Russia might be merely another voice urging North Korea against escalating tensions while Kim Jong-un will hope the meeting might put him in a better bargaining position to deal with Washington."

Myanmar top court rejects Reuters journalists' appeal - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48019192,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Wa Lone, left, and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in prison for more than a year Myanmar's top court has rejected an appeal by two Reuters journalists jailed on charges linked to their reports on the Rohingya.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years last September in a case condemned around the world.
They had revealed that state security forces executed 10 Muslim Rohingya during a military operation in 2017.
A lower court had rejected their initial appeal before it was brought to the Supreme Court.
On Tuesday Supreme Court Justice Soe Naing announced Myanmar's top court had reached the same conclusion.
""They were sentenced for seven years and this decision stands,"" he reportedly said, without giving details.
The pair have been in prison for more than a year for breaking Myanmar's Official Secrets Act.
Reporters held 'for investigating killings' Seeing through the official story in Myanmar They were arrested carrying official documents handed to them by police officers. Both maintain their innocence and say the authorities set them up.
""I [felt] hurt when the court rejected the appeal. I'm very sad as the verdict was not what i expected,"" Chit Suu Win, the wife of Kyaw Soe Oo told BBC Burmese.
""He [Kyaw] and I expected good news.""
When arrested, the two were investigating a mass execution of Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have been forced to flee destruction and persecution in the northern Rakhine province of Myanmar (also called Burma).
The pair's lawyer said the verdict had ""damaged"" freedom of the press in the country.
""We regret it very much not only for them but for the prestige of the country, for freedom of the press,"" Khin Maung Zaw told the BBC. ""All are damaged by this verdict.""
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Human rights groups have condemned the case UN investigators have called for top Myanmar generals to be investigated for genocide, and criticised the country's de facto leader Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi for failing to stop the attacks.
The massacre the reporters were investigating is the only one the Burmese government has admitted. Myanmar's military - which says its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats - had until then insisted its soldiers carried out no unlawful killings.
What were they investigating? Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, are Myanmar citizens who were working for the international news agency.
They had been collecting evidence about the murders of 10 Rohingya men by the army in the village of Inn Din in northern Rakhine in September 2017.
They were arrested before the report's publication, after being handed some documents by two policemen who they had met at a restaurant for the first time.
A police witness testified during the trial that the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption These are the men whose deaths the Reuters journalists were investigating The final report - a collaboration with other journalists - was considered extraordinary , because it gathered testimonies from a range of participants, including Buddhist villagers who confessed to killing Rohingya Muslims and torching their homes. Accounts from paramilitary police also directly implicated the military.
The military had previously released its own investigation into allegations of abuse in Rakhine, and exonerated itself of wrongdoing, despite large amounts of testimony from Rohingya refugees describing atrocities.
Authorities later launched their own probe into the Inn Din killings, confirming the massacre had taken place and promising to take action against those who had taken part.
Seven soldiers were sentenced to prison for their involvement in the killings. The military said the soldiers would serve 10 years with hard labour for ""contributing and participating in murder""."

The SS Iron Crown, a naval freight ship, was hit by a torpedo off the state of Victoria in 1942, killing 38 people. Its five remaining crew members survived.
The ship sank within 60 seconds of the attack in Bass Strait.
Maritime archaeologists called the find ""an event of national significance"".
A search team from the Australian National Maritime Museum located the shipwreck about 100km (60 miles) off Victoria.
Measuring about 100m (330ft) long, the ship was found upright and ""relatively intact"" about 700m below the ocean surface, officials said. Its bow, railings and anchors were also found in place.

""Locating the wreck after 77 years of not knowing its final resting place will bring closure for relatives and family of those that were lost at sea,"" Mr Harvey said.
Its oldest surviving crew member died in 2012. George Fisher told historians in 2003 that the attack had been ""one of the saddest"" events of his life, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
The wreck's exact whereabouts have not been revealed in order to protect the site.

Which? survey reveals customers' least favourite mobile network - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48020470," Vodafone has been rated as the UK's worst mobile network provider for the eighth year in a row, in consumer lobby group Which?'s eighth annual survey.
EE and O2 also finished in the bottom three. Virtual network provider Giffgaff came top of the poll, ahead of Utility Warehouse and Plusnet Mobile.
Which? said the study proved that good ""customer service"" and ""value for money"" were important to people.
Vodafone said it was ""sorry"" that Which? members were unhappy with them.
In a statement, the company added: ""We are working hard to understand the issue and what more we can do.""
In all, 13 networks were included in the survey of 6,135 Which? members in February.
The survey said Vodafone had collected one-star ratings for customer service, value for money and technical support.
One in five of its customers told Which? that ""customer service, including complaints handling and the way their queries were dealt with, was poor"".

An EE spokeswoman said: ""We're ranked top by OpenSignal for mobile experience in the UK, which is supported by other independent reports from Ofcom and RootMetrics.
""Ofcom's latest figures also show that EE receives among the fewest complaints in the mobile industry, as we've continued to invest in the UK's best customer service.""
'Shop around' Nearly all Giffgaff customers said it was ""good or excellent"" for value for money, adding they would recommend it to friends and family.
Sim-only deals proved on average 31% (¬£3.56 a month) more expensive with the Big Four providers (EE, O2, Vodafone and Three).
The same was true for the average monthly contract price for an iPhone XS, which was 18% more (¬£10.11) with the Big Four, while a Samsung Galaxy S10 was 6% more expensive (¬£3.22).
Natalie Hitchins, Which? head of home products and services, said: ""The continuing reign of smaller networks over the big players goes to show exactly how important customer support and value for money are to mobile users.
""If you think you're paying too much or are not getting the level of service you expect from your provider, you should shop around for a better deal - you might find you save yourself some money and probably a lot of grief, too.""

Sri Lanka attacks: What led to carnage? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Anbarasan Ethirajan Bbc News,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48018417,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The ruthlessness of the suicide attacks has stunned Sri Lankans Sri Lanka is in a state of shock and confusion, trying to understand how a little-known Islamist group may have unleashed the wave of co-ordinated suicide bombings that resulted in the Easter Sunday carnage - the worst since the end of the civil war a decade ago.
The South Asian island nation has experience of such attacks - suicide bombers were used by Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war. But the ruthlessness of the new atrocities has stunned the nation anew.
Eventually the government spokesman, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, came out and blamed National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ), a home-grown Islamist group, for the bombings.
""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded,"" he told reporters on Monday.
That might go some way to explaining how a group that has been blamed for promoting hate speech may now have been able to scale up its capacity so monumentally.
Who are the victims of the Sri Lanka attacks? 'My heart shattered when I saw the bodies' On Tuesday, however, the Islamic State (IS) group said its militants had carried out the attacks. It published a video of eight men the group claimed were behind the attacks.
The IS claim should be treated cautiously. It is not clear whether these men were trained by the group or simply inspired by IS ideology.
Political deadlock and confusion The manner in which NTJ was identified was circuitous. The prime minister said there had been warnings made to officials that hadn't been shared with the cabinet. He said only the president would get such briefings, even though it is not clear if he personally did in this instance.
This is not an insignificant statement from a prime minister who was at loggerheads with the president for much of the past year. Many are drawing a conclusion about how political discord can have serious consequences - as well as undermining trust in the messages being put out.
If the suicide bombers were local Sri Lankan Muslims, as stated by the government, then it is a colossal failure by the intelligence agencies. Information is also now emerging in the US media that the Sri Lankan government may also have had warnings from US and Indian intelligence about a possible threat.
""Our understanding is that [the warning] was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to President Maithripala Sirisena, said.
The Sri Lankan president, who oversees security forces, has now set up a committee to find out what went wrong.
Sri Lankan intelligence was credited with foiling several suicide attacks by the Tamil Tiger rebels at the height of the civil war and for penetrating a well-knit and ruthless Tamil Tiger organisation.
Sri Lanka's Muslim strife While this is clearly a security and political failure, there are also questions about the nature of communal strife in Sri Lanka's more recent history. During the civil war, Muslims were also targeted by Tamil Tiger rebels and suffered at their hands.
But Muslim community leaders say successive Sri Lankan governments have failed to restore confidence among young Muslims following more recent attacks by some members of the majority Sinhalese Buddhist community.
One of the worst incidents was in the town of Digana in central Sri Lanka where one person died when a Sinhalese mob attacked Muslim shops and mosques in March last year.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency after attacks on mosques and Muslim-owned businesses in 2018 ""After Digana quite a few Muslims lost faith in the government to provide them security. Some of them got the idea that they can defend themselves,"" says Hilmy Ahamed, vice-president of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council.
The attacks and what the youths perceived as the lack of action by the government may have led some of them towards groups like NTJ.
Some of the radicals were blamed for damaging Buddhist statues in recent years and their leader was arrested last year for offending religious sentiments. He later apologised for offending the sentiments of the Buddhist Sinhalese.
Radical preacher Now it is widely believed a new group emerged a few years ago under the leadership of Zaharan Hashim, a radical Muslim preacher from eastern Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka attacks: What we know Who are National Thowheed Jamath? Mr Hashim posted several videos on social media purportedly promoting hatred against non-Muslims. Most of his videos are in the Tamil language. His teachings are said to have attracted several Muslim youths.
""This man was preaching hate with lots of YouTube videos on social media posts. Some of us reported him to the national intelligence services. Once about three years ago and once in January this year,"" says Mr Ahamed.
He added that security services did not take any action against Mr Hashim. Reports say the preacher was one of the suicide bombers though it's yet to be confirmed.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Like Muslims, Christians are a minority in Sri Lanka Muslim community leaders say a few youths went to Syria to join IS, and some of them were killed in fighting there.
It's important not to overstate this, though, and a former senior military officer Maj Gen (Retired) GA Chandrasiri says ""we have very cordial relationship with the Muslims. Most Muslims are not with these people. They are peace loving people"".
There are no reports so far of a high number of jihadists returning to Sri Lanka. But even if a select few jihadists are angry with the majority, why were Christians targeted?
In the complex cocktail of Sri Lanka's religious and ethnic tensions, Christians are almost unique for not perpetrating any kind of violence on behalf of their community. After all, it is a religion that crosses ethnic lines.
Global dimension? I covered the Sri Lankan civil war for years and reported on many Tamil Tiger suicide attacks. It took years for the group to be able to learn to detonate such devices.
So it is intriguing that a lesser-known Islamist group, with a few home-grown radicals, could carry out six - some say even seven - suicide attacks with such pinpoint precision and devastation. None of them failed.
Even though connections with global jihadist groups are unclear, the choice of major luxury hotels and Christians as a target - in addition to the sophistication of the operation - makes it plausible that local radicalism has come under the influence of global jihadist networks. It would be a tried and tested pattern in global attacks.
'Church of miracles' is a symbol of hope 'I thought we left violence behind us' During the Sri Lankan civil war foreign tourists were spared and attacks on outsiders were rare. In the latest bombings, many foreigners were killed and this has raised the spectre of links with al-Qaeda or IS.
""For this type of operation you need lots of assistance from outside. You need finances, training and technique for this kind of work. You can't do these things alone. May be there was some help from outside,"" Gen Chandrasiri said.
Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka has soared after the end of the civil war Violence is not new to Sri Lanka. It went through turbulent times during a left-wing insurrection in the 1970s followed by a nearly three-decade bloody war with the Tamil Tiger rebels. Tens of thousands of people were killed.
But the ruthlessness and sophistication of the latest atrocities indicate that it will be challenge for the Sri Lankan security forces to deal with those behind the bombings. The last thing the Sri Lankan public wants is more violence and recrimination."
Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg dies aged 98 - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48020480,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Grand Duke Jean abdicated in favour of his son Henri in 2000 Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg has died at the age of 98, his son Henri has said in a statement.
He had recently been admitted to hospital suffering from a pulmonary infection, and passed away surrounded by his family, the statement said.
Grand Duke Jean abdicated in favour of his son Henri in 2000, after nearly 36 years on the throne.
During his reign, he oversaw the transformation of the Grand Duchy into an international financial centre.
Grand Duke Henri announced the death of his father in a statement on Tuesday, saying: ""It is with great sadness that I inform you of the death of my beloved father, His Royal Highness Grand Duke Jean, who has passed away in peace, surrounded by the affection of his family.""
Luxembourg profile Jean Beno√Æt Guillaume Robert Antoine Louis Marie Adolphe Marc d'Aviano was born on 5 January 1921, the eldest child of Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix.
A graduate of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he took part in the D-Day landings, and the liberation of Luxembourg from Nazi Germany.
He married Princess Jos√©phine-Charlotte of Belgium in 1953, and together they had five children.
During his reign, Luxembourg turned itself from an industrial backwater into a centre for financial services and satellite communications.
Grand Duke Jean's decision to step down at the age of 79 followed a precedent set by his mother, who abdicated in 1964.
The head of state's constitutional role is largely ceremonial, and in 2008 parliament further restricted it by rescinding the monarch's right to veto legislation.
With about half a million inhabitants, Luxembourg is not only one of the smallest states in the European Union, but also the wealthiest in terms of per capita gross domestic product."

The firm, which made its UK launch in November, expects to offer 8.75 million shares priced between $19 and $21 each.
At the upper price range, the flotation would value the company at $1.2bn.

Colombia landslide: 11 more bodies found in Rosas - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-48021710,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Whole families were among those buried by the landslide Rescue workers have found 11 bodies buried in the mud after a landslide hit the Colombian town of Rosas on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the town in south-western Cauca province has risen to 28.
At least two people are still missing but emergency workers say hopes of finding anyone alive are slim.
Landslides are common in Colombia and houses built on steep hillsides are at particular risk during the country's rainy season.
In April 2017, more than 250 people were killed when a landslide hit the town of Mocoa, in Putumayo province.
More people at risk Rosas Mayor Jes√∫s Eduardo D√≠az said he feared other homes in the area could also be in danger after prolonged heavy rains.
Image copyright AFP Image caption The homes were buried deep in the mud Image copyright EPA Image caption Locals are helping with the search for at least two people who are still missing Image copyright AFP Image caption Dogs have been deployed in the search but hopes to find anyone alive are waning Colombian President Iv√°n Duque who visited the area on Monday and said a geological fault line which runs through the town had contributed to the disaster.
The mudslide happened in the early hours of Sunday and buried at least eight homes.
Mayor D√≠az said it was known that the homes were at high risk of mudslides and that residents had been warned a year ago to relocate.
He says that because all that had been available to rehome them was a temporary shelter located 35 minutes away, residents decided to stay put.
President Duque said his government would ""take all the necessary action to help those affected"". The ministry of housing said it would build 56 new homes in the town.
Locals are angry because plans to build 92 new homes after mudslides in the rainy season of 2010/2011 stalled. A contract to build the homes was suspended in August 2018 after the construction firm was found to not be duly fulfilling its work.
Emergency workers will continue searching for the missing and work is also under way to clear mud from the Panamerican Highway, which was partly blocked by the landslide."

Halyna Yanchenko, a top official at the anti-corruption watchdog Nabu, said "" MPs' immunity must be consigned to the past "". She spoke on Hromadske TV.
Aide Ivan Aparshyn said state defence orders ""will be as open as possible"".
Mr Zelensky, a popular comedian, won with 73% of the vote on Sunday.
He made tackling Ukraine's deep-rooted corruption a major campaign theme, though his political agenda is generally not very detailed.

Military reform plan Skirmishes continue in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed rebels are confronting Ukrainian troops along a mainly static frontline.
Ukraine's military, Quote: d by Unian , said a Ukrainian soldier was killed and three were wounded in 14 rebel attacks in the Donbas region. The report spoke of three rebels killed, but the losses were not independently confirmed.
Mr Zelensky wants to hold direct talks with Russia to restore peace in the conflict zone, where the rebels have declared self-rule. An international peace plan remains largely unfulfilled.
Ivan Aparshyn, a defence adviser in Mr Zelensky's team, told the Ukrainian news website Obozrevatel that the defence ministry budget would be made ""as open to the public as possible"".
A major scandal over defence procurement erupted in February, at the height of the presidential election campaign.
It was alleged that the son of an ally of Mr Poroshenko had facilitated corrupt deals involving Russian military equipment sold to Ukrainian forces at inflated prices.
It prompted then-President Petro Poroshenko - defeated by Mr Zelensky in Sunday's election - to issue a decree ordering reform and transparency in defence procurements.
Mr Aparshyn, a veteran defence ministry bureaucrat, promised criminal investigations into figures suspected of corruption in the defence sector.
He also referred to Ukraine's severe setbacks during the conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the east, notably the losses suffered in Ilovaysk, Debaltseve and Crimea. On that score, he said, ""no one is going to hide anything from anyone"".
""Officials who took decisions or did not act where it was necessary to act will be prosecuted,"" he said."
Sri Lanka attacks: The ban on social media - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Jane Wakefield Technology Reporter,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48022530,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Offline security was also tight in the wake of the bombs at churches and hotels Shortly after the bombings in Sri Lanka, and the spread of inaccurate stories began, the government took the drastic decision to block social media.
To stop the spread of ""false news reports"", Facebook, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and Viber were all banned.
The government has not said when the ban will be lifted.
But it comes at a time when social media firms are battling to rein in the spread of misinformation.
Why was it banned? After more than 300 people died in a series of bombings at churches and hotels on Sunday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asked the population to ""please avoid propagating unverified reports and speculation"".
That plea was followed up with an outright ban on a series of social media sites. The government said the block would be temporary, but remain in place ""until investigations were concluded"".
The shutdown does not appear to affect Twitter, which is not as widely used in the country as other platforms, according to some experts.
The shutdown is not without precedent. Facebook was briefly blocked a year ago in Sri Lanka, after it was accused of allowing posts that incited anti-Muslim violence.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption WhatsApp is widely used in Sri Lanka It is perhaps not surprising that the Sri Lankan government has taken such extreme measures given that the social network Facebook admitted in November that its service had been used to spread violence in Myanmar .
Then in March, it had to race to stop footage from the attacks on mosques in New Zealand being shared.
The killings were live-streamed on Facebook and the video was shared countless times on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, with social media firms playing a frantic game of whack-a-mole to try to contain the spread.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern did not block social media but made no secret of the fact that she held them responsible for the viral spreading of unacceptable content and threatened far stricter regulation.
How to contain the spread of misinformation Christchurch shootings: Race to stop attack footage being shared The country where Facebook posts whipped up hate What we know about the Easter bombings Is the ban a good idea? For some, the ban is an inevitable response to the seeming inability of technology firms to get a grip on the spread of misinformation.
Writing in the New York Times, journalist Kara Swisher, who has previously accused social media firms of ""weaponising civic discourse"" , described the decision as ""a pre-crime move, if you will, and a drastic one, since much critical information in that country flows over these platforms "".
And the topic of the relentless spread of online misinformation and what to do about it was a hot topic at the recent TED conference in Vancouver, where a series of speakers described the internet as being ""broken"" with fake news leading to sometimes fatal real-world consequences.
But others are concerned about the government making snap decisions on stopping the flow of free information online, especially in Sri Lanka, which has a history of controlling the media.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Social media firms are grappling with how to stop spread of misinformation One researcher, Yudhanjaya Wijeratne, told BuzzFeed that it was a complex problem.
""Social media remains a vital force for the democratisation of information, for evading government censorship. This is not to say it is a force entirely for the good. Hate speech spreads, and Facebook has been utterly terrible at countering it here.""
What's the downside? While there is no questioning the fact that social media networks are used to spread misinformation, they are also crucial communication platforms for families desperate to check on relatives.
In a statement, Facebook said: ""People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time.""
WhatsApp is widely used in Sri Lanka - where platforms like Facebook are not just part of the internet but are the internet for many, meaning their only form of communication, perhaps when they need it most, is suddenly cut off.
One family based in the UK told the BBC it had contacted its Sri Lankan-based family via the telephone after finding it difficult to get through to anyone on social media platforms.
Is ban working? Some people are using virtual private networks to circumvent the ban. VPNs can hide someone's location by funnelling data through a server in another country.
According to Netblocks, an organisation which tracks internet outages, one of these - TunnelBear - has also been blocked.
Dr Claire Wardle, an academic who founded First Draft, a non-profit organisation that researches misinformation, told the BBC: ""While it's understandable to want to do something after such a serious event, evidence from the impact of social media shutdowns in other contexts show that they don't have the impact people expect.
""When there aren't strong channels for quality information, this can backfire. In addition, social media can be lifelines for people trying to connect with each other."""
French ex-PM Fillon and British wife face 'fake jobs' trial - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48023180,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Fillon's presidential election campaign was devastated by the allegations surrounding Penelope Fillon's work Two years after French presidential favourite Fran√ßois Fillon became caught up in a public funding scandal, investigating judges have recommended that he and his wife Penelope Fillon should go on trial.
His campaign collapsed when allegations emerged that Mrs Fillon had been paid for years as a parliamentary assistant without having a parliamentary pass.
The Fillons have always insisted she had carried out the work.
A trial could start by the end of 2019.
Who is Fran√ßois Fillon? It was January 2017, and Mr Fillon, the Republicans party candidate, was leading the polls three months ahead of the first round of presidential elections.
A prime minister under Nicolas Sarkozy until 2012, he was a safe pair of hands for the centre right.
But then came a raft of allegations published by satirical weekly Le Canard Enchain√©, surrounding hundreds of thousands of euros paid in wages over several years to Penelope Fillon while she was employed by her husband and then by his successor as MP, Marc Joulaud.
Fillon payment inquiry: What you need to know Fran√ßois Fillon: Candidate devoured by 'fake jobs' affair Mr Fillon's ratings dived as the judiciary announced a full inquiry and he came third in the first round of the election, with 20% of the vote.
What have investigators decided? According to French reports, investigating judge from France's financial prosecution office have called for the Fillons and Mr Joulaud to go to court.
Mr Fillon is cited for alleged misuse of public funds, concealing the misuse and failing to declare it to French authorities, says Le Monde, quoting a 150-page document handed to officials last Friday.
Penelope Fillon is alleged to have concealed the misuse of public funds and Marc Joulaud is also facing accusations of misuse of public funds, it adds.
Mr Fillon's lawyers complained that the news had emerged in French media before their client had himself been told.
""It shows just the sort of spirit in which this entire inquiry has been handled, and we'll react on the substance of it when we've had a chance to look into the document,"" Antonin L√©vy told AFP.
Mrs Fillon's lawyer was also damning of the breach of investigative secrecy. ""Everything about this case is abnormal,"" said Pierre Cornut-Gentille. There was talk of the case beginning by the end of the year, he said, even though such cases usually took at least 12 months to get under way."

Cathay Pacific to crack down on 'pilferage' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48021913,"Image copyright AFP Cathay Pacific has vowed to act after stories emerged of food, drink and other items being stolen from planes.
Items such as mini tubs of Haagen-Dazs ice cream, bottles of champagne and cutlery are said to have gone missing.
Reports said cabin crew were to blame, but the airline's boss, Rupert Hogg, said the blame may lie elsewhere.
""The bigger issue is a pilferage issue and it may not necessarily be around cabin crew,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""We are losing, I don't know, wine or things like that from aircraft or somewhere in the supply chain.""
Mr Hogg added that the airline was determined to put a stop to the losses, and added: ""We've got support from the unions to do this, let's try to stamp this out.""
Cathay Pacific to buy budget airline Hong Kong Express Cathay Pacific sells first-class tickets at economy rates again According to the South China Morning Post, six employees were placed under investigation on Saturday - and face possible disciplinary action - after security spot checks at Hong Kong International Airport.
It added that staff were warned by email earlier in the year about removing items from planes and were told there would be ""zero tolerance"".
The email added that employees could only take items for personal consumption and could be punished for taking anything else - even if they believed it was going to be thrown away or wasted.
In a statement, the airline said: ""In view of an increasing number of reported losses of company property, we have informed our cabin crew that random inspections will be carried out.
""We are dealing with cases in a fair and reasonable manner in accordance with standard internal procedure.""
Cathay Pacific has been in dispute with employees before over petty theft.
In 1993, the leader of a three-week strike by crew who wanted improved conditions was sacked after being accused of stealing nuts and a bottle of water."

When I went into this project for BBC Radio Manchester, I was confident of what to expect. But I was wrong. I mean this in the most respectful way, but being a police officer is not a normal way of earning a living. I've seen them dealing with people at their most vulnerable, and most dangerous. I've been on high-speed chases and police raids. I've spoken to the counter-terrorism officers who investigated threats against Prince George. Over these months, I've seen police officers working under immense pressure with no margin for error, in situations that most of us will never be exposed to. Those officers who do this are not normal. They are brave and sometimes they're heroic. Crisis One of the first jobs I attended was a ""blue light"" emergency response to a hospital in Bolton. A man had taken a knife and was attempting to cut his own face off because he said the voices in his head had told him to do it. Horrified, I stood and watched the officers assess the situation calmly then quickly take control. Over 20 minutes, they talked the man down from crisis and had him ready to receive medical care. I'd never seen anything like it. Image caption Andy Bell joins GMP officers on the beat in Bolton There was no time to process what had happened because the next priority call literally ran straight past us. It was a woman who'd swallowed a load of pills and was refusing treatment. The officers gave chase and again had to delicately reason with her to come back and seek help. In the first hour after joining their shift, I'd seen the police prevent two human beings from dying in front of me. 'Proud' During the quieter moments that followed, as we patrolled Bolton in their van, the officers told me what I'd just seen was not unusual. More and more of their time is being taken up responding to people having mental health crises, they said. Those cases, as well as domestic violence and alcohol-related issues, are what usually confront them while out on the beat. During the early hours of the morning I was able to head home to bed. The police officers I'd been with weren't so fortunate - they had to return to the station to start doing their paperwork. Image copyright Reuters/Andrew Yates Image caption Chief Constable Ian Hopkins with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham at the funeral for one of the victims of the Manchester Arena attack Despite all of this, every officer I met said they loved their job and were proud to be doing it. Later, I spoke to their boss, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins. He was candid about how he sees modern-day policing. Since 2010, he said his force had lost about a quarter of its officers, down to about 6,200, due to central government cuts. A recent increase in council taxes does mean they can recruit an extra 320 officers, however. But the front line is still very stretched, he said, and the pressures - from mental health crises to organised crime and terrorism - are increasing. As a result, Mr Hopkins said about 43% of crimes reported to his force were now being ""screened out"", meaning they are not fully investigated. The police have to prioritise. I don't think anybody likes it - one officer I spoke to called it a ""necessary evil"". Debates about funding are for another forum, and certainly not for me to say. But seeing what officers deal with on a daily basis left me under no doubt whatsoever - that it's a very tough job and one I'm grateful I don't have to do myself.

Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government believed Sunday's attacks could not have been carried out without help from terror groups abroad.
IS claimed the attack on Tuesday, although did not provide evidence.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka's president vowed to ""completely restructure"" state security after the attacks.
In a televised address late on Tuesday, Maithripala Sirisena said he plans to change the heads of defence forces ""within the next 24 hours"".
He also admitted threat reports had not been shared with him, and promised to take ""stern action"" against security officials.
What did the prime minister say? Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ).
But Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks ""could not have been done just locally"".
""There had been training given and a coordination which we are not seeing earlier,"" he said.
What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who are the victims? Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack, all of whom were Sri Lankan nationals. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks.
Mr Wickremesinghe said that only Sri Lankan nationals had been arrested in connection with the attack so far, but that some of the attackers may have travelled abroad before the bombings.
''We, certainly the security apparatus, are of the view there are foreign links and some of the evidence points to that. So if the IS (Islamic State) claimed it, we will be following up on this claim,"" he added.

An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be ""out there"" following the attack.
Who could be behind the attacks? IS said it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"" via its Amaq news outlet.
It provided no evidence for the claim but shared an image on social media of eight men purported to be behind the attack.
The group's last territory fell in March but even then experts had warned it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Authorities have declared a state of emergency Earlier, the country's defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI. He gave no further details.
The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? He also said ""preliminary investigations"" indicated that the bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand , in March.
NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings.
The Sri Lankan government is facing scrutiny after it emerged the authorities were warned of about a possible attack.
Security services had been monitoring the NTJ but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said.
'Targets in line with IS ideology' Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera
The Sri Lankan government has said locals from two known groups carried out the attack. But from the start - because of the scale and sophistication of it - they have also said they thought there was an external role.
In the past, IS has sometimes claimed attacks that it was not involved in or which it simply inspired. But the details from IS would seem to back up the government's assessment.
The choice of targets is much more in line with IS ideology than with the traditional types of communal violence seen in Sri Lanka.
There are still questions - did the local men affiliate themselves to IS or receive direct support? Did they travel to Syria or to other countries? The Sri Lankan government has said it believes some of them had spent time abroad, but how significant was that to the plot?
Answering questions like these will be important not just for Sri Lanka but other countries as they try and understand whether other relatively small, locally focused groups could be capable of transforming a threat into violence on such a massive scale."

Jagmeet Singh, 40, revealed in a new memoir that he suffered the abuse during the 1980s while growing up in Windsor, Ontario.
The Sikh politician also openly addressed the racism and bullying he faced during his childhood.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau praised Mr Singh for his courage in speaking out.
Mr Singh is the first visible minority to lead a major federal party in the country.
In the memoir, Love and Courage, he describes the bullying he faced from other children growing up in the city west of Toronto because of his patka - a child's turban - and long hair.
An excerpt from the book, which was released on Tuesday, was published by the Toronto Star newspaper .
His concerned parents, who knew he was being bullied and was fighting with other children, enrolled him in taekwondo classes.
Mr Singh said the instructor - who he only refers to as Mr N - offered him personal classes at his home dojo. He said his instructor has since died.
The politician does not go into detail of the abuse but says it soon began to feel ""normal"".
""That's the thing about abuse - it can make the victim feel an overwhelming sense of shame, a shame so disabling that one suffers in silence,"" he writes.
""I told no one, and I told myself not to think about what had happened. In a way, I prevented myself from actually accepting the truth.""
Mr Trudeau praised Mr Singh for his ""courage to speak up will fight against stigma, and help so many people know they are not alone"", when the excerpt was published.
In February, Mr Singh won a seat in Canada's House of Commons - a boost for his leadership in the run-up to the federal election scheduled for October.
The New Democratic Party is currently the third place party in Canada's Parliament, with 41 of 338 seats. The left-of-centre party has never held power.
It elected Mr Singh, a former criminal defence attorney and Ontario provincial politician, to lead the federal party in 2017."

"I will name a Golan town after Trump, says Israel's Netanyahu - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48031045,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Netanyahu praises Trump for recognising Israel control of Golan Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says he intends to name a new settlement in the occupied Golan Heights after US President Donald Trump.
Mr Netanyahu said the move would honour Mr Trump's recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan in March.
Israel seized the Golan from Syria in 1967 and annexed the territory in 1981. The move has not been recognised internationally.
Syria said Mr Trump's decision was ""a blatant attack on its sovereignty"".
Mr Netanyahu, who has secured a fifth term in office in the recent Israeli elections, has been on a trip to the region with his family for the week-long Passover holiday.
""All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognise Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
""I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J Trump"", he said in a video message .
For decades, Washington did not recognise Israel's sovereignty over the Golan, but Mr Trump announced his plan to overturn US policy in a tweet on 21 March .
What are the Golan Heights? The region is located about 60km (40 miles) south-west of the Syrian capital, Damascus, and covers about 1,200 sq km (400 sq miles).
Israel seized most of the Golan Heights from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Middle East war, and thwarted a Syrian attempt to retake the region during the 1973 war.
The two countries agreed a disengagement plan the following year that involved the creation of a 70km-long (44-mile) demilitarised zone patrolled by a United Nations observer force. But they remained technically in a state of war.
In 1981, Israel's parliament passed legislation applying Israeli ""law, jurisdiction, and administration"" to the Golan, in effect annexing the territory. But the international community did not recognise the move and maintained that the Golan was occupied Syrian territory. UN Security Council Resolution 497 declared the Israeli decision ""null and void and without international legal effect"" .
Three years ago, when former US President Barack Obama was in office, the US voted in favour of a Security Council statement expressing deep concern that Mr Netanyahu had declared Israel would never relinquish the Golan .
Syria has always insisted that it will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan. The last US-brokered direct peace talks broke down in 2000, while Turkey mediated in indirect talks in 2008.
There are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, which are home to an estimated 20,000 people. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. The settlers live alongside some 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze Arabs, who did not flee when the Golan was captured."
Trump backs Harley Davidson on EU trade tariffs - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48031660," Donald Trump has vowed to reciprocate against ""unfair"" European Union trade duties on Harley Davidson motorbikes.
The US President had previously criticised the US bike maker for its plans to shift American production overseas to avoid EU tariffs.
But on Tuesday, after Harley blamed the 31% duties for a large drop in profits, Mr Trump appeared to back the firm.
Responding to comments on Fox Business on Twitter, he said the duties were ""so unfair"", adding: ""We will Reciprocate!""
The broadside comes ahead of talks aimed at calming trade tensions between the EU and the US.
Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúHarley Davidson has struggled with Tariffs with the EU, currently paying 31%.

‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019 Report End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump
Last June, the EU imposed tariffs on a raft of US-made goods in retaliation for duties the White House had placed on imported steel and aluminium.
It meant tariffs on Harleys climbed from 6% to 31%, and they are set to rise further in 2021.
On Tuesday, the US firm said that various trade spats between the US and its partners would cost it between $100m (¬£77m) and $120m in 2019.
This was partly because of Chinese tariffs, which have increased to 55% as a result of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.
Trump backs Harley-Davidson boycott Harley to make more bikes outside the US But the firm said ""the big impact"" would be from the EU duties, adding they had also contributed to a 27% fall in profits to $127.9m in the first quarter.
Analysts say the company's trade worries compound years of fading interest in the brand, whose heyday was in 1960s and 70s.
President Trump and the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed last year that they wanted to reduce trade barriers.
And earlier in April the EU approved plans for formal trade talks with the US.
But earlier this year news reports suggested that the US was considering new tariffs on EU imported vehicles.
Mr Juncker later said Mr Trump had assured him there were no plans to do this ""for the time being"", but vowed an immediate response if the tariffs went ahead."

Kim Jong-un heads to Russia for Vladimir Putin summit - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48032592,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrives in Vladivostok ahead of Putin summit North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has arrived in the far east of Russia for a summit with President Vladimir Putin.
Mr Kim arrived by train in the Pacific Coast city of Vladivostok for his first talks with the Russian president, which are expected to start on Thursday.
He was welcomed by officials with a traditional offering of bread and salt.
Russia says they will discuss the Korean peninsula's ""nuclear problem"" but Mr Kim is also said to be seeking support after talks with the US failed.
US President Donald Trump and Mr Kim met in Hanoi earlier this year to discuss North Korea's nuclear weapons programme but the summit - their second - ended without agreement.
What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? The North Korean leader greeted Russian officials warmly on his arrival in Vladivostok.
After tasting traditional korovai bread and salt, Mr Kim was entertained by a brass band before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed.

""I hope that during the talks with respected President Putin, I will be able to discuss in a concrete manner issues relating to the settlement of the situation on the Korean peninsula, and to the development of our bilateral relations.""
What do we know about the summit? It is due to take place on Thursday afternoon at about 13:00 (03:00 GMT) on Russky island, just off Vladivostok, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov was Quote: d as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency.
Russian and North Korean national flags are already in place on the island, where the leaders are expected to meet on a university campus.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Kim travelled on his armoured train Mr Putin was expected to arrive for the summit later.
According to his spokesman, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US.
""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters.
""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas.""
What do both sides want? This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of nuclear talks with the US earlier this year, the BBC's Laura Bicker says.
The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit in February.
Earlier this month North Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks , accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him.
The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, our correspondent adds.

Analysts believe this summit is a chance for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula.
President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined.
Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state.
Senior officials say the Kremlin is hoping to see a reduction in tensions on the peninsula.
Mr Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said the situation there had ""stabilised somewhat"" in recent months.
""Russia intends to help in any way possible to cement that positive trend,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.
A South Korean foreign ministry spokesman said Russia ""shares our viewpoints"" on denuclearisation and peace on the peninsula.
Nuclear activity seems to be continuing in North Korea, and the country said it had tested a new ""tactical guided weapon"" - thought to be a short-range missile - earlier in April.
How close are Russia and North Korea? During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons.
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally.
Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture.
While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers."
Jailed French executive who felt force of US bribery law - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Henri Astier Bbc News,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47765974,"Image copyright Brigitte Baudresson Image caption Pierucci's five-year ordeal is a cautionary tale for globe-trotting executives In April 2013, as Fr√©d√©ric Pierucci stepped off a plane at New York's JFK airport during a routine business trip, he was seized and handcuffed by uniformed men.
The 45-year-old executive for Alstom, a French energy and transport group, was then driven to the FBI building in Manhattan, where the reason for his arrest became clear.
In 2003-4, a federal prosecutor explained, Pierucci had authorised bribes to Indonesian officials to secure a contract for boilers at a power plant.
This was true. At the time, he was working for an Alstom subsidiary in Connecticut. Bribery was common practice at the company then.
Risky business Pierucci had assumed he was safe from prosecution because he had not arranged the Indonesian kickbacks, only signed off on them. And since then, Alstom had assured the US justice department that it was cleaning up its act.
But, as Pierucci discovered, the department had been gathering evidence against him on charges including wire fraud and money laundering .
He did not know about them because the indictment had remained sealed - as it was for Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive who was arrested in Canada last year and denies US allegations that she helped evade sanctions on Iran.
Pierucci was to spend more than five years in the clutches of the American justice system. His story illustrates the risks faced by foreign businessmen who - sometimes unbeknownst to them - are accused of breaching US law.
Image copyright Google Image caption The bribes were in connection with the Tarahan power plant on Sumatra island, which was completed in 2007 The US government has long been dead serious about corruption. In 1977 it approved the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the world's first ban on bribing foreign officials. Elsewhere, companies continued to get away with it for decades. In the 2000s, however, spurred by a campaign by the OECD, other developed nations began to clamp down.
Co-operation from foreign law-enforcement agencies helped the US government export its anti-corruption drive. Alstom is a case in point. The justice department pursued the company after Italian, Swiss and British prosecutors had exposed the company's global bribery scheme.
American investigators have their own way of pursuing white-collar crime. Instead of launching raids on company offices, they start by asking for co-operation. The request is polite but the underlying message brutal: help us incriminate yourself and we will not come down as hard as we might otherwise.
Prison rules When Alstom was first approached in this way in 2011, its then-chief lawyer Fred Einbinder understood the need for coming clean. ""When you get a subpoena, it's not like you've got a choice,"" he tells the BBC.
But his advice to co-operate was ignored. Later that year, Einbinder was let go.
Image copyright Reuters The prosecutor offered his quarry a deal: Pierucci could be released if he agreed to act as a secret FBI informant within Alstom. He declined the offer.
The next day, Pierucci was denied bail and transferred to the Wyatt Detention Facility, a high-security prison in Rhode Island.
He had to adjust quickly to living alongside hardened criminals. ""You must not look fellow inmates in the eye. You must not touch or even brush past them. Any perceived slight can turn into a fight,"" Pierucci told the BBC in a recent interview. A 70-year old man was raped by a drugged-up youth in a nearby cell, he says.
Detention conditions were not Pierucci's only, or even main, concern. He had no idea how long he would stay inside. The Connecticut-based lawyer appointed and paid by Alstom to defend him said his best hope for release was to plead guilty in a deal with prosecutors.
' Monumental error '
The advice may have been sound, but there was a problem. Pierucci wanted to argue that he was far down the chain of command. However he soon realised that the Alstom management would never go along with a line of defence that implicated them.
""At first I was happy that Alstom took charge of my defence - it was only later that I saw it had been a monumental error,"" Pierucci says.
As months went by, the news got worse. Three other Alstom executives were arrested on bribery charges. If one of them struck a plea deal first, Pierucci's own bargaining position would be undermined. He was in a race with the other defendants to satisfy the prosecutors.
Image copyright Google Unsure about the next step, Pierucci turned to his cellmates for legal advice. Jacky, a veteran of the French Connection drug ring who had 36 years' experience of the US penal system, warned him against accepting an ""open plea"", where defendants sign away their presumed innocence without any guarantee on a sentence.
What Pierucci wanted, Jacky said, was a ""binding plea"" that commits prosecutors to a specific jail term. When he relayed this request to his lawyer, he was told - correctly - that open pleas were the only option in Connecticut.
But the lawyer thought he had a gentleman's agreement with the prosecutor on a six-month sentence: if Pierucci admitted sole guilt, he could expect to be free by October. The alternative was to go to trial and risk up to 125 years in jail.
The pressure he was experiencing was far from unique. Thanks to mandatory sentences, US prosecutors wield huge powers. One of Pierucci's fellow detainees, who had been caught with drugs but had no previous convictions, hanged himself in his cell after being offered 15 years as an opening bid.
Fired In July 2013, hoping for release within months, Pierucci bowed to the inevitable and pleaded guilty. The plea deal, however, brought little relief.
Now that Pierucci was a convicted criminal, Alstom cut him loose. His absence, the dismissal letter read, ""imperils the operation of the entity which you lead"" and makes it impossible ""to maintain our contractual relation"". In addition, it noted, his misdeeds ""run counter to the values and the ethics of the group"".
Besides being apparently fired for not turning up for work while in jail, Pierucci found it a bit rich to be lectured about integrity by a firm that had engaged in corruption in many countries and been blacklisted over these practices by the World Bank.
But he recognises that the company had little choice. It made sense for Pierucci's bosses to blame him as much as they could.
 Image caption As Alstom boss, Patrick Kron (right) was close to then-President Nicolas Sarkozy Meanwhile Pierucci's detention showed no sign of ending. October came and went. Six months turned into a year, without any news on sentencing. In a book on the case, Le Pi√®ge am√©ricain (the American trap), he compares his ordeal to being stuck in ""an endless tunnel with slippery walls - nothing to hold on to.""
In June 2014, Pierucci was released after friends put up their homes as bond and later that year went home to Paris. But he was yet to be sentenced, and the possibility of more jail time still hung over him.
The uncertainty lasted another three years. In September 2017 Pierucci flew back to Connecticut for sentencing. The judge gave him 30 months.
He did not become a free man until late 2018, when he walked out of the Pittsburgh prison where he had served the second half of his sentence.
Paranoia ?
Pierucci believes he was a pawn in three larger battles with global economic and political ramifications.
The first is the fight between the US justice department and Alstom, which resulted in total surrender by the French company.
In late 2014, it admitted having paid $75m bribes over a decade, in a scheme described by prosecutors as ""astounding in its breadth, its brazenness and its worldwide consequences"". Alstom settled the case for $770m (¬£580m; ‚Ç¨670m) - the largest-ever FCPA fine imposed by the department.
The arrests of Pierucci and other managers were crucial in breaking Alstom's resistance. As then-Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said: ""It was only after the department publicly charged several Alstom executives - three years after the investigation began - that the company finally co-operated.""
The second battle that Pierucci believes influenced his fate was the purchase of most of Alstom by its US rival General Electric (GE).
 Image caption Under CEO Jeffrey Immelt, GE made several mega deals, including GE's acquisition of Alstom's power business The business saga and the legal cases unfolded in lockstep. Alstom boss Patrick Kron announced plans to sell the power business - 75% of the company - in mid-2014, when it was clear that the company was in the justice department's crosshairs.
Shareholders approved the sale to GE that December. Three days later, the settlement in the bribery case took Alstom's top brass off the hook.
Pierucci is among many in France who claim that the justice department was helping GE by keeping the pressure on Alstom until the sale was complete. According to a French parliamentary report published last year, the threat of a huge fine ""undoubtedly... precipitated Mr Kron's decision"".
Kron has always vehemently denied the allegation. ""We absolutely did not make this transaction in response to any direct pressure on myself or anyone else,"" he told MPs. Alstom's power operations, he insists, were sold for the best business reasons. Indeed the purchase is widely seen as a costly mistake by GE, and in 2017 its CEO admitted as much.
The US justice department's anti-corruption chief, Daniel Kahn, also rejects any suggestion of collusion. ""We certainly didn't force Alstom to plead guilty in order to help out GE. That never entered into consideration,"" he told the BBC.
 Image caption Since the sale to GE, Alstom and its boss Henri Poupart-Lafarge have refocused on its transport business Neither is the timing necessarily suspicious. The justice department could have taken the sale into account in its settlement with Alstom simply because of GE's strong anti-corruption record. ""In general, we don't want to discourage companies with strong compliance programs from acquiring companies with weaker ones,"" Kahn says.
Andrew Spalding, who teaches anti-corruption law at the University of Richmond, Virginia, notes that for any conspiracy between prosecutors and GE to work, it would also have to involve America's independent judiciary. ""That's paranoia,"" he says.
Power games The third battle Pierucci is convinced he was dragged into is the biggest of all. It is nothing less than a struggle for worldwide supremacy.
In the subtitle of his book, he describes himself as a ""hostage in the greatest campaign of economic destabilisation"". He is not alone in believing America is seeking to weaken foreign companies. This is the way most French analysts and many politicians have described the various Alstom sagas over the years.
Pierre Laporte, a former GE lawyer who now works as Pierucci's partner, notes that 70% of firms targeted for US anti-bribery action are foreign - notably European. The FCPA and other laws that apply beyond US borders, Laporte says, are ""tools of economic domination"".
Such suspicions may sound overblown, but they reflect serious concerns in France. Alstom, whose turbines power the country's nuclear stations and submarines, is regarded as a strategic asset. Many worry that if a serious diplomatic spat arose with the US, as was the case during the Iraq war, French sovereignty could be undermined.
 Image caption A US company now makes the turbines that power French nuclear submarines America's judicial expansionism is a matter of concern for many countries whose companies are being pursued for doing business with Iran and other states targeted by American sanctions.
Since his return to Paris, however, Pierucci has focused on the narrow issue of the fight against corruption rather than geopolitical power games.
He and Laporte have set up a consultancy to help companies stay on the right side of anti-bribery prosecutors.
There is a big demand for Pierucci's expertise. In 2016, France belatedly passed tough anti-corruption legislation and is enforcing it. The US justice department's Daniel Kahn says he has a ""very strong relationship"" with his French counterparts - this recently resulted in a successful joint action against French bank Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale over bribes in Libya .
""Once you identify possible violations, you can put safeguards in place,"" Pierucci says. He tells his clients to be particularly vigilant about hidden practices by overseas partners or consultants that may put them at risk.
Danger can lurk in unexpected places. In 2017 a retired Siemens manager was arrested while on holiday in Croatia and extradited to the US, where he was eventually convicted over bribes paid by the German group in Argentina in the 1990s .
As the reach of US legislation expands, foreign executives who fight the law may well find that the law wins."
"Why is a 2,500-year-old epic dominating polls in modern India? - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47944411," Many Hindus see the Ramayana's protagonist, Ram, as a hero With the Indian general election under way, the Ramayana, a 2,500-year-old Hindu mythological epic, is back in the spotlight. The BBC's religious affairs reporter Priyanka Pathak explains why.
This year, like in previous elections, the conversation among many hardline Hindus has returned to the epic Ramayana and its protagonist, Ram.
A longstanding demand to construct a temple in the northern city of Ayodhya - a key point of tension between Hindus and Muslims - which Hindus believe is Ram's birthplace, has become louder in recent months.
Hardline Hindus want the temple built on the same spot where a 16th Century mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. They believe the Babri mosque was built after the destruction of a Hindu temple by a Muslim invader.
India's Ayodhya site: Masses gather as Hindu-Muslim dispute simmers
The governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised, once again, to reconstruct the Ram Mandir (temple) in its election manifesto.
Like in previous elections, they hope that this pledge will draw in more Hindu voters. They also organised Hindu religious festivals on a grand scale in the lead-up to the polls.
On 12 April, a large gathering of right-wing organisations was held at the iconic Ram Lila Maidan, a sprawling ground named after the god in the centre of the capital, Delhi, to celebrate ""Ram's birthday"".
People dressed in saffron robes wielded swords as they chanted ""Jai Shree Ram"", which translates from the Hindi to ""Hail Lord Ram"". They shouted slogans, reiterating their promise to Ram that they would reconstruct the temple.
What is the story of the Ramayana? Image copyright Heritage Images/Getty The epic tells the story of Ram, a beloved prince who is unaware of his own divinity On the eve of his coronation, he is banished from his kingdom for 14 years by his father at the behest of his stepmother With his wife, Sita, and brother, Lakshman, he wanders through India's forests - until the 10-headed demon king Ravana abducts Sita Ram then fights and defeats Ravana to rescue Sita after which he establishes a just kingdom The story of Ram's pursuit of righteousness has made him a symbol of self-sacrifice and heroism for many Hindus He is why this epic remains potent and has dominated India's political discourse Experts believe that the movement to build the temple, spearheaded by a powerful Hindu nationalist organisation called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has helped craft some sort of a collective Hindu identity in India.
This idea is something that the RSS, the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, has cultivated since the early 20th Century.
However, the movement found its zeitgeist moment only a century later.
 People in Ahmedabad city sitting along the road and watching a television series on the Ramayana Several things happened almost concurrently during the late 1980s. First, a television show on the epic reminded 80 million viewers of the story and rekindled a love for its hero.
The serial broadcast a standardised story of the Ramayana, pulled together from many versions and variants. There is no official version of this sprawling epic although historical scholars consider the version by Valmiki, a sage and Sanskrit poet, to be the most authentic.
But really there are as many as 3,000 retellings of the story in around 22 languages, including some that eulogise Ravana while others say it was actually Ram's brother Lakshman who killed the demon king.
India votes 2019 Narendra Modi: The man who wants 900m votes A really simple guide to India‚Äôs general election The Bollywood factor in India's election But what the television show did was give India a single narrative of the Ramayana. It also gave a single religion to a country ""that was diverse and plural and included many different ways to be Indian"", says Arshia Sattar, a doctorate in south Asian languages, who has translated Valmiki's Ramayana from Sanskrit into English.
The second big moment came in the late 1980s, when the Congress party led by Rajiv Gandhi - which has always styled itself as secular - decided to lay the foundation stone of the temple in Ayodhya with the help of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a right-wing outfit, to woo Hindu votes in a close election.
The plan didn't work - instead, it paved the way for the BJP, still a young party at the time, to seize what they saw as an opportunity to galvanise Hindu voters.
In September 1989, the party's then president LK Advani launched a nationwide march for the temple. Bricks began to move from around India for the construction of the temple. The campaign was successful in mobilising communal sentiments and set in motion a series of events that would result in the demolition of the mosque. This, in turn, triggered nationwide riots.
 Hindu activists are demanding the construction of the Ram Temple But in the next elections, the BJP swept the polls. From that moment forward, the party - which was 12 years old at the time - became a national heavyweight.
It took its place as either the party leading the ruling government alliance or as the leading opposition party. For the BJP, the Ayodhya issue became a way to consolidate Hindu votes - something that used to be fragmented along caste lines.
This now well-known version of the epic, championing Ram, also became a convenient point for other Hindu organisations to rally around. This meant that other versions of the epic began to be stamped out.
India's Ayodhya site: Masses gather as Hindu-Muslim dispute simmers Q&A: The Ayodhya dispute Thousands rally in Delhi over disputed religious site For instance, in 2011, a Hindu nationalist student union and other affiliated right-wing groups succeeded in forcing Delhi University to drop an essay by the late poet and Ramayana scholar AK Ramanujan, which questioned how many versions of the epic existed, from its history curriculum.
""This may have been part of the general climate of intolerance and the battle over who had the right to tell the country's history and its myths that was part of the Indian landscape between the 1980s and the 2000s,"" literary critic and author Nilanjana Roy wrote of the incident in her blog in 2011.
 Ram fights and defeats the ten-headed demon Ravana in the Hindu epic But for hardline Hindus, the cultural loss of other versions is simply collateral damage.
They believe that a sort of Hindu renaissance can be built around the epic, allowing Hindus to band together and revive their religion as a way of life that they believe was lost and can be re-established.
For instance, in September 2017, the Uttarakhand state minister for alternative medicine, proposed spending $3.6m (¬£2.8m) to find Sanjeevani - a mythical, glow-in-the-dark herb, described in the epic as having saved Ram and Lakshman from certain death.
The deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has also suggested that science was so advanced during the time of the Ramayana that Sita was actually a test-tube baby. And the vice chancellor of an Indian university has claimed that Ravana, had a fleet of airplanes.
A series of such examples from Indian politicians and scholars can be seen as an attempt to bolster pride in the mythological epic. But they also evoke a nostalgia for a grand past, reawakening hope for a future that repeats the great feats of distance ancestors."
NFL Draft 2019: The colourful and controversial Combine questions faced by prospects - BBC Sport,www.bbc.com,Mike Henson Bbc Sport,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/47818230,"Justin Lane, Rock Ya-sin, Will Harris and Greedy Williams go through a physical workout at this year's Combine You are in a hotel, the blandly luxurious type that specialises in draining corporate expense accounts.
Fresh out of university, you are here for a job interview.
It's a dream gig, with a wage far beyond those chased by your student peers, regular travel and a sprinkling of stardust.
There is a knot of nerves in your stomach. Rival candidates, primped and prepped, sit alongside.
You are called into a small meeting room. Four faces look up to greet you.
""If you were a fruit, what kind of fruit would you be?""
""Are you afraid of clowns?""
""How long can you stare without blinking?""
""Do you have both your testicles?""
""Is your mother a prostitute?""
""Are you gay?""
This is the NFL Combine - where the top college American football players prove themselves to NFL teams before being drafted into some of the richest locker rooms in sport.
Up to 335 young men attend the event in Indianapolis every February. Each goes through a medical and a battery of physical tests. NFL officials record their 40-yard dash time, the number of reps they manage on a 225lb (102kg) bench press and their furthest leaps, both vertical and horizontal.
There is also a verbal reasoning-style written examination - the Wonderlic - to assess players' cognitive ability.
It might ask, for instance, how many handshakes occur at a meeting of five people where each shakes every other person's hand once.
But the questions in the interview section, in which coaching staff from the NFL's 32 teams quiz prospects on playbooks and personal lives, can be the most puzzling.
""On interview night you have got these big function rooms and a load of tables. It is like speed dating, people moving across every 15 minutes,"" the Manchester-born offensive tackle tells BBC Sport.
""Some teams were in separate rooms.
""You would walk into some and the general manager would just ask you questions while the assistant general manager, the head coach and the defence or offensive coordinator would be quiet.
""In others everyone would be talking and you would be getting it from all angles.
""I went into a room and Tom Cable, now the Raiders offensive line coach but at the time at Seattle, was pushing my buttons.
""It was not abrasive or about family, but he kept asking weird antagonising questions.
""I got frustrated, showed some anger and he said 'oh I like that'.
""You are in a job interview and your boss is trying to wind you up before he is your boss. He actually gets you wound up and then enjoys it. It was then I realised this is going to be a weird experience.""
In the wake of each Combine, tales of the weirdness seep out.
Some are quirky. In between talking through plays on a whiteboard, players might get pitched curveballs about what animal they see themselves as, the benefits of boxers and briefs or how many different ways they could use a brick in a minute.
Others cross lines not even approached in conventional job interviews.
At 2018's Combine Derrius Guice, now a Washington Redskins running back, claimed a team asked him about his sexuality. Two years previously, an Atlanta Falcons coach apologised for asking Eli Apple, now a New Orleans Saints cornerback, if he was gay.
This year, Texas cornerback Kris Boyd says he was asked to account for his testicles. In 2016, Obum Gwacham was asked when he lost his virginity. In 2010, Dez Bryant was asked whether his mother was a prostitute on a visit to the Miami Dolphins facility.
DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the players' union, called for any team asking questions about a player's sexuality to be banned from the Combine. The NFL has emphasised that such inquiries are contrary to its workplace policies.
However, given that breaking Combine omerta is the type of behaviour to dent your draft stock, it is fair to guess numerous similar instances have gone unreported.
So, why do teams do it?
Neil Stratton runs Inside the League, which tracks the draft process and advises players on what awaits them at Combine.
""Some teams are pretty adversarial in their approach,"" he tells BBC Sport.
""They want to make a player feel uncomfortable because so many players have been through training and are able to homogenise their responses, talking without saying much.
""They hope, by getting under a player's skin, to get him to say something more revealing."" Media playback is not supported on this device Menelik Watson's NFL trial
Before arriving at the Combine, the teams will have already done a fair bit of digging into their draft targets' pasts.
Colleges employ pro liaison coaches who field teams' enquiries into how players conduct themselves off the pitch, while each NFL team will also have a network of insiders to lean on.
Some employ specialists from outside football. Brian Decker used to select soldiers for the US Army's Special Forces, but now weighs up the character of potential players as the Indianapolis Colts' director of player development.
For some teams, the side-swiping shock of an unexpectedly personal question is a final way to get behind a facade and find out if their multi-million dollar investment will wilt under pressure.
""These teams are specialists in chasing information that the players don't want them to have,"" adds Stratton.
""Generally there are very few questions they can ask that they don't already know the answer to.
""But there are still personnel on the ground who will try and gain an extra insight or advantage by hook or by crook.""
The emphasis on upright, unflappable locker-room citizens seems odd when you consider history.
Teams have regularly thrived in spite of - often because of - some questionable characters.
The Dallas Cowboys won three Super Bowls in four years in the mid-nineties. Only afterwards did it emerge that the playing squad was a noxious mix of ego, rivalry, addiction and scandal.
The Patriots, who have won three of the last five, have almost made it policy to pick up players rejected by other teams for off-field issues.
Might there be another reason for such emphasis on character?
NFL players recently found themselves on the front of America's ongoing culture war, when President Trump and some of the leagues' owners lined up against their right to protest against discrimination during the national anthem.
In 2011, once again, the players were collectively pitted against their employers, locked out of training facilities and barred from communicating with their coaches for weeks as a dispute over pay escalated to industrial action.
Watson says that the Combine itself fosters a similar 'us and them' mentality - ""it is definitely not a rivalry, you share tips, give each other heads up about the sort of interviews you might have"" - among draftees.
Could those questions be a covert test of how new recruits react to authority, confrontation and conflict? Will they toe the line or take a knee?
Not for Watson. He believes the interview is a justifiable way to predict how a player fits into a delicate locker-room ecosystem and stand up to the rigours of the league.
""Some teams' superstars might be big personality guys, character guys, out-going guys that you have to work with,"" he says.
""Maybe you have an offensive line group who are mature, older guys with families and the teams want to see if you could fit in with that group or if you are a young brash guy who likes to go out and party.
""They have to know what they are getting.

BBC - Future - Can you survive if you run out of air?,www.bbc.com,Richard Gray,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190423-the-man-who-ran-out-of-air-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean,"Oceans Can you survive if you run out of air? Science tells us the human body can only survive for a few minutes without oxygen. But some people are defying this accepted truth. By Richard Gray 23 April 2019
There was a sickening crack when the thick cable connecting Chris Lemons to the ship above him snapped. This vital umbilical cord to the world above carried power, communications, heat and air to his diving suit 100m (328ft) below the surface of the sea. Worst Case Scenario
This article is part of a new BBC Future column called Worst Case Scenario , which looks at the extremes of the human experience and the remarkable resilience people display in the face of adversity.
It aims to look at ways people have coped when the worst happens and what lessons we can learn from their experiences.
While his colleagues remember the terrible noise of this lifeline breaking, Lemons himself heard nothing. One moment he was jammed against the metal underwater structure they had been working on and then he was tumbling backwards towards the ocean floor. His link to the ship above was gone, along with any hope of finding his way back to it.
Most crucially, his air supply had also vanished, leaving him with just six or seven minutes of emergency air supply. Over the next 30 minutes at the bottom of the North Sea, Lemons would experience something that few people have lived to talk about: he ran out of air.

‚Ä¢ The attack that made me a maths genius
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I had a full handle on what was happening,‚Äù recalls Lemons. ‚ÄúI hit the sea bed on my back and was surrounded by an all-encompassing darkness. I knew I had a very small amount of gas on my back and my chances of getting out of it were almost non-existent. A kind of resignation came over me. I remember being taken over by grief in some ways.‚Äù View image of Chris Lemons in his diving gear (Credit: Chris Lemons)
Lemons had been part of a saturation dive team fixing piping on an oil well manifold at the Huntington Oil Field, around 127miles (204km) east of Aberdeen on the east coast of Scotland. To do this work, divers must spend a month living, sleeping and eating in specially constructed chambers on board the dive ship, separated from the rest of the crew by a sheet of metal and glass. In these 6m-long tubes, the three divers acclimatise to the pressures they will experience once underwater.
It is an unusual form of isolation. The three divers can talk to and see their crewmates outside the chamber, but they are otherwise cut off from them. The members of each team are entirely reliant upon one another ‚Äì it takes six days of decompression before they can leave this hyperbaric chamber or help can get inside.
A kind of resignation came over me, I remember being taken over by grief in some ways ‚Äì Chris Lemons
‚ÄúIt is a very strange situation,‚Äù says 39-year-old Lemons. ‚ÄúYou are living on the ship surrounded by lots of people who are just a sheath of metal away, but you are completely isolated from them.
‚ÄúIt is quicker to get back from the Moon than it is from the depths of the sea in some ways.‚Äù
Decompression is necessary because nitrogen gas from the air divers breathe while underwater dissolves into their blood stream and tissues when they are at depth. As they come to the surface, the pressure of the surrounding water is lifted and the nitrogen bubbles out. If this happens too quickly, it can cause painful tissue and nerve damage and even lead to death if the bubbles form in the brain ‚Äì a condition commonly known as ‚Äúthe bends‚Äù.

The divers who do this work, however, take the risks in their stride. For Lemons, he was most concerned about spending such a long time away from his fianc√©e Morag Martin and the home they shared on the west coast of Scotland.
The day of 18 September 2012 had started normally enough for Lemons and the two colleagues he was diving with ‚Äì Dave Youasa and Duncan Allcock. The three climbed into the diving bell, which would be lowered from the ship, the Bibby Topaz , to the sea bed where they would carry out their repair work.
‚ÄúIn many ways, it was just an ordinary day at the office,‚Äù says Lemons. While not as experienced as the other two men, he had been a diver for eight years and had been saturation diving for a year and a half, taking part in nine deep-water dives. ‚ÄúThe sea was a little rough on the surface, but it was pretty clear underwater.‚Äù View image of A saturation diver on the sea bed (Credit: Dogwoof)
That rough sea, however, would trigger a chain of events that almost claimed Lemons‚Äôs life. Normally dive vessels use computer-controlled navigation and propulsion systems ‚Äì known as dynamic positioning ‚Äì to keep them over the dive site while they have people in the water.
As Lemons and Youasa began repairing the piping underwater, with Allcock supervising them from the bell, the Bibby Topaz‚Äôs dynamic positioning system suddenly failed. The ship rapidly began drifting off course.
On the sea floor, alarms sounded on the divers‚Äô communications system. Lemons and Youasa were instructed to get back to the bell. But as they began following their umbilical cords, the ship had already drifted back over the tall metal structure they had been working on, meaning they had to climb over it.
We had this strange moment where we were looking into each other‚Äôs eyes ‚Äì Chris Lemons
When they neared the top, however, Lemons‚Äôs umbilical became snagged on a piece of metal sticking out of the structure. Before he could free it, the drifting ship pulled it tight, dragging him into the metal beams.
‚ÄúDave realised something was wrong and turned to come back to me,‚Äù says Lemons, whose story has been turned into a feature length documentary Last Breath . ‚ÄúWe had this strange moment where we were looking into each other‚Äôs eyes. He was desperately flailing to get to me, but the boat was pulling him away. Before I knew it, I didn‚Äôt have any gas because the cable was stretched so tight.‚Äù View image of An ROV image of Chris Lemons on the sea bottom (Credit: Floating Harbour)
The strain on the cable must have been immense. Composed of a tangle of hoses and electrical wires with a rope running through the middle, it creaked as the drifting boat pulled it tighter and tighter. Lemons instinctively turned the knob on his helmet to start the flow of gas from the emergency tank on his back. But before he could do anything else, the cable snapped, sending him tumbling back to the sea bed.
Miraculously, in the pitch darkness, Lemons managed to pull himself upright and feel his way back to the well structure, climbing it again to the top in the hope of seeing the bell and getting back to safety.
Without oxygen, the human body can only survive for a few minutes before the biological processes that power its cells begin to fail
‚ÄúWhen I got there, the bell was nowhere to be seen,‚Äù says Lemons. ‚ÄúI took a measured decision to calm down and conserve what little gas I had left. I only had about six to seven minutes of emergency gas on my back. I didn‚Äôt expect to be rescued, so I just curled up into a ball.‚Äù
Without oxygen, the human body can only survive for a few minutes before the biological processes that power its cells begin to fail. The electrical signals that power the neurons in the brain decrease and eventually stop altogether .
‚ÄúLoss of oxygen is right at the very sharp end of survival,‚Äù says Mike Tipton, head of the extreme environments laboratory at Portsmouth University in the UK. ‚ÄúThe human body doesn‚Äôt have a great store of oxygen ‚Äì maybe a couple of litres. How you use that up depends on your metabolic rate.‚Äù
An adult at rest will typically use between a fifth and a quarter of a litre of oxygen every minute . This can rise to four litres every minute if they are exercising hard.
‚ÄúIf someone is stressed or panicked, then this can raise their metabolic rate too,‚Äù adds Tipton, who has studied people who have survived for long periods without air underwater.
They watched helplessly as Lemons‚Äôs movements gradually stopped, his life fading away
Back on board the Bibby Topaz, the crew desperately tried to manually navigate back into position to save their lost colleague. As they drifted further away, they launched a remote-controlled submarine in the hope of finding him.
When it did, they watched helplessly on its cameras as Lemons‚Äôs movements gradually stopped, his life fading away.
‚ÄúI can remember pulling the last bits of air from the tank on my back,‚Äù says Lemons. ‚ÄúIt takes more effort to suck the gas down. It felt a bit like the moments before you fall asleep. It wasn‚Äôt unpleasant, but I can remember feeling angry and apologising a lot to my fianc√©e Morag. I was angry about the damage this was going to do to other people. Then there was nothing.‚Äù View image of Chris Lemons on the sea bed (Credit: Dogwoof)
It took around 30 minutes before the crew of the Bibby Topaz were able to regain control and restart the failed dynamic positioning system. When Youasa reached Lemons on top of the underwater structure, his body was still.
Through sheer will, Youasa dragged his fallen colleague back to the bell and passed him up to Allcock. When they removed his helmet, Lemons was blue and not breathing. Instinctively, Allcock gave him two breaths of mouth to mouth resuscitation.
Miraculously, Lemons gasped back into consciousness.
Common sense suggests he should have perished after so long at the bottom of the sea
‚ÄúI felt very groggy and there were some flashing lights, but I don‚Äôt have many lucid memories of waking up,‚Äù says Lemons. ‚ÄúI recall Dave sitting crumbled on the other side of the bell looking exhausted and not really knowing why. It was only a few days later that I realised the gravity of the situation.‚Äù
Nearly seven years later, Lemons is still perplexed as to how he managed to survive for so long without oxygen. Common sense suggests he should have perished after so long at the bottom of the sea.
But it seems likely the cold water of the North Sea may have played a role ‚Äìaround 100m (328ft) down, the water was probably below 3C (37F). Without the hot water flowing through the umbilical cord to heat his suit, his body and brain will have quickly cooled. View image of Oxygen masks on a plane (Credit: Alamy)
‚ÄúRapid cooling of the brain can increase survival time without oxygen,‚Äù says Tipton. ‚ÄúIf you reduce the temperature by 10 degrees the metabolic rate drops by a half to a third. If you lower the brain temperature down to 30C (86F), it can increase the survival time from 10 to 20 minutes. If you cool the brain to 20C (68F), you can get an hour.‚Äù
The pressurised gas that saturation divers usually breathe may have given Lemons an additional chance. When breathing high levels of oxygen under pressure, it can dissolve into the blood stream, giving the body additional reserves to draw on.
Going hypoxic
Divers are perhaps the most likely people to experience a sudden loss of their air supply. But there are many other situations where the oxygen supply can be cut off. Firefighters often rely on breathing equipment when entering smoke-choked buildings, while high-altitude fighter jet pilots also use breathing masks.
At the less extreme end, a lack of oxygen ‚Äì known as hypoxia ‚Äì can affect many other people. Mountain climbers experience low levels of oxygen when they are on high mountains, a condition which often has been blamed for accidents. When levels of oxygen drop, brain function can suffer, leading to poor decisions and confusion. View image of Diver being filmed trying to find his way in the dark (Credit: Dogwoof)
Patients undergoing surgery will also often undergo mild hypoxia , which is thought to impact their recovery . Strokes are also caused by a patient‚Äôs brain being starved of oxygen, leading to cell death and damage that can have lasting effects on their lives.
‚ÄúThere are a lot of diseases where the final stage is hypoxia,‚Äù says Tipton. ‚ÄúOne of the things that happens is that people who are hypoxic start to lose their peripheral vision and they end up looking at a point. It is thought to be the reason why people report seeing a light at the end of the tunnel in near death experiences.‚Äù
Children and women are more likely to survive because they are smaller and their bodies tend to cool much faster ‚Äì Mike Tipton
Lemons himself survived his time without oxygen unscathed. He found only a couple of bruises on his legs after his ordeal.
But his survival is not unheard of either. Tipton has examined 43 separate cases in the medical literature of people who have been submerged in water for long periods . Four of these recovered, including a two-and-a-half-year-old girl who survived being under water for at least 66 minutes .
‚ÄúChildren and women are more likely to survive because they are smaller and their bodies tend to cool much faster,‚Äù says Tipton. View image of A climber on Mount Everest (Credit: Alamy)
The training of saturation divers like Lemons may also be inadvertently teaching their bodies to cope with extreme situations. Researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim have found that saturation divers adapt to the extreme environment they work in by altering the genetic activity of their blood cells .
‚ÄúWe saw a marked change in the genetic programs for oxygen transport,‚Äù says Ingrid Eftedal, head of the barophysiology research group at NTNU. Oxygen is carried around our bodies in haemoglobin, a molecule found in our red blood cells. ‚ÄúWe found the activity of genes at all levels of oxygen transport ‚Äì from haemoglobin to the production and activity of red blood cells is turned down during saturation diving,‚Äù Eftedal adds. View image of A diver's helmet (Credit: Dogwoof)
She and her colleagues believe this might be a response to the high concentrations of oxygen they breathe while underwater. It is possible that the slow-down of oxygen transport in Lemons‚Äôs body allowed it to make the meagre supplies it had last longer.
Exercising before diving has also been shown to help reduce the risk of developing the bends .
Studies of indigenous people who habitually free dive without additional air have also shown just how much the human body can adapt to life without oxygen. The Bajau people in Indonesia can reach depths of up to 70m (230ft) while holding their breath as they hunt for food with spears.
Melissa Ilardo, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Utah, has found that the Bajau have genetically evolved to have spleens that are 50% larger than the their land-dwelling neighbours, the Saluan .
With larger spleens, it is thought the Bajau benefit from a greater injection of oxygenated blood and so can hold their breath for longer
The spleen is thought to play a key role in enabling humans to free dive.
‚ÄúThere is something called the mammalian dive reflex, which in humans is triggered by the combination of holding your breath and submerging yourself in water,‚Äù says Ilardo. ‚ÄúOne of the effects of the dive reflex is contraction of the spleen. The spleen acts as a reservoir for oxygen-rich red blood cells, and when it contracts these red blood cells are pushed into circulation, providing an oxygen boost. It can be thought of as a biological scuba tank.‚Äù View image of Free divers from the Bajau people Credit: Alamy)
With larger spleens, it is thought the Bajau benefit from a greater injection of oxygenated blood and so can hold their breath for longer. One Bajau diver that Ilardo met told her he had spent 13 minutes underwater.
Lemons himself returned to diving about three weeks after his accident ‚Äì at the very spot where it had happened, to finish the job they had started. He has also married Morag and they have a daughter together.
Reflecting on his brush with death and his miraculous survival, he doesn‚Äôt take much credit for his own actions.
‚ÄúOne of the greatest reasons I survived was the quality of the people around me,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn truth, I did very little. It was the professionalism and the heroics of the two in the water with me and everyone on the ship. I was very lucky.‚Äù View image of Chris Lemons and his wife Morag on their wedding day (Credit: Chris Lemons)
His accident has triggered a number of changes in the diving community. They now use emergency tanks that carry 40 minutes of air rather than five. The umbilical cords are now festooned with fairy lights so they can be seen more easily under water.
The changes in his own life have not been so dramatic.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve still got to change the nappies,‚Äù he jokes. But he does find himself thinking about death differently. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it as something to be feared any more. It is more about what you leave behind.‚Äù

US President Donald Trump is making a three-day state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June.
From an inflatable ""Trump baby"" to awkward hand-holding, here's a reminder of his last trip, a working visit, there in July 2018. 23 Apr 2019 "

Wanted: New Bank of England boss - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48035122," The government has launched the recruitment process for a new governor for the Bank of England.
The current governor Mark Carney will step down on 31 January 2020 after more than six years in the post.
For the first time the government has hired a recruitment firm - Sapphire Partners - to help with the search.
The job description has been placed on the public appointments website. The annual salary is ¬£480,000 - unchanged since 2013.
It states that candidates must be able to demonstrate the ability to lead ""a complex and powerful financial institution"".
Interviews will be held over the summer and the appointment will be made by the government in the autumn.
""Finding a candidate with the right skills and experience to lead the Bank of England is vital for ensuring the continuing strength of our economy and for maintaining the UK's position as a leading global financial centre,"" the chancellor said in a statement.
Who is in the running? With the Bank of England governor's job being crucial when it comes to our financial wellbeing, it is likely that approaches to candidates are already being made behind closed doors.
The chancellor has previously speculated that the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit might put off some applicants. But it's still a prime job - with a base salary of ¬£480,000.
There's no shortage of potential internal candidates - such as Bank Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent or Chief Economist Andy Haldane.
Then there's former Deputy Governor Andrew Bailey, and former rate-setter Nemat Shafik.
But the use of a firm of headhunters for the first time implies the chancellor is keen for this to be a wide sweep of talent in what is, after all, the world's financial capital - and he is under pressure to consider more female candidates.
And, as with the incumbent, the search could go beyond our borders.
Raghuram Rajan, a former head of India's central bank, is another name that's been touted. But given the current political situation, the next governor is almost certain not to hail from elsewhere in the EU.
'Advocates for women' On its website, the recruitment firm Sapphire Partners, which been employed to carry out the search describes itself as ""advocates for women in business"", and it is run by five female partners.
Sapphire's appointment could be seen as an attempt to quell criticism over gender diversity.
Last May, the Bank's failure to appoint another woman to its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was described as "" truly staggering "".
Currently the nine-strong MPC - which votes on interest rate decisions each month - has only one female member.
Foreign candidate? The job description also emphases the ability to inspire confidence ""on the international stage"", and experience at a financial institution such as the Bank for International Settlements or the International Monetary Fund.
The preference for international experience suggests the Bank could be looking for a foreign candidate.
Last September, the Treasury confirmed that Mr Carney would extend his term until 2020, saying it would support a ""smooth exit"" from the European Union.
Officially the post is for eight years, but Mr Carney agreed to a five-year term with the option of a further three.
Mr Carney has ""helped steer the UK economy through a challenging period,"" Mr Hammond said.
 Image caption Mark Carney has been governor of the Bank of England for more than six years ""Under Mark's leadership the Bank of England has been at the forefront of reforms to make our financial system safer and more accountable,"" he added.
The Bank of England governor wields immense power in the UK financial system, as they can influence the course of interest rates and also set priorities for the Bank in managing risks to the financial system.
The Bank governor is the chair of the three central committees at the Bank of England:
The Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates The Financial Policy Committee which monitors risks in the financial system The Prudential Regulation Authority which regulates financial firms Last year Mr Carney, who is Canadian, received total pay of ¬£881,574. That included an accommodation allowance of ¬£250,000, which the Bank says reflects the difference in the cost of living in London rather than Ottawa."
Trump tax return deadline missed again - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48034682,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The president has refused to release his tax returns The White House has refused to meet an extended deadline to deliver President Trump's tax returns to Congress.
House Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal had said failure to comply with the 23 April deadline would be interpreted as a denial of request.
Mr Trump says he does not want his information disclosed and will not release his tax returns while under audit.
Democrats have warned that legal action could follow.
""The president is pretty clear: Once he's out of audit, he will think about doing it,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Tuesday.
""He's not inclined to do so at this time.""
The IRS has previously said that he could release the returns even if they were under audit.
Trump lawyer dismisses tax return demand NY to examine Trump tax affairs in 1990s How did Donald Trump make his fortune? Mr Neal had initially given the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) until April 10 to turn over Mr Trump's personal tax returns, and those of several entities connected to the president, for 2013 through to 2018.
The deadline was extended to April 23 after the Trump administration failed to comply.
Most presidents have turned over their tax returns since the 1970s even though it is not required by law.
One of Mr Trump's top aides said this month that the Democrats would ""never"" see his tax returns . Republicans have called the request an overreach of confidential taxpayer data.
The US Treasury Department said it was reviewing Mr Neal's request and consulting with the Justice Department, and that there were ""serious constitutional questions"" related to the request.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has told Mr Neal that the department would make a final decision by 6 May on whether or not to comply.
Democrats have warned that legal action, such as a subpoena of financial data, could follow if the president does not comply, a move that could lead to a lengthy battle in the courts."
Sri Lanka attacks: Bomber 'studied in UK and Australia' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48035043,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Volunteers provide water, food and support to those mourning the bombing One of the attackers behind the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka once studied in the UK, officials say, as further details on the bombers emerge.
He visited south-east England in 2006-7 to study but did not complete a full university degree, a senior Whitehall official told the BBC.
The attacker later did a course in Australia, Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister said.
The death toll has risen to 359, with more than 500 people wounded.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said the Islamic State (IS) group may be linked to the blasts.
IS has said it carried out the attacks, which targeted churches and high-end hotels, although it did not provide direct evidence of its involvement.
What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? In another development, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena replaced Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando and took steps to sack the Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara.
Key information from officials today: Police have identified eight out of nine attackers - one of whom was a woman - with no foreigners among them Most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and ""middle class"" The US envoy to Sri Lanka warned there were ""ongoing terrorist plots"" in the country Police have now detained around 60 people in connection with the attacks Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hero Ramesh was killed in the blast in Batticaloa What do we know about the attackers? A Whitehall official confirmed the name of the bomber who had visited the UK as Abdul Latif Jamil Mohammed.
Sri Lankan Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said the attacker had gone on to do ""his postgraduate in Australia before coming back to settle in Sri Lanka"".
Confirmation that he studied in the UK in the mid-2000s would tend to cast doubt on the likelihood of his being radicalised so long ago, says the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The footage shows a man wearing a large backpack calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church It also points to his being in his early to mid-30s at the time of the attacks, our correspondent adds.
Mr Wijewardene added that most of the attackers had been ""well educated and come from... middle or upper middle class"" families.
""They are financially quite independent and their families are quite stable financially,"" he said.
Two of the bombers are reportedly brothers and the sons of a wealthy Colombo spice trader. They detonated their explosives at the Shangri-La and the Cinnamon Grand hotels, police sources told the AFP news agency.
From privilege to terror Analysis by the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner
The announcement that most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and ""middle class"" is not as surprising as it sounds.
Although poverty and lack of opportunities have steered many down a path to terrorism, there are also numerous examples of individuals abandoning a relatively comfortable lifestyle for a violent cause.
Ziad Jarrah, one of the 9/11 attackers who hijacked United Airlines flight 93, came from a privileged Lebanese family. More recently, there have been cases of British jihadists who have worked for the NHS, including doctors.
The late IS executioner Mohammed Emwazi, aka ""Jihadi John"", attended the University of Westminster in London. And the original co-founder of al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, chose to leave behind a luxurious life in Jeddah to go and fight the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s.
Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) but Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks ""could not have been done just locally"".
""There had been training given and a co-ordination which we are not seeing earlier,"" he said.
The worshipper who blocked a bomber The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? Police have now detained around 60 suspects in connection with the attack. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks.
The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There were emotional scenes outside St Anthony's Shrine in Colombo An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be ""out there"" following the attack.
One of the targeted hotels, the Kingsbury, has now reopened.
The country remains tense with police still looking for suspects and possible further explosives.
Two controlled explosions of suspect packages were carried out on Wednesday, including one near a popular cinema in Colombo.
Cautioning about ""ongoing terrorist plots in the country"", US envoy to Sri Lanka Alaina Teplitz told reporters that terrorists could ""strike without warning"".
Who could be behind the attacks? IS said online that it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"".
It provided no evidence for the claim but shared an image on social media of eight men purported to be behind the attack.
The group's last territory fell in March, but even then experts had warned it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology.
Mr Wijewardene has also told parliament that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI. He gave no further details.
'I was praying - let that not be Monique' 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Woman named as eighth UK Sri Lanka victim He also said ""preliminary investigations"" indicated that the bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand , in March.
NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings.
The Sri Lankan government is facing scrutiny after it emerged the authorities were warned about a possible attack.
Security services had been monitoring the NTJ but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said.
On Tuesday, President Sirisena promised ""stern action"" over the failure to pass on the warnings and said he would restructure the country's police and security services.
Who were the victims? The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims.
Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services.
Some 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 11 Indian nationals.
The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts. Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday.

The Seahorse Trust has applied for a judicial review of a decision to allow a temporary oil rig in Poole Bay, Dorset, earlier this year.
It said government regulations in general did not allow applications by energy firms to be fully scrutinised.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has been approached for comment. Image copyright Craig Pinder Image caption The Seahorse Trust said dead seahorses, dolphins and a seal had washed up near the drilling site
Energy firm Corallian previously said it had found ""extensive"" reserves of oil during its exploration of the Colter South area in February and March.
Dorset Wildlife Trust said an ""unusually high number"" of dead seahorses subsequently washed up on Dorset beaches.
The Seahorse Trust said nine had been found in or near Poole Bay since late March, as well as two dead dolphins and one seal.
Director Neil Garrick-Maidment said seahorses reacted badly to ""excessive noise"" from drilling and the deaths were ""very, very coincidental"".
""Dormant diseases take hold and kill them when they get stressed,"" he said. Image caption The group Save Our Shores protested against the Dorset rig
The trust has issued High Court proceedings against Energy Secretary Greg Clark and the Oil and Gas Authority.
In court papers, the charity said the defendants had failed to properly adopt the European Union's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive, because there was no requirement in UK law to properly publicise applications.
Susan Ring, a partner at law firm Harrison Grant, said: ""As a result, the application to drill for oil offshore has not been subject to a transparent environmental impact assessment process required by the directive, so that the public, including my client, has been shut out of the process.
""In short, the [UK government's] Offshore EIA Regulations are not fit for purpose.""
Corallian said it would not comment on the legal action against the two regulators. Related Topics"
Venezuela crisis- How much aid is getting in&quest;,www.bbc.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47369768,"Trump vows 'no way out' for Maduro's military backers
President Maduro denies there's a humanitarian crisis and says the US-led relief effort is part of a plan to remove his government.
The aid, including food, hygiene and medical kits, was requested by Mr Guaid√≥, who declared himself interim president last month. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Aid shipments on the Colombian border have so far been blocked by Venezuela The Russian shipment
Last week, Mr Maduro announced that Russia was sending 300 tonnes of food and medical supplies to Venezuela, which would arrive on 20 February.
But in response to questions from BBC News, the Venezuelan government provided no further details about the contents of the aid shipment and said there were currently no opportunities to film it.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked about the shipment in a daily press call on 21 February and replied that he didn't have any information but would make inquiries.
BBC News also asked the Russian government for information about the status of this aid package but received no reply.
However, the Pan-American Health Organisation, which works with the World Health Organization (WHO) did release information about medical supplies sent by Russia. A shipment of 7.5 tonnes arrived on 21 February.
A similar delivery was made in April 2018.
The WHO oversaw the delivery of a total of 50 tonnes of medicines and supplies last year from foreign countries. Who is buying Venezuela's oil?

Groups working inside Venezuela say the country is facing chronic healthcare shortages.
The country lacks 85% of medicines it needs, according to the Pharmaceutical Federation of Venezuela.
The UN's Financial Tracking Service (FTS), which collates global data on humanitarian funding, recorded $24m (¬£18m) for Venezuela in 2018.
The agencies to have received the most money earmarked for Venezuela include the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund and the Norwegian Refugee Council.
And this includes about $9m (¬£6.8m) raised through the UN's central emergency response fund for projects to improve nutrition, overseen by international agencies including UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, and the WHO.
So far this year, another $15m has been donated, according to the UN database.
Since November, UN agencies had been scaling up existing activities to meet ""urgent health, nutrition and protection needs"", a representative of the UN's Office for the Co-ordination for Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA) said. And about the half the money needed to fund this had been raised so far.
The European Commission (EC) was the largest donor to organisations working inside Venezuela in 2018, according to the database.
It has been sending humanitarian aid to Venezuela since 2016.
The EC focuses on projects to improve access to food and nutrition, water, hygiene and sanitation for people in Venezuela.
Last June, it announced a ‚Ç¨35m (¬£30m) package that included emergency humanitarian relief for people inside the country, measures to protect people displaced in neighbouring countries and development assistance.
That was followed in December by a ‚Ç¨20m emergency relief package and an additional ‚Ç¨5m plan was announced this year."
