* This time , it was freshman Rep. John Rose’s (R-Tenn.) fault: “House conservatives blocked a bipartisan $19.1 billion disaster aid bill for the third time Thursday, once again thwarting Democrats’ efforts to pass the long-delayed legislation that is supported by President Trump.”
* This new policy takes effect immediately: “New Hampshire is the latest state to repeal its death penalty, as the state Senate had enough votes to override Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto…. The 16-8 vote Thursday was the necessary two-thirds majority to override. The House narrowly voted last week to override Sununu’s veto.”
* Real political drama in Israel : “Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a ruling coalition late Wednesday night, becoming the first elected prime minister in Israeli history to stumble in forging a working government.”
* Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), who’s up for re-election this year, is prepared to sign this : “The Louisiana House of Representatives passed an abortion ban on a 79-23 vote Wednesday that would prohibit women from terminating a pregnancy once a fetal heartbeat has been detected.”
* This story is just getting started: “Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., this week sent subpoenas to Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, and Trump Victory, a political fundraising committee, demanding they turn over all records relating to Republican Party donor Li ‘Cindy’ Yang and several of her associates and companies, the Miami Herald has learned.”
* Russia : “The Trump administration believes Russia has restarted very low-yield nuclear tests, officials said on Wednesday in a finding that could be used to renew in earnest the arms race between Moscow and Washington.”
* A year is a long time : “The Pentagon press corps has chafed for months at what reporters see as a sharp decline in access to information, including limited access to officials during trips. Celebrities such as Kiss rocker Gene Simmons and actor Gerard Butler have showed up in the briefing room, but Friday will be a year since the Pentagon held an on-camera briefing with any department spokesperson.”
* An FDA moving in the wrong direction : “Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) charged in an unusually sharp attack Wednesday that acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless seemed to have ‘no intention’ of addressing youth e-cigarette use, which his predecessor deemed a public health epidemic.”
* King strikes again : “Rep. Steve King, who earlier this year was condemned by his congressional peers for favorable comments about white supremacy, argued Tuesday that presuming all cultures are equal devalues the Founding Fathers.”
* Cochran : “Seven-term Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who used seniority to steer billions of dollars to his home state of Mississippi, has died. He was 81.”

Why Trump's ongoing confusion about China and trade matters | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-31-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-ongoing-confusion-about-china-and-trade-matters,"File photo taken in November 2017 shows U.S. President Donald Trump (and Chinese President Xi Jinping attending a welcome ceremony in Beijing. Kyodo via AP Images Why Trump’s ongoing confusion about China and trade matters 05/31/19 09:20 AM By Steve Benen During a brief Q&A with reporters yesterday, Donald Trump fielded a question about trade talks with China, which the president responded to in a familiar way :
“China would love to make a deal with us. We had a deal, and they broke the deal. I think, if they had to do again, they wouldn’t have done what they did. We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. China is subsidizing products. So the United States taxpayer is paying for very little of it.”
Earlier this week, Trump made a very similar argument during a press conference in Tokyo, while standing alongside Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo.
“You know, foolishly, some people said that the American taxpayer is paying the tariffs of China. No, no, no – it’s not that way. They’re paying a small percentage, but our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars…. I don’t believe that China can continue to pay these, really, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. I don’t believe they can do that.”
At this point, we could talk about the simple fact that Trump has reality backwards . We could also talk about the latest Monmouth University poll that suggested the American public has a better grasp of the basic details than their president.
We could even have a chat about Trump’s willful ignorance and his decision to deliberately ignore reality, even when his own White House team tries to educate the president about his own agenda.
But as important as these angles are, I’m principally concerned with the practical effects of Trump’s ongoing and persistent confusion.
By all accounts, the American president is absolutely convinced that his tariffs policy is forcing China to pay us billions of dollars, which Trump believes gives him leverage in trade talks. After all, in the Republican’s mind, Beijing will yield any day now, unwilling to keep pumping billions into the American treasury.
That leverage exists only in Trump’s imagination, making it that much more dangerous – for the economy, for U.S. consumers, for everyone affected by international economic conditions – when the White House pursues a policy built on a foundation of ignorance.
Complicating matters is that Trump, falsely convinced that his tariffs on China are working wonders, is now poised to impose new tariffs on Mexico , unaware of the impact this will have on his own country.
Pointing and laughing at the American president’s unsettling limitations is easy, but there’s nothing comedic about the real-world effects of Trump’s nonsense.

Trump admin looks for 'fresh thinking' on international human rights | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-admin-looks-fresh-thinking-international-human-rights?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter,"Spokesperson Heather Nauert (L) speaks as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo dialogues with reporters in his plane while flying from Panama to Mexico, October 18, 2018. Brendan Smialowski/Pool via REUTERS Trump admin looks for ‘fresh thinking’ on international human rights 05/31/19 10:16 AM By Steve Benen As things stand, the U.S. State Department already has a bureau that focuses on human rights. It’s called the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor , and it’s led by an undersecretary for civilian security, democracy, and human rights. This system has been in place since 1977 and it’s never been especially controversial.
Politico reported yesterday, however, that the Trump administration wants a separate human rights panel, which will apparently be expected to look at the issue in a different way.
The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer “fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.
The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.
According to the State Department’s notice, this new commission “will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights.”
At face value, the idea of introducing “fresh thinking” may seem relatively benign. After all, there’s nothing inherently wrong with challenging preconceived ideas and thinking anew about old debates.
But it’s nevertheless hard to have confidence in Trump administration initiatives like these, especially given how little this president and his team have cared about human rights since taking office.
For one thing, there’s been no meaningful explanation of why the State Department needs two bureaus to work on the same issue. David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights in the Bush/Cheney administration, told Politico he’s glad to see Team Trump take an interest in the issue, but he’s “not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”
For another, there’s even less clarity on the direction the new Commission on Unalienable Rights is supposed to take. The administration apparently believes the current “discourse” on human rights has “departed from our nation’s founding principles.”
Such as?
And then, of course, there was the reference to “natural law,” which is a phrase the far-right has been known to use to dismiss the rights of women and the LGBTQ community.
Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), who led the State Department’s human rights bureau through much of Barack Obama’s second term, added , “I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights.”
Given everything we know, it’s tough to disagree.

* With California hosting a massive presidential primary early next year, 14 presidential hopefuls attended the California Democratic Party’s convention over the weekend. It was, by all accounts, a rather raucous affair.
* At a Fox News town-hall event last week, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said, “We want women to have a seat at the table.” Host Chris Wallace asked the presidential candidate, “What about men?” to which the New York Democrat replied , “They’re already there – do you not know?”
* Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a prominent Democratic presidential contender, has begun fleshing out his plan to overhaul the U.S. Supreme Court. Under his vision, the high court would have 15 members: five justices affiliated with Democrats, five affiliated with Republicans, and five chosen by the other 10.
* In case there were lingering doubts, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) ruled out the possibility of a 2020 presidential campaign over the weekend. Hogan had considered taking on Donald Trump in a Republican primary.
* On a related note, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) late last week also said there’s “ no path ” for him to defeat his party’s president in 2020.
* In one of this year’s most closely watched contests, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) is one of the nation’s most unpopular governors, but he may win re-election anyway because he’s a Republican.
* In Montana last week, the conservative Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC that helps Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate, launched a new ad attacking Gov. Steve Bullock (D). That wouldn’t be especially notable except for the fact that Bullock is running for president, not the Senate, though the SLF apparently isn’t convinced about his 2020 electoral plans.

"Asked about Russian interference, Kushner offers discouraging answer | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-03-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/asked-about-russian-interference-kushner-offers-discouraging-answer,"By Steve Benen White House senior advisor Jared Kushner doesn’t do many interviews, so those who’ve wondered about his role in a variety of stories – including the Russia scandal – have generally been left wanting.
It made it all the more notable when he sat down with Axios’ Jonathan Swan for an interview that aired last night on HBO. Kushner’s futile defense of Donald Trump’s racism has generated plenty of headlines, and for good reason . But the back and forth on Russia was every bit as important, if not more so.
SWAN: On June 8, 2016, you were sent an email with an offer of help for the Trump campaign from the Russian government.
KUSHNER: I’m sorry? Which email are you talking about?
SWAN: The email from Rod Goldstone.
KUSHNER: Look, Jonathan –
SWAN: My question to you is why didn’t you pick up the phone and call the FBI? It was an email that said Russia, that said the Russian government was trying to help. Like, why didn’t you do that?
Though the presidential son-in-law clearly didn’t think so, it was a good question. Kushner did, after all, receive an email with a subject line that read, “FW: Russia - Clinton - private and confidential.”
He nevertheless spent the next minute downplaying the significance of the email and the infamous Trump Tower meeting he attended with Russian emissaries. He complained about how busy he was at the time (“Let me put you in my shoes at that time. OK, I’m running three companies, I’m helping run the campaign….”) and the about attitudes of “self-righteous” people who’ve played “Monday morning quarterback.”
It led to an important follow-up question: would Kushner call the FBI if Russia again offered assistance to the Trump campaign?
“I don’t know,” Kushner replied. “It’s hard to do hypotheticals.”
That’s certainly one way to look at it. Alternatively, it’s very easy to do hypotheticals when someone asks you how you’d respond to a foreign adversary offering illegal campaign assistance – for the second time.
But Kushner’s in a bit of a jam. If he said, “Of course I’d contact the FBI if it happened again,” then his 2016 actions would appear negligent. If Kushner said, “No, even now, I still wouldn’t contact the authorities,” he’d look worse.
So one of the most powerful officials in the White House was left with, “It’s hard to do hypotheticals.”
During a rather remarkable Senate hearing a few weeks ago, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) asked Attorney General Bill Barr: “Going forward, what if a foreign adversary … offers a presidential candidate dirt on a competitor in 2020? Do you agree with me the campaign should immediately contact the FBI?”
It took a little effort, but the president’s AG eventually said yes . So what is it, exactly, that Kushner is unsure about?

* It’s about time : “Congress is finally shipping President Donald Trump a $19.1 billion disaster aid bill, a measure stalled for months by infighting, misjudgment, and a presidential feud with Democrats.”
* Not what the White House was hoping for: “The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request from the Trump administration to speed up its consideration of the future of DACA, the federal program that has allowed 700,000 young people – known as Dreamers – to avoid deportation.”
* Newly relevant in light of Friday afternoon’s mass shooting: “A Virginia bill designed to ban sales of large-capacity magazines similar to those used by the Virginia Beach gunman died in committee in January on a party-line vote.”
* Hmm : “China and Mexico both signaled a willingness to negotiate with Washington over escalating trade issues, while the Trump administration took to the airwaves to defend its use of tariffs to gain concessions from trading partners.”
* This should be interesting: “House Democrats announced Monday they’ll hold a hearing next week focused on the Mueller report and ‘presidential obstruction.’”
* Notable White House Departure #1 : “President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that a member of his legal team, Emmet Flood, will leave his post later this month after helping him handle the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election campaign.”
* Notable White House Departure #2 : “Kevin Hassett … is stepping down as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Trump said Sunday night.”
* Illinois : “A bill that establishes a ‘fundamental right’ for women to get an abortion in Illinois cleared the state Senate late Friday night, sending the sweeping measure to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who already has signaled his support.”
* Australia? “The Trump administration considered imposing tariffs on imports from Australia last week, but decided against the move amid fierce opposition from military officials and the State Department, according to several people familiar with the discussions.”
* In related news : “The Trump administration announced on Friday that it was stripping India of a special status that exempts billions of dollars of its products from American tariffs, part of a deepening clash over India’s protections for its market.”
* Ethanol : “The Trump administration said Friday that it has lifted a summertime ban on the use of E15, a gasoline blend made of 15 percent ethanol. The move is designed to help corn and soybean farmers harmed by President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs.”
* I don’t know why he keeps saying stuff like this : “Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., is currently awaiting trial for misusing over $250,000 of federal campaign funds for personal use. But this hasn’t stopped him from stirring the pot further. In an interview with Barstool Sports’ Zero Blog Thirty podcast, Hunter said while serving as a Marine field artillery officer in Iraq, his unit had ‘killed probably hundreds of civilians, if not scores, if not hundreds of civilians’ and ‘probably women and children.’”
Anything to add? Consider this an open thread.

Trump discovers that Middle East peace isn't as easy as he thought | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-04-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-discovers-middle-east-peace-isnt-easy-he-thought,"By Steve Benen Just three months into his presidency, Donald Trump declared with confidence, “I want to see peace with Israel and the Palestinians. There is no reason there’s not peace between Israel and the Palestinians – none whatsoever.” As we discussed at the time, there are all kinds of things standing in the way of peace, though the president didn’t appear to recognize them.
He was, however, quite serious about the attitude. A month later, Trump boasted there’s a “very, very good chance” his administration would help strike a deal for Middle East peace. “It’s something, frankly, maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years,” the president added.
As regular readers know , Trump assigned his young son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to oversee the White House’s efforts to reach an agreement between Palestinians and Israelis. Trump was certain he’d picked the right person for the job, saying of Kushner, “If you can’t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can. OK. All my life I’ve been hearing that’s the toughest deal in the world to make. And I’ve seen it, but I have a feeling that Jared is going to do a great job.”
Yeah, about that …
Jared Kushner’s Middle East peace plan isn’t even out yet, but there are already intensifying calls to scrap the rollout – including from some Trump allies.
Prominent conservative and pro-Israel voices close to the White House are increasingly sharing their fears, which range from the possibility that the peace proposal could trigger violence to worries that its offerings could forever kill efforts to craft a two-state solution.
As the Politico report added, political turmoil and a fresh round of elections in Israel were likely to delay the White House’s gambit anyway, but some are nevertheless “going on the record to urge the Trump administration to set aside the plan indefinitely.”
Complicating matters, the Washington Post obtained a recording of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaking behind closed doors to a group of Jewish leaders last week, when the president’s chief diplomat “delivered a sobering assessment” of the plan’s prospects. Pompeo said “one might argue” that the blueprint is “unexecutable” and it might not “gain traction.”
Making matters slightly worse, the president suggested Pompeo may very well be right.
During a brief Q&A with reporters before leaving for the U.K., Trump was asked if he had any comment about Pompeo’s remarks. The secretary of State, the president replied , “may be right.”
As things stand, the White House, which has gone to great lengths to antagonize Palestinians, is expected to unveil its peace plan three weeks from today. While the details remain under wraps, multiple reports suggest Kushner’s blueprint is built on financial incentives for Palestinians, not a two-state solution.
As that plan starts to unravel – before its release – it’s worth pausing to question the wisdom of putting the process in the hands of a young presidential son-in-law with no experience in diplomacy or foreign policy, answering to a president with no interest in diplomacy or foreign policy.

"As House passes disaster-relief bill, Trump gets confused | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-04-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/house-passes-disaster-relief-bill-trump-gets-confused,"By Steve Benen Congress’ disaster-relief package – traditionally the sort of thing that passed easily – was needlessly delayed for months. Donald Trump had some specific demands related to border funding and excluding aid for Puerto Rico ; Democrats balked; and so the bill languished.
Two weeks ago, however, the clouds parted. As regular readers know , Trump caved , clearing the way for final passage.
A small group of House Republicans managed to delay the bill for another week – it’s not at all clear why they bothered – but yesterday, the legislative process came to an end .
The House on Monday evening passed the Senate-approved $19 billion disaster aid measure that three conservative Republicans had taken turns blocking in separate votes over the past two weeks.
With the 354-58 vote, the bill will now be sent to President Donald Trump for his signature, which can be delivered via auto-pen while he’s on a state visit to the United Kingdom.
The final roll call is online here . Of the 58 members who voted against the relief package, all 58 were Republicans, though most of the GOP minority voted with Democrats.
Just minutes after the House vote, Donald Trump published a tweet that said , “House just passed the 19.1 Billion Dollar Disaster Aid Bill. Great, now we will get it done in the Senate!”
That’s not quite right.
As the president probably ought to know, after he retreated two weeks ago, the Senate took up the disaster-relief bill and passed it , 85 to 8.
The bill then went to the House, which passed the same measure yesterday afternoon, which means all it needs now is Trump’s signature.
The president deleted his confused tweet last night.

Remember when Republicans were prepared to impeach Hillary Clinton? | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-04-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/remember-when-republicans-were-prepared-impeach-hillary-clinton,"Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the second presidential debate, Oct. 9, 2016. Photo by Mark Peterson/Redux for MSNBC Remember when Republicans were prepared to impeach Hillary Clinton? 06/04/19 09:20 AM  Updated 06/04/19 09:31 AM By Steve Benen On Nov. 8, 2016, Donald Trump unexpectedly won the U.S. presidential election. Just four days earlier, however, the Washington Post published this report on Republican plans to impeach Hillary Clinton, whom they expected to win.
Senior Republican lawmakers are openly discussing the prospect of impeaching Hillary Clinton should she win the presidency, a stark indication that partisan warfare over her tenure as secretary of state will not end on Election Day.
Chairmen of two congressional committees said in media interviews this week they believe Clinton committed impeachable offenses in setting up and using a private email server for official State Department business.
And a third senior Republican, the chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, told The Washington Post he is personally convinced Clinton should be impeached for influence peddling involving her family foundation.
The same morning that article ran, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the then-chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told Fox News that he believed Hillary Clinton committed “ treason ” with her email protocols.
Two days before that, Senate House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) also suggested Clinton committed impeachable offenses. In reference to the Democrat’s email issues, the Wisconsin Republican said on Nov. 1, 2016, “I’m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written. I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor.”
It was around this time that a National Review writer made the case that congressional Republicans should impeach Clinton before the election, while Rudy Giuliani reportedly “ guaranteed ” to an Iowa audience that Clinton, if elected, would be impeached within a year of taking office.
Less than a week later, Trump won, and the question of whether the Republican Congress would impeach Hillary Clinton or not became a moot point. But as the issue of presidential impeachment returns to the fore, it’s worth revisiting the standards GOP lawmakers set in the very recent past.
Three years ago, federal investigators examined Clinton’s email protocols and concluded that she broke no laws. Then-FBI Director James Comey concluded that the issue was not a close call .
“At the end of the day, the case itself was not a cliff-hanger; despite all the chest-beating by people no longer in government, there really wasn’t a prosecutable case,” Comey wrote in an internal memo.
In contrast, federal investigators examined Donald Trump’s alleged misconduct as part of the probe into the Russia scandal, and they uncovered evidence of, among other things, obstruction of justice.
The Republican’s allies are now feigning outrage at the very idea of presidential impeachment, but they espoused very different standards in the fall of 2016.

The issues Donald Trump turns to as 'his safety blanket' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-04-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-issues-donald-trump-turns-his-safety-blanket,"By Steve Benen According to Donald Trump’s plan , the United States will begin imposing a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods early next week. The only way for Mexico to avoid the tax penalty would be to satisfy unspecified White House demands about stemming the flow of immigration.
What’s more, according to the president, the tariff would climb incrementally, month by month, reaching a 25% tax on Oct. 1.
As is usually the case, many of those close to Trump told him not to do this . In fact, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, and White House senior advisor Jared Kushner all lobbied the president to choose a more responsible course. True to form, he ignored them .
It’s worth appreciating why. The Atlantic reported today on Trump’s “preferred method of relief in moments of crisis.”
In the days leading up to the tariff announcement, the news cycle was captivated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s first public remarks since he was appointed to his role more than two years ago…. Trump was clearly affected by the fallout. “How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? WITCH-HUNT!” the president tweeted on Wednesday. […]
So while his tariff announcement was in many ways a surprise, it also had a tinge of inevitability. According to current and former aides, who requested anonymity to speak freely, when Trump feels he has lost control of the narrative, he grasps at two issues: border security and trade. Those aides said he sees these topics as reset buttons, ways to rile both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and draw attention away from whatever dumpster fire is blazing in a given week.
A senior campaign adviser told The Atlantic ’s Elaina Plott, “Whenever a negative story comes around, his instinct is to pivot to immigration or trade. It’s kind of like his safety blanket. He knows that Fox and conservative media will immediately coalesce and change what the base is talking about.”
The article added , “Aides say that the Mexico tariff decision and its developments to come represent a way for Trump to channel his anxieties and feel in control.”
Or put another way, the White House has no policy process. It instead has the whims of an erratic amateur who sees two major issues – neither of which he understands in any meaningful way – as a pacifier. Mexico is facing an economic threat, not because our neighbor deserves punishment, but because Robert Mueller, Democrats, and news organizations made the Republican feel bad.
Your government at work.
Whether Trump intends to follow through on his plan remains an open question. Many congressional Republicans believe the president is bluffing , hoping to see what he can get out of Mexico City. Trump himself said this morning that he’s “ likely ” to follow through on his idea, which was hardly categorical.
He’s made related threats before, only to back off before doing real harm.
Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the Washington Post reports today that GOP lawmakers are “discussing” how and whether to block the White House’s tariffs plan, raising the prospect of Republicans choosing a “dramatic act of defiance.”
Having been awake since January 2017, I’m skeptical of the possibility, but the fact that Trump’s party is sending these signals is emblematic of just how wrong they believe the president is.
In this case, they’re right. The president’s gambit may be “his safety blanket,” but this is a dreadfully misguided plan .

* A new national CNN poll found former Vice President Joe Biden (D) leading Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, 32% to 18%. That’s a smaller gap than in a CNN poll conducted last month around the time of Biden’s kickoff. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is third in the poll with 8%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with 7%.
* On a related note, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) reached 1% in the CNN poll, which means he’s now qualified to participate in the first round of Democratic debates. It’s worth noting, however, that the DNC has capped the number of participants at 20 – and Bennet is the 20th. It raises the prospect of candidates qualifying for the events but not making it onto the stage.
* Biden’s campaign this morning unveiled the Delaware Democrat’s climate and energy plan , and it’s a bit more ambitious than expected. The blueprint calls for, among other things, net zero emissions by 2050, which is line with the IPCC’s plan.
* Speaking of Biden, the New York Times today takes a closer look at the Delaware Democrat’s 1988 presidential campaign, which was a bit of a train wreck.
* Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, unveiled a $2 trillion climate plan today, which includes extensive investments in low-carbon technology and a “Green Marshall Plan” to assist developing nations poised to suffer as the climate crisis intensifies.
* Another presidential hopeful, Julián Castro, yesterday unveiled a plan to overhaul police use of deadly force and reduce wrongful shootings through federal law enforcement standards. As part of the proposal, the former HUD secretary intends to combat “racially discriminatory policing.”
* And in North Carolina, a state the president won by nearly four points in 2016, a new Emerson poll points to possible trouble for the Republican. In a hypothetical match-up, the poll found Trump trailing Biden by 12 points. The incumbent is also behind Sanders and Pete Buttigieg by 8 and 4 points, respectively. The same poll found him tied with Warren and narrowly leading Harris.
