HBO’s ‘Chernobyl’ Makes A Powerful Argument Against Relative Truth,thefederalist.com,Spencer Brown,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/hbos-chernobyl-makes-a-powerful-argument-against-relative-truth/,"By Spencer Brown June 12, 2019
“It is always there, whether we see it or not, whether we choose to or not. The truth doesn’t care about our needs or wants. It doesn’t care about our governments, our ideologies, our religions. It will lie in wait for all time.” These words from nuclear scientist Valery Legasov, uttered in the final episode of “Chernobyl,” are a significant thread throughout the HBO miniseries.
Perhaps surprisingly, at a time many cultural producers have bought into the left’s call for socialist policies, “Chernobyl” provides viewers a rare, honest, and raw look at the reality of socialism and, especially in the case of Chernobyl, the significant flaws of a system where The Truth is whatever serves the needs of the Central Committee.
The damage caused by a state that reigns supreme over any truth or fact is foreshadowed in the series’ opening scene. There again, we hear Legasov’s thoughts: “What is the cost of lies? It’s not that we’ll mistake them for truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all. What can we do then? What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth.”
These costly lies are told throughout the series, by everyone. Even the characters who seem to be heroes-in-the-making become complicit.
In discussions at the Chernobyl Nuclear Powerplant, workers are told what they didn’t see. In meetings with Mikhail Gorbachev, the Central Committee is told the situation isn’t serious. In the streets, citizens are told their evacuations are temporary. At the site of the exploded reactor, miners and conscripted citizens are told they’ll be fine. No one truly believes the lies he tells. For the good of the state, they are repeatedly told: “Have faith, comrades.”
In the first of several chilling monologues delivered on the supremacy of the state, it is reiterated that “Faith in Soviet socialism will always be rewarded.” Yet this blind faith in the state is what’s so damaging. “When the people ask questions that are not in their own best interest they should simply behold to keep their minds on their labor,” agents of the government declare. “Leave matters of the state to the state.”
This kind of thinking is what made Chernobyl an unmitigated disaster. The idea that the state—i.e., those on the Central Committee—knows best is proven wrong over and over. As Gorbachev says, “Our power comes from the perception of our power.” In the pursuit of protecting this perception of power, innocent life is treated as expendable in the response to the explosion, for the determined good of the state.
Evacuation recommendations are ignored. Communication with the outside world is cut off. Workers conscripted to serve at the reactor site are knowingly condemned to horrific deaths. “This is what has always set our people apart,” explains the USSR’s Fuel and Energy Bureau head Boris Shcherbina at one point. “A thousand years of sacrifice is in our veins. And every generation must know its own suffering.”
Despite the overwhelming force of the state, another nuclear scientist, Ulana Khomyuk, works with Legasov in an attempt to uncover the truth of how and why the disaster happened—an adventure not without peril of its own. When the KGB arrests Khomyuk, Legasov begs for her release. He is saved from punishment for this improper questioning of a state authority, according to Shcherbina, because Legasov “came off like a naive idiot—and naive idiots are not a threat.”
Lacking a singular protagonist, “Chernobyl’s” creators opt instead to highlight the Soviet people. Humanity is seen in the victorious spirit of the divers who sign their death warrants to pump water out from the reactor facility manually. It’s seen in Vasily Ignatenko, a firefighter who was among the first to arrive on the scene following the explosion, and his wife. It’s seen in the miners who agree to dig under the reactor to install a heat exchanger.
In a poignant scene during the forced eviction of those within the exclusion zone, it’s shown in a monologue from an 82-year-old woman who’s told by a young soldier she must leave:
You’re not the first soldier to stand here with a gun. When I was 12, the Revolution came. Czar’s men. Then Bolsheviks. Boys like you marching in lines. They told us to leave—No. Then there was Stalin and his famine, the Holodomor. My parents died. Two of my sisters died. They told the rest of us to leave—No. Then the Great War. German boys, Russian boys. More soldiers, more famine, more bodies. My brothers never came home. But I stayed, and I’m still here. After all that I have seen, I should leave now because of something I cannot see at all—No.
The Soviet people (and their cows, dogs, and homes) paid the price for the Central Committee’s lies and self-preserving suppression of truth.
Much like Chernobyl’s radiation demolished the cellular structure of the afflicted, this system poisons society and eats away at the convictions of those who know the truth. Shcherbina speaks, seemingly from experience, when discussing the possibility of exposing the full story of why Reactor Four turned into a nuclear bomb: “When it’s your life and the lives of everyone you love [on the line] your moral conviction doesn’t mean anything,” he says. “It leaves you. And all you want at that moment is not to be shot.”
The reward for furthering the state’s lies is made to seem more appealing. Legasov is offered recognition as “Hero of the Soviet Union,” but only if he follows the KGB’s plan to cover the truth at the sham trial for those chosen to take the fall for the state’s negligence. Once Legasov’s testimony is given, explains the KGB, “We will have our villains, we will have our hero, we will have our truth.”
“Their truth,” the infallibility of the state, is finally shattered when Legasov chooses to tell the full story of the cover-up leading to the explosion. He’s warned at the trial that if he’s implying the state is responsible for the disaster, he is “treading on dangerous ground.”
Legasov responds: “I’ve already trod on dangerous ground. We’re on dangerous ground right now because of our secrets and our lies. They’re practically what define us. When the truth offends we life and lie until we can no longer remember it is even there. But it is still there. Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid.”
The rejection of truth is indeed dangerous, whether it’s to appease the Soviet state in the 1980s or to earn a gold star from the politically correct cultural gatekeepers of today. What HBO’s “Chernobyl” may lack in scientific accuracy, it more than makes up for by showing the dangerous truth of what socialism can bring.
Those who peddle socialism’s glory today are hiding a truth as nefarious as the reality of Chernobyl’s exposed reactor. These lies too incur a debt, one that Americans will pay if we don’t heed the warnings of socialism given to us by history. Spencer Brown is the spokesman for Young America's Foundation."
New Typeface Helps You Remember What You Read — By Erasing It,thefederalist.com,Nicole Fisher,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/new-typeface-helps-remember-read-erasing/,"By Nicole Fisher June 12, 2019
Common sense tells us that the harder you work at something, the better you will be at it. And science, once again, is finding support for what we thought to be true. In this case, a unique study finds that when our brain works harder to read or write something, the better we recall the information.
RMIT University in Australia has concluded that “When a piece of information is too easily and cleanly read, it can fail to engage our brains in the kind of deeper cognitive processing necessary for effective retention and recall.” Thus the introduction of Sans Forgetica , a typeface specifically designed to boost memory. Here’s a sample.
Sans Forgetica attempts to address what RMIT researchers refer to as a “somewhat ironic flaw of design. By disrupting the flow of individual letterforms, readers are subtly prompted to increase their focus on the text being communicated.” Basically, the more you must focus on a task, the better you are at it.
Research on reading, writing, and human memory isn’t new. Cuneiform —the first Sumerian writing system—emerged in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. Since that time, scholars have attempted to grasp how documented communication connects and affects human beings.
Neuroscientists, in particular, have attempted to understand the ways our brain encodes and recalls the things that we write and read, versus speak, hear, taste, touch, or smell. Or, more accurately, how all the senses work in tandem to remember and recall things that are written. The Death of Writing by Hand
Because of that, a body of evidence has evolved in recent years about the decline of long-form writing, especially during meetings and classes. It has come to light that typing notes on a computer amplifies mindless transcription with a verbatim recording of what we hear. This means the brain does not process the information well because the encoding process of typing is more shallow than writing by hand.
A study published in Trends in Neuroscience and Education found that when children who had not yet learned to read or write were asked to trace, draw, or type a letter, the recall for the letter when viewed later in an MRI machine was different. Recognition was greatest for the letters that had been independently drawn because they activated three brain regions, more than either those who traced the letter or typed it.
In three distinct studies on young adults, college students who took manual notes in class (thus physically writing their thoughts with pen and paper and reframing them) performed significantly better when tested on conceptually based questions. What makes this even more interesting is that laptop note-takers, on average, take much lengthier and more robust notes than those who write in long-form on a notepad. But the Journal of Educational Psychology published results of a study that show, in less than 24 hours, the advantage of more text disappears. It really is about quality, not quantity, when it comes to performance.
The results of written note-taking studies suggest that the manual writing method itself may not necessarily improve or decrease recall. For example, the decline of cursive as a curriculum in elementary school has drawn attention (mostly criticism) in the last two decades. Yet, to date, there is not conclusive evidence that cursive is definitively better or worse than other forms of long-form writing by hand. Data on both sides does suggest that cursive writing may improve motor skills and processing , and that it may connect our senses in a way that improves recall for some.
Nevertheless, as our use of computers and printed type have increased, most new research has been in relation to the physical characteristics of text . Font type, spacing, and proportionality of lettering have been growing areas of focus. All are shown to affect recall of information. Most recently, Princeton University (on which the RMIT research was based) attempted to understand if harder to read fonts really do help us remember things. It appears that they do. Word Variation and Recall
Whether it be words that are italicized, bolded, or missing parts of letters or words, “disfluency” of font appears to help your brain remember. The authors of “ Fortune favors the bold (and the Italicized): effects of disfluency on educational outcomes ” found that deeper processing occurs when more cognitive energy is needed to complete a task, and that includes reading. In both studies, it was concluded that material in hard-to-read fonts was better remembered than easier fonts, and that small changes to learning materials could yield differences in classrooms.
This is where Sans Forgetica comes into play. As the new font was released to the public, so too was a RMIT report –ironically not written in Sans Forgetica—demonstrating the work that went into crafting the new font. Importantly, both science and practicality were used as measurements for success.
The work included a threshold of difficulty called “ desired difficulty” that optimizes learning and recall. It turns out that making things too easy reduces learning. This means it’s important to consider exactly how difficult comprehension should be, without being so difficult it defeats the purpose of learning.
As research continues, we will learn more about how the brain learns and processes words, whether you’re writing or reading. While Sans Forgetica might have a place for typing study materials and flashcards (or maybe your “Honey Do” list), it is hard to imagine that the font will translate to long-form writing, since learning a new way to write is beyond the goal of most individuals.
But it is certain that both how humans encode words and recall them can be influenced by using our senses. No matter which strategy you employ, make sure that you’re putting forth enough effort to do the task well.

Don’t Assume Biden’s Abortion Flip-Flop Will End His Campaign,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/dont-assume-bidens-abortion-flip-flop-will-end-campaign/,"By Warren Henry June 12, 2019
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, abandoning a position he held for decades, now supports taxpayer-funded abortion. Moreover, as flip-flops go, this one was executed almost as clumsily as could be imagined , given the sensitivity of the issue. But Biden’s flip does not mean his campaign is about to flop, as the conventional wisdom suggests.
The immediately accepted line on Biden’s newfound opposition to the Hyde Amendment (language included in spending bills to ban taxpayer-funded abortion) was well-stated by Jonathan S. Tobin here at The Federalist: “[W]hile Biden would like to act as if the nomination is in the bag in order to concentrate on winning back Trump defectors, the Democratic primary race’s tone and issues are still being set by the party’s left-wing base. In a party increasingly intolerant of any deviations from leftist orthodoxy on any number of topics, that means even frontrunners dare not try to defy the activists who have a disproportionate say in determining the nomination.”
In addition, Biden’s switch is said to undermine two of the pillars of his candidacy. What good is Biden’s experience if he distances himself from it? ( This is a point I argued even before Biden entered the race.) And what value is Biden’s “ authenticity ” if he flips on a long-held position on one of the most important moral issues of our time?
But however morally objectionable Biden’s flip-flop is, there is a political case to be made for it. Granted, the Hyde Amendment is popular in a general election. Yet pro-life voters were never going to pull the lever for the already pro-choice Biden in November 2020.
Conversely, Democrats have not cared about their leadership making even larger flips to support abortion since the days of Ted Kennedy and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. To the contrary, people generally approve when a candidate flips in their direction; the left’s continuing attacks are the tell that something more is at play.
Biden will not be the general election candidate if he does not win the primary. Opposing the Hyde Amendment is popular with Democrats (although the margin varies from poll to poll ). As Josh Krashuaar observes: “this was the worst possible issue for Biden to break with the base of his party,” adding that “[u]nlike other policy priorities on the Left—from the Green New Deal to government-run health insurance—support for abortion rights is a bedrock principle for most Democrats, liberal and moderate alike.”
From this perspective, Biden’s flip reflects the left’s weakness as much as its strength. Biden is not offering the left a single-payer “Medicare for all” plan. He is not offering them Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s version of the Green New Deal, caring precisely enough about the environment to cut-and-paste together a cut-rate proposal from special interest groups.
As a general election candidate, Biden would have to offer the left something to unify his party. What he is offering them is only something every Democratic nominee since Bill Clinton has offered them (and neither Clinton nor Barack Obama fought for once in office). He is offering them something that Planned Parenthood Federation of America and NARAL Pro-Choice America are not pushing to get from a Democrat-controlled House, where the proposal has little support.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is likely to allow a vote on the issue only if she is sure it would lose. The last thing Pelosi wants is for Democrats to be seen shutting down the government over something as unpopular as taxpayer-funded abortion. It is simply not the hill on which Democrats want to abort themselves.
The intensity of the response to Biden’s flip is due in part to the intensity of the emotions on both sides of the issue. But the response also says something about the desire to impose a particular narrative on the Democratic primaries.
Before Biden entered the race, there was a significant effort on the left and its friendly media to scare him out of the race. The conventional wisdom was that Biden would collapse upon entry. Although his support has dropped a few points under sustained attacks, he remains in the lead and roughly five points ahead of when he entered .
Accordingly, the conventional wisdom shifted to grudgingly accepting Biden was not going away, but predicting and hoping he might destroy himself. The coverage and commentary regarding Biden’s abortion flip (and the kerfuffle about his staff plagiarizing policy positions) represents an attempt to will this new conventional wisdom into reality.
The “Crazy Uncle Joe destroys himself” narrative would please left-wing activists for whom Biden’s success is a crushing reminder of the limits of their influence. It is also a narrative that pleases the right, who would much prefer Democrats repeat the colossal blunder of 1972 by nominating a more radical candidate to run against President Trump.
Having largely proven the conventional wisdom wrong so far, no one should be shocked if Biden resists the pressure to comprehensively capitulate to the left and destroy his own campaign. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois. Photo"
How To Start Restoring Dignity To ‘Back Row America’,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/start-restoring-dignity-back-row-america/,"By Nathanael Blake June 12, 2019
Chris Arnade has written a good book. And like the Good Book, Dignity: Seeking Respect in Back Row America was sometimes a tough read. This was not only because of the hard-luck stories he reports, or the humanizing pictures he took of those telling them. It is also because this book is as much a secular sermon as a story, a jeremiad Arnade delivers to and against his own class.
It begins with Arnade’s journey of repentance. A physics PhD working on Wall Street for Citibank, his penchant for meandering walks took him into the isolated and troubled Hunts Point neighborhood in the Bronx. He thought of himself as a good progressive, but as he kept coming back and became acquainted with the locals, he began to learn “how cloistered and privileged my world was and how narrow and selfish I was. Not just in how I lived but in what and how I thought.”
He got to know the lowest of the low in Hunts Point — the addicts, homeless, and hookers (often combined in one person). He quit his job to report on what he saw, but he eventually had to quit alcohol and Hunts Point, both of which he had gotten in with too deep.
He was a banker turned writer and photographer, not a pastor or social worker. He couldn’t “save” the neighborhood or his troubled friends there. So he decided to leave New York and travel the country to document what he calls “back row America.” This is Hillbilly Elegy in reverse. Discarding Progressive Pieties
He found McDonald’s and drugs, churches and shuttered storefronts, community and decay. He documented it with interviews, stories, and many thousand-word pictures. His subjects are trying to maintain their dignity in a world that left them behind and looks down on them for it.
Despite his progressive pieties, Arnade was part of that disdainful “front row”—the eager learners and strivers “moving on and up with the GDP.” The front row runs the world and believes itself to be inclusive, offering everyone a shot at life in the front row and accepting and even celebrating minorities who make it. But they often disrespect and condemn those who are left in the back row.
Front-row success required education and mobility, so “staying put was seen as failure.” Arnade and his class were successful, at least by the metrics they accepted. He writes that “We primarily valued what we could measure, and that meant material wealth. The things that couldn’t be easily measured—community, dignity, faith, happiness—were largely ignored.”
Arnade’s class does not think much of McDonald’s or religion, especially low-church evangelical Protestantism. But they are redoubts in back-row America. McDonalds is not just a source of cheap food, it provides a gathering place and shelter for many. The fast-food chain also offers a tableau of the divisions in the back row. While the term is useful for Arnade, it encompasses a heterogeneous group.
There are those in the back row, and then there are those who have dropped out or been kicked out. So McDonald’s employees try to keep the bathrooms from becoming ad hoc laundromats, showers, and drug dens, and the blue-collar retirees meeting each morning for coffee and conversation are not in the same category as the homeless. Getting God
These distinctions matter, but there is a place they can be put aside—before the throne of God. Arnade did not intend to examine religion in his project. Like most of his peers, he saw religion “as an old, irrational thing that limited and repressed people—and often outright oppressed them,” and he is still an agnostic, albeit an apparently humbler one. But, as with McDonald’s, he kept finding himself in churches, because that was where the people he walked to talk to were.
For those at the very bottom, belief in God was essential to sustain themselves. Religion was more than a psychological comfort, however. The front row offered those at the bottom “sterile institutions that chew them up and spit them right back out.” In contrast, the small churches that minister to them “are the only places on the streets that regularly treat them like humans … The preachers and congregants inside may preach to them, even judge their past decisions, but they don’t look down on them.”
These churches are not endlessly tolerant, but they are forgiving: “There are rules to follow if you join, but… You are welcome as long as you try.” They provide support (spiritual, material, and relational) that keeps some in the back row from hitting bottom, and they offer those at the bottom a way up and out. Arnade relates that the “few success stories told on the streets are of relatives, friends, or spouses who found God, got with the discipline and order of a church, and moved away.” Hallelujah.
For those trying to escape cycles of prostitution, drugs, and homelessness, getting God and getting away is lifesaving. For some pundits and policymakers, this gospel of U-Haul is the solution for everyone left behind in back row America. But although it is sometimes necessary to move for a better life, moving is often damaging.
Arnade observes that for many, it “would mean destroying their identity and breaking their support system of family and friends. Their happiness would be reduced. The few good things they have going for them, things that don’t cost money, would disappear.” The Gospel of U-Haul
Many leave anyway, and those who remain are disproportionately the aged, the infirm, the addicted, and those caring for them. Arnade tells of those who stay behind to care for family, rather than striking out on their own to earn more. This violates the gospel of U-Haul, but it may fulfill the commands of another, older gospel, which does not tell us to forsake our family for the sake of the GDP.
Regarding the GDP, it turns out that a rising tide does not lift all boats; some are capsized and sink. It should not require extraordinary virtue to pursue a life of marriage, family, church, and community while laboring honestly for wages sufficient to support these modest ambitions. But this ordinary life has become much harder for many across our country. Although much of the pain in back row America is self-inflicted, cultural and economic forces have played a part in making drugs, disability, and instability the default for too many.
Those who preach in back row America should not abandon a message of personal responsibility. But by the same token, those in the front row should reflect on their responsibility, for they have played a part in the ills that have befallen many American communities.
Thus, Arnade indicts his own class for their failures—both in what they have done and in what they have failed to do. He writes that “Our metrics for success became how high the stock market got, how large the profits were, how efficient the company was. If communities, towns, and people, suffered in this, it was all for the greater good in the name of progress.” In the long run, everyone would be better off.
However, those in the back row were “left with a world where their sense of home and family and community won’t get them anywhere, won’t pay the bills. And with a world where their jobs are disappearing.”
This was due in large part to policies instituted by a bipartisan consensus of the front row. As Arnade puts it, we “gave my old world, Wall Street, whatever it wanted, and what it really wanted was to lower labor costs.” Other losses followed job losses, as cities, communities, and families crumbled and broke in the cause of economic efficiency.
These did not show up on corporate spreadsheets, but they showed up elsewhere, from overdoses to fatherless children. Global corporations have not born the costs of their pursuit of cheap labor—those too were outsourced, this time from Wall Street to back row America.
Arnade challenges narratives of both the left and the right (the chapter on racism may have something to upset almost everyone). He notes that it may help explain how we got Trump, but it is not an apology for the president, or even primarily a political book. A Sermon in Prose and Photographs
What this volume aims to do is remind the rest of us of those who have been left behind in America. It humanizes the people we have ignored and makes us look at the places they live, when we might prefer to fly over or drive through. Arnade uses interviews, stories, and pictures to show us those we tend to look away from and walk past.
However, there are two unfortunate omissions. First, are the children. For obvious reasons, he focused on interviewing adults, so children tend, at most, to be seen but not heard from in this book. There are glimpses of abuse and neglect repeating across generations, but we do not see the full enormity that afflicts children at the bottom, often at the hands of their parents.
The second is that Arnade neglects the middle rows. As a matter of reporting, keeping the middle to the periphery of the book is fine—Middle America may be less compelling than back row America or drop-out America, and it probably needs less humanizing. But it should have been included when Arnade turned to broader narratives and diagnoses. Life from rural Oregon to the heart of West Virginia ain’t all back row. There is a lot of middle in America, and it must be included in discussing relations between the back row and the front.
A welcome omission is that Arnade avoids offering a comprehensive solution or system to address the problems he reports. This humility becomes him, and some of the problems he illuminates can only be mitigated, not solved. The poor will be with us always, but require persistent charity and kindness. It is not an excuse to dismiss and ignore them, or to strip them of dignity even while managing them through social services.
Those in the front row will be important to ameliorating the problems Arnade describes. They hold outsized power, after all. But they should begin their efforts by reflecting on the people in the back row, rather than looking away while burbling about the ultimate, ineffable benefits of creative destruction, or offering social programs that mostly keep the poor out of sight and out of mind.
That is what this book, this sermon in prose and photographs, is for. It is sometimes uncomfortable because it pricks the conscience of the reader and calls to mind our sins. Good. That is how repentance, forgiveness, and reconciliation begin. Nathanael Blake is a Senior Contributor at The Federalist. He has a PhD in political theory. He lives in Missouri."
"‘Final Fantasy VII’ Remake Might Not Just Ignore SJW Complaints, But Spite Them",thefederalist.com,Ashe Schow,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-might-not-just-ignoring-sjw-complaints-spiting/,"By Ashe Schow June 12, 2019
It’s been four years since Square Enix first announced it was remaking beloved JRPG “Final Fantasy VII,” but in the past month we have gotten a new teaser trailer, a new full trailer, a battle explanation, and a release date (March 3, 2020).
The new trailers appear to suggest Square Enix has, thankfully, ignored social justice warrior complaints and demands from over the years. Back in 2015, I wrote that the developer shouldn’t give in to the SJWs because those making the complaints clearly haven’t examined the game or paid attention to the characters and their environment.
For example, for years SJWs have complained that Barret Wallace is a racist stereotype. As I explained in 2015, he’s not. He is an angry, animated character, but so is Cid Highwind, a white character. Both swear constantly and shake their fists.
Despite sharing similarities in looks with Mr. T, Barret isn’t actually Mr. T. As Tim Rogers pointed out in his series “Found in Translation,” the original Japanese dialogue shows the character is closer to Metal Gear Solid’s Solid Snake than Mr. T. He appears, at least in my view, to be a mixture of the two based on the latest trailers.
The first thing we hear Barret say in the new trailers is, “I’m here for you, to take the load off your shoulders.” He has a new voice actor, John Eric Bentley, who’s gruffer than previous voice actor Beau Billingslea.
Video game website Kotaku was immediately upset by the character, claiming “fans” were “concerned” about his voice in the remake. After the first trailer was released, I had a short discussion with another Twitter user about his voice—but about whether Billingslea was still the actor behind the character.
A Kotaku writer, who admitted to never playing the original game, claimed “Barret is a stereotype of a gruff black man in the English translation of the original game,” and that, in the new version, he has “an exaggerated black dialect” and emphasizes “Americanized ideals about masculinity.”
“This depiction plays into racist assumptions people make about black men: not seeing them as full people, but as hulking masses of muscle that sometimes provide folksy wisdom,” the author wrote. We haven’t seen more than a few clips of the character, yet this author has already determined the entire depth of the character in a game he or she never played.
If this is how SJWs are going to see the character, it shows Square Enix ignored years of complaints about Barret. The same goes for my favorite character, Tifa, who was finally revealed in the newest trailer Monday night.
The complaints about her for years were the tired, predictable complaints that her breasts were too big and she was sexualized for the male gaze. Yet here I am, a woman, preferring her over Aerith, mostly because of her character , which is rich beyond her looks.
As I wrote back in 2015, Tifa’s appearance is never a factor in the game. An old man in Mideel flirts with her when you first enter the town, but it’s done in a way typical of all old men toward all young women. Rude also has a crush on her, but at no point do men drool or gawk at her physique.
It appears Square Enix hasn’t nerfed her appearance for the trolls. She still has large breasts, although she seems to have a better sports bra in this game. And not only does she still have an incredibly short black leather skirt (it now flares out so she can fight easier), but now she’s wearing thigh-high black pantyhose.
That means she’s technically showing less skin, but never in the history of ever have thigh highs been considered modest. Again, the creators have ignored the complaints and gone in the opposite direction.
Seeing these two characters in their new versions gives me hope for the cross-dressing portion of the game. As I wrote four years ago, contrary to the claims of “transphobia,” this part of the game is quite progressive. The people of Wall Market support Cloud’s decision to dress as a woman and help him achieve his new look. And this was back in 1997, when society was not so accepting about such things.
The first episode of the game comes out in nine months and takes place entirely in the opening city of Midgar. We don’t yet know if that means it takes us through the point in the story where the team lives the city, although the newest trailer shows Cloud in the lobby of Shinra headquarters and the “1st Class” edition of the game comes with a figure of Cloud on the Hardy Daytona, so it’s likely that is where the game will end.
Until then, we will just have to wait and see whether Square Enix continues this trend of bucking the SJWs.

Black Mirror Series 5 Is Less Tech-Focused And More Character-Driven,thefederalist.com,Clay Waters,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/black-mirror-series-5-less-tech-focused-character-driven/,"By Clay Waters June 12, 2019
Series five of “Black Mirror,” writer-creator Charlie Brooker’s dark anthology series, dropped on Netflix last week. This newest batch of episodes is less preoccupied with what the tech world may look like in the near future and more interested with how we are dealing with it today.
Character-driven and grounded in more or less present-day reality, this might be the least “Black Mirror”-ish series to date, and a possible start to the show’s mature period. That sounds ominous, but Brooker has scored a strong if short season this time out, again taking advantage of our collective unease about the technology—those “black mirrors”—we have surrounded ourselves with.
Each of the three episodes of series five (remember that Brooker spent a lot of energy on the technically innovative “Black Mirror” movie “Bandersnatch”) tops out at just over an hour. One episode leans tense and serious, one is screwball and farcical, the other an intriguingly mature look at friendship, marriage, and sex.
After gaining a cult following from its shocking UK debut in 2011, “Black Mirror” moved to Netflix for its third series, with longer running times and more exotic locations, including American settings, although the show has oddly never filmed in the United States. Series three focused on high-tech eye-tech, while series four tapped into an existential fear of being trapped in our own digital hells. Series five, if it has a theme, is about fighting off loneliness via personal connection.
As always with the show, don’t infer anything from the episode titles. Episode 1, ‘Striking Vipers’ Grade: A-
Brooker proves there is still something interesting to say about virtual reality technology. Two college friends, Karl and Danny (played by Anthony Mackie from the Marvel movies) meet up and bond again over the titular kung-fu fighting video game, based on the “Street Fighter” franchise.
Eleven years later, Karl, the more outgoing and impulsive one, hasn’t settled down, while the reserved Danny and his now-wife Theo have a slightly boring middle-aged marriage, being bossed around by their high-tech dishwasher. Karl gives Danny a fateful birthday gift: An immersive, virtual reality version of “Striking Vipers.” But when Danny and Karl role-play as fighters “Lance” and “Roxette” inside the game’s world, what else changes besides their handles?
Brooker has an underappreciated talent for slice-of-life pathos, steering a murky path through the workarounds of marriage and friendship. Situations here that could have easily come off ludicrous were effective thanks to the quietly believable acting. I am not a big fan of drama-mode “Black Mirror,” but this episode really worked. Episode 2, ‘Smithereens’ Grade: B
Actor Andrew Scott goes all-in as a London rideshare driver with a desperate, potentially deadly obsession with the social media company of the title. He’s on a quest to speak to company founder Billy Bauer, who is on a 10=day technology fast in Utah complete with Jesus sandals and a man-bun.
The thin, mechanistic plot is aided by a quiet, tense atmosphere. But questions about motivation become a fatal flaw. The story may have worked better five years ago when the perils of social media hadn’t become quite so baked into our digital cake. As is, “Smithereens” is an ironic victim of the show’s cultural imprint—foreseeable partly because we’ve absorbed so much “Black Mirror” over the last five years . Episode 3, ‘Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too’ Grade: A-
This is the surprise smash of series five, with a “Vox Lux” vibe, but more entertaining. Parallel themes of loneliness are experienced by world-famous pop star Ashley O (played by actual world-famous pop star Miley Cyrus) and one of her legion of teenage fans, Rachel, struggling at a new school while receiving little empathy from older sister Jack, a sullen guitar player resistant to Ashley O’s charms, and their widowed father, beavering in the basement to perfect “humane” mouse control.
As in “Striking Vipers,” things change with the arrival of a birthday gift for Rachel: A miniature stylized robot doll, branded Ashley Too, its circuits stuffed with banal paeans of encouragement and empowerment, like the star herself. Inspired by the doll to mimic Ashley O’s choreography for a school talent show, Rachel practices with amateur enthusiasm and amateur talent, leading to a scene that feels inevitable but is still heart-breaking.
When catastrophe strikes, the two stories merge and the tone abruptly changes, as various teenage movie genres start crashing into each other pell-mell. There’s a sinister Svengali crew and echoes of “The Fugitive,” making a fun farce that is goofy, corny, and crammed with incidents, demonstrating a message of individual empowerment without making an after-school special about it.
Reviewers aren’t wild about the series five package as a whole, but for me, two neat stories out of three is pretty good for late-period “Black Mirror.” Brooker made a change of pace, slowed things down a little, and got away with it."
Forum Reflects On Rising Concerns For Jews Across The World,thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/forum-reflects-rising-concerns-jews-across-world/,"By Melissa Langsam Braunstein June 12, 2019
What does it look like when our vulgar and polarized political era collides with one of American Jews’ oldest and most genteel organizations? Rather like the 2019 American Jewish Committee (AJC) Global Forum.
Last week, nearly 2,500 people representing the United States and 50 other nations gathered in Washington D.C. for the organization’s annual conference. Myriad speakers addressed issues concerning Jews across the world, reflecting AJC’s global advocacy efforts.
Those concerns, which recurred across three days of speakers, panels, and videos, included such weighty issues as the resurgence of anti-Semitism in the United States and Europe, hyper-partisanship in our politics, concerns about the misrepresentation of Jews and other minorities, a defense of values including civility, an affirmation of a community of conscience, and a discussion of whether American global leadership is in decline.
As is typical of these annual conferences, there was a star-studded lineup of speakers. However, as AJC CEO David Harris noted in his call to action this year, organizers focused more than usual on capturing the zeitgeist. So, while the conference included AJC’s hallmark bipartisanship (among speakers) and brainy bent, the event had a different feel this year. Changing Times
For example, when Jason Isaacson, AJC’s chief policy and political affairs officer, introduced Neera Tanden and Michael Anton ’s debate over whether American global leadership is in decline, Isaacson felt compelled to remind the crowd that booing would not be tolerated. I didn’t hear any booing, but having attended multiple such gatherings since 2001, I also don’t recall ever hearing such a warning before. It’s clearly a sign of the times.
Another striking change appeared in the ongoing conversation over resurgent anti-Semitism. A panel on this subject was introduced by a video that led with American examples, including assaults in Brooklyn, as well as the deadly attacks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Poway, California. AJC has been warning about this resurgence for nearly 20 years. However, even a year ago, this video and the ensuing discussion would have been laser-focused on Europe. No more .
But back to Tanden and Anton. Given how differently they view the world, they surprised me by agreeing that American power is in decline. They only differ over whether President Trump is to blame.
Tanden sidestepped Isaacson’s question about President Obama’s policy failures, instead insisting that President Trump is a chaotic leader with a go-it-alone strategy, while Obama had nations to lead. Anton defended Trump’s foreign policy decisions and tactics, including renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and threatening Mexico with tariffs, while Tanden attacked the president for undermining his own appointees and being too friendly to authoritarian leaders.
Tanden and Anton also agreed that foreign policy nostalgia is unhelpful. Anton observed that the liberal international order was so successful that the foreign policy establishment started believing it could fix anything and should last forever. However, our post-9/11 world requires an update, and that’s what Trump is hammering out. Tanden offered that we shouldn’t hold onto decades-old policies to make people feel good. Rather, our foreign policy should focus on ensuring America is strong and secure. ‘No One Is Irredeemable’
Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) talked about bills he has introduced to support Israel’s national security, as well as the resolution he is working on with Sen. Tim Kaine (D–Va.) to clearly condemn anti-Semitism; this is essentially the resolution the House should have passed earlier this year. Cruz also advised the audience that the pro-Israel community has more work to do to make the case for Israel domestically.
Sen. Rob Portman (R–Ohio) looked very much in his element as he touched on a number of topics, including the importance of American leaders condemning anti-Semitism, while eschewing partisanship. Portman described legislation he’s introduced to ensure synagogues and other religious institutions can afford necessary security.
Portman also spoke forcefully about the discrimination inherent in the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement (BDS) and the importance of opposing it in the context of bilateral trade agreements and international organizations, especially as the threat of an international blacklist of companies working beyond Israel’s Green Line looms.
As for anti-Semitism, in addition to being referenced by numerous speakers (including by some Democratic presidential hopefuls in pre-taped videos), it was addressed directly. One session specifically addressed combating white supremacy . As the moderator noted in introducing the panel, Klansmen used to hide behind hoods. By contrast, when marchers in Charlottesville chanted “Jews will not replace us!” their faces were visible.
Tony McAleer, co-founder and board chair of Life After Hate , recalled his time in the movement, surrounded by “vulnerable young men, bound by our wounds and anger.” He explained that the ideology is not what draws people in. Rather, it’s the sense of purpose, belonging, and community that comes along with it. For these reasons, we shouldn’t write them off, because “no one is irredeemable.” Anti-Semitism at Home and Abroad
A second panel featured an interview with Joan Ryan and Ian Austin, two British members of Parliament who quit the Labour Party earlier this year over its institutional anti-Semitism. Listening to Ryan and Austin describe how Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have captured their formerly center-left political party felt eerily familiar, having watched Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar lead their party sharply leftward—and toward increasing anti-Semitism—this year.
There was also a panel dedicated to the rise of global anti-Semitism , including the proposed paradox that while more European leaders condemn anti-Semitism publicly, it continues to grow increasingly common—even more than statistics reveal. Michael O’Flaherty, director of the European Union’s Fundamental Rights Agency, shared that 80 percent of these crimes go unreported because, as one person asked him, “Why would I report anti-Semitism to an anti-Semite?” There is both fear and remarkably little faith in the police or the courts to fairly address anti-Semitic crimes.
John Mann, a Labour MP, declared that “politicians need to act, not just talk.” He laid out a two-point plan to combat anti-Semitism: consequences and consistency. Without consequences for any individual or organization that engages in anti-Semitism, “It’ll spread and deepen.”
Consistent responses are also a must. Mann said Labour has been “very bad at spreading good practice and very shy at calling out bad practice,” frequently including a lack of action. He believes it’s important that all countries and civil society organizations adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance ‘s (IHRA) working definition of anti-Semitism as a way to eliminate tail-chasing arguments on the left about defining anti-Semitism and ensure that it’s combated.
While U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Elan Carr reported feeling optimistic about the global battle against anti-Semitism, O’Flaherty opined, “I’m not as optimistic. It’s getting worse.” He continued, “It’s not just a struggle for the Jewish community. It’s a struggle for the whole of our societies. Combatting anti-Semitism is a test of our civilizations. If we fail it, our civilizations have failed.”
Indeed, this is no low-stakes fight. It’s time for all people of good will to step up and help win it.

Kylie Jenner Throws ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ Birthday Party. SJWs Predictably Erupt,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/kylie-jenner-throws-handmaids-tale-birthday-party-sjws-predictably-erupt/,"June 12, 2019 By Ellie Bufkin
Over the weekend, beauty mogul Kylie Jenner threw a themed birthday soiree for her best friend. Both women are super fans of Hulu’s hit dystopian drama “The Handmaid’s Tale,” so Jenner designed the party to resemble the show’s characters and their fictional world of “Gilead.”
She gleefully posted photos on Instagram of the costumed party-goers, quoting signature lines from the series like “praise be” and “under his eye.” Attendees enjoyed cocktails served by actors hired to behave like the subdued women of the television series under flags of the show’s made-up oppressive regime. The evening concluded with a screening of the premiere of the show’s third season.

A post shared by Kylie Jenner News (@kyliesnapchat) on Jun 8, 2019 at 6:04pm PDT
For those unfamiliar with the hit show, “The Handmaid’s Tale” is based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel of the same name, which depicts a hostile overthrow of America at an undetermined point in the future. The story’s unrest began when the fertility rate dropped to the floor and only a small percentage of women could still bear children.
Following the coup, these women were kidnapped and made to wear red cloaks and bear the children of their villainous masters. The show’s protagonists are all defiant women. They face tremendous abuse in hopeless environments but still find ways to fight their oppression. Hero feminism seems like a logical pick for a birthday party for a young woman, but Jenner’s innocent celebration of her favorite television drama managed to activate the woke outrage mob.
According to many angry tweets and Instagram posts, Kylie’s choice of “The Handmaid’s Tale” for a birthday party simply did not recognize the very serious, very real-life context of the entirely fictional television show. While the show’s creators have never been unclear about the fact that their plot and characters are completely made up, numerous social media users seemed to feel that the recent wave of pro-life legislation passed in several states is a sure sign that “The Handmaid’s Tale” is going to come to life. Not that I had any before but @KylieJenner just lost all of my respect and business. The Handmaids Tale is not a joke or laughing matter. It is about the rape & oppression of women and it is happening right now in America. I have never witnessed this level of ignorance in my life
— Leah Michael (@isleahmichael13) June 9, 2019 Kylie Jenner turned her home into a little slice of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" for a party. Because nothing says celebration like the brutal oppression of women. https://t.co/8QGd0t3G2G
— HuffPost (@HuffPost) June 10, 2019 Kylie Jenner throwing her friend a Handmaid’s Tale themed birthday party complete with robes, Gilead flags, “Praised be” vodka and “Under his eye” tequila is so tone deaf, at any time, but especially when women’s rights and autonomy are particularly under attack. Disheartening.

AOC Demands Increase To Salary Already Triple The Average American’s,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/socialist-darling-aoc-reveals-true-colors-demands-increase-salary-already-triple-average-americans/,"By Ellie Bufkin June 13, 2019
For a congresswoman who has served for less than a year, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has put together an impressive list of radically socialist “greatest hits”—and she has never been afraid to share her thoughts. A democratic socialist, she is extremely popular for her ideas of economic redistribution, government-funded college, open borders, and socialized health care in the name of “ basic levels of dignity so that no person in America is too poor to live .”
Buoyed in popularity by her own perceived naivety, the congresswoman has even suggested living in a luxury apartment building should be a “ basic right ” for everyone. She sure knows how to make socialism sound great, but when asked to explain how she intends for America to provide and maintain these ideals, things get shaky.
Her best suggestion so far for funding Medicare for people under 65 was to use an extra $21 trillion she thought the Pentagon had after skimming an article in The Nation magazine. Other classic zingers include, “ unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs ,” or the “ upper-middle class does not exist anymore in America ,” or this masterpiece of critical thinking, “ Why aren’t we incorporating the cost of all the funeral expenses of those who died because they can’t afford access to health care? That is part of the cost of our system .”
So, when a funding bill came up this week that would have increased congressional salaries by $4,500, it stands fair to reason that someone who is such a fighter for economic equality, government-funded programs, and social justice would be against the pay raise. But after House Democrats pulled the line from the bill that would have implemented a 2.6 percent pay increase for lawmakers, Ocasio-Cortez was not pleased. She said :
This is why there’s so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on members’ service after people leave because, because precisely of this issue, so it may be politically convenient and it may make you look good in the short term for saying, ‘oh, we’re not voting for pay increases,’ but we should be fighting for pay increases for every American worker. We should be fighting for a $15 minimum wage pegged to inflation so that everybody in the United States with a salary, with a wage gets a cost of living increase.
Members of Congress, retail workers, everybody should get cost of living increases to accommodate for the changes in our economy and then when we don’t do that it only increases the pressure on members to exploit loopholes like insider trading loopholes to make it on the backend.
Ocasio-Cortez and almost all other members of Congress make $174,000 annually. That is nearly four times the national average of $47,000. The jettisoned $4,500 pay increase to her earnings, which, according to AOC, is “not even like a raise” is nearly 10 percent of the average national income.
Suddenly, Ocasio-Cortez went from the darling of socialism and economic equality to suggesting that voting against congressional raises would “increase the pressure to exploit loopholes and legal loopholes to kind of lean on other ways to enrich oneself through service.” She’s implying that earning four times the average salary isn’t enough to stop her and her colleagues from resorting to cronyism and graft.
She seems a world away from fighting for the people in Queens and touting $15 an hour as being a “living wage.”
This is the true face of socialism. It is a people promised that more government and more control over their lives would lead to prosperity. It is the government representatives telling you that your support will mean greater equality, dependable housing, and open access to health care and education.
As those promises turn to ash, the people like Ocasio-Cortez promising you the world ascend to the ruling class. That is why $174,000 is not enough for someone who believes in socialism as she does—she does not view herself as an equal, but as a leader.
Socialism is not free colleges, free doctors, and luxury condos for everyone—it is a contraption of pretzel logic and self-contradiction. As we have been recently reminded by HBO’s “Chernobyl,” regimes built on the Marxist foundation can’t survive without fact twisting and lies. And the result yields two sides.
There are those in power, like Ocasio-Cortez, who hold the purse strings and convince the people that the ever-creeping and expanding control the government has on its people is for their own good. Then there are the people, once promised a utopic life of government-funded care and amenities, thus crippled by a system that controls their money, their property, and their freedom.

How Ignorance Of History Feeds Demagogues Who Hate The Constitution,thefederalist.com,Robert Curry,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/ignorance-american-history-feeds-demagogues-hate-constitution/,"By Robert Curry June 13, 2019
We have forgotten so much of what Americans once knew about America. To choose just one example—a simple but telling one—there is the name of the city of Cincinnati.
For decades, I have been conducting a kind of unscientific poll. Whenever I meet someone from Cincinnati, I always say, “Cincinnati. What an interesting name that is. Do you know where it came from?” The question generally elicits a blank look. So far, no one I have asked has been able to provide the answer. (I am certain many people from Cincinnati do know the answer, but evidently many don’t.)
Please don’t get me wrong. I don’t mean to pick on the fine citizens of this great city; many of us who are not from Cincinnati can’t answer the question either.
This would have astonished Americans of the Founders’ generation and many later generations of Americans. Once upon a time, every American knew quite a bit about the men known as the Cincinnati—and about the man they were named for. That man was George Washington.
Washington was celebrated as “Cincinnatus.” He earned that name by being an astonishing example of republican virtue. Meet the Original Cincinnatus
Washington led America to victory in the American Revolution, but he did not then seize political power, as many in Europe assumed he would and as his contemporary Napoleon did after the French Revolution. In London, George III asked the American-born painter Benjamin West what Washington, having won the war, would do. West replied that it was said he would return to his farm. “If he does that,” said the king, “he will be the greatest man in the world.”
Washington did that, and he was. And then he outdid even that by giving up power yet again.
Peace concluded, Washington resigned his military commission and went home to Mount Vernon and private life in 1783, astonishing the world. He returned to public life to preside over the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and to public office when he was elected president in 1789. He served two terms as president, each time winning every vote of the Electoral College.
His campaign for the second term consisted of him not declining to serve. Americans from all walks of life sent him letters begging him to continue in office and ministers led their congregations in prayer that he would consent to serve again. He then again astonished the world by declining to serve a third term, leaving office in 1797 and retiring to Mount Vernon, a private citizen once more.
It was for these actions specifically that Washington was known as Cincinnatus. Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus was a hero of the Roman Republic. In the fifth century B.C., the Roman Senate called on Cincinnatus to lead the army of the republic against foreign invaders. After leading the army to victory, he resigned his commission and retired to his farm.
So, who were the Cincinnati? The Cincinnati were the officers who served with Washington in the Revolutionary War. They were bright with fame because they reflected the glory of their leader. In 1783, they founded the Society of the Cincinnati, and the city was named in their honor in 1790.
Not that long ago, just about any American knew as much or, even more, probably could even have named a few of the most famous Cincinnati. Today, not so much. But our forgetting is not limited to interesting historical facts. What has been forgotten includes the purpose of essential elements of the Founders’ design. The Founders’ Magnificent Creation
Take, for one example, the Senate. Many of us do not know that senators were originally chosen by the state legislatures—and this change was made not that long ago. In 1913, around the beginning of the Progressive Era, the 17th Amendment to the Constitution tossed aside this critical feature of the Framers’ design, replacing it with the direct election of senators we have today.
The Founders would certainly have opposed the 17th Amendment because they would have understood that it would throw the system they gave us completely out of balance, as it, in fact, has done. It was perhaps the single change that would do the most to undo what the Founders had accomplished by means of the Constitution.
Americans in 1913 showed by their votes they had forgotten the purpose of the Framers’ design for the Senate. We today, by and large, have even forgotten that generation’s forgetting.
The consequences of this change to America’s constitutional order have been many and profound. Probably the most obvious has been the inevitable erosion of the independence of the states and of their ability to counterbalance federal power.
The Senate was once a barrier to the passage of federal laws infringing on the powers reserved to state governments, but the Senate has abandoned that responsibility under the incentives of the new system of election. Because the state governments no longer have a powerful standing body representing their interests within the federal government, the power of the federal government has rapidly grown at the expense of the states. State governments increasingly are relegated to functioning as administrative units of today’s gargantuan central government.
The Founders would say we no longer have a federal system, that the 17th Amendment in effect overthrew the 10th Amendment. Here is the 10th: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
The 10th has become a dead letter. Instead of retaining many of their powers and responsibilities as the Framers intended, the states are more and more entangled in administering federal programs and in carrying out federal mandates. These mandates are often not even funded by the federal government; the costs of unfunded mandates fall on the states.
The many new departments of the federal government that have accumulated in Washington, D.C. during the Progressive Era in which you and I now live, such as Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education, involve themselves in, and even direct, functions the Framers left to the states. Politics Ought to Be Local and Limited in Scope
According to the Founders’ vision, American political life was to be vibrantly local and limited in scope. Our contemporary obsession with national politics, the natural result of the centralization of enormous political power in Washington, was not what they intended.
Madison and the other Founders put much emphasis on the importance of the independence of the states to the preservation of Americans’ liberty. Lord Acton, the great scholar of the history of liberty, agreed with them: “Federalism: It is coordination instead of subordination; association instead of hierarchical order; independent forces curbing each other; balance, therefore, liberty.”
Direct election of U.S. senators undermined this critically important protection of liberty. The erosion of Americans’ individual liberty that has resulted is no doubt the most important consequence of the change. Many of our troubles today are self-inflicted, the result of us forgetting how the Founders’ system was designed to work and the unwise changes we have made because of our forgetting.
Tragically, because of our forgetting, we may be on the verge of making another mistake like the one Americans made in 1913. There is a powerful movement afoot to get rid of the Electoral College, an essential constitutional safeguard of American liberty.
As you know, each state is allotted as many electoral votes as it has senators and members of the House of Representatives. To become president of the United States, one must win election state by state. Eliminating the Electoral College and electing the president by direct vote, as the progressives are determined to do, would transform the office. Its occupant would in effect become the president of the Big Cities of America, and the last vestiges of autonomy guaranteed to the individual states by the Constitution’s electoral system would be swept away.

"Media Claims Notwithstanding, Trump Is Favored To Be Re-Elected",thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/trump-is-favored-to-be-re-elected-media-claims-notwithstanding/,"By Mollie Hemingway June 13, 2019
At least six Democratic candidates would defeat President Trump if the election were held today and he’s struggling even in Texas, a pollster claims . Sen. Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and former vice president Joe Biden would trounce Trump by anywhere from five to 13 percentage points nationwide, the poll says.
Another poll said Biden and Sanders had 12-point leads over Trump in Michigan.
Media outlets such as Axios claim that Trump has a “ re-election crisis “:
Everywhere he looks, President Trump can see flashing warnings that his re-election is in serious peril, a week ahead of his official campaign launch next Tuesday in Orlando. …
Trump is betting polls will swing when it’s a choice between him and someone he can lampoon as a dumb socialist.
But, but, but: Even the self-avowed socialists are beating him — Bernie Sanders is up 12 in Michigan.
Nearly a year and a half before the 2020 election, no one knows what will happen. Perhaps Axios’ Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen and their fellow tut-tutting DC journalists are correct that Sanders really could defeat Trump in a historic nine-point landslide win.
In a more reasonable and less histrionic world than the one DC journalists inhabit, however, the truth is that Trump is a favorite to be re-elected. The polls are what the polls are, as they were in 2015 and 2016, when they showed Trump having little to no chance of winning the presidency. (Spoiler alert: he won.)
One major difference from that era is a poll of Wall Street insiders showing that more than 70 percent expect Trump to win re-election. A Goldman Sachs analysis also sees Trump’s re-election as more likely than not . These projections absolutely could be wrong, but firms such as Goldman Sachs are deeply concerned about making money for the corporation and its clients by making accurate predictions about likely future events.
One doubts that journalists crowing about Trump’s peril would take the under on a 9-point spread for Sanders over Trump, if they were betting men. The real-world situation of Trump being a favorite is not complicated. Approval records notwithstanding, the country has a strong economy, and is in an era of peace and prosperity. Incumbents tend not to be thrown out of office in such situations.
So what explains the rash of stories about Trump’s certain doom in 2020? There’s a method behind the false narrative, and one relates to the fact that the media and other members of the Resistance are invested in Trump’s destruction. In the years since Trump did the unthinkable and won, they’ve been monomaniacally focused on overturning the election or otherwise making sure, in the words of one Democratic politician, it’s a one-term aberration .
For Democrats, the media, and NeverTrump Republicans, the current situation is much worse than they anticipated when their Resistance effort began. One shared goal was to drive a wedge in the Republican Party with elected officials splitting from the president. While the Resistance counts some top Republicans in its ranks, the ones that have tested their anti-Trump message publicly with voters instead of just privately with reporters and colleagues — such as Sens. Jeff Flake and Bob Corker — have been run out of politics.
The Resistance also helped perpetuate the delusional Russia collusion conspiracy theory that gripped Washington and her institutions for the better part of two years. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe served a powerful function. For reasons he hasn’t explained, he declined to notify the American public that there was no Russia collusion until months after the 2018 election, even though investigators chatted in May 2017 with their colleagues about the lack of substance to the charge.
As a result of the ensuing hysteria and false reporting of supposed “bombshells,” many took the claims seriously, ginning up suspicion and hostility against Trump that helped propel Democrats’ takeover of the House of Representatives. But it wasn’t enough to take the Senate. That meant that the Senate confirmed the formidable and capable William Barr as attorney general — his second time in the position following his first stint in the George H.W. Bush administration.
Mueller was unable to deliver the goods in his Russia probe, ending with not a single indictment of any American or treasonous collusion with Russia. Barr, meanwhile, says he seeks to restore the credibility of the FBI and Department of Justice by getting answers about the unprecedented probe of the Trump campaign by intelligence officials.
The efforts against Trump affiliates included national security letters, wiretaps, and the use of overseas intelligence assets. The New York Times reported yesterday that CIA officials are nervous about being asked questions about their role against the Trump campaign. After years of using the false allegation that Trump was a traitor to undermine him and his administration, the media, Democratic operatives, bureaucratic resisters, and NeverTrump holdouts are now on the defensive.
The Resistance was certain that Trump would be subject to a party primary, and some worked very hard to find a legitimate candidate to primary him. A primary opponent would allow NeverTrump Republicans months or even a year of time to work with media allies in opposing Trump. Instead of a legitimate candidate, they have found Bill Weld, a former Massachusetts governor and the 2016 Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee. Everyone knows that his candidacy is not serious, and certainly not a serious threat.
Nothing has turned out the way the Resistance had hoped. Far from their fever dreams of global chaos and economic catastrophe, the Trump agenda is turning out to be surprisingly successful, whether in economic invigoration or repositioning with China. The Republican Party is, despite all the best efforts of its fervent opponents, united. The media do not want to report these fundamental issues, choosing instead to claim, as per usual, that Trump is in “crisis.”
Just because Trump is a favorite to win re-election does not mean it is automatic. Much matters on who the Democrats nominate. But there, too, they face a tough situation. They need to tap into party excitement to win, but the excitement is on the far left of the party. The current front-runner Biden may be too much like 1996 Bob Dole or 2012 Mitt Romney, neither of whom had the energy needed to unseat vulnerable incumbents.
The theory in 2012 was that dislike of Barack Obama would be sufficient for Romney to win. It was not. Alternately, Democrats could go the riskier route and nominate someone who taps into the energy of the leftist base, such as Warren or Sanders. But then there’s a question of whether Trump would throttle them and their unpopular positions in a general election match-up.
Rather than assess the race honestly, including that Trump is overseeing a healthy domestic and global situation and is currently a favorite to win re-election, the media and other Resistance members need to keep up the illusion that Trump is an aberration and in dire trouble, a narrative they would like to run through the fall of next year in the hope that 2020 will reward their efforts to influence voters in a way 2016 did not.

Will Democrats Shut Down Gov't To Force Taxpayer Abortion Funding?,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/will-democrats-shut-government-force-taxpayer-funding-abortions/,"By Christopher Jacobs June 13, 2019
Last week, the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding of most abortions, became the focus of presidential politics. First Joe Biden said he still supported the amendment , then changed his position one day later , after tremendous political pressure from farther-left Democrats.
But the press should focus less on whether Democrats support taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand. Virtually all Democrats running for president now support that position, as did the party’s 2016 national platform .
Rhetorically, Democrats sound fully in lockstep with their pro-abortion left. For instance, on Tuesday presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) called a pro-life position “not acceptable,” and equated nominating pro-life judges to “appoint[ing] a judge who’s racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic.” But with the Hyde Amendment, the real test for Biden, Gillibrand, and their fellow candidates will come in how hard they will push for its repeal. Democrats Don’t Want to Vote on Hyde
For all the focus last week on the Hyde Amendment, named after its prime advocate, the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), reporters have not focused on the Labor-Health and Human Services spending bill that the House of Representatives will consider this week. The committee-approved bill includes the following language:
SEC. 506. (a) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, and none of the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated in this Act, shall be expended for any abortion.
In other words, an appropriations bill approved by the Democratic-run House Appropriations Committee still includes the Hyde Amendment language. (Subsequent sections exempt cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother—the Hyde Amendment exceptions—from the funding ban.)
Yet the chairwoman of that Committee, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), co-sponsored stand-alone legislation (H.R. 1692) repealing the Hyde Amendment protections that she included in her spending bill. How Far Will They Go?
An appropriations bill lacking Hyde protections on taxpayer funding of abortions holds virtually no chance of becoming law, for several reasons. First, Republicans control the Senate, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will not bring a bill to the Senate floor that lacks the Hyde protections. Early last year, a move to bail out Obamacare failed because Republican leaders would not support additional funding for the law without clear protections on taxpayer funding of abortion, while Democrats would not vote for any measure that included those protections.
Even if Republicans did not control the Senate, 41 pro-life senators could filibuster any measure lacking Hyde Amendment protections, thus preventing the legislation from passing. And of course, President Trump can, and likely would, veto any appropriations bills that omitted pro-life protections on taxpayer funding of abortion.
The likelihood during this Congress of legislation passing that excludes the Hyde Amendment seems infinitesimal. Moreover, such legislation passing during the next Congress could well require 1) a Democrat to win the presidency, 2) Democrats to retake the Senate, and 3) Democrats to agree to end the legislative filibuster, which dozens of them claim they oppose. This Is All Just Failure Theater
Events in the House this week show that liberal members of Congress are essentially “going through the motions” about repealing the Hyde Amendment. Several of them, led by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), offered an amendment to strike Hyde from the spending bill. However, on Monday the House Rules Committee reported a rule for consideration of the underlying bill that did not make the amendment in order.
Ostensibly, the Democratic leadership did not allow the House to vote on the amendment because the amendment contained authorizing language, which violates House rules prohibiting the addition of unrelated matters on spending bills. But in reality, the House Rules Committee can, and does, waive such procedural restrictions when it wishes to do so. It didn’t here.
Likewise, Pressley could have omitted that authorizing language, and submitted a shorter amendment just striking the Hyde provisions. She did not—and that she did not strongly suggests that she and her colleagues wanted to give the House Rules Committee, and therefore Democratic leadership, an “out” to block consideration of her amendment.
Pressley’s office claimed “the Congresswoman believes that she and her colleagues must use every tool and tactic available to fight for reproductive justice.” But if she wanted to use “every tool and tactic,” she would have drafted an amendment without an obvious procedural flaw giving the leadership political cover to reject it. She and her liberal colleagues would also demand a vote on her amendment, and vote against the rule to consider the bill unless and until Democrats give them one.
Pressley didn’t do the former, and when the vote on the rule came on Tuesday , she and her colleagues didn’t do the latter either. Instead, she cut a deal with the leadership whereby everyone could “save face”—as evidenced by the fact that House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, on the same day he denied her amendment a vote, co-sponsored the stand-alone bill requiring taxpayer funding of abortions. Flip-Flops Ahead
The “failure theater” in the House this week demonstrates that Democratic presidential candidates currently serving in Congress may soon find themselves in a political bind. Those who criticized Biden for his Hyde Amendment flip-flop —or, as former Obama adviser David Axelrod called it, a “ flip-flop-flip ”—are going to have to flip on the issue themselves. For instance, Rep. Seth Moulton trolled Biden on Friday , asking him to change his position on the 2003 Iraq war.
In the coming months, however, Moulton will face a flip-flop decision of his own, as will the many other Democratic presidential candidates currently serving in Congress. Will they vote for spending bills that include the Hyde Amendment—as any final appropriations package almost certainly must include its provisions to get enacted into law—even though they claim to support repealing the amendment?
On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) laid the groundwork for just such a reversal. In an interview with CNN, he admitted that “sometimes in a large bill you have to vote for things you don’t like.” (That makes a good argument for Congress to stop passing massive spending bills that they don’t bother to read.)
Of course, if Democrats don’t want to flip-flop on taxpayer funding of abortion, they have another alternative: Refuse to pass any spending bills that include the Hyde Amendment provisions. If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) wants to shut the federal government down until Republican lawmakers approve taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand, well, good luck with that. But if she and her Democratic colleagues don’t want to follow that strategy, then they should get ready to explain to their constituents why they voted for legislation that retained the Hyde Amendment after promising to abolish it.
In crass political terms, Biden didn’t help his candidacy by wavering over the Hyde Amendment last week. But even though they may not yet realize it, most of his fellow presidential candidates may soon have their own flip-flop moments on taxpayer funding for abortion.

I'm HIV Positive And Oppose AIDS Research Using Aborted Baby Parts,thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/im-hiv-positive-but-i-cant-support-finding-a-cure-to-aids-if-that-means-using-aborted-baby-parts/,"By Chad Felix Greene June 13, 2019
My journey over the past 10 or so years living with HIV has been remarkable. At first, I believed I wouldn’t survive the first year. After I did, I began wondering if I could manage the next five. Later, I walked out of my doctor’s office with the realization that I no longer had a terminal illness.
Long ago, I accepted my fate—and during a particularly difficult time in my treatment, even accepted my impending death—but a small part of me always continued to hope. Every few years I would see some excited online article about the promise of a new medical breakthrough. After a while, I became numb to the enthusiasm of those around me whenever these articles were shared.
In 2008, when I was first diagnosed, I was told I had a slim chance at living long enough to be as old as I am now. Less than five years ago, my doctors were hopeful I would make it into my 50s with the promise of a new treatment that put less stress on my liver and kidneys.
Today, my HIV specialist leaves me with positive news. I am healthy, my illness is now a condition that is managed, and there is no reason to believe I won’t live a normal lifespan. My very first medication made me too sick to function. Today, I barely have any side effects.
My life today is so different that I almost can’t believe I survived those years alone. Can you imagine what it would mean for our families and friends if a cure, a genuine cure, could be found? Thus for many, seeing recent headlines that proclaimed “ Trump deals huge blow to HIV research with new policy ” was likely an incredible shock and deep horror. Aborted Fetus Tissue and Medical Research
On June 5, the Trump administration announced it would end funding to organizations that use tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research, primarily ending the practice within the National Institutes of Health. The New York Times quoted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stating, “Promoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump’s administration.” Researchers responded with shock.
Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University, warned, “It will affect everything from cures for cancer and HIV through to Parkinson’s and dementia.” Gostin continued, “The ban on fetal tissue research is akin to a ban on hope for millions of Americans suffering from life-threatening and debilitating diseases.”
The LGBT media article linked above argued that critical HIV medical research relies on using fetal tissue to test experimental treatments. It contends the practice has been ongoing since the 1930s and has been responsible for a multitude of medical advances. There are no substitutes for the research, they argue.
But should a person who believes in the equality of human life and the universal value of humanity accept that answer? Is my only hope for living a life free of HIV to rely on experimentation that uses innocent human beings brutally torn from their mothers’ wombs and tossed aside? Can I even conceive of looking at these tiny lives, erased with casual cruelty, and justify that this tissue is vital to research?
There currently may be no other viable method of testing potential HIV treatments. But can I, in good conscience, accept medical treatment that resulted from the disposal of human life?
In 1932, a medical program titled Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male conducted a medical experiment on 600 black men. Those suffering with Syphilis were intentionally denied medical treatment that could have saved their life. This was excused as a necessary means to discovering viable treatment for the disease.
The men never consented to the experiments. They were completely unaware of what was happening to them. It took decades for the medical community to recognize that this practice was morally and ethically wrong, regardless of the potential benefit to society. The use of aborted fetuses is no different. How Do We Reconcile This?
When a child is electively aborted, his or her life is determined to have little to no value, which justifies disposing of his or her body in terribly cruel ways. The only value these unborn humans are assigned is of usefulness in medical research.
This kind of neglect for humanity and arbitrary dismissal of individuality is what allowed medical professionals of the past to look at black men and believe they were justified in torturing them for what they believed to be progress. Today, as modern researchers simply view the discarded remains of a once-living human being as “leftover tissue” to experiment on, I challenge our society to argue it is in any way different.
My husband is HIV negative and I look forward to the added decades of my life with him as an unexpected and wonderful gift. I want every person diagnosed with HIV today to feel the same hope and purpose I do, bypassing the years of pain and fear I fought through to get here.
I want a cure; I want a vaccine. I want to be one of the last living humans on Earth to have had HIV. But I am not willing to exploit the countless innocent lives lost to abortion to get there. We can never evolve as a society in our views of humanity as equal and worthy of life and happiness if we believe the corpses of the most vulnerable are a necessary resource for our advancement. We simply must find another way.
Medical research is not lost. The decision to respect the human remains of the most vulnerable in our society does not end hope for those waiting for advancement in medical treatments for their illnesses. Those of us living with HIV are not doomed to never enjoy the freedom a cure could provide because President Trump has taken a profound step in recognizing the absolute value of human beings, regardless of their development.
To see so many in the medical research field argue that exploiting human beings is the only way for medical progress to continue is astonishing and disturbing. We must be better. Despite everything I have gone through, I can’t quietly ignore this atrocity for the yet-unrealized hope it could bring to me and so many others. My life is not more valuable than that of any other person on this planet. No cure is worth the cruel exploitation of human beings. Chad Felix Greene is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

"Thomas Sowell Talks About Discrimination, Race, And Social Justice",thefederalist.com,David Hogberg,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/an-interview-with-thomas-sowell-on-discrimination-race-and-social-justice/,"By David Hogberg June 13, 2019
A newly updated version of Thomas Sowell’s book, “ Discrimination and Disparities ,” came out this spring. The author and famed economist sat down with writer David Hogberg to talk about it and his life’s work.
David Hogberg: I want to read to you something that a currently very popular actress by the name of Brie Larson said at a recent awards show. She stated that, “USC Annenberg’s Inclusiveness Initiative released findings that 67 percent of the top critics reviewing the 100 highest grossing movies in 2017 were white males. Less than a quarter were white women and less than 10 percent were unrepresented men. Only 2.5 percent of those top critics were women of color. Now you’re probably thinking right now that … doesn’t represent the country I live in. And that’s true. This is a huge disconnect from the U.S. population breakdown of 30 percent white men, 30 percent white women, 20 percent men of color, and 20 percent women of color. So, why does that matter? … If you make a movie that is a love letter to women of color, there is an insanely low chance a woman of color will be able to see your movie and review your movie … We need to be conscious of our bias and do our part to make sure that everyone is in the room.”
That’s an example of the main fallacy that you expose in your book, correct?
Thomas Sowell: It’s one of the many fallacies. My God! We could play the same game with basketball and get even greater skewed representation. Blacks are the vast majority of basketball players in the NBA. That quote is downright silly.
What’s become so frustrating to me over the years is people who assume that if people or events are not evenly represented, then that’s some deviation from the norm. But you can read through reams of what scholars have written and find that nowhere is this norm to be found. You can read people like Gradell and others who have studied internationally various cultural events, and they say again and again that nowhere do they find a distribution of people who is representative of the population of the larger society.
So [people like Larson] are taking something that no one can find and making it a norm, the deviations from which should cause the government to intervene to correct this supposedly rare thing.
Hogberg: What is the “Invincible Fallacy”?
Sowell: It’s what been illustrated by the example you mentioned. It’s the belief that people would be, in the normal course of events, proportionally represented in various endeavors in the way they are represented in the general population. And if that doesn’t happen it must be some kind of negative factor like either genetics or discrimination that is causing the deviation.
What’s frustrating is that I can come up with 100 examples to the contrary, but the people who believe in the fallacy do not have to produce even one example—not one speck of evidence from anywhere in the world over thousands of years of human history that what they are asserting is the norm has ever, in fact, happened.
For example, there is a book called “Why Nations Fail” that asks, why are there such economic disparities among nations? It compared the U.S. to Egypt and asked, why has Egypt failed? The authors wrote as though what happens in the U.S. is the norm. When, if anything, what happens in Egypt is closer to a norm. In any case, they are assuming that there is this natural tendency among nations that has somehow been thwarted in Egypt and therefore we must do something about that.
Hogberg: If you were to make a list of the causes of disparities with the most important causes being at the top of the list and the least important toward the bottom, where would discrimination be?
Sowell: I wouldn’t even attempt to rank them since there are so many causes. Just one that I mention in the first chapter of the book is being the first-born child in a family. First-born children tend to have higher IQs than their siblings. They are generally more successful in all sorts of endeavors, they tend to have higher incomes—you can run through the list. There are so many reasons for disparities that to single out one reason a priori is almost madness.
Hogberg: So what impact does discrimination have?
Sowell: It can have some negative effect. But that is the whole point. When you say A has a certain effect on B, it does not mean that every time you see B you can infer A. One example wholly away from economics or politics is that some children are years late, later than most children, in beginning to talk. Some of them have very severe mental retardation. Because there are many reasons that some children begin talking late does not mean that we can say that mental retardation has nothing to do with it. But there are other children who talked late and grew up to be intelligent and in some cases geniuses like Albert Einstein.
I didn’t write a book that says discrimination has no effect. There’d be no point in my writing a whole chapter on discrimination in the book if discrimination had no effect. I did write this book to say that disparities arise from all kinds of factors.
Hogberg: Is it possible for people to face severe discrimination and still prosper?
Sowell: Yes. The Jews are a classic example. So are the overseas Chinese. Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. You could run through a long list of them.
Hogberg: How important is geography in affecting outcomes?
Sowell: Huge. Just one of the reasons it is important is the enormous difference in the cost of land transport versus water transport. One example I note in the book is that in the days of the Roman Empire you could ship cargo the length of the Mediterranean Sea, more than 2,000 miles, at a cost less than the cost of carting that same cargo 75 miles inland. So, if you lived 75 miles inland, you had nothing like the prosperity that you had on the coast.
And while modern transportation has eased some of that cost, it has by no means eliminated it. So even now, if you are born up in the mountains and someone else is born in the river valley, then the odds are huge against you of ever being as prosperous as that person born near the river.
Hogberg: Before I move on from our discussion of the Invincible Fallacy, I want to briefly talk about genetic determinism. Today, the idea that difference between races is due solely to genetics is pretty much limited to the political fringes in the U.S. But 100 years ago it was huge among the intelligentsia, correct?
Sowell: Absolutely. For example, John Maynard Keynes set up the first eugenics society at Cambridge. And there were many others—Madison Grant, Woodrow Wilson, Harold Laski, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells. In fact, just recently I was looking back over R.H. Tawney’s 1931 book “Equality.” He’s this great egalitarian who says in passing that there is proof of the genetic inferiority of certain peoples.
Hogberg: Now, regarding the practice of discrimination, in your book you note that even if, say, employers are racist and they want to discriminate in their hiring practices, there are often powerful forces that may prevent them from doing so. Can you explain?
Sowell: It depends on the context. If, for example, it is an industry operating in a labor market in which there is a chronic surplus of qualified job applicants, then it costs the employer nothing to turn away qualified applicants from groups he doesn’t like and instead hire people from groups he does like that are still qualified.
But you seldom have that in a free market because wages adjust over time. You may have temporary surpluses or shortages, but those things tend to self-correct. It is when you have something like the minimum wage law, where you raise the wage rate above where it would be in a free market. Therefore, you increase the amount of workers available to the industry but you reduce the quantity of workers that employers demand because labor is now more expensive. And so you create a chronic surplus of labor.
I go into detail about the minimum wage in the book. And what is fascinating to me is to look back to 1948, when, for all practical purposes, the minimum wage law didn’t apply because inflation had made all wages above what was specified in the law. At that time not only was unemployment as a whole a fraction of what it is today, there was no difference between the unemployment rate of black teenagers and white teenagers. Today that seems almost impossible to believe.
It’s only later on, when politicians started increasing the minimum wage to keep up with inflation and so on, that’s when the total unemployment of teenagers in general became some multiple of what it was in 1948. And that’s when a gap opened up between the unemployment rate of black teenagers and white teenagers.
So, the increase in unemployment among black teenagers was not due to racism, which was at least as great in 1948 as it is today. Rather, the cost of discrimination to the discriminator had changed. You lowered the cost of discrimination. As you would expect, you lower the cost and more is demanded.
Hogberg: There were even costs to discrimination in South Africa, correct?
Sowell: Even in South Africa. That was the classic case. And I use that example in the book instead of getting bogged down in these questions about how much racism exists and so forth. I deliberately picked the country where there is no question at all about the racism of the people in control of the country. Which is to say that the whites had openly proclaimed white supremacy. And yet in South Africa, there were occupations where the black workers outnumbered the white workers even though it was illegal to hire any black workers in that occupation. And this was not due to the white employers having different social views. Rather, the cost to them of not hiring blacks was just too high.
If I may, just the other day I came across an article about how employers setting up new factories in the United States have been deliberately locating those factories away from concentrations of black populations because they find it costlier to hire blacks than to hire whites with the same qualifications. The reason is that the way civil rights laws are interpreted, it is so easy to start a discrimination lawsuit which can go on for years and cost millions of dollars regardless of the outcome.
It makes no sense from a business standpoint to hire a black worker if a white worker can be hired with the same qualifications who can’t start a lawsuit. So what this suggests is that when you give some people special rights, those special rights have special costs, not only to other people but to the people with special rights.
Hogberg: Related to discrimination, you have a section where you note that Harlem, which was predominately white in the early 20th century, was less hostile toward blacks when it came to providing housing that blacks could afford than San Francisco is today. Please explain.
Sowell: The landlords of Harlem weren’t less hostile toward blacks, they were more hostile. The realtors and building owners were assuring the white tenants that they were not going to let any blacks move into Harlem and, thus, there was no reason for their tenants to leave. Well, as it turned out that was a bad prediction. And my point is the reason it failed was the cost to the discriminators.
Now, if every single realtor in Harlem had stood firm on not letting blacks into Harlem, then Harlem might not be black today. But even racists, who prefer one race to another by definition, tend to prefer themselves most of all. So if a landlord has a building where he is having trouble finding tenants at the prices he wants to charge, but he can find blacks willing to pay those prices, then he is not going to pass up that money. Most people would not. And once that process starts, it becomes costlier and costlier for the holdouts among landlords and realtors to continue holding out.
Now, in San Francisco, they have restricted the supply of housing by restricting the building of housing. And there is no cost—people who already own houses or apartment buildings can easily vote to restrict the building of more housing. That causes the price of existing housing to go up. So, by 2005, the number of blacks living in San Francisco was less than half of what it had been in 1970 even though the total population of the city had increased. And that’s because more and more blacks were priced out of the housing market and forced economically to leave San Francisco.
So I doubt there was anywhere near the amount of hostility toward blacks in San Francisco in the late 20th century as there was toward blacks in Harlem one hundred years earlier. But where the cost of discrimination was low, people discriminated and where it was high they had to give it up.
Hogberg: Let’s talk about crime. You write, “Statistics cited in support of claims that the police target blacks usually go no farther than showing that the proportion of black people arrested greatly exceeds the roughly 13 percent of the American population who are black.” Why is that charge misleading?
Sowell: It’s misleading because what is relevant is not the percentage of people in a population but the percentage of people who are doing a given thing, in this case committing crimes. As long as there has been data collected, the homicide rate among blacks has been some multiple of the homicide rate among whites. Among blacks and whites, murderers tend to kill people among their own race. It’s the one area where segregation still reigns. And so, therefore, the relevant comparisons are the number of black homicide victims as compared to white victims and the number of blacks arrested for homicide as compared to whites.
The media have this thing where they do not mention the race of people who commit a crime but they do mention the race of people who are punished for committing a crime. Well, just from that one inconsistency you can generate a whole range of outrageous rhetoric about how the cops are targeting blacks.
There have been studies, for example, of people who are speeding on the highway, and they show that blacks speed more than whites. Therefore, it is not at all surprising if the cops pull over more black motorists than white motorists. So the whole argument that cops are discriminating against blacks falls apart when you put facts into the equation. Unfortunately, there are lots of people who have great incentive to avoid putting facts into the equation.
Hogberg: In other books you talk about what you call the “cracker culture” among blacks. What is that, and how much does that have to do with the higher crime rates in black areas in the U.S.?
Sowell: It’s many things. It’s a culture that is far more violent. It is far less oriented around education or entrepreneurship. It puts far less emphasis on human capital. Andrew Carnegie once went down to Birmingham and saw iron ore and coal located very close to each other. He wondered why someone hadn’t thought to build a steel mill there. The transportation costs of bringing the coal and iron ore together would be relatively cheap.
But, of course, the people in Alabama were not the same as Andrew Carnegie. And even years later when they did develop a steel industry in the South, the more complicated things that had to been done with steel were still being done in Pittsburgh and Gary, Indiana and other places in the North because they did not have the same skills in the South.
Now, the white population in the American South has had a higher violent crime rate than the white population of the rest of the country. Nor is this unusual. The murder rates in Eastern Europe have for centuries been some multiple of the murder rates in Western Europe. Like so many things that should theoretically be equal, they’re not, and they never have been.
Now, of course, over 90 percent of blacks in the U.S. came out of the South at some point in history. And so it’s not surprising that they bring many of the same cultural attitudes of Southern Whites to the North, East and wherever else they settle.
There is a whole history behind these things. But whatever the history, these groups were culturally different whether they were black or white or whatever.
Hogberg: You have a section on merit versus productivity, and you discuss the difficulties in judging merit in the sense of moral worth. Can you talk about that?
Sowell: Merit is the extent to which outcomes are due to the virtues of the particular individual compared to those circumstances the individual was born into or encountered in the larger world. I find it hard to believe that anyone specifically thinks that he can separate those things out in order to tell who is meritorious. Perhaps a mass murderer would have turned out to be a humanitarian under some other conditions, but we don’t know what those other conditions would be, and we certainly don’t know how to change him from a mass murderer into a humanitarian. And so we have to deal with things as they are.
What we can judge is productivity. We do know that someone will, say, produce a certain amount of a product per hour, while someone else will produce a lot more and someone else will produce a lot less. One of the problems of the political left is that they come up with things that they want to do, but pay very little attention to the key question of can you actually do those things? For example, wealth redistribution.
Those on the political left have no question in their minds that they can determine which rich people are unworthy and thus it is justifiable to confiscate wealth from them, and which poor people are worthy and should be given that wealth. One of the key problems for such schemes is that the source of wealth is human capital—the skills and knowledge about how to generate wealth.
Human capital is inside people’s heads and it can’t be confiscated. You can confiscate money and wealth and all the tangible things that you want to, but those things wear out over time. And unless you have someone there who can generate some more, you are worse off than before.
There are countries that have gone through that process and I mention some of them in the book. Some group in a country is prospering wonderfully and then a political leader says, well they have too much, we’ll take it from them. In some cases, they expel that group and in other cases, those people flee to a different country because they are tired of people taking their wealth.
Hogberg: Let me pose a related question. In Washington, D.C., there is the Trump International Hotel, owned by Donald Trump. People who stay there are certainly lining Donald Trump’s pockets. Now, Trump is certainly not a paragon of virtue. He has not been faithful to his wives for example, and he has at one time or another associated himself with vile people like Roy Cohn. What would you say to people who say it is immoral to book a room at Trump International Hotel?
Sowell: Is it immoral to buy a Volkswagen because Hitler was one of those promoting the Volkswagen? I mean, the Trump Hotel notion is silly beyond words. Perhaps there should be a moral surcharge based on the background of Hilton or some other hotel founder before we book a room at any of them? Again, that is asking people to do something we are not equipped to do.
Hogberg: Toward the end of the book you talk about what we can learn by examining the causes of disparities among different groups, and you write, “We can learn how dangerous it is, to a whole society, to incessantly depict outcome differences as evidence or proof of malevolent actions that need to be counter-attacked or avenged.” Why is that dangerous?
Sowell: I think we’ve seen a good illustration of why it is dangerous based on what has happened in the U.S. and Britain since the 1960s. Back then, one of the big preoccupations was with countering the fact that some people had more than other people. What the political left sets out to do is one thing; what they’ve actually done is quite another.
The left has polarized whole societies. They have set the sexes against each other, the races against each other, the classes against each other. They have delegitimized moral principles, they have delegitimized law and order, and the consequences can be seen almost daily. For example, the homicide rate among black males fell by 18 percent in the 1940s and by 22 percent in the 1950s. In the 1960s, it rose by dozens of percentage points—I don’t recall the exact number. [The homicide rate among black males per 100,000 population rose about 83 percent from 1960 to 1970— Ed .]
Steven Pinker’s book on violence internationally shows that this trend in homicide rates is something that happened across the Western world at the same time. There were declines in homicide rates until 1960, and then in the 1960s homicide rates did a U-turn. They shot up to levels that hadn’t been seen since the 19th century. It was quite a coincidence. Indeed, there were many such “coincidences” of trends that were getting better and then suddenly turned around and started getting worse in the 1960s.
Now the academics who study the history of that era aren’t likely to see it since they are often too busy celebrating the 1960s. Thus, the bad ideas and their consequence are not the sorts of things academics are going to put into their books.
Hogberg: What changed in the 1960s that caused all of that?
Sowell: It is what I call the “Social Justice” vision. That is, if there are disparities, it proves that somebody was wronged by somebody else. It’s one of those things that you don’t need one speck of evidence for. It sounds so good that many people will easily buy into it.
And many people around the world have paid with their lives for that vision. Especially in communist countries where communists came to power to supposedly correct such disparities. And once the communists are in power they create problems that make the problems that came before seem like nothing.
But that’s true of the left in general. They judge their actions by the wonderful things they are trying to do and are often oblivious to the actual harm they visibly doing to society.
Hogberg: Related to that, did you follow the controversy surrounding the actor Jussie Smollett? And what impact do hate-crime hoaxes have on fomenting racial hatred?
Sowell: I’ve tried not to, but it is hard to escape. The impact certainly isn’t good. What’s amazing is how impervious some people are to evidence that the charges are hoaxes. I think back to the Duke-Lacrosse case, where people were just hell-bent on believing that this terrible crime had been committed. And counter evidence didn’t stop the prosecution or the public. Some people, activists especially, are primed to believe certain things and when they see an opportunity they run with it, facts be damned.
Hogberg: We have an epidemic of hate crime hoaxes in the nation, going back at least ten years. Do you think that has a lot to do with the social justice vision?
Sowell: Yes. Especially given that these claims are so readily believed and rewarded. You can turn in the grievances for benefits just like they were airline miles.
Hogberg: And what makes it even worse is that Smollett got off with a slap on the wrist, apparently because he is connected to someone close to former President Obama.
Sowell: Yes. And that’s one of the deadly costs of all this stuff. You eventually erode the faith people have in the law. And once people no longer have faith in the law, you cannot hire enough police officers to maintain law. When the lawbreakers are a small group, the cops can keep that under control. But once the idea that the law is just a racket becomes pervasive then society is in a very dangerous situation.
Hogberg: You write that our society has a taboo “against discussing anything that might be considered negative in the individual behavior or social culture of lagging groups” and that is “counterproductive.” Why is that taboo counter-productive?
Sowell: It is counterproductive because human beings of every conceivable background are so imperfect that to exempt anybody from criticism is not a benefit but a curse. Think of the proverbial mother who dotes on her child and makes excuses for everything he does wrong. That child is going to have some hard time in our society. The reason is that not everybody is going to be making up excuses for him. And he could even end up behind bars for a long time because he didn’t realize that people other than his mother wouldn’t make excuses for him.
Hogberg: Finally, you’ve now released a revised edition of “Discrimination and Disparities,” a book that challenges this widely held notion that most if not all disparities are due to discrimination such as racism and sexism. And yet, outside of conservative media, this book doesn’t seem to be getting any attention. Why is that?
Sowell: I think back to a time when my books were reviewed not only by The New York Times but also the New York Review of Books. These days that doesn’t happen. I can’t say definitively, but I think people find that their best strategy is to pretend my books don’t exist if they can’t answer the arguments in them. And it’s not just with my writing but also other writers who challenge the prevailing vision. Their books are not going to get reviewed because the reviewers who believe in the prevailing vision don’t have a very effective answer to that challenge.

Pinterest Whistleblower: ‘Normalization Of Censorship Within Big Tech Companies Is Un-American’,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/16/pinterest-whistleblower-normalization-censorship-within-big-tech-companies-un-american/,"June 16, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
Former Pinterest engineer Eric Cochran was fired for exposing the tech company’s bias against conservative and pro-life users on their platform. On Wednesday, Cochran joined “Tucker Carlson Tonight” to discuss definitive proof from behind the scenes that big tech is actively imposing pro-abortion views on what social media users can see and share.
“The normalization of censorship within big tech companies right now is downright un-American,” he said. “I saw this as the fight for abortion. I saw a big tech company…saying behind closed doors that they believe that Live Action shouldn’t have a platform to speak.”
Shortly after investigative reporters at Project Veritas reported what they discovered about blocklists and censorship at Pinterest, other tech companies began censoring Project Veritas. Both Twitter and YouTube pulled Project Veritas’s reporting on Pinterest from their sites.
Cochran said he believes this is a “watershed” moment, and that he hopes other pro-lifers at tech companies will come forward, forcing their employers to explicitly say they are pro-abortion so the public knows their political stances.
“Now they are in full cover-up mode as they try to protect their pro-abortion stances,” he said. “Now with YouTube doing Pinterest’s bidding by removing the Project Veritas video, you’re seeing that they are going to do whatever it takes. They are 100 percent in to protect the abortion lobby.” Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour. Follow her on Twitter ."
The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library Is Shallow But Funny,thefederalist.com,Paulina Enck,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/16/the-donald-j-trump-presidential-twitter-library-is-shallow-but-funny/,"June 16, 2019 By Paulina Enck
In 2014, businessman and tabloid celebrity Donald Trump tweeted, “Many people have said I’m the world’s greatest writer of 140 character sentences.” Now, five years later, those 140 (and sometimes 280) character sentences are immortalized (at least for the weekend) in The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library.
Trevor Noah’s pop-up museum has been fashioned as a parody of the presidential libraries, displaying Trump’s tweets in a variety of manners. The nature of the president’s Twitter feed makes the exhibit inherently humorous, although the entire exhibit relies on the one joke, which can wear a little thin.
Trump’s Twitter account is something of an anomaly. Some of his tweets announce interviews or press conferences. Others send genuine sentiments of support, such as his farewell messages to soon-to-be-former Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He sometimes weighs in on policy discussions.
Yet much of his Twitter feed is overrun with reflexive reactions to current events, pop culture, and feuds. It is these bizarre, sometimes humorous, often over-exposed tweets that make up this parody of a presidential library.
The exhibit opens with a prerecorded welcome from Noah, explaining his vision for the library, documenting “A rare moment in history, possibly the last moment in history,” in which, “thanks to Twitter, we have unprecedented access into an American president’s complicated inner life, whether we want it or not.”
After this greeting, the “library” mimics an array of museum types. Mirroring a historical exhibit, Noah presents Trump’s Twitter in five eras, pulling a few key tweets into a facsimile of historical context. Certain tweets are framed as if works of art, with descriptions underneath. An “In Memoriam,” surrounded by red roses, printed a now-deleted tweet on gold plaques: deleted, but not forgotten.
Some of the exhibits are more interactive. Using a randomizer, guests can enter their names and receive a Trump-style nickname in the vein of “Lying Ted” or “Crazy Bernie.” I was dubbed “Little Paulina,” oddly befitting my short stature.
The most popular exhibit allowed attendees to create their own Trumpian tweet in response to a given situation. This activity took place in a model Oval Office, with a golden toilet in place of a chair. Attendees have the option of wearing a bathrobe, red tie, messy blond wig, and MAGA hat, while surrounded by American and Russian flags. The activity is mildly fun, but not worth the line.
The penultimate display is a video of testimonials, with various people describing the pain and shock they experienced during the 11 minutes in 2017 when Trump’s Twitter account vanished. This video was the most original joke in the exhibit, and the only one not relying solely on Trump’s tweets being odd and funny. By the time I reached the video, I had achieved a level of fatigue with the same punch line carrying through all the jokes.
No one should go into the Twitter library assuming Noah has any intention of being non-biased, and Trump is far from his only target. While the president takes the brunt of the jokes, his family and Fox News are also mocked. One particularly pointed jab refers to “Fox and Friends” as the president’s “daily intelligence briefing.”
The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library is an unqualified success. Facing consistent hour-and-a-half long waits, people are lining up to attend. While certainly catering to a liberal crowd, anyone can enjoy the humor.
For those who dislike the president, the museum is the perfect means by which to mock him. His fans can appreciate the jokes in a tongue-and-cheek manner, laughing along with the tweets. While the entire premise rests on one joke, no one will leave the museum without laughing. Paulina Enck is an intern at the Federalist."
Americans Need To Stop Spending Abroad While We Rack Up Debt,thefederalist.com,Eduardo Lachica,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/17/americans-need-stop-sending-money-abroad-rack-trillions-debt/,"By Eduardo Lachica June 17, 2019
In his pique over unfair trade, Prcsident Trump is prone to bewail America’s as the “piggy bank that everybody wants to steal from.” Critics might dismiss this as just another whiff of Trumpian hyperbole, but it calls attention to a serious question about the country’s fiscal adequacy. Is there enough in that piggy bank for America to take care of its citizens, grow the economy, and defend itself?
The “piggy bank” analogy captures our concerns not only about trade, but also about national security and immigration. The bank was full when America was truly “great” in the Trumpian sense. This, of course, was the America that built the mighty war machine that vanquished Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, emerging as the world’s sole superpower with a moral obligation to help raise the war-torn countries back on their feet.
There were then enough dimes and nickels to fund the Marshall Plan—some $12 billion, or more than $100 billion in today’s dollars—which helped rebuild the European democracies. America also set up what the National Bureau of Economic Research called a “unique and asymmetrical” U.S.-centered network of alliances that required Washington to “guarantee the safety of multiple allies without requiring the protected parties to make any reciprocal commitments…in return.”
These arrangements were complemented by an equally asymmetrical trading system in which America’s huge and insatiable market absorbed much of the region’s industrial products without reciprocal access for U.S. products to Asia’s markets. This is how the ever-growing U.S. trade deficits with Japan, China, and other East Asian economies got started. At Some Point, the Piggy Bank Goes Empty
But this open-handed generosity could not last forever. The American fiscal surplus turned into ever-growing deficits. The emptying of the piggy bank can be blamed equally on Republican and Democratic administrations that lacked the will and the courage to slow the growth of entitlement programs. The trillion-dollar wars the two Bush presidencies started made the problem worse, but so did the Obama administration that doubled the fiscal deficit in just eight years.
Long before Trump even contemplated a presidential run, other voices were sounding a lot like him. In the 1990s, Brent Bozell, a young conservative activist, groused about America making out as “the world’s social worker.” Kevin Kearns, a Republican, recounted how the U.S. made incredible sacrifices to win the Cold War. “It’s time for peace dividends,” he said. “I’d call on our allies to help us rebuild our economy.”
Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who made a third-party bid for the White House in 1992, is best remembered for his warning of a “giant sucking sound” that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) could make as American companies closed their plants and poured capital into Mexico.
The establishment paid no heed. More than 300 economists of all persuasions, including several Nobel Prize winners, signed a petition urging NAFTA’s passage. The pact got a larger winning margin in the House than expected, 234-200, and a comparable 61-48 vote in the Senate. The lost American jobs left a big hole in U.S. Treasury accounts.
It took Trump, an economic naif to his critics, to call attention to the strategic costs of America’s $800 billion trade deficit. One country exporting more goods to another than it can import from that country, of course, does not constitute theft, per se. The matter of unfairness enters only if the trade surplus is obtained by currency manipulation or impediments to exports from the deficit-bearing partner. What constitutes prima facie theft is the $300 billion or more in intellectual property that the United States has lost to China through patent violations, espionage, and compulsory technology transfer.
If a growing trade surplus also contributes to a buildup of foreign exchange reserves, as with China, that would directly affect the global power balance. China has used its reserves—$4 trillion at its peak, with much of them in U.S. Treasuries—to buy influence from infrastructure-needy countries. The United States, a debtor nation with a fiscal deficit pushing $22 trillion, can no longer be big daddy to the world and has to husband its resources more judiciously. Looking at the Fiscal Implications of Our Policies
Even immigration policy has serious fiscal implications. The administration wants to halt the flow of asylum-seekers on the borders because of its costs to the operations of federal agencies and the communities forced to shelter these border jumpers. One inkling of the potential fiscal drain is the $98 million per year price of California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s health care program for about 90,000 illegally present young adults.
The same issue of affordability lies behind Trump’s preference for merit-based migration, which puts entrepreneurs and skilled professionals at the head of the line. They are likely to be productive, high-earning citizens whose efforts can add to the nation’s wealth.
The current policies favoring migrants sponsored by relatives already in the United States or picked by lottery won’t affect the fiscal situation as positively. These migrants may pay taxes, too, but some of their earnings are not spent here, and instead passed to relatives left behind. Guatemalan migrants accounted for the bulk of the $9.3 billion in remittances their native country received in 2018. A positive take from this is that it’s one way the United States can help alleviate poverty in Central America.
Back to the trade front, the stakes are so high that retaliatory tariffs, cringe-worthy though they might be to Chicago School economists, could be a justifiable recourse (if of limited scope or duration) since there is no other way to bring the other party to the negotiating table. This is the rationale behind the president’s latest deal with Mexico.
Trade remedies, however, can get the country only so far. It is widely accepted that technology causes more job losses than unfair trade does. The job gains from the 2018 Trump tax cuts are encouraging, but more corporate and government-funded research and development are needed to keep up with the Chinese.
More investments are also in order. Both the Trump administration and the House Democrats should be reminded of their commitments to infrastructure renewal before their attention is wholly taken up by 2020 electioneering.

Trump Administration Gets Smart On Pre-Existing Conditions,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/17/trump-administration-gets-smart-pre-existing-conditions/,"By Christopher Jacobs June 17, 2019
Last Thursday afternoon, the Trump administration released its final rule regarding Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs). The 497-page document will take lawyers and employment professionals weeks to absorb and digest fully. But in a nutshell, the rule will help to make coverage more portable and affordable—while also going a long way to resolve the problem of pre-existing conditions.
As I first explained when the administration proposed this HRA rule back in October, much of the problem surrounding pre-existing conditions revolves around portability. Because most Americans don’t own their own health coverage—their employers do—when people lose their job, they lose their health coverage. The pre-existing condition problem emerges when people develop a costly medical condition while at one job, then have to switch jobs or otherwise leave their employer plan.
Solving the portability problem—allowing health coverage to go from job to job—would go a long way towards solving the pre-existing condition problem. Of course, Democrats don’t talk about solving the portability problem because they don’t want to solve it. They want the government to control everything through a single-payer health care system . That’s why they spend so much time talking about a symptom (people with pre-existing conditions who can’t get coverage) rather than the underlying disease (coverage not being portable).
But if people owned their own insurance policies, they could change jobs easily, without fear of losing their coverage. Moreover, they would get to pick the kinds of benefit designs and doctor networks they want, rather than being stuck with what their employer picks for them.
The final rule accomplishes both objectives. It enhances portability by allowing employers to give their workers a (tax-free) contribution to an HRA, so employees can buy the plan that works best for them. If there’s any difference between the employer’s contribution and the total premium—for instance, an employer contributes $300 per month, and the worker selects a plan with a $350 monthly premium—the worker can pay the difference on a pre-tax basis , so long as he purchases the plan outside of the Obamacare exchanges. Best of all, because employees own the plans and not the employer, they can keep their coverage when they change jobs.
This change also improves affordability, in two key respects. First, individuals can buy just the coverage they want , rather than the coverage their employer gives them. Currently, if an employer plan offers particular benefits that an employee does not value, or a provider network a worker does not need, the worker can only buy an alternative plan by forfeiting their employer’s subsidy towards their health insurance—an unattractive and irrational option for most. The HRA option will allow workers to retain their employer’s subsidy, yet purchase more tailored coverage.
Second, more people purchasing coverage individually will create a more robust marketplace, increasing competition. Carriers may move into the market for individual coverage, and even create new options to attract additional business—both changes that will help consumers, and mitigate premium increases.
The final rule does include important safeguards to ensure that businesses don’t just try to “dump” their sickest employees onto individual insurance plans, raising premiums on the Obamacare exchanges. Most notably, if they elect the HRA option, firms must apply it to an entire class of workers —for instance, all full-time workers, or all workers in a certain geographic area. Moreover, employers cannot vary their contributions to workers’ HRAs, except by the employee’s age and number of dependents.
The rule could eventually lead to dramatic changes in Americans’ health-coverage options, but it includes provisions designed to phase those changes in over time. Under the rule, employers cannot offer traditional group health coverage to any class of workers that has access to an individual coverage HRA. In other words, employers can choose the “new” HRA model to deliver benefits to their workers, or the “old” (i.e., existing) model for their workers, but not both (at least not for the same class of workers).
However, the final rule also includes a critically important grandfathering provision , which will provide businesses the option for a smoother transition. Under this provision, an employer can apply the HRA model to new hires, while allowing existing employees to maintain their traditional group insurance. For instance, an employer could state that any worker joining the firm after the HRA rule takes effect (on January 1, 2020) would receive health coverage using the new rules, while current workers would remain on the firm’s existing employer plan.
The HRA rule represents the last element of President Trump’s October 2017 executive order on health care (the others being short-term insurance and Association Health Plans )—and potentially the most significant. The HRA coverage option presents a “win-win” for both employees and employers: Workers get portable insurance, and the chance to select their own plan, while businesses (particularly small businesses) that select this option can avoid the paperwork and bureaucracy that comes with running a health plan for their employees.
Conservatives concerned about pre-existing conditions should study this rule closely, and cite it every time the left mounts political attacks over the issue . Liberals want the government to control all of health care, as evidenced by their single-payer push . Conversely, conservatives want doctors and patients to make their own health-care decisions. Last week’s HRA rule will accomplish just that. Chris Jacobs is founder and CEO of Juniper Research Group, and author of the forthcoming book, "" The Case Against Single Payer .""

Teddy Roosevelt Taught Us How To Break Up Monopolies Like YouTube,thefederalist.com,Jonah Gottschalk,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/17/teddy-roosevelt-taught-us-break-monopolies-like-youtube/,"By Jonah Gottschalk June 17, 2019
As many have heard, YouTube started another wave of controversy last week by demonetizing the largest conservative commentator on the platform, Steven Crowder . The events came to a head last week, with the CEO of the platform issuing a dramatic personal apology to LGBT people.
Crowder, a comedian and pundit nearing 4 million subscribers, is known in particular on YouTube for his Vox rebuttals. In them, he takes down video essays by the MSNBC-funded corporation point by point. Carlos Maza , the producer of the video essays, claimed Crowder’s attacks on him were racist and homophobic harassment. Rather than taking his feud to Crowder, he chose to report to Big Brother, and demanded that YouTube ban Crowder from the platform.
The controversy (an in-depth look can be found here ) was caused by Crowder’s boorish jokes. The comedian is known for his rude ribbing of public figures from Justin Trudeau to John Kasich. While I disliked the way he spoke, there can be no denying that the comments were jokes. Those aimed at Maza went no farther than what Crowder frequently does to guests on his show, coworkers, and even friends of his, like Ben Shapiro.
YouTube initially came to the same conclusion, reporting that, though it does not agree with the tone of Crowder’s videos, they do not violate the platform’s policies. Then came the mob.
Under increasing pressure from several left-leaning media outlets and outraged Twitter users, YouTube quickly caved. Within a day, its leaders had seemingly changed their minds and now decided the videos did violate YouTube policy, and thus would be demonetized. YouTube cited “widespread harm to the YouTube community” caused by the videos.
What harm was that? Crowder has never encouraged violence of any kind. The “damage” was merely causing offense. What kind of standard is that? If an offended internet mob is all it takes to strip a channel of its ability to collect revenue, then it’s only a matter of time before others will be targeted.
This is important because, uncomfortable as it can be to acknowledge, tech giants like Google, which owns YouTube, wield immense power over our lives. Last year, Pew Research found that the amount of Americans getting their news from traditional cable news was in sharp decline, with only 28 percent reporting they often get their information from cable news.
YouTube, on the contrary, just logged its highest number of viewers ever, at more than 1.9 billion . In the United States, about 60 percent of the population is logged in and using the platform. That’s more than twice the reach of all of cable news combined.
Unsurprisingly, many of these viewers use the platform to watch videos on politics. Conservative creators have been immensely successful there, gaining a large Gen X and millennial audience that otherwise would have struggled to find honestly portrayed conservative viewpoints. With such a vast viewership, and its power to demonetize or deplatform at will, YouTube wields staggering influence over what information the average American will, or won’t, hear about.
YouTube is clearly in the wrong in this controversy. It made a judgment based on its rules, then backtracked after taking fire from the left. It then established a new standard for demonetization based on offense rather than content, which can and will be used in the future for similar situations. Considering how powerful YouTube is today, we should be concerned about this mishandling of power. Now the question becomes what, if anything, can be done about it. We Couldn’t Break Big Tech Up If We Tried
In a regular market, the answer would be simple. Since many are unsatisfied with the service YouTube provides, they could simply switch to another firm, which would offer a better service. Each consumer could choose the forum that provided the service he or she was happiest with, and not bother the others.
This is complicated due to the fact that YouTube is, to an extent, a monopoly. The reason it dominates is simple: convenience. Pew has found that people in the Digital Age place remarkable value on convenience, prioritizing it above even privacy. And it simply isn’t efficient to have two YouTubes. Having all of the content creators on the same free and easily available platform, which you can access through your Google account, is, of course, preferable to going back and forth between dozens of sites to see different content on each.
Let me give you an example of YouTube’s dominance. Trying to find any potential competitors, I tried searching “YouTube competition” on Google. The first result was a Daily Dot article titled “Meet the 5 Companies Trying to Beat YouTube at its Own Game.” It was from 2014.
Of the five, one is out of business. One (Comcast) gave up and now hosts YouTube on its networks instead. One never even materialized. The most successful of the five, and YouTube’s largest “competitor ,” French Daily Motion, has less than 1 percent of YouTube’s audience, and appears to be stagnant.
For any competition to realistically arise, they’d need to convince millions of content creators and viewers to leave for them, a herculean task. Every company that has tried has failed. It is here we must bring in Roosevelt. Lessons From the Gilded Age
There are striking similarities between what is happening today and what happened in a period of American history known as the Gilded Age. As the United States industrialized, business boomed in new markets such as railroads and oil.
However, after a period of extreme innovation, a few major companies came to dominate the new fields . These monopolies, or “trusts,” squeezed out competition, froze innovation, and wielded large power over the public sphere. These included giants such as Rockefeller’s Standard Oil and Carnegie’s U.S. Steel.
In the 19th century, the Republicans were known as the pro-business party, much like they are today. Yet it was them, under the lead of President Teddy Roosevelt , who spearheaded the charge to stop the monopolies’ abusive practices, using a policy of “trust-busting.” This included using a variety of techniques , such as breaking up the worst offenders and regulating others to prevent abuse of their power. It worked.
Perhaps it was even because they were the pro-market party that enabled the Republicans to act so successfully. By not being beholden to more radical elements, they could reform in a way that replaced market monopolies with competitive markets. More radical elements likely would have replaced market monopolies with government monopolies. How to Trust-Bust YouTube and Facebook
Much like Americans at the dawn of the 20th century, we’re living through an era of technological upheaval. Again, a few giants have used their early starting position to solidify a position of unhealthy power over both the market and society as a whole. The Republican Party is in a unique position today.
Like Teddy Roosevelt before us, we can craft a bipartisan solution that can restrain the power of giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, while ensuring more innovation through a freer market. Like “trust-busting” during Roosevelt’s presidency, we’ll have to handle each giant differently.
For Facebook, simply breaking it up may be the best strategy, as recently argued by none other than its co-founder Chris Hughes. Google, which owns YouTube, wields similar power and may also require a full “trust-bust.” As pointed out by the Department of Justice’s anti-trust chief Makan Delrahim, the scale of its buying power has limited innovation, and this will continue as long as Google exists in its current state.
YouTube, then, could be separated from Google. Yet this may not alone be enough. As the platform would still dominate its market, the problems discussed earlier would continue. An additional step of either labeling it as a publisher or placing some basic regulations upon it to restrain its worst impulses would help there.
The influence of tech giants over the American people has grown exponentially over the last few years, and we have every right to be concerned. On the path we’re on, problems like demonetizing Crowder will soon seem minor. But by looking to history, we can recognize that such problems have happened before and that we have the power, like Roosevelt before us, to stop them before they get out of hand.

In May, however, the university contacted Kashuv demanding an explanation for his use of the word “n—-r” in messages with friends when Kashuv was 16 that were leaked to media after he became a prominent advocate for gun rights. The messages occurred months before the Parkland massacre that left 17 dead and 17 wounded, and which Kashuv said “forced me to mature and grow in an incredibly drastic way.”
The Huffington Post published leaked text and Skype messages from a former student and a current student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School dated in late 2017 and early 2018 showing Kashuv using racial slurs.
“[She] goes for n—-rjocks,” Kashuv texted one student. Another instance shows Kashuv repeating the N-word in all caps on a midterm study guide where he wrote that he is “really good at typing n—-r ok like practice u makes perfect.” Huffington Post did not release the identities of the fellow students who sent them the incriminating messages.
As the comments came to light, Kashuv immediately apologized and offered Harvard a lengthy explanation and apology as political opponents urged the university to rescind his admission. Kashuv also reached out to Harvard’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion to seek help on navigating the situation and how to make things right.
“I am deeply sorry for my past comments, I know I am not the same person,” Kashuv wrote to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. “During my gap year, I will supplement my activism to include reaching out to minority communities. I am open to any advice or suggestions on activities I might pursue during my gap year in pursuit of that goal.”
Kashuv’s apology, explanation, and outreach efforts weren’t enough for the university, which ultimately revoked his admission. Following the university’s decision, Kashuv requested an in-person meeting with university officials, which they rejected.
Kashuv emerged on the national spotlight following the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. While many of Kashuv’s classmates became staunch advocates for gun control in the shooting’s aftermath, Kashuv became a leading figure advocating for gun rights and served as a national staff member for Turning Point USA before stepping down from the conservative organization earlier this year.

Teen Vogue Encourages Children To Explore Prostitution As A Career,thefederalist.com,Chrissy Clark,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/17/teen-vogue-encourages-children-explore-prostitution-career/,"June 17, 2019 By Chrissy Clark
On April 26, Teen Vogue posted an article titled “Why Sex Work is Real Work” by Dr. Tlaleng Mofokeng. Teen Vogue tweeted the article out again today. Yes, sex work is real work! https://t.co/v9T3b7eBj6
— Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) June 16, 2019
The author, who is also the founder of Nalane Reproductive Justice , explains why she believes sex work should be decriminalized.
“The idea of purchasing intimacy and paying for the services can be affirming for many people who need human connection, friendship, and emotional support,” Mofokeng said.
What drew outrage, beyond the obvious, was that the article was published in Teen Vogue, a magazine targeted toward 13-year-old girls.
This article reduces the work of a medical professional to that of a sex worker. In her piece, Mofokeng questions why having a medical degree to talk about sex-related problems differs from physically performing sexual acts. Both are a transfer of cash, therefore both ought to be legal.
With that line of logic, we should legalize all drugs because doctors give out drugs; therefore crack dealers should be allowed to give out drugs. They’re both a transfer of cash, after all.
Mofokeng elaborated:
“I find it interesting that as a medical doctor, I exchange payment in the form of money with people to provide them with advice and treatment for sex-related problems; therapy for sexual performance, counseling and therapy for relationship problems, and treatment of sexually transmitted infection. Isn’t this basically sex work? I do not believe it is right or just that people who exchange sexual services for money are criminalized and I am not for what I do. Is a medical degree really the right measure of who is deserving of dignity, autonomy, safety in the work place, fair trade and freedom of employment? No. This should not be so. Those who engage in sex work deserve those things, too.”
Why would a topic of such moral ambiguity be promoted by a magazine for teenagers?
When I was younger, I used to pick up an issue of Teen Vogue before I would head over to the neighborhood pool. The magazines were filled with trendy models and articles about Selena Gomez. The biggest scandal, from what I can recall, was the Selena Gomez-Justin Bieber break up. How did a magazine that used to dish about celebrity scandals choose a topic as perverted as sex work to preach to young women about?
Not only was the article was tasteless, given the audience, but it also failed to talk about legitimate problems with consensual prostitution and closely-related sex trafficking: I don't doubt that a small % of women enter into sex work consensually. But it is beyond selfish for @TeenVogue to prioritize their needs & desires above the needs & desires of women who are victims of this industry—women (and girls) who are trafficked, abused, and desperate. https://t.co/PZ6REWnT0N
— Kelsey Bolar (Harkness) (@kelseybolar) June 17, 2019
This article was a slap in the face to those young women who are trafficked and abused at skyrocketing rates . Between 2010 and 2015, there was an increase of reported child sex trafficking by 846 percent .
In 2014, the Department of Justice reported that more than half of sex trafficking victims are 17 years old or younger. While Teen Vogue is pushing a sex liberation agenda on young women, they are bypassing the unfortunate truth that some of their readers may become victims of this industry.
Promoting unlimited, legal prostitution is not freeing and not something that we should be promoting to young women, especially during a time when women are doing exceptionally well in America and the doors are opening for women in all job fields. In fact, 70 percent of people see the wide-ranging benefits of female leadership. Why should we open up avenues for women to fall into the dangerous clutches of sex work—or worse, sex trafficking—when the working woman’s opinion is of such value?
We should not be promoting a sex liberation narrative to 13-year-olds. We should be teaching 13-year-olds about community, family, careers, literally anything else. You would think a doctor would know that.
It is unimaginable how someone would promote such a skewed ideology of feminism to such a vulnerable readership. Chrissy Clark is a staff writer at The Federalist. Follow her on social media @chrissyclark_ or contact her at [email protected] Photo David Holt/Google Images "

California Embodies Everything Wrong With Obamacare,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/california-embodies-everything-wrong-obamacare/,"By Christopher Jacobs June 18, 2019
In recent days, California lawmakers have finalized their budget . The legislation includes several choices regarding health care and Obamacare, most of them incorrect ones. Doling out more government largesse won’t solve rising health costs, and it will cause more unintended consequences in the process. Health Coverage for Individuals Unlawfully Present
This move has drawn the most attention, as the budget bill expands Medicaid coverage to illegally present adults aged 19-26. California will pay the full share of this Medicaid spending, as the federal government will not subsidize health coverage for foreign citizens illegally present in the United States.
Sad as it may sound, expanding coverage to “only” some law-breaking foreigners represented a compromise. Liberal lawmakers originally wanted to expand Medicaid to all illegal residents, at a cost of $3.4 billion . But California Gov. Gavin Newsom objected to the price tag, so lawmakers agreed to fund benefits solely for the 19-26 population, and delayed its implementation until January 1, 2020 .
As to those who disagree with this move, one can study the words of none other than Hillary Clinton . In 1993, she testified before Congress in opposition to giving illegal residents full health benefits, because “illegal aliens” were coming to the United States for health care even then:
We do not think the comprehensive health care benefits should be extended to those who are undocumented workers and illegal aliens. We do not want to do anything to encourage more illegal immigration into this country. We know now that too many people come in for medical care, as it is. We certainly don’t want them having the same benefits that American citizens are entitled to have.
If Clinton’s words don’t sound compelling enough, consider one way that California may finance these new benefits: By reinstating Obamacare’s individual mandate. To put it another way, people who obey the law (i.e., the mandate) will fund free health coverage for people who by definition have broken the law by coming to, or remaining in, the United States unlawfully. A Questionable Individual Mandate
This issue faces multiple questions on both process and substance. First, the budget bill includes about $8 million for the state’s Franchise Tax Board to implement an individual mandate, but doesn’t actually contain language imposing the mandate. The bill that would reimpose the mandate, using definitions originally included in the federal law, passed the Assembly late last month, but faces opposition in the Senate.
Second, if and when the state Senate considers the individual mandate, it faces a further obstacle: The California Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to approve any tax increases. (The legislation did clear that threshold in the Assembly, which passed the bill by a 55-18 margin.) Newsom’s office claims that, because the mandate reinstates a penalty that the federal government originally imposed, the legislation requires only a simple majority for enactment. But if the Senate passes the bill by less than a two-thirds majority, expect a legal challenge on this issue.
Third, implementing the mandate imposes legal and logistical challenges. I argued in the Wall Street Journal last fall that states cannot require employers who self-fund health coverage to report their employees’ insurance coverage to state authorities. The mandate bill the Assembly passed does not include such a requirement.
Without a reporting requirement on employers, a mandate could become toothless, because the state would have difficulty verifying coverage to ensure compliance—people could lie on their tax forms and likely would not get caught. However, imposing a reporting regime, either through the mandate bill or regulations, would invite an employer to claim that federal labor law (namely, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act) prohibits such a state-based requirement. More Spending on Subsidies
While the budget bill does not include an explicit insurance mandate, it does include more than $295 million to “provide advanceable premium assistance subsidies during the 2020 coverage year to individuals with projected and actual household incomes at or below 600 percent of the federal poverty level.”
This language creates a state-based regime of exchange subsidies on top of Obamacare’s subsidy regime. According to the bill, one-quarter of the spending would go towards individuals with incomes between 200-400 percent of the poverty level—who already qualify for subsidies under Obamacare—while three-quarters would go towards individuals with incomes between 400-600 percent of the poverty level, who do not qualify for federal Obamacare subsidies.
Obamacare epitomized the problems that policy-makers face in subsidizing health insurance. The federal law includes a subsidy “cliff” at 400 percent of the poverty level. Households making just under that threshold can receive federal subsidies that could total as much as $5,000-$10,000 for a family, but if their income rises even one dollar above that “cliff,” they lose all eligibility for those subsidies.
By penalizing individuals whose incomes rise even marginally, the subsidy “cliff” discourages work. That’s one of the main reasons the Congressional Budget Office said Obamacare would reduce the labor supply by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs.
California decided to replace these work disincentives with yet more spending on subsidies. This year, the federal poverty level stands at $25,750 for a family of four—which makes 600 percent of poverty equal to $154,500. In other words, a family making more than $150,000 will now classify as “low-income” for purposes of the new subsidy regime.
Extending the subsidies up the income scale, thereby phasing them out more slowly, minimizes work disincentives, but it also raises spending on subsidies. In fact, the budget bill includes specific language authorizing state officials to increase the appropriation beyond the $295 million amount, if necessary, to pay for the full cost of the new subsidy regime. California could end up with a rude awakening at this provision’s full cost. Hypocrisy by Officials
The individual mandate bill gives a significant amount of authority for its implementation to Covered California, the state’s insurance exchange. The bill says the exchange will determine the amount of the mandate penalty, and determine who receives exemptions from the mandate.
Who runs California’s exchange? None other than Peter Lee, the man I previously profiled as someone who earns $436,800 per year , yet refuses to buy the exchange coverage he sells. Or, to put it another way, if the mandate passes, Lee will be standing in judgment of individuals who refuse to do what he will not—buy an Obamacare plan.
If you think that seems a bit rich, you would be correct. But it epitomizes the poor policy choices and hypocritical actions taken by officials to prop up Obamacare in California.

Southern Baptist Convention Supports Anti-Christian Racial Identity Politics,thefederalist.com,Matthew Garnett,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/last-minute-move-southern-baptist-convention-supports-anti-christian-racial-identity-politics/,"By Matthew Garnett June 18, 2019
The largest Protestant denomination in North America, the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), officially adopted “critical race theory” and “intersectionality” as “analytical tools” to be used in fostering racial reconciliation in the church. These key drivers of identity politics, however, are more likely to produce racial discord and strike at Christianity itself.
Before we get to why, let’s look at how it happened. The convention adopted “ Resolution Nine— On Critical Race Theory and Intersectionality” during its annual meeting last week. The resolution instructs Southern Baptists that while these “tools of analysis” can be employed, it must be done in subordination to the Bible.
The Committee on Resolutions, chaired by Dr. Curtis Woods of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , took just more than an hour directly before the meeting’s scheduled dinner break to pass some 13 resolutions, including resolution nine. The committee spent the first 45 minutes on resolutions one through eight. Then the meeting’s chair and SBC president, Pastor J.D. Greear, called for a motion to pass resolutions nine through 13 as a package.
Because the meeting follows strict parliamentary rules, the chair’s suggestion could only be done without objection. Only resolutions 11 and 13 were left as a package; Nine was the first to be ferreted out for debate as a stand-alone resolution. By the time this was done, the time allotted for the Committee on Resolutions had expired. Greear then extended the debate time.
Angela Um presented resolution nine. As she approached the microphone, she said, “Oh boy…here we go,” before making the motion to adopt the resolution. She then directed the messengers to read the resolution in a pre-printed handout and moved that the resolution be adopted.
During debate, Pastor Tom Ascol offered a friendly amendment that stated that critical race theory and intersectionality are incompatible and indeed antithetical to Christianity. The amendment was rejected as “friendly” by Woods and defeated soundly when put to a vote on the floor. As he rejected the motion, Woods stated, “critical race theory and intersectionality are simply analytical tools…they are to be used as a tool, not as a worldview.” Critical Race Theory Is Flat-Out Anti-Christian
But that’s simply not true. Critical race theory is essentially literary deconstruction applied to culture, politics, and economics. According to Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstructionism, it is impossible for people to understand one another. They can only come up with their own interpretations of what others say. Thus, Derrida encouraged his students to identify in any work of literature a “binary.” That is, a pair of characters or groups of characters that often are at odds.
Next, the reader is taught to identify the “privileged” individual or group and the “marginalized” individual or group in the story. Then, the reader “subverts” the binaries and assigns more virtue to the “marginalized,” then re-reads the story from that angle. Finally, the reader attempts to understand the story where the binaries are so subverted as to lose all meaning.
The most obvious example of this applied to politics and culture currently is critical feminist theory. The transsexual movement is the perfect example of the final step in the deconstruction of the terms “male” and “female.” Here these terms only mean what any given individual wants them to mean. They have absolutely no objective meaning.
If traditional Christianity is anything, however, it is utterly dependent on objective truth claims. It cannot survive if truth becomes merely based on one’s lived experience, or relativism. For critical theorists, the notion of truth doesn’t exist. What is true is what subverts.
If a certain way of looking at the world disrupts the status quo, then that viewpoint is true for the critical theorist. Despite that, we have the SBC, normally known for its strict adherence to the objective truth claims of the Bible, endorsing this approach as legitimate. Southern Baptist Leaders Respond Strongly
In his latest edition of “ The Briefing,” the influential Dr. Albert Mohler , president of Southern Theological Seminary, said of the resolution:
Ideas, as we know, do have consequences…the main consequence of Critical Race Theory is Identity Politics. And Identity Politics can only rightly be described as antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We have to see Identity Politics…as nothing less that devastating to the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ.”
According to Pastor Tom Buck (who spoke against the resolution during debate), Mohler was breaking what Southern Baptists refer to as the 11th Commandment. It goes something like, “Thou shalt not publicly criticize a fellow Southern Baptist brother in good standing with the convention.” According to Buck, for Mohler to openly criticize one of his own faculty members should cause all members of the SBC to sit up and take notice.
Buck also opined that the whole proceeding was “very weird” for a normal meeting of the SBC. He had never before seen controversial resolutions lumped together like this at the eleventh hour of a committee report. Buck says that it was, at the very least, a gross mismanagement of the meeting’s time.
Resolution nine, as it was presented to the meeting, was a heavily edited version of a resolution originally presented to the committee by Pastor Stephen Feinstein of Sovereign Way Christian Church. His original resolution included provisions echoing Ascol’s “friendly” amendment. In the original resolution, the language condemns critical race theory and intersectionality in no uncertain terms:
critical race theory and intersectionality are founded upon unbiblical presuppositions descended from Marxist theories and categories, and therefore are inherently opposed to the Scriptures as the true center of Christian union…both critical race theory and intersectionality as ideologies have infiltrated some Southern Baptist churches and institutions—institutions funded by the Cooperative Program…critical race theory upholds postmodern relativistic understandings of truth and…divides humanity into groups of oppressors and oppressed, and is used to encourage biblical, transcendental truth claims to be considered suspect when communicated from groups labeled as oppressors.
Clearly, all such condemnatory language was struck, and the “analytical tools” were held up and codified as “useful” by the committee so long as they were subordinate to the Bible. Put simply, Feinstein’s original resolution—condemning these philosophies—was transformed by the committee to endorse them. Note that Feinstein is, like Mohler, breaking the SBC’s “11th Commandment.” What On Earth Is Going on with These Southern Baptists?
Given all of this, there are several possibilities. First, the majority of the meeting might simply be ignorant of the implications of the philosophies grounding critical race theory and intersectionality. Secondly, it could be that while the messengers are ignorant, they are being taken advantage of by a small (but vocal) minority in the convention. Third, the SBC, like so many denominations in North America, could be simply succumbing to the cultural zeitgeist.
In my opinion, Southern Baptists should focus on this second possible explanation. As I’ve maintained in previous articles on this subject, an essential strategy of critical theory is deception. It is the proverb of the “frog in the kettle” applied practically to affect change.
Let me hasten to add that there is no way a person can know with certitude that such a deception is happening in the SBC. However, all Southern Baptists should at least be aware that this is a stratagem of the philosophy of critical theory. Essentially, you woo the masses with a message of “compassion for the oppressed” all while using “the oppressed” to forward your political agenda. As Mohler put it, “embedded in both of those analytical tools (critical theory and intersectionality) is a praxis, that is a political extension.”
This was thematic of the Black Liberation theologian James Cone . “By all means necessary” is the thesis of Liberation Theology, later to be defined as “critical theory.” Cone and his followers not only endorsed deception in order to achieve their political goals, but violence as well. Do not bother convincing your opponents, simply deceive them.
Resolution nine smacks of the kind of deceit founded in Cone’s version of Liberation Theology. Stripped of any language that clearly condemns critical theory, the motion, while appearing to subordinate this philosophy to the Bible, in fact, codifies it as a legitimate means by which race relations should be addressed among members of the SBC.
Pastor Buck put it well in my interview with him following the SBC meeting:
We’re already employing the concepts of Critical Race Theory and Intersectionality…people are not aware of it…and now we voted in a resolution that says it’s okay. I think they [members of the SBC] need to wake up. I think they need to educate themselves on what critical race theory and intersectionality is…they need to realize that the messengers voted for something that we likely don’t understand and we need to understand the gravity of it.
The Southern Baptist Convention is being infiltrated by an ideology that is antithetical to the Christian religion. Sadly, that infiltration is happening right under the noses of SBC members. If they care about their part of the church and want it to continue, Southern Baptists need to investigate these matters for themselves, understand the implications, then work to mount an informed opposition to this activism in their church body.

Why Churches Should Ditch Projector Screens And Bring Back Hymnals,thefederalist.com,Tom Raabe,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/churches-should-ditch-projector-screens-bring-back-hymnals/,"By Tom Raabe June 18, 2019
A couple of decades ago, churches split in a grand debate over worship. Contentious arguments raged over every aspect of worship style, components, decorum, and practically everything else. Every church seemed to be choosing between opposites—organ or praise band, historic liturgy or rock liturgies, contemporary songs or historic hymns. The fallout was ugly. Assemblies erupted in dissonance and members on the losing side transferred out.
Years later, the voices have calmed and the dust has settled. Some pastors declared a sort of “separate peace” by establishing rival worship services—one traditional, one modern. Others went the “blended worship” route. While this included enough elements from both styles to at least keep the group together, everyone was left a little dissatisfied. Mixing pipe organs with electric guitars tends to do that.
Perhaps we no longer hear about the worship debate because everyone is simply tired of fighting. Positions have calcified. No matter how well-intentioned, few minds are being changed. Bringing up the subject only tears open wounds that haven’t quite healed.
More likely, the reason you don’t hear much about the worship wars is that one side has won. It may not be a total victory, but one side is clearly winning while the other is cowering in a back pew hoping a pack of millennials doesn’t make them wave their arms in the air and sing whatever Chris Tomlin or Bethel Music wrote that morning. Informality at Church Is Increasing
Published in 2015, The National Congregations Study undertaken by researchers at Duke University surveyed nearly 4,000 congregations across the Christian spectrum. It found that traditional aspects of worship were in decline. Between 1998 and 2012, congregations that used choirs in worship decreased from 54 to 45 percent; those using organs dropped from 53 to 42 percent. Use of drums increased from 20 percent to 34 percent of congregations between 1998 and 2012.
While churches printing bulletins fell from 72 to 62 percent, the use of projected images rose by 23 percent. Informality in worship is way up (shouting “Amen,” wearing shorts to church) and formality is way down (calling the minister “Pastor So and So,” dressing up for services).
The survey didn’t come right out and say it, but informal worship with contemporary Christian music (CCM) seems to have won the worship war. All the megachurches are doing it. It’s hard to find many churches that haven’t bowed at least one knee to the modern, informal trend.
For those who attend their church’s traditional service, the demographic trends are not encouraging. Ushers for these services might as well require an AARP card for entry. At my church, the number of kiddos who trotted forward for the children’s sermon last Sunday was zero. It won’t be long until “old-timey” Protestants are searching out liturgical worship services like Catholics have to search out a Latin Mass.
While the larger worship war seems to be over, there might still be time to save at least one element of the traditional service: the hymnals. Hymnals Are Disappearing
Hymnals are a wonderful legacy of Western Christianity. They’ve been housed in pew racks in church sanctuaries for centuries. Since they first appeared in the United States during the 1830s, hymnals have been indispensable for worship—objects of treasure both in the sanctuary and in households. In my denomination, many received engraved hymnals as confirmation presents.
Churchgoers used to proudly carry their own hymnals to church. Nobody’s doing that anymore. In fact, more and more worshipers aren’t even looking at hymnals in church. Instead, their gaze is fixed to the front wall and a screen attached to it.
On this screen, everything from lyrics, to announcements, to YouTube videos is displayed. Churches in all traditions, meeting in all manner of worship spaces, are fastening large white canvases to their chancel walls and leaving the hymn books to molder in the pew racks.
A report from 2004 indicated that almost 60 percent of churches used some form of projector technology at last once a year. Another study from 2011 estimated that two-thirds of Protestant churches employed a large-screen projection system. In a last-gasp effort, here’s the case for bringing back hymnals and ditching those awful screens. Screens Don’t Belong In Church
To the first point: they’re horrifically ugly. In churches that don’t look like churches, the sort that instinctively prompt you to look for basketball nets and a scoreboard, they almost fit. Screens feel at home among the accouterments of contemporary worship that also dominate the space—guitars, mics, drum kits, keyboards, and amps—and behind that, typically giant luminescent slabs on the wall.
In a traditional sanctuary, on the other hand, with subdued natural lighting, pews, and steps leading to a chancel, the screens jump out and slap your aesthetic sensibilities. Housed next to time-honored trappings of ecclesiastical tradition like an altar, a pulpit, and a lectern, screens just don’t fit.
So why are they there? Some reasons are practical. Screens elevate worshipers’ heads out of hymnals and up toward the front, which amplifies the volume during the songs. Screens also free worshipers’ hands. Parishioners with weak eyes can often see words on a big screen better than words in a hymnal. For visitors or the unchurched—“seekers,” as they’re often called—screens remove the learning curve required to read music. Projector Screens Reflect Our Tech-Obsessed Culture
In our visual culture, screens possess another, less practical appeal. The control screens have over our daily life is staggering. We spend countless hours at the office staring at a computer screen then come home to watch another big, flat screen for our evening’s entertainment. Between tablets, laptops, smartphones, and e-readers, there’s no getting away from the bits and bytes, the ones and zeros. With all this, why not worship screens in church too?
In a culture that treasures the new, convenient, and informal, and plants a sloppy wet kiss on every new tech toy, the appeal of worship screens is easily explained. The downside is that as we eliminate hymnals from the worship life of the church, we lose everything they contain and represent.
It becomes difficult to teach new songs on a worship screen, primarily because there are no notes. Screens only work when worshipers already know the melodies. Worship “playlists” at contemporary services are often meager because the same songs tend to be sung over and over.
If you’re not already familiar with the tune, you cannot sing from a screen. There are no instructions on how many pitches you must devote to each syllable. In cases like these, most just end up keeping their mouths shut. This also limits the complexity of the songs’ music and words, because it’s easier to learn simpler songs when new ones are introduced without sheet music. Hymnals Provide Deep, Theologically Rich Worship
As hymnals fade, theology also suffers. The rich repository of religious wisdom contained in hymns will be lost. The old-fashioned language of hymns may strike some as unusual, but their text teaches the Christian faith far better than most of the praise choruses that dominate contemporary services. Old hymns were carefully crafted with theology at the forefront. Traditional hymns present doctrine clearly and beautifully convey the gospel story of saving grace.
On a larger scale, how do worship screens affect worship? Are they like other technology—truly neutral, beneficial when used well and deleterious when ill applied? We still have the same worship, they say. We simply added the screens! Instead of people looking down at their books, now they’re looking up at the wall—everything else is exactly the same!
Maybe so. But probably not. We may not want screens to change how we worship, but they certainly will. They definitely change the sermon-receiving “experience.” Images on the screen constantly interrupt attention. They do change the view, and they do put the technology front and center, rendering it visible where it used to merely exist subtly in the background.
While singing in a modern service, it’s hard not to start thinking about things other than the music. Will the slide change at the right time? Will the correct slide come up next? “Oh, look, there’s a typo!” It’s hard not to see how technology distracts from the meaning of the words we sing.
Screens represent a move away from permanence to the transitory. The words contained in a hymnal were printed in a book that was published with care. Inked on the paper accompanied by notes and staffs, hymnals were real. The words on the screens may look like the words in the book, but they lack substance. They’ll disappear the moment the switch is flipped off. To Save Worship, We Must Rediscover Hymnals
If circumstances don’t change, worship screens will eventually kill hymnals—although it may be a slow, painful death. Long after Gutenberg, books were still being hand-copied or printed from woodblocks. In his book “The Shallows” Nicholas Carr points out, “The old technologies lose their economic and cultural force. . . . It’s the new technologies that govern production and consumption, that guide people’s behavior and shape their perceptions.” We traditionalists may take the hymnal with us to the grave, while economic forces will push publishing companies away from producing new hymnals and revising old ones.
Does any of this matter? Will the warnings of traditionalists bring any worship screens down from the chancel walls or lead congregations to rethink installing them in the first place?
Maybe the whole thing is moot. How long before implanted hardware in our brains will allow us to download hymns and project them directly onto our retinas? Voila! No more screens.
Those who wish to see the Christian faith prosper, however, should consider the long-term effects that replacing hymnals with screens will have on worship and faith itself.

5 Ways Michael Flynn’s New Lawyer Could Expose More About Spygate,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/5-ways-michael-flynns-new-lawyer-expose-spygate/,"By Margot Cleveland June 18, 2019
What is Michael Flynn’s new “GREAT LAWYER, Sidney Powell” up to? And what might it mean for Flynn and those seeking the truth about Spygate? Here’s your legal primer for the five possible scenarios. For background on Flynn’s case and his switch to Powell, read this .
Let’s start with a quick review. On November 30, 2017, Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor, Flynn, with lying to FBI agents about conversations he had in December 2016 with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. The next day, Flynn pled guilty to the offense, pursuant to a plea agreement before federal judge Rudolph Contreras.
Less than a week later, for a still-unexplained reason, Flynn’s case was transferred to Judge Emmet Sullivan. Shortly after the case was transferred, Sullivan entered a standing order in the case directing “the government to produce to defendant in a timely manner—including during plea negotiations—any evidence in its possession that is favorable to defendant and material either to defendant’s guilt or punishment.” Sullivan further ordered the government, if it “has identified any information which is favorable to the defendant but which the government believes not to be material,” to “submit such information to the Court for in camera review.”
After pleading guilty on December 1, 2017, Flynn continued to cooperate with the special counsel’s investigation into possible collusion with Russia—a hoax, as we now know. After more than one year of cooperation, Flynn appeared before Sullivan on December 18, 2018, for sentencing. ‘You Sold Your Country Out’?
At that hearing, Judge Sullivan drilled Flynn’s attorneys on whether their client had truly accepted responsibility for his crime, noting that Flynn’s sentencing memo seemed to excuse Flynn’s conduct. Sullivan also quizzed Flynn on whether he wished to withdraw his guilty plea. Flynn held fast, though, telling the court he was pleading guilty because he was guilty. Flynn also declined Sullivan’s offer to appoint an independent attorney to review his file and provide a second opinion concerning Flynn’s guilty plea.
Following these exchanges, Sullivan proceeded to chastising Flynn. “I’m not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense,” Sullivan told the retired lieutenant general, with the long-time federal judge intimating that he may well sentence Flynn to incarceration—as opposed to zero jail time as recommended by the government.
In the midst of his diatribe, Sullivan incorrectly stated that Flynn had been working as a foreign agent while serving as Trump’s national security advisor, and suggested that Flynn may have even committed treason. “Arguably, you sold your country out,” Sullivan seethed.
Sullivan later backtracked on these comments, saying he had misspoken when stating that “Mr. Flynn [was] acting as a foreign agent while serving in the White House.” The judge also downplayed his questions about treason, saying “Don’t read too much into the questions I ask. But I’m not suggesting he committed treason. I just asked a legitimate question.”
Sullivan then asked Flynn whether he wanted to be sentenced at that time, or delay sentencing until after he had completed his cooperation with the government. Flynn wisely—given Sullivan’s tone and demeanor—opted to wait until he had finished assisting the government. Then Flynn Got a New Attorney
That is where things stood for the last six months. Then, a little more than a week ago, in a surprise development, Flynn’s attorneys, Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, from the gilded D.C. firm of Covington and Burling, LLP, filed a motion to withdraw as Flynn’s attorneys of record. According to the motion, Flynn had notified them “that he is terminating Covington & Burling LLP as his counsel and has already retained new counsel for this matter.”
Judge Sullivan granted the motion, after temporarily denying the request on technical grounds. But it was not until late last week that the public learned Flynn had replaced his lawyers with former prosecutor turned defense attorney—and vocal critic of the special counsel investigation—Sidney Powell.
News that Flynn had hired Powell prompted celebrations on social media and speculation that Trump’s former national security advisor intended to withdraw his guilty plea. However, in a statement to The Federalist, Powell stressed Flynn’s cooperation with the special counsel investigation, stating that “he will continue to cooperate with the government.”
Then Friday, in a Joint Status Report filed with Judge Sullivan, Powell and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Jessie Liu, who took over the case from the special counsel team, proposed providing the court with another status report in 60 days. At that time, as Friday’s filing explained, Flynn’s cooperation would be completed and the parties and court could then address any additional time Powell and newly retained co-counsel may need to review the voluminous file in preparation for Flynn’s sentencing.
Powell’s statement that Flynn will continue to cooperate and the status report’s reference to Powell’s need to prepare for sentencing both suggest that nothing has changed but Flynn’s legal representation. And when asked whether there will be a change in strategy for Flynn, Powell told The Federalist that “General Flynn continues to cooperate with the government according to his plea agreement. That is our focus.” “It will take extensive time for me to review the file,” Powell added.
So, what options does Flynn have once Powell’s review is complete? Let’s go through them. A Motion to Recuse
One option available is requesting Judge Sullivan recuse from Flynn’s case and the case be reassigned to another judge. Going into the December 2018 sentencing hearing, Flynn and his family likely expected a sentence of no jail time and minimal supervised release. Flynn had cooperated with the special counsel’s office from the get-go and over the course of the investigation provided substantial assistance to Mueller’s team. Additionally, the government agreed that “a sentence at the low end of the guideline range—including a sentence that does not impose a term of incarceration—is appropriate and warranted.”
But Judge Sullivan’s comments at the sentencing hearing suggested that he was seriously considering incarcerating Flynn for at least some amount of time, even if Flynn favorably completed his cooperation with the government. While a defendant cannot switch judges out of a fear of a tougher sentence, a defendant may seek recusal in a case where a judge’s “impartiality might be reasonably questioned.”
In Flynn’s case, Sullivan said to Flynn “arguably, you sold out your country,” and suggested treason might even be a plausible charge. Yet the only question before Sullivan was the appropriate sentence for Flynn lying to the FBI. The law provides that the presiding judge determine whether recusal is required, meaning Sullivan will be the one deciding whether to recuse himself.
Sullivan also wrongly accused Flynn of serving as a foreign agent while serving as Trump’s national security advisor. Sullivan then gratuitously condemned the slap on the wrist the government gave Gen. David Petraeus. Powell could highlight these exchanges and argue in a motion to recuse that Sullivan should recuse because “his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”
This strategy is high-risk, though, because controlling law provides that “a motion to recuse should not be ‘lightly granted.’” Thus, “a party introducing a motion to recuse carries a heavy burden of proof; a judge is presumed to be impartial and the party seeking disqualification bears the substantial burden of proving otherwise. To overcome this presumption, the moving party must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that a judge has conducted himself in a manner supporting disqualification.”
Additionally, the law provides that the presiding judge determine whether recusal is required, meaning Sullivan will be the one deciding whether to recuse himself. And should Powell seek Sullivan’s recusal and lose, Flynn would then find himself facing an even less sympathetic Judge Sullivan. (While a defendant may appeal a district court’s denial of a motion to recuse, appellate courts rarely overturn the trial court judge’s decision.) Another judge may be less inclined to enforce Judge Sullivan’s standing order under these circumstances.
Further, Powell may prefer Judge Sullivan to some of the other D.C. judges because of Sullivan’s history in the Sen. Ted Stevens case. In that case, the federal government had charged Stevens with corruption. After a jury convicted Stevens, Sullivan set aside the verdict and dismissed the indictment with prejudice following revelations that prosecutors had systematically concealed “significant exculpatory evidence.” Sullivan’s outrage over the prosecutorial misconduct in the Stevens case provides another reason Powell may prefer to keep Flynn’s case in his courtroom, especially if she intends to focus on prosecutorial misconduct.
Powell may also prefer that Sullivan continue to preside over Flynn’s case because he entered the standing order directing the government to produce “any evidence in its possession that is favorable to defendant and material either to defendant’s guilt or punishment,” and requiring the government to submit any favorable evidence that it believes is not material to the court to allow the court to determine whether it needed to be turned over to Flynn.
While this practice has been standard in Sullivan’s court since the Stevens case, not all federal judges enter such orders. Additionally, in this case, Sullivan’s order came after Flynn had already entered into a plea agreement and pleaded guilty. And in his plea agreement, Flynn agreed to “forego the right to any further discovery or disclosures of information not already provided at the time of the entry of Flynn’s guilty plea.” Another judge may be less inclined to enforce Judge Sullivan’s standing order under these circumstances—and as discussed below, that is likely just what Powell will want to do once she finishes reviewing the file.
So, for all of these reasons, while Powell could file a motion to recuse, that approach seems unlikely. Motion to Compel, Motion to Comply, or Motion to Show Cause
Instead, the more likely approach will be for Powell to file a motion to enforce Judge Sullivan’s standing order, assuming, of course, that during her review of the file, Powell discovers that the special counsel team did not provide Flynn’s previous attorneys all evidence material to the charges against Flynn. Powell might fashion this motion as a motion to compel or a motion to comply, or could instead file a motion to show cause, requiring the prosecutors to explain to Judge Sullivan why they did not comply with his standing order.
At this time, it is impossible to know what, if anything, the special counsel’s office withheld from Flynn’s attorneys, because the material provided to defense counsel, for the most part, was not filed with the court. However, if something is missing from the file, Powell is best positioned to realize its absence.
She has been researching, writing, and speaking on the Mueller’s investigation and Flynn prosecution for more than a year, and is thus well-versed in the many public details. Powell also has experience with Mueller’s “pit bull” lawyer Andrew Weissmann and his questionable past practices, and accordingly will know special areas meriting a particular focus.
But, for now, Flynn’s supporters will have to wait and to see whether this motion materializes and if so whether the evidence does as well. Motion to Withdraw the Plea
Third, Powell might file a motion to withdraw the plea on Flynn’s behalf. However, for several reasons, this course of action seems unlikely.
First, at this point Flynn’s chances of success in withdrawing his guilty plea are slim. While prior to sentencing the law provides that plea withdrawals should be “liberally granted,” a defendant must nonetheless “show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.” At this point Flynn’s chances of success in withdrawing his guilty plea are slim.
In determining whether there is a “fair and just reason,” courts consider three factors: whether the defendant has asserted a viable claim of innocence; whether the delay in the defendant’s attempt to withdraw his plea has prejudiced the government’s ability to prosecute the case; and whether the guilty plea was somehow tainted.
Any attempt by Flynn to argue actual innocence would likely fail given that on multiple occasions he acknowledged his guilt: in his plea agreement; in court when entering his guilty plea before Judge Contreas; and finally when Judge Sullivan quizzed him at length in December 2018.
Further, both Judge Contreas and Judge Sullivan detailed, at length, the rights Flynn would be foregoing by pleading guilty (what lawyers call a Rule 11 colloquy, after the procedural rule mandating this process), and Flynn acknowledged that he understood his rights and nonetheless wanted to plead guilty, because he was guilty. And Judge Sullivan specifically asked Flynn whether he wished the opportunity to attempt to withdraw his guilty plea, telling him “I will afford you that opportunity,” but Flynn declined the offer. Flynn acknowledged that he understood his rights and nonetheless wanted to plead guilty, because he was guilty.
Flynn also stated that he was happy with his attorneys and did not wish to consult with an independent attorney. Flynn’s attorney further stated, “We have no intention and the defendant has no intention to withdraw the guilty plea, and we’re certainly not asking Your Honor to consider that.” Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that Judge Sullivan would find Flynn’s guilty plea tainted.
That does not mean it would be impossible for Flynn to succeed in a plea withdrawal: Powell could argue that his attorneys were constitutionally ineffective or the file may provide evidence of government misconduct justifying a plea withdrawal. But it is unlikely Flynn would succeed, making the filing of such a motion a high-risk proposition: If Flynn seeks to withdraw his plea and Judge Sullivan denies his motion, Judge Sullivan would likely conclude that Flynn has not accepted responsibility for his crime, resulting in a longer prison sentence.
Moreover, if Flynn withdraws his guilty plea, the government would be free to prosecute Flynn, not just for lying to the government during the January 2017 FBI interview, but for filing materially false statements and omissions pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) related to work performed by his and his company, the Flynn Intel Group, Inc. (FIG), for Turkey.
The special counsel made clear during the December 2018 sentencing hearing that it could have charged Flynn in the indictment now pending in the Eastern District of Virginia, charging Bijan Rafiekian and Ekim Alptekin with various FARA violations. Flynn escaped those charges by pleading guilty to one count of making false statements to the FBI and cooperating with the special counsel. (Flynn’s cooperation will be complete following the trial of Rafiekian and Alptekin, which is scheduled to begin in mid-July.) If Flynn were to withdraw his guilty plea at this point, he could then be prosecuted both for lying and for the FARA violation, making that an untenable strategy. Motion to Dismiss for Prosecutorial Misconduct
A fourth and much more likely option would be for Powell to file a motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct. The Supreme Court has held that a “court may dismiss an indictment upon a finding of outrageous government misconduct that causes prejudice to a defendant,” but “the level of government wrongdoing that occurred must have been quite high.” Dismissal based on prosecutorial misconduct is rare, but so then is the abuse of the rule of law seen since Trump entered the political fray.
Whether Powell moves to dismiss the charges against Flynn will depend on what she discovers over the next two months in her review of the file. We know scant little at this time because, as mentioned above, the material provided Flynn’s defense, with a few exceptions, was not filed with the court. And Flynn’s former attorneys were extremely reticent to include information in their court filings that might upset the special counsel’s office. Dismissal based on prosecutorial misconduct is rare, but so then is the abuse of the rule of law seen since Trump entered the political fray.
This point became clear during the December 2017 sentencing hearing when the court asked Flynn’s attorneys why they had not filed the original 302 interview summary with the court along with the sentencing memorandum. “Prior to the filing, we shared a draft copy of our brief with the Special Counsel’s Office really for two purposes,” Flynn’s attorneys explained to Judge Sullivan: “One was to make sure that we weren’t including anything covered by the protective order, which they objected to our including, which would, perhaps, have to be redacted or filed under seal; and the other reason, frankly, was generally to understand what their reaction might be to particular points in the filing.”
“After that,” Flynn’s attorneys explained to Sullivan, “the Special Counsel’s Office discussed it with us and asked that we consider removing the Strozk 302, and the McCabe memorandum from the brief and to simply cite to them. Given our position as cooperating in the investigation, we acceded to that.”
Defense counsel no longer needs to accede to such demands by the special counsel, because the special counsel is no more and Flynn’s former attorneys are no more. Further, by the time Flynn is up for sentencing again, his cooperation will be complete. These facts, coupled with Powell’s reputation for weeding out prosecutorial misconduct, all point to revelations to come. What exactly those revelations will be, though, remains to be seen.
At this point, however, it is safe to say that seeking to dismiss the criminal charges based on prosecutorial misconduct offers two advantages over Flynn attempting to withdraw his guilty plea. First, seeking dismissal for prosecutorial misconduct will allow Powell to highlight government misconduct without implying that Flynn has not fully accepted responsibility for his crime. Second, and relatedly, such a motion would expose efforts by the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI to spy on, and interfere with, the Trump campaign, transition team, and administration, vis-à-vis Flynn, which would then play well for a future pardon request. Sentencing Memorandum
Finally, unless Sullivan tosses Flynn’s case, Powell will eventually file a new Sentencing Memorandum. The new Sentencing Memorandum will provide Powell the opportunity to establish that Flynn deserves a sentence of no jail time, and in the process expose more details about Spygate.
While Flynn’s former attorneys attempted this tack, they went about it wrong, leading Judge Sullivan to view Flynn as blaming the government for his crime and not fully accepting responsibility. Powell, however, can avoid raising Judge Sullivan’s ire by simply addressing questions Sullivan raised during the December 2018 hearing in Flynn’s new sentencing memorandum—the answers of which might well reveal that the government had listened in on Flynn’s calls with the Trump transition team. That in turn could set Flynn up for a pardon, even if it doesn’t affect his sentence. It would be entirely proper for Powell to highlight the lack of actual harm caused by Flynn’s false statements.
During the December 2018 sentencing hearing, Sullivan stated that Flynn had “admitted that his false statements or omissions impeded and had a material impact on the investigation.” Judge Sullivan went on to note that he “need[ed] to know answers about how [Flynn] impeded the investigation and what the material impact on the investigation was.” Then, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, Sullivan noted that he “had many, many, many more questions,” for the government, and reiterated that he needed to know “How the government’s investigation was impeded” by Flynn’s lies? And “what was the material impact of the criminality?”
Sullivan’s questions are understandable. Before the FBI interviewed Flynn on January 24, 2017, agents were already aware of the content of Flynn’s conversation with the Russian ambassador because they were listening in on the call. How then could Flynn’s false statements have impeded or materially impacted the FBI investigation?
It would be entirely proper for Powell to highlight the lack of actual harm caused by Flynn’s false statements in the updated sentencing memorandum because, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, a court must consider “the nature and circumstances of the offense.” Powell can do this while admitting that it is a serious offense to lie to the FBI; she would need only stress that in this case, the FBI knew of the content of Flynn’s call to the Russian ambassador, and thus the actual harm was minimal.
Further, in discussing “the nature and circumstances of the offense,” in the Sentencing Memorandum, Powell might well expose more details about the targeting of Flynn—and those details might well implicate the FBI in listening in on calls between Flynn and the Trump transition team.
The Statement of Offense filed in Flynn’s case suggest this is a real possibility. In the Statement of Offense, the government noted that “Flynn falsely stated that he did not ask the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to refrain from, ‘escalating the situation,’ in response to sanctions the Obama Administration had imposed upon Russia.” The statement then continued to lay out the timeline and what actually happened, as opposed to Flynn’s false statement:
On December the 28th, 2016, then-President Obama signed Executive Order 13757 which was to take effect on December the 29th, 2016. The executive order announced sanctions against Russia as a response to Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. On December the 28th, 2016, the ambassador contacted Mr. Flynn. The next day Mr. Flynn called a senior transition official who was with other senior officials at the Mar-a-Lago Resort. They discussed the sanctions and their shared desire that Russia not escalate the situation. Immediately after this phone call, Mr. Flynn called the ambassador, ‘and requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond in a reciprocal manner, end.’ Shortly after this conversation, Mr. Flynn spoke again with the senior official to report on the call. . . . On December 30th, 2016, President Putin announced that he would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions imposed by then-President Obama. On December 31, 2016, the ambassador called Mr. Flynn to inform him that Russia had chosen not to retaliate. After this call, Mr. Flynn spoke with senior members of the transition team about the conversation and Russia’s decision not to escalate the situation.
We already know that the FBI was listening in Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador. But was the FBI also listening in on Flynn’s call to “senior transition officials”? The details in the Statement of Offense raise that question.
While it is true that Flynn may have provided the special counsel’s office a summary of his conversations, that Mueller’s team believes Flynn fully, completely, and truthfully cooperated with its investigation suggests they may have had a way to double-check the information Flynn had told them—just as they did when Peter Strzok questioned Flynn about his January 24, 2017 call with the Russian ambassador.
If the FBI knew of Flynn’s conversations with the senior transition officials prior to interviewing him on January 24, 2017, Flynn’s false statements would have had even less of a chance of impeding the Russia collusion investigation because agents would have already known exactly what went down before Flynn opened his mouth. Powell could include revelations along these lines in Flynn’s revised sentencing memorandum to fully explain the “nature and circumstances of the offense.” But it would do much more—it would help to more fully explain the nature and circumstances of Spygate.

The Problem With Ocasio-Cortez's Shameful Ignorance Of History,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/ocasio-cortezs-shameful-ignorance-history/,"By David Harsanyi June 18, 2019 “The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border. That is what they are.” — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .
In April 1944, two Slovakian Jews named Alfred Weczler and Rudolf Vrba escaped from Auschwitz, and provided one of the first eyewitness accounts of the horrors of the European concentration camps. Both men had been rounded up with a group of their countrymen and sent to the Birkenau section of the camp in the spring of 1941, where they were immediately put to work as slave labor.
This was before the German regime had properly streamlined and industrialized efforts to destroy European Jewry. In the early days of the camp, any man incapable of labor was immediately executed. Those who survived were sent to do the grueling work of construction.
The men began their work at sunrise, and except for a half-hour break at noon, when the prisoners were fed cabbage and turnip soup, they worked until 6 p.m. For dinner, the men were given an ounce of moldy bread made from “ersatz flour and sawdust.” Lice and fleas tortured their emaciated bodies as they slept on wooden boards. “Rats were so bold they gnawed at the toes and fingers of sleepers and stole the crumbs they had left in their pockets,” wrote Robert Conot in his book “Justice at Nuremberg.”
A third of the prisoners died every week. If a worker was hurt, he was allotted three days of recovery time. If they failed to heal, the infirmary—where Dr. Mengele had already begun his nefarious work on women and children—would inject a fatal dose of phenol directly into their hearts.
Of the 2,722 Slovakian Jews who had been rounded up with Weczler and Vrba, only 159 survived to the summer of 1942. Those who died had been dumped, with another approximately 105,000 bodies, into shallow trenches around Birkenau. “As they decomposed” Conot noted, “the earth rose like a yeasty mixture of dough and bubbled up nauseating gases, which spread for miles.”
I think of that last sentence whenever some modern-day know-nothing begins comparing the United States to a proto-Nazi state. Maybe it’s because their analogies are embarrassingly ignorant and intellectually lazy, or maybe it’s because people like Ocasio-Cortez, perhaps unknowingly, diminish the suffering of millions of dead. Or maybe it’s because my own grandfather was taken as slave labor in Austria.
Then again, maybe it’s because the comparison itself is a despicable smear of the American people. It’s true that we’re not prepared for the crush of refugees on the southern border (although it should be noted that many Democrats contend any border is immoral ). While there is a border, however, we ask migrants who show up to follow existing laws; ones that are subject to the democratic process and the court system.
Sometimes we reacted ham-fistedly, even temporarily breaking up families who are transporting children without any oversight. Some migrants have been abused and some have died in our care. There is no excuse for it. Neither is sanctioned by the state.
If you believe any of this morally equivalent to carting away millions of people to crematoriums for execution because their faith, your moral compass is irreparably broken.
It should also be noted that the United States has more immigrants than any other country in the world . There are 40 million people living in the United States who were born in another country—accounting for about one-fifth of the world’s migrants in 2017. We could build a giant steel fence around the entire country, and the United States would still reign as the most welcoming place for foreigners that has ever existed.
This doesn’t mean that people of good faith can never be critical of U.S. policy or contrast any policy with Nazi Germany. “Concentration camps” have a long history that predates the Holocaust, after all. But the contemporary usage is clear, notwithstanding Ocasio-Cortez’s unconvincing attempts to walk back her initial statements. She, in fact, stresses, “I don’t use those words lightly. I don’t use those words to just throw bombs.”
This dumb Nazi equivalence certainly isn’t new . We see a spike whenever a Republican is elected—be it Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, or George Bush. Of course, with Donald Trump, they are in full bloom . We see it all across social media. We see it not only from random accounts but from celebrities , well-known pundits , and major newspapers peddling fourth-grade-level historical analysis. What they’re doing is cheapening their own arguments, on top of all else.
Ocasio-Cortez, whose historical obliviousness leads her to believe we’re living in an economic and racial dystopia , says she is speaking to those who “are concerned enough with humanity to say that ‘Never Again’ means something and…that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the Home of the Free.” It’s indeed strange to hear a leftist who champions anti-Israel causes and anti-Semitic politicians using this phrase, since the Jewish state is the most successful and enduring manifestation of Never Again.
The appearance of “Never Again” also undermines her later contention that she wasn’t talking about the Nazi camps.
We’re forced to take someone seriously who believes vegetables are a tool of colonial oppression because Ocasio-Cortez is both a charismatic elected official with many impressionable fans, and a person bestowed with a huge media platform. Only last weekend, she appeared on “Meet the Press” praising socialism—the other scourge of the 20th century. Yet when we need our media to ask her to explain her profoundly childish and destructive statements, they are nowhere to be found. "
Medicare Needs A 30 Percent Tax Hike Or 20 Percent Spending Cuts,thefederalist.com,Roger Stark,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/prevent-bankruptcy-medicare-needs-30-percent-tax-hike-20-percent-spending-cuts/,"June 18, 2019 By Roger Stark
The Medicare program’s trustees recently released their annual financial report. The report is similar to last year’s, and like last year, it again serves as a serious wake-up call that the finances for the program are not going well. In general, the growth of health care spending far outpaces inflation and economic growth in the United States.
In 2018, Medicare’s costs consumed 3.7 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). The trustees project this number to increase to 5.9 percent of the economy by 2038. After 2038, spending is estimated to increase to 6.5 percent of GDP. In addition, the Medicare Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays for Medicare Part A hospital care, will run out of money by 2026.
To successfully address the shortfall, either Medicare payroll taxes would need to increase by 30 percent or spending in the program would need to decrease by 20 percent. In other words, workers would see their taxes increase significantly or hospitals and doctors would experience a dramatic drop in income.
The irony is that despite looming financial failure, leftists are clamoring that a single-payer system—or as they like to call it “Medicare for All”—be imposed on the entire country. The current Medicare program enrolls 15 percent of the U.S. population. For a single-payer plan to have a chance of surviving, the necessary astronomical increase in taxes would choke the economy. In addition, provider payments would sink so low that very few talented people would be attracted to health care. This would lead to a decrease in the quality of care nationwide.
The existing Medicare program is an insurance plan for seniors 65 and older. It is indeed popular with Americans. However, as the trustee report shows, it must absolutely be reformed to remain viable. At some point, our elected officials must face reality and tackle Medicare’s runaway spending. We cannot afford to have them defer the issue to a future Congress.
A simple first step to Medicare reform would be to gradually raise the age of eligibility. When the program started in 1965, the average life expectancy in the United States was 67 years for men and 74 years for women. Average life expectancy is now up to 76 years for men and 81 years for women. This reality has put enormous strain on an entitlement program that was not designed to provide health services to people for so many years late in life.
Another simple Medicare reform would be a more thorough means-testing system. If this were properly implemented, wealthier seniors would pay more, and low-income people would pay less.
There is currently no private insurance market for seniors. Medicare long ago stifled the possibility of any private market. It is virtually impossible to compete with the government, which has monopoly power and an unlimited ability to fix prices and lose money while any potential competitors go out of business.
The private market for the elderly could be resurrected by allowing people to voluntarily opt out of Medicare and allowing those seniors to purchase health savings accounts and high-deductible health plans. Low-income seniors could use vouchers or another type of subsidized premium-support that would allow them to purchase health insurance in the private market.
Physicians should be allowed to seek partial payments from patients or their insurance companies, which by law, they cannot do now unless they leave the Medicare program entirely.
Future generations should be allowed to keep the individual health insurance they want into retirement. This would ensure that as the younger generation saves, their health insurance nest egg would build until they need it in their later years, just as popular IRAs do now.
Reforms can save the current Medicare program. Our elected officials, however, will need political courage to implement these measures. Given the program’s current problems for patients, taxpayers, and providers, imposing “Medicare for All” on Americans is not a reasonable or viable solution."
Taylor Swift's 'You Need To Calm Down' Is Breathtakingly Elitist - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/taylor-swifts-need-calm-breathtakingly-elitist/,"June 18, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
While tech billionaires mine our divisions for profit, Taylor Swift is playing house in a trailer park. That’s the irony of “You Need To Calm Down,” which belongs to the dark era of shrieking keyboard warfare it rebukes, despite a blindingly bright aesthetic.
To illustrate her LGBT pride anthem, Swift assembled the glitterati, casting them as the heroes of a utopian trailer park where her feud with Katy Perry ends, and ugly gay marriage protesters meet their match in a fabulous show of celebrity force. The set, of course, almost certainly cost more than what many people who make such places their home earn in a year. “Love letters only,” reads the side of one lily white mailbox in Swift World. (Where do the bills go?)
Her creativity mysteriously lapsed when it came time to cast the protesters, who look like they should be playing banjos in “Deliverance”: toothless, badly dressed, holding misspelled signs. “Control your urges to scream about all the people you hate,” Swift demands. “Cause shade never made anybody less gay.”
It’s all grotesquely elitist when you consider that she’s mocking people with less money while appropriating a trailer park lifestyle for three minutes of breezy, colorful fun. (Support for same-sex marriage declines along with income and education level.) Are there a lot of crazy people who yell at Swift on the Internet? Some, sure. But she went with a very specific type. The message is basically, “We’re beautiful and right; You’re poor and dumb.” If that sounds reductive or based on caricatures that would never be tolerated if used against the left’s pet identity groups, watch the video again.
“I’ve learned a lesson that stressin’ and obsessin’’bout somebody else is no fun,” sings Swift, recalling memories of the “Mean” era. It’s been a long nine years since that song debuted, yet its childlike naiveté somehow feels more sophisticated than “You Need To Calm Down.”
Indifference can be disarming, and Swift captures that in the lyrics and video. It’s not a bad premise either. With a dash of self-awareness, “You Need To Calm Down” could have been the giant exhalation we need right now, collective catharsis as the grip of social media platforms designed to keep us in conflict tightens, an easy antidote to the stresses of virtual battle. We do need to calm down. All of us.
But this won’t help. Swift’s lazy caricatures and pedestrian insults belong very firmly to the moment at hand. So, too, does the video’s deafening elitism, rubbing celebrities in the faces of rubes as if their glamour was an argument in and of itself. It’s not.
It’s also aggressively tone-deaf for a song that styles itself as a defusion effort. The whole thing is just cheap, chasing applause for punching down. The stereotypes are so crude they border on parody. You would think someone who was thrust into super stardom by country music fans might have more respect for people from different backgrounds.
“You Need To Calm Down” culminates in an instructive insult. “Like, can you just not step on our gowns?” Swift asks of the swarming yokels. It’s a question as ridiculous as the song itself. How could they ever get close enough to a red carpet to try? Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky . "
Female Athlete Sidelined By Trans Males Speaks Out For Women's Sports,thefederalist.com,Susanna Hoffman,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/female-runner-files-complaint-after-losing-placement-to-biological-males/,"June 18, 2019 By Susanna Hoffman
Two transgender male athletes kept high school track runner Selina Soule from advancing in the New England girls’ track regionals. Soule needed to be in the top six runners to advance, but came out eighth because the two biological males were also competing as transgender girls. She is now taking legal action with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) to uphold her rights under the federal law providing equal access to women in education, known as Title IX.
Fox News’ Tucker Carlson hosted Soule and ADF attorney Christiana Holcomb Monday night.
“I’ve gotten nothing but support from my teammates and from other athletes,” Soule said. “But I have experienced some retaliation from school officials and coaches.”
[Related Post: Trans Activists: We’re Normal, But You Must Pay To Fix Us]
This retaliation began after Soule’s parents complained to the school principal, she said, saying she has received difficult requests to complete during practice that did not occur before she spoke out against transgender males competing in girls’ sports. She is told that if she cannot fulfill these requests, then she cannot compete at all.
“Girls like Selina should never be forced to be spectators in their own sports,” Holcomb said. “But unfortunately that is exactly what is taking place when you allow biological males to compete in sports that have been set aside and specifically designed for women like Selina.”
ADF is representing Soule and two other female athletes who filed a Title IX complaint Monday to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights. Their complaint requests that the Board of Education “investigate illegal discrimination against the Connecticut athletes,” ADF wrote .
Title IX is supposed to protect girls in athletics so they are not prevented from competing at the highest levels. According to ADF, the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference has a policy allowing transgender males to compete in girls’ athletics. One of the transgender athletes who competed in Soule’s race broke 10 state sports records previously held by biological women, which took women some 20 years to achieve.
It is unsurprising for biological males to destroy female records. Men are physiologically stronger than woman, having more muscle mass and a higher bone density, ADF reports . Typically an average male athlete in any sport will beat the best female athletes in the same sports because of males’ biological height, weight, speed, bone, muscle, and other physical advantages compared to women.
“It is fundamentally unfair to allow biological males to step into women’s sports and frankly dominate them and take away opportunities, and even compete for scholarships,” Holcomb said.

Drag Kids Are Being Manipulated By Adults Who Should Know Better,thefederalist.com,Denise Shick,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/19/kids-dress-drag-manipulated-adults-know-better/,"June 19, 2019 By Denise Shick
As a child, when I looked into my daddy’s eyes, what I wanted to see more than anything else was a sign of acceptance and approval. I rarely saw such affirmation, because my dad was too focused on his own life to be concerned about mine. But in those rare moments when he did pay attention to me and cheer me, I was elated. I wanted more.
“Mom, look at me!” “Dad, see what I can do!” Who doesn’t remember a childhood partially spent craving parental praise?
Children naturally move toward the behaviors that elicit positive responses from the adults in their lives. If mom claps and calls out praises when little Andy successfully bats that teeball, then Andy likely will pursue that endeavor right on into Little League and perhaps all the way a varsity letter in high school. On the other hand, if mom praises little Andy when he parades around the house in a dress his older sister outgrew, Andy likely will pursue that course.
Such was the case of Desmond Napoles. When, at the impressionable age of two, Desmond’s parents began taking him to drag shows, and the toddler saw his parents cheering on the female impersonators, the little child’s future was being shaped—perhaps unalterably. As the visits to the drag shows continued, no doubt Desmond’s developing brain was processing: Prancing around in dresses and wearing wigs and makeup causes mom and dad—and all these other adults—to smile and cheer. I want that!
Desmond, now 11, is now best known by his stage name, Desmond Is Amazing. Desmond has become a transgender institution. He has his own line of fashions and cosmetics and even a magazine. If that’s not enough, he has his own drag queen nightclub that promotes other child drag queens. After all, if one transgender Desmond is amazing, scores of them must be stupendous!
The question, then, is whether influencing a child in this manner is in his or her best interests. Is the transgender lifestyle healthy? A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that transgender people were more likely to be smokers, more likely to be sedentary, and more likely to experience a diminished quality of life due to mental or physical health conditions or unmet health care needs.
If Desmond’s parents had instead taken him repeatedly to extremely violent movies and cheered on the graphic incidents of bloodshed and gore, and Desmond now had declared himself to be a gun-toting gangster, the progressives who now applaud him would be aghast. How dare his parents influence him in such a manner?
In America, the average life expectancy is just short of 80 years. The average life expectancy for gang members in America is a little more than 20 years. The average life expectancy for transgender people in America is a little more than 30 years. So, statistically, American transgenders are somewhat better off than gang members but, on average, they can expect to die five decades sooner than the overall average for Americans.
Young people enter violent gangs primarily for the same reason they play baseball, take up ballet, or parade on stage at drag-queen shows. They crave acceptance and applause. But not all endeavors are equal; not all pursuits have similar outcomes.
Adults—who are supposed to want the best for the children in their care—need to understand that some lifestyles are not in their children’s best interests. Like bentonite clay, children are impressionable. Bentonite clay can be used to create beautiful, long-lasting pottery. Or it can be used as kitty litter and thrown out after a few uses. Not all uses are equal. Not all choices are equal.

U.S. Media Need To Stop Publishing Chinese and Russian Propaganda,thefederalist.com,Mark Hemingway,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/20/if-the-media-dont-want-to-be-called-propagandists-they-need-to-stop-publishing-chinese-and-russian-propaganda/,"By Mark Hemingway June 20, 2019
If you ever spend any time in the Washington D.C. area, there’s a good chance you’ll come across a publication known as China Daily . In appearance, it’s a newspaper. In reality, it is official propaganda from the Chinese government that Communist Party officials deem appropriate for influencing those inside the Beltway. You can find it all over downtown D.C. in newspaper boxes. Large stacks of free copies are also dropped off directly at offices all over the city.
Even better, if you subscribe to the Washington Post, you can get communist propaganda delivered straight to your doorstep for a fee. A few times a year, the Post comes wrapped in a special advertising supplement called China Watch that, again, does its best to approximate a legitimate newspaper. But underneath the masthead in fine print, it reads: “This supplement, prepared by China Daily , People’s Republic of China, did not involve the news or editorial departments of the Washington Post .”
Anyway, you may have recently heard about how two million people out of a population of seven million in Hong Kong recently protested in the streets against the Communist Party’s attempt to further snuff out their little pocket of freedom. Here’s how China Daily is reporting what happened :
Parents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region took to the streets on Sunday to urge US politicians to not interfere with the SAR’s extradition amendments and its internal affairs.
The protest, organized by several Hong Kong social groups, also condemned foreign entities for misleading young people in the city.
Among these social groups was an alliance of more than 30 local political, business and legal dignitaries who support the proposed amendments to the SAR’s extradition law. They marched outside the US Consulate General in Hong Kong and Macao, calling on the US to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs.
The whole article is a damnable lie, and yet, as far as I know, the brave truth-tellers at the Washington Post have been taking money to distribute this kind of bilge at least since 2011.
Of course, in recent years we’ve been subject to endless preening from journalists about “fake news” and their renewed commitment as truth tellers. The Washington Post even adopted the slogan “Democracy Dies In Darkness.” We can argue what this metaphorical “darkness” is supposed to be, but democracy literally dies in oppressive communist regimes.
Further, the Post has spent the better part of a year attacking the Trump administration for its inadequate response to Saudi Arabia after the kingdom apparently killed one of the Post’s writers, Jamal Khashoggi. Regardless of the Post’s Pollyanna-ish denial of Khashoggi’s questionable activism masquerading as journalism, his murder was appalling and the Saudis’ general human rights record is terrible.
It’s not hard to see why the paper would be thundering about injustice here. However, that argument is harder to make when a venerable institution such as the Post is so untroubled by the world’s worst human rights abuser that it distributes their propaganda.
Just to wrap your head around the hypocrisy, note that last November 29, the Post published yet another advertising insert from China Watch: Ohhh boy! The same @WashingtonPost that’s lecturing about press freedom after one of their columnists was murdered by the Saudis is STILL running Chinese propaganda inserts. They’ll claim it’s just an “Advertising Supplement,” but they’d stop if they were serious. pic.twitter.com/hwWXhMYwom
— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) November 29, 2018
Khashoggi was murdered the previous month, and the Post was still in high dudgeon about it. But the timing of it again publishing Chinese propaganda was even more appalling. The day after the Post ran ChiCom propaganda, Time reported on how a “Uighur woman and mother of three told a Congressional committee this week that she was tortured and suffered the loss of a child in a mass internment camp, pressing the U.S. to take punitive action against China’s mass detention of the Muslim minority.”
Time magazine has a video of the woman’s wrenching testimony. The woman sobs as a translator recounts that “I thought that I would rather die than go through this torture.” Do note Time’s use of the genteel descriptor “internment camp” here, given the recent full-throated defense by many in the media of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez describing illegal immigrant detainment centers on America’s southwest border as “concentration camps.” One of these governments is actually detaining people against their will explicitly because of their religion and ethnicity, and if you’re unclear on which is which, you have a promising career in bartending ahead of you.
Of course, Uighurs are just the tip of the iceberg for a government that executes people on a mass scale, profits from harvesting the organs of political prisoners , sends people to labor camps for tweets it doesn’t like, and lets 1 billion people live in grinding poverty while the politically connected minority that runs the country has become some of the wealthiest people on earth.
The same day as the Time report, the Post , to its credit, ran its own damning coverage of Uighur human rights abuses . One could point to this as evidence that the Post advertising and editorial sections are operating independently, as they should.
But unlike lots of struggling newspapers, the Post is owned by the richest man in the world, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. It seems unlikely that they are going to fold if they refuse to run communist propaganda. If they’ve been running these advertising sections for years because the sum the Chinese government is paying is, in fact, significant enough to affect their bottom line in ways that would harm the paper, then there are legitimate questions about the Chinese buying influence that should be asked.
Of course, China isn’t the only problem here. State-owned publisher Rossiyskaya Gazeta also publishes the English-language propaganda excerpt Russia Beyond — formerly known as Russia Beyond the Headlines — which is published as an advertising section in major newspapers all over the world. The New York Times confirmed it was still distributing Russia Beyond last year, and the Washington Post distributed it as late as 2015. A lengthy RealClearInvestigations report last year detailed how Russia Beyond is also repulsive propaganda:
It serves not only Russian national interests, but also the personal power plays of President Vladimir Putin. According to a study by the Institute of Modern Russia, a New York think tank run by Pavel Khodorkovsky, a Russia Beyond insert in the largest German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, featured an article attacking his father, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a onetime oligarch imprisoned and later pardoned by Putin.
‘In the words of Ulrich Schmid of the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung, the article is reminiscent of the Russian media’s ‘journalistic execution’ of Russia’s number one political prisoner,’ the institute said, referring to the elder Khodorkovsky. ‘In the article, Khodorkovsky is painted in the darkest colors as a Komsomol apparatchik, cynical businessman, and an interpreter of the Bible.’
Go ahead and read the whole thing. The American media’s Trump-Russia hysteria of the last few years gains some real perspective when you consider that they are more than willing to take blood money to distribute publications that whitewash authoritarian crimes. The Mueller investigation indicted 13 Russians involved with The Internet Research Agency, a Russian “troll factory” involved in social media and online misinformation campaigns.
Of course, the efficacy of such internet trolling, even when specifically targeted at influencing an election, is dubious. Nonetheless, if that rises to the level of meriting indictments, shouldn’t printed propaganda that gets implicit credibility from being bundled with major papers be treated as a serious concern?
To the extent that these papers have had to address the issue, the answers have been lackluster at best. When Tucker Carlson asked Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple about the Post publishing paid Russian propaganda when he has been so critical of the Trump administration’s ties to Russia, the response was embarrassing . “That’s a good question. I’ve got a lot to write about. I’m interested in that topic,” he said, before stammering through an unsatisfactory and evasive answer.
Certainly, the media are struggling these days and can be awfully defensive about accusations they are dishonest and grind partisan axes. So here’s a free tip to help them begin to recover their credibility: If you don’t want to be treated like propagandists, stop publishing actual propaganda on behalf of the worst people on earth.

8 Things To Keep Doing With Your Children Even When They’re Teenagers,thefederalist.com,Cheryl Magness,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/20/8-things-keep-children-even-theyre-teenagers/,"By Cheryl Magness June 20, 2019
Recently the Facebook page “Parenting Teens & Tweens” shared a list of things parents shouldn’t stop doing just because their kids have become teenagers . It’s a good list, with things like showing physical affection and saying “I love you.” These are practices worth continuing, whether a child is 6 months, 6, or 16.
Here are a few more suggestions for things parents shouldn’t stop doing simply because a child has entered double digits. While many parents discontinue these practices when their children reach a certain age, there’s no good reason to do so. Families that maintain these habits will nourish a stronger connection with their children and help their children lead happier, healthier lives. 1. Read with Them
Many parents read bedtime stories to their children when they’re very young and need help going to bed, but quit when the children are old enough to put themselves to bed. Yet the benefits of reading aloud as a family are not age-specific , and there’s no reason to stop reading together, at bedtime and other times, as long as a child is at home. 2. Sing with Them
There’s something about a baby that invites a song, encouraging even the most bashful singer to coo a chorus of “Hush, Little Baby” or “Old MacDonald.” We’re not singing to our babies or each other as much as we used to. But singing together , like reading together, has benefits far beyond the preschool years. It’s a practice we should cultivate in any way we can, beginning with our families. 3. Eat with Them
This one is included on the “Parenting Tweens and Teens” list, and for good reason. Many families eat together when the children are young, but stop doing so as the kids get older and schedules get more complicated. That is all the more reason to make family mealtime a priority. To share a meal is to share much more than food . Some days it may be the only time a family spends together. 4. Expect Them to Treat You with Respect
Contrary to popular opinion, children don’t turn into monsters as soon as they hit adolescence. Teenagers are just slightly older versions of the same people they’ve always been. If we’ve done our job as parents, they have learned some things about how to treat others, and there’s no reason those lessons should stop applying, at any age. 5. Tell Them Family Stories
When I was a little girl, I loved listening to my parents tell stories about their childhood. As I got older, I wasn’t always as willing to listen, and they didn’t push me to do so.
Now that they’re gone, I find myself wishing I could ask them to tell me more stories. In a 2013 piece for The Atlantic , psychology professor Elaine Reese details the ways children benefit from hearing family stories. They “demonstrate better understanding of other people’s thoughts and emotions … have higher self-esteem and stronger self-concepts. … more robust identities, better coping skills, and lower rates of depression and anxiety.”
Reese adds that “family storytelling can help a child grow into a teen who feels connected to the important people in her life.” Tell your children their family’s stories. It will help them know who they are. 6. Praise Them
Remember how you used to display every smudged drawing, misshapen sculpture, and droopy wildflower arrangement as if it were the most beautiful creation you had ever seen? Teenagers and young adults are too smart to believe you when your accolades are less than warranted. But they still want your praise.
Look for opportunities to give it, whether by celebrating a major accomplishment or simply expressing your appreciation when they help out around the house without being asked. 7. Require Them to Go to Church
Some church-going parents seem to have a misguided idea that if they “force” religion on their teenagers, they’re going to drive them away from the church, so they stop insisting on attendance and give their children “space” to “find their own way.” It’s not a wise choice.
When you let your kids skip church—because they had a late night out, they had to work, they have a lot of homework, or another reason—you send one message only: church is not important. Yet even secular studies have shown that children who are brought up in the church turn into happier, healthier adults who live more moral lives and who contribute more to their communities. Of greater importance, though, is that the story of God’s love is not one we should ever stop hearing, and the best place to do that is in church . 8. Pray With Them
Like reading to our children, this one often goes by the wayside when we’re no longer tucking our kids into bed. It shouldn’t. When you stop praying with your children, you model that prayer doesn’t matter. If you believe it does, look for other times to do it: at mealtime, driving in the car as you discuss the world’s problems, before significant events such as trips and graduations, at difficult times, and at times of joy and thanksgiving.
And if you’ve made a practice of family devotions, don’t stop simply because the kids are getting older. My children are 15, 23, and 26, and the older two still take part in family devotions when they are home.
There’s a widely held opinion that children’s needs vary dramatically from one stage of development to another. Certainly, they go from being completely helpless and dependent to gradually needing us less and less.
But children don’t become alien beings just because there is a “teen” at the end of their age. The things they need, in both childhood and adolescence, are the things we all need throughout our lives: a sense of community, the assurance of being loved, and a connection to the Word of God. If we help our children carry these things through their teenage years, they will be more likely to carry them to the grave.

"America Under Democrats: Forcing Abortion Payouts, Banning Chick-Fil-A",thefederalist.com,Christine Goss,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/20/america-democrats-forcing-americans-pay-abortion-banning-chick-fil/,"By Christine Goss June 20, 2019
Last week, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden changed his position on the Hyde Amendment, joining the other front-runners for his party’s nomination. The amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortions (with a few exceptions), is a critical safeguard in protecting the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who morally oppose the procedure.
The First Amendment guarantees not only our right to speak freely, it protects other forms of expression like religious practices and personal financial contributions. Our Founders understood this and were careful to make sure our nation’s laws cannot restrict the free practice of religion. Forcing people to fund an act that many faiths prohibit certainly falls within that scope.
It’s very concerning that so many of the candidates seeking the U.S. presidency — and so many of our lawmakers and elected officials — are ignorant, or maybe just dismissive, of the constitutional rights of those they govern. It doesn’t portend well for people of faith in this country, but the reality is, we shouldn’t be surprised that the Hyde Amendment now sits on shaky ground. The far left has been chipping away at First Amendment rights for years.
From college campuses to places of business, the free speech rights of conservatives, in politics and faith, have long been regularly suspended. Just last month, news outlets reported that the University of Chicago is now allowing mandatory student fees to fund abortions on campus . A student government bill to block mandatory student fees from being used in this way was soundly defeated.
According to U.S. News and World Report’s annual ranking of U.S universities, the University of Chicago ranks third in the nation, behind Princeton and Harvard universities. Given that a portion of U-Chicago’s $1,500 “Student Life Fee” that may be used to fund on-campus abortions is mandatory, pro-life students who wish to attend this prestigious school are therefore forced to violate their consciences.
The trade-off is unfair: we all know that elite schools are influential in future success, from the quality of education to the connections to top jobs and networking. More than unfair, however, this form of bullying is illegal and an underexposed form of violating freedom of speech.
The threat is much broader than on college and university campuses. More and more examples are coming to light that reveal conservative views could lead to individual job loss or restrictions on companies’ ability to do business.
Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich was forced to resign for his private financial contribution in support of the pro-marriage Proposition 8 in 2017 and Linda Bean, the granddaughter of L.L. Bean, endured a similar attack in 2018 when protesters called for her to be removed from the company’s board for her personal contribution to a free-market political action committee. Bean stood up to the bullying, but others lack the power.
We’re learning that conservatives must often hide their political and religious views to protect their jobs. A Google engineer, Michael Wacker, recently published an essay on Medium exposing the restrictions Republicans and Christians must follow, or risk getting fired at this major global tech company. According to Wacker, “these outrage mobs will hunt down any conservative, any Christian, and any independent free thinker at Google who does not bow down to their agenda.” Wacker cites a fellow employee who was reported to HR for a complimentary comment about psychologist, professor, and bestselling author Jordan Peterson.
The assault on freedom of speech, and freedom of religion specifically, is particularly striking in light of the double standard. Tim Cook , Jeff Bezos, and other celebrity CEOs have been very active in voicing and advancing their political views. Cook even penned an op-ed in the Washington Post opposing religious freedom laws . Apple, Amazon, Starbucks, Target, and many other major companies have used their platforms to push leftist values and political views.
At a Bloomberg Global Business Forum in 2017, Apple CEO Cook stated, “ [p]eople should have values … [c]ompanies are nothing more than a collection of people. So by extension, all companies should have values. As a CEO, I think one of your responsibilities is to decide what the values of your company are and lead accordingly .” Cook’s and his company’s personal political engagement are certainly protected by the First Amendment — and they should be. But we’ve seen that this freedom has only been protected for some companies: those that support leftism.
Companies guided by Christian values or even companies whose owners hold traditional Christian views separate from business policies, like Chick-fil-A owner Dan Cathy, have not received the same protections. Small bakeries and pizza shops have been fined or put out of business for their company values, and Chick-fil-A has been discriminated against in cities across America. San Antonio and Buffalo are currently being sued for violating the First Amendment for banning Chick-fil-A from their city’s airports.
Just three years ago, Hillary Clinton said religious “ beliefs have to be changed ” if they don’t fit political goals, and this cycle’s crop of Democratic presidential hopefuls are doubling down on efforts to remove the barriers that faith poses to political ends. If this doesn’t send chills through the spines of Americans, it should.
This assault threatens the very fabric of the United States of America — an exceptional nation founded on the principle that people are born free and that no government or body may impede that freedom. It’s why our Founders designed a republic rather than a democracy — to protect the minority from “majority rule.”
A cursory study of history and current events shows that religion is the first threat totalitarian governments target for elimination in order to solidify social control. Millions have flocked to the United States because it guarantees rights that make us free individuals, like freedom of religion and conscience.
The United States is a safe haven for so many persecuted groups. It’s sad and alarming to see our own form of persecution rear its head on our land. The threat is real, and the repercussions are visible. We must recognize it when it takes place, expose it, and demand protection for free speech in all of its forms, including religion. Christine A.

SCOTUS Upholds Maryland Memorial Cross On Public Land,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/20/scotus-upholds-maryland-memorial-cross-on-public-land/,"June 20, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
In a 7-2 ruling on Thursday, the Supreme Court decided that a 40-foot World War I memorial cross that has stood on public land in Maryland for 94 years does not violate the First Amendment. Writing the majority opinion , Justice Samuel Alito said the memorial, also known as the “Peace Cross,” has become a prominent community landmark and should be upheld.
“After the First World War, the picture of row after row of plain white crosses marking the overseas graves of soldiers who had lost their lives in that horrible conflict was emblazoned on the minds of Americans at home, and the adoption of the cross as the Bladensburg memorial must be viewed in that historical context,” Alito wrote. “Its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of ‘a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.'”
In the concurring opinions, justices agreed that religious expression in the public square has been common throughout U.S. history and doesn’t need to be purged. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor were the two dissenters, arguing that displaying the Peace Cross on a public highway is implying that the government elevates Christianity over other faiths.
“As I see it, when a cross is displayed on public property, the government may be presumed to endorse its religious content. The venue is surely associated with the State; the symbol and its meaning are just as surely associated exclusively with Christianity,” Ginsburg wrote.
Kelly Shackelford, the chief counsel to First Liberty, represented the plaintiff The American Legion in the case.
“This is a landmark victory for religious freedom. The days of illegitimately weaponizing the Establishment Clause and attacking religious symbols in public are over,” Shackelford said. “Our Founders would have been appalled at this attempt to make the government hostile to our religious heritage, history, and symbols. The attempted perversion of our Constitution is now over, and every American now has more freedom than they have had in decades, with a government no longer hostile to people or expressions of faith.”
Luke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said the court, “rightly recognized that religious symbols are an important part of our nation’s history and culture.” Here's the key concluding quote: /3 pic.twitter.com/00zwQeR6q4

Concord Case Takes A Page Out Of The Soviet Handbook,thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/20/special-counsel-case-russian-company-takes-page-soviet-handbook/,"By Adam Mill June 20, 2019
For nearly a year and a half, Special Counsel Robert Mueller piloted an audacious effort to protect Americans from “divisive” political speech from foreigners who might cause “discord” within the United States. If his successors are successful, the Department of Justice will gain the authority wielded by the Soviets and the Chinese to prevent politically unacceptable foreign ideas from reaching American eyes and ears.
A May 24, 2019 order in the “Russian interference” case United States v. Concord Management & Consulting exposes a particularly troubling flaw in the government’s effort to control, manage, and curate political ideas from abroad. The special counsel appears to have forgotten to explain how foreign political speech broke U.S. law.
According to the May 24 order, the government is required to demonstrate that Russia-based company Concord had a duty to play “Mother, may I?” with the DOJ and the Federal Elections Commission before posting political speech on the internet using assumed names. Without that, the entire criminal case falls apart.
As noted by Judge Dabney L. Freidrich, speech that might “sow discord among US voters through divisive social media posts and political rallies … by itself, was not illegal.” Truly, all political speech has the potential to be divisive or sow discord. The prosecution of any political criticism of Hillary Clinton without citing the specific laws supposedly being violated is troubling, to say the least.
The case against Concord rests on the idea that if a foreigner publishes “divisive” political speech critical of an American presidential candidate (but only if it’s not Trump), that person must first seek permission from the DOJ and the FEC, disclose his true identity, and reveal his source of funding.
Vivid proof of the potential for retaliation may be found in the DOJ bringing a criminal action to punish political speech that opposed its preferred candidate. The Concord case is all about letting the world know that the DOJ will not tolerate outside criticism of the candidate that aligns with its politics. As far as the candidate that doesn’t fit their preference (Trump in 2016), it’s open season. Pseudonymous Speech Is an American Tradition
The special counsel report offers sinister but unacceptably vague accusations against Concord, a Russian-based company that has entered its appearance to oppose criminal charges in an American courtroom. The Mueller report and indictment of Concord accuse the company of:
using fictitious US personas, to operate social media accounts and group pages designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists. Over time, these social media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences. … By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton.
It might sound sinister for foreigners to generate fake social media persona to intercede in political discourse, but consider how Mueller’s theory affects our own freedoms. Many Americans operate social media accounts under assumed names to avoid retaliation for controversial political speech. The use of alternate “fictitious” personas to offer opinions has been around for as long as political speech has existed.
Wikipedia cataloged nearly 50 pen names of writers who contributed to the constitutional debates more than 200 years ago. Alexander Hamilton wrote under the pen name of “Phocion.” Patrick Henry, who famously exclaimed, “Give me liberty, or give me death!” nevertheless promoted his safety by writing under the name “Senex.” Many other “fictitious personas” remain secret to this day.
The Mueller prosecution seeks to criminalize such speech under the auspices of preventing “fraud.” Yet anonymous or even pseudonymous speech is an essential and longstanding tradition. It allows the powerless to insert unpopular, but needed, dissent into the public forum, strengthening debate in the process.
It shouldn’t matter that the people attempting to speak under pseudonyms are foreign. Criminalizing foreign speech and actively blocking it from entering a country are the hallmarks of dictatorship and should remind people of Soviet jamming of Radio Liberty or present-day efforts by China to block foreign speech from reaching its citizens. Limiting Speech Is Un-American
The Mueller indictment’s criminalization of Concord’s effort to “sow discord” has chilling similarity to Chinese justifications for censorship: “to curb the harmful effects of illegal information on state security [and] public interests.” Mueller’s report makes little or no effort to explain why political speech that originates from another country is a crime. It’s not.
Mueller shouldn’t be attempting to punish speech critical of Clinton, particularly when no effort was made to criminalize the abundant foreign criticism of Trump. In protecting speech that occurs inside the United States, the Constitution doesn’t differentiate between foreign, domestic, anonymous or pseudonymous. In the boiling cauldron of political discourse, all viewpoints should be welcome. If the target of free speech is running for office, that simply makes the speech more relevant to the public.
It’s particularly damaging to freedom when the partisan Mueller squad criminalizes speech against Clinton but not Trump. Foreigners might not be allowed to vote in American elections, but free speech commands their access to our ears and eyes. We free citizens can decide what speech and claims over foreigners have merit, or not.
The solution to untrustworthy foreign political speech is not to empower politically motivated prosecutors to cleanse our democracy of what they deem “unacceptable speech.”If the really smart attorneys in the Department of Justice don’t agree with political speech, they are free to pen an opinion article explaining their viewpoint to Americans. If their ideas are so superior, prosecution should be completely unnecessary to triumph in the marketplace of ideas. The DOJ Should Be Politically Neutral
Complicating matters further, on April 24, 2019, Concord filed a motion seeking an order to show cause why Mueller shouldn’t be held in contempt. Concord argued that the Mueller report violated rules prohibiting prosecutors from public pronouncements of the defendant’s guilt that might poison a potential jury pool. Concord pointed to the fact that Attorney General William Barr’s public statements went beyond the Concord indictment to levy a new, otherwise uncharged allegation that the Russian government was behind Concord.
Concord complained that the actions of Barr and Mueller led to multiple news reports “that the Defendants in this case were operating as part of a Russian-government led interference campaign expressly linked to the allegations in United States v. Netyksho et al . This despite the fact that the indictment contains no such allegation.” Concord also disputes Barr’s characterization that the company’s internet activity was illegal.
On May 9, 2019, the government responded to Concord’s contempt motion with barely disguised disdain: “the few sentences cherry-picked by Concord from the report do not create any reasonable likelihood of interfering with a fair trial or otherwise prejudicing the due administration of justice.”
The government did not dispute that Mueller and Barr introduced new allegations to the press, but minimized the significance arguing, “Because the unredacted sections of the report concerning this case largely track the allegations in the public Indictment, there is no likelihood that the public report will interfere with a fair trial or prejudice the due administration of justice in this case.” In Today’s Political Climate, the More Speech the Better
Concord has pointed out that the government has the speech rules exactly backward. Concord has the right to speak out on any political topic, including criticizing Clinton. It’s the government that should refrain from trashing Concord outside of the courtroom.
The mere existence of Mueller’s Concord case deters foreign speech likely to offend our left-leaning DOJ. Suppose, and I’m picking a hypothetical example totally at random, a foreigner has information that a candidate’s son took money from a foreign interest while that interest had business pending before the candidate when he served in the government? If that candidate has the best chance to defeat Trump, should the DOJ deploy its awesome criminal prosecution powers to prevent that information from reaching the eyes and ears of the American electorate?
In a free country, we should welcome as much speech as possible, both foreign and domestic. In the post-Trump era, it appears like we’re headed for exactly the opposite. Adam Mill is a pen name.

Max Boot’s Absurd Hit Piece On Marco Rubio Proves Boot's Irrelevance,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/max-boots-absurd-hit-piece-marco-rubio-proves-boots-irrelevance/,"June 21, 2019 By David Marcus
The Washington Post’s Max Boot and I still have one thing in common: we both supported Marco Rubio in the 2016 Republican primary. I remember being at Rubio headquarters the night of the New Hampshire primary. It was supposed to be the beginning of his post-Iowa comeback. It wasn’t. After getting kneecapped by Chris Christie in a debate, Rubio floundered with the voters and his campaign was effectively finished.
I also have something in common with Rubio: I was also once Never Trump, ardently so. I had deep and serious existential concerns about what a Trump presidency would do to the country. It was almost a year into his presidency that I came to terms with the fact that Trump has not burned America to the ground. I still disagree with him on some things, and cringe at some of his comments, but no, the sky is not falling, and I had to finally admit that.
So now, has Rubio. For having such, temerity Boot accused Rubio yesterday of being a “fan-boy” who is “co-dependent on his abuser” and a “caddie” for the president. This, mind you, from a fedora-wearing scribe who claims to be appalled by the coarse nature of Trump’s discourse and his abandonment of norms. Boot is not the only person on the left who claims to be appalled by Trump’s aggressive rhetoric while using it as an excuse to engage in his own, but he is one of the worst offenders.
Rubio is a U.S. senator, which means he has an important job to do helping to guide and run the federal government. His job is not to throw temper tantrums about the president’s style, bogus allegations of obstruction of justice, not to stomp his foot and stand in the president’s way in some glorious act of virtue signaling.
Rather, his job is to represent his voters and work with his colleagues, including President Trump, to get things done. What do his voters want done? They want conservative judges. They want tax cuts. They want to aggressively fight against socialism here and around the world, and they want to stop rolling over in the culture wars. They want serious action to deal with the border crisis. On all of these issues Rubio has become a natural ally of Trump, whether Boot likes it or not.
To some extent, that was what Joe Biden was talking about this week when he discussed having worked in the Senate in the 1970s with segregationist Democrats even though he abhorred their views. His job was to pass legislation, not lead protests against other senators voted into office by the American people. For holding this view he has effectively been called a racist.
What Boot is asking Rubio and all conservatives to do is to hand the keys of the country over to the most radically leftist Democratic Party in American history. To embrace socialism, and abortion up until birth, to effectively allow for open borders, and to push Christians out of the public square while forcing them to celebrate gay marriages and Drag Queen Story Time. No thanks, Mr. Boot.
At the end of his progressive diatribe, Boot suggests Rubio has decided that Trump will be the future of the Republican Party and that he is probably right. So, here’s the thing on that. Should Trump win a second term, he will leave office at almost 80 years old. Rubio will be in his 50s, able to bridge the gap between the hardcore Trumpists and the concerned conservatives. He will not convince Boot or what remains of the Never Trump movement, but frankly they would probably now comfortably fit in a minivan.
Calling names at the man whom the vast majority of Republicans voted for in 2016, and insulting those very voters, is a good way to get a job at the Washington Post, but it is not a good way to lead the country. That job requires more serious men who put the country first and their petty squabbles second. That is exactly what Rubio has done over the last two years.
Boot is dead wrong about his final point — the GOP will not become the party of Trump, any more than Democrats are currently the party of Barack Obama. It will become the party of men like Rubio who stand by principles and policies, not just strong disdain for our president. It will still be the party that stands for life, markets, jobs, and capitalism. If Boot wants no part of that, then it isn’t the GOP that has changed. It’s him.

Jerry Nadler Is A Sexist Pig Who Should Be Censured By Congress,thefederalist.com,Caroline Court,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/jerry-nadler-sexist-pig-censured-congress/,"By Caroline Court June 21, 2019
On June 19, Hope Hicks, the former White House director of strategic communications then director of White House communications, was interviewed by the House Judiciary Committee. The interview was not public and was behind closed doors. Yesterday, a transcript of the interview was released.
It was revealed that during the interview Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) referred to Hicks as “Ms. Lewandowski” three separate times before she corrected him. If I hadn’t seen the transcript for myself, I simply would not have believed it.
Her name is Hope Hicks. It practically rolls off the tongue. It’s not forgettable. And certainly not a name that one would confuse.
The level of disrespect by a congressman to an individual testifying before Congress is absolutely stunning. The blatant sexism Nadler displayed simply cannot be ignored.
To back up for a minute, Lewandowski is of course a reference to Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager for Donald Trump. In the now widely discredited book by noted hack Michael Wolff, Wolff claimed that Hicks and Lewandowski had an affair while Lewandowski was married.
Wolff made many outrageous claims in his book, including salacious and disgusting claims about U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Wolff is a con artist, who like many others, saw a way to make a dollar off the Trump presidency. While the book was CNN fodder for a period of time, any reputable outlet saw it for what it was: tabloid trash.
Hicks is a very attractive young woman. She was a model early in her life. She is also a smart, well-educated woman, who previously worked at the Trump Organization. Indeed, she was Trump’s longest-serving aide at the time of her resignation. It’s been widely reported that not only was she was excellent at her job, she was someone Trump actually listened to. If you’ve been paying attention at all, you know that’s not an easy feat.
She earned her reputation as a loyal, hardworking White House staffer. She does not, under any circumstances, deserve some pants-up-to-his-chin congressman addressing her by the name of a man she may have dated. Dated. Not married.
Let’s be absolutely clear: Nadler knew exactly what he was doing. What he did was not only sexist, but purposeful and truly ugly. Whether or not Hicks and Lewandowski had an affair or even dated is completely beside the point. They were not a public couple posing for pictures for People Magazine. For Nadler to refer to her as Lewandowski is the lowest of the low, and entirely inappropriate.
Whether he did it to rattle her during her testimony, or to take a shot at Trump, is also irrelevant. I don’t care what his motive was. When you’re so obsessed with taking down a political opponent that you don’t care who is collateral damage, it’s really time to reassess what you’re doing with your life.
In this author’s opinion, Hicks showed restraint. She let Nadler pull this nonsense not once, not twice, but three times before she politely corrected him: “I’m Ms. Hicks.” I assure you my response would not have been as civil and definitely not as refrained. There was simply no reason, under any circumstances, for Nadler to confuse her for Lewandowski.
I won’t hold my breath, but surely the feminists will come to Hicks’s defense and demand that Nadler publicly apologize. Right?
Just kidding. I know they won’t. The hypocrisy and double standards in politics are as gross as Nadler’s conduct. When it’s your side that’s committed the malfeasance it’s easy to ignore or make excuses.
In the meantime, I will continue to call out these stunts. Congress is and always will be a joke. But stunts like this that attack and demean people should be unacceptable, no matter your party affiliation.
I strongly believe in congressional term limits. Nadler has been in Congress since 1992. He apparently feels comfortable enough to pull these disgusting stunts.
His treatment of Hicks is unacceptable and reprehensible. Yet it will go unpunished and I would be surprised if any of his colleagues on the same side of the aisle called him out for this gross behavior. I know people have lots of bad things to say about lawyers. But man, politics is so gross. @beyondreasdoubt is a criminal defense attorney in New York City. You can find her musings on Twitter."
Cutting Aid To Central America Won’t Solve The Border Crisis. It’ll Make It Worse,thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/cutting-aid-to-central-america-wont-solve-the-border-crisis-itll-make-it-worse/,"By John Daniel Davidson June 21, 2019
The U.S. State Department said Monday it would cut millions of dollars in foreign aid to Central America, because governments in the region haven’t done enough to curb the unprecedented surge of families and unaccompanied minors heading towards the U.S.-Mexico border.
This is a terrible idea that will almost certainly have the opposite of its intended effect. Simply put, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are in varying stages of societal collapse. Asking their governments to do more to end the crisis is like surveying Europe in 2015 and concluding that Syria needs to do more to control its borders.
Although announced by State, this is coming from the White House. President Trump ordered the cuts in late March, and Monday’s announcement revealed that $432 million in aid allocated in fiscal year 2017 would continue but $185 million would be withheld until the governments of the so-called “Northern Triangle” countries take “concrete actions” to reduce the numbers of families and minors now arriving at the southwest border. Future aid in 2019 and 2020, according to a State Department official, would be conditional. The Northern Triangle Is a Mess
Why is this a bad idea? Because these governments are not capable of taking “concrete actions.” They’re barely functioning. Consider that Guatemala, the country sending by far the most families and minors to the U.S.-Mexico border , is right now embroiled in a political corruption crisis.
The country just held national elections on Sunday, with two candidates heading to a runoff election in August. Both of them, a former first lady of the country and a former prisons director, vehemently oppose the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (or CICIG by its Spanish initials), a United Nations prosecutorial panel that’s been operating in Guatemala since 2007.
Why do they oppose CICIG? Because both have been caught up in the kinds of corruption schemes the panel was meant to stop. The former first lady, Sandra Torres, has been accused of campaign finance violations from her failed 2015 bid for president. The former prison director, Alejandro Giammattei, was charged (although not convicted) along with other high-ranking officials in a string of extrajudicial prison killings .
Not that these sort of things are uncommon in Guatemala. The country’s current president, Jimmy Morales, has been accused of campaign finance violations by CICIG, and in turn has waged a kind of open war against the panel, vowing not to renew its mandate when it expires in September. Indeed, there can be a heavy cost to working with CICIG. Former attorney general Thelda Aldana, who worked closely with the panel to prosecute high-profile politicians, was blocked from running for president by the courts.
Then again, the CICIG itself seems to have been absorbed into Guatemala’s ecosystem of political corruption and become a kind of fifth column in Guatemala. As the Wall Street Journal’s Mary Anastasia O’Grady noted last year , the panel’s “unchecked power has led to abuse,” with reports of witness tampering, illegal negotiations, and prolonged detention.
In one case, CICIG flouted Guatemalan law and a constitutional appeals court to convict a Russian family fleeing persecution. Their crime? Falling victim to a Guatemalan crime syndicate that sold them false identity documents through a law firm, which, oddly enough, was never prosecuted.
As if rampant political corruption weren’t enough, Guatemala is also facing widespread famine in its western highlands , where successive years of drought, failed harvests, and “coffee rust” fungus have devastated coffee farms and forced villagers, many of whom speak neither English nor Spanish, to head north.
We often hear of migrants fleeing violence, but the homicide rate in Guatemala is now at its lowest point since 2000. Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recently told the Washington Post that “Food insecurity, not violence, seems to be a key push factor informing the decision to travel from Guatemala, where we have seen the largest growth in the migration flow this year.” Without U.S. Aid and Support, Nothing Will Change
These are just two issues in one of the three Northern Triangle countries. In November, the brother of Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández was convicted of narcotics trafficking on a grand scale—according to the indictment, “multi-ton loads of cocaine that arrived in Honduras via planes, go-fast vessels, and on at least one occasion, a submarine.”
Family troubles aside, Hernández, whose popularity plummeted after he changed election rules to allow himself to seek a second term in 2017, is now facing mass riots throughout the country. There was unrest and widespread looting in the capitol city of Tegucigalpa on Wednesday after riot police, who were supposed to be keeping the peace, withdrew to their quarters to pressure the government for better benefits. On Thursday, Hernández deployed the military.
Things are slightly better in El Salvador, where the newly elected president, 37-year-old Nayib Bukele, has vowed to crack down on organized crime and, unlike past governments, has ruled out talks or truces with criminal gangs . However, since last year far fewer migrant families and minors have come from El Salvador than from Honduras and Guatemala, such that even if the country achieved zero emigration, the United States would still have a worsening border crisis on its hands.
The truth is, there’s not much these governments can do without direct help from the United States—and not just in the form of foreign aid. They need active help from U.S. law enforcement and immigration agencies. Some of that is happening, albeit on a very small scale. The Department of Homeland Security recently sent 80 agents and investigators to Guatemala to work with the national police and immigration officials to locate and interdict illegal human smuggling operations.
That’s a good first step, but more is needed—more aid, more advisors and assets, more involvement from the U.S. government, not less. Relying on Central American officialdom is just as naïve and misguided as relying on the Mexican National Guard to secure Mexico’s southern border.
It’s true that these countries need to be prodded and forced into action by U.S. policymakers, but the best way to get results on the U.S.-Mexico border is to step in and help them, not withhold aid in hopes they can gain control of their collapsing countries.

How Christianity Is Helping Keep Hong Kong’s Stunning Protests A Peaceful Beacon To The World,thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/christianity-helping-keep-hong-kongs-stunning-protests-peaceful-beacon-world/,"By Helen Raleigh June 21, 2019
What’s more impressive than 2 million people walking down central Hong Kong demanding freedom? How about the scene where the human wave moved to the side in an orderly fashion to let an ambulance pass without anyone directing them?
How about before going home for the night, the young protesters stayed to ensure there was no litter left on the streets that 2 million people walked? How about that there was nothing, not a trash can, nor a car, nor a building, burned down, despite protesters’ emotions running high?
Anyone who has paid close attention to Hong Kong recently can’t help being in awe at how well-behaved the Hong Kong protesters, especially the youth, have been throughout the anti-extradition bill protests, which have gone on for two weeks now.
Journalists tweeted grateful messages to those who helped them: Hong Kong's youth protestors are kind. I post this clip to say thanks. @CBSrandy was rolling when the police fired tear gas at the group we were in. An umbrella and helmet were forced on me.

Melissa Chan, an American journalist, tweeted: The people of Hong Kong should be up for the Nobel Peace Prize. Two million protesters — orderly, recycling, giving way to ambulances as massive crowds part, giving safety hat and gear to visiting foreign correspondents — what better example of peaceful resistance in 2019?
— Melissa Chan (@melissakchan) June 16, 2019
What contributed to Hong Kongers, especially the youth’s, orderly, thoughtful, and dignified behavior? The outspoken Cardinal Joseph Zen credits the city’s prevalent Catholic school education. He is not exaggerating.
In an article titled , “Church, State and Education: Catholic Education in Hong Kong during the Political Transition ,” John Kang Tan notes that “many schools subsidized by the Hong Kong Government have religious bodies.” More than 50 percent of secondary schools in Hong Kong are faith-based. Although only an estimated 10 percent of Hong Kongers identify as Christian, many more Hong Kongers receive a faith-based education, despite the city’s outward appearance of an overly commercial and secular society. Most of these schools are run by Protestant or Catholic religious bodies.
According to Tan, “In terms of the number of schools, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest denomination that sponsors schools.” Zen confirmed the island city has about 300 Catholic schools, from kindergartens to colleges, providing education to 25 percent of the population. Catholic schools have such a stellar reputation for quality that they are highly sought after by eager parents.
Why are there so many Catholic schools in Hong Kong? It has everything to do with the island’s colonial past. Catholicism and Colonialism
The first Catholic church in Hong Kong was founded in 1841, a year before the Chinese government officially ceded Hong Kong to the United Kingdom. Under British rule, Hong Kong was the freest city that is closest to mainland China, so foreign missionaries often established their bases here before they ventured onto the mainland.
As China suffered one war to another from the 19th to early 20th centuries, many mainland refugees flooded to Hong Kong. The Catholic church took the lead in providing orphanages, social services, medical care, and education to the poor and the displaced. Hong Kongers have more confidence in the church’s moral leadership than in the local government.
The first Catholic school in Hong Kong was founded in 1843, an all-male school. Since then, Catholic schools have played an important role in educating generations of Hong Kongers and shaping Hong Kong’s cultural, social, and political environment. On the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese’s education website , under “vision and mission,” it says its mission includes “help youth and students to cultivate wisdom and virtues, pursue the truth, verify merits, and to develop into persons who hold dear the basic human rights and dignity.”
After the United Kingdom handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the Catholic church didn’t retreat from politics. Catholic schools, like many agencies in Hong Kong, have faced intrusions from Beijing. A 2004 Education Bill attempted to interfere with the management of Catholic schools. The church fought back by pointing out to the pro-Beijing legislature that if Catholic schools “did not have the freedom to continue [their way of managing their schools], their mission would be ruined, and this would damage the entire society of Hong Kong.”
Zen, who was made cardinal in 2006, has been vocal on issues regarding human rights, political freedom, and religious liberty in Hong Kong as well as in mainland China. He warned Pope Francis not to be misled by Beijing. But the pope ignored his warning and reached an agreement with Beijing last year, accepting the atheist government’s authority over how Catholic bishops are appointed in China.
This means bishops and priests in mainland China will be selected by the Chinese government—run by the atheist Chinese Communist Party—and must prioritize their loyalty to the party and country before God. They have to support government-sanctioned practices such as support for abortion, which violates the church’s teaching. The Vatican hasn’t released any text of the agreement. Zen decried the deal as “a total surrender” by the Vatican and “an incredible betrayal” to the seven million Catholic faithful in mainland China.
This year, when Carrie Lam, the Beijing-appointed chief of Hong Kong, tried to rush a controversial extradition bill through the Hong Kong legislature, the Catholic church joined by several other Christian organizations, provided moral guidance to the opposition. The Catholic dioceses urged “[the Hong Kong government] not to rush to amend the fugitive bill before fully responding to the concerns of the legal sector and the public.” When it became obvious that Lam wouldn’t listen, Zen called the faithful to join the peaceful protests.
As The New York Times noted , “Christians have been a visible part of the protests this month, providing food and shelter at demonstrations and condemning efforts by the police to break them up . Many protesters, even those who are not religious, have embraced the teachings and messages of Christianity to denounce a proposed law to allow extraditions to mainland China.” Peaceful Protests By Faithful, Freedom-Seeking People
After Hong Kong authorities called the peaceful protests “riots,” Hong Kongers sought protection by singing “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord.” Because religious assemblies in Hong Kong are protected, they hoped signing the hymn would protect protesters from police attacks and show the authorities the peaceful nature of their protest. No wonder this hymn has become the movement’s theme song and has been heard everywhere the protests took place.
After Lam apologized to Hong Kong people this week but still refused to meet protesters’ demands, the Catholic dioceses asked the government to “launch a thorough independent inquiry” on reported police brutality and to “make an explicit, public statement that the Bill has been ‘withdrawn’ to meet the strong demand of the general public.”
The Catholic church and other Christian organizations’ active involvement adds a moral dimension to the protest. They unite Hong Kongers from all walks of life as one powerful voice against injustice. They also serve as a restraint that helps keep the protests peaceful. It’s very likely that without faith-based organizations’ involvement in Hong Kong’s education and politics, the mass protests might turn out very differently.
Here in the United States, churches may lose their tax-exempt status if pastors or priests discuss politics from the pulpit. Progressives have been lecturing us that our religious beliefs are “private matters” and have no place in a public forum.
That’s why they keep dragging nuns to court for not wanting to pay for contraception and suing the same Christian bakers over and over again for not being willing to make a cake to celebrate occasions that violate the bakers’ religious beliefs. Opponents of school choice argue that when parents send their kids to faith-based schools using school vouchers, they somehow blur the separation of church and state.
Such attacks on religion haven’t made us any happier. We are so bitterly divided that it seems we can’t get anything meaningful done. Some even feel justified in using violence to shut down disagreement. As we cheer for Hong Kongers in their fight for freedom and note how much churches have taken the lead in the movement, we Americans should probably learn something, too.

"Joe Biden’s Dixiecrat Comments Are Freaking Out The Left, But Not Many Dem Voters",thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/joe-bidens-dixiecrat-comments-freaking-left-not-many-dem-voters/,"By Warren Henry June 21, 2019
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden , criticizing the lack of civility in our current politics, spoke during a recent fundraiser about working with two unapologetically segregationist Dixiecrat senators: James Eastland and Herman Talmadge.
“I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,” Biden said, according the pool report. “He never called me ‘boy,’ he always called me ‘son.’” He also called Talmadge “one of the meanest guys,” before adding: “At least there was some civility. We got things done.”
Biden further stated: “We didn’t agree on much of anything. But today, you look at the other side, and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.”
The backlash to these comments from the left has already begun, from rival presidential candidates Bill de Blasio and Cory Booker , to almost-presidential candidate Sherrod Brown , to commentators like Jamil Smith and Jamelle Bouie. It’s 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of “civility” typified by James Eastland.

— b-boy bouiebaisse (@jbouie) June 19, 2019
This backlash will probably grow in breadth and intensity, but it has as much to do with the state of the Democratic Party—as identified by Biden—as it does with opposition to segregationists. There are at least four additional reasons for the hostile reactions.
The first, most obvious reason to attack Biden’s comments about working with Dixiecrats is opportunism. Biden is not defending Jim Crow. His critics do not think he is a closet segregationist. If anything, Biden is analogizing today’s Republican politicians to yesterday’s segregationists, which is something Democrats do as a matter of routine.
But Biden is the current front-runner for his party’s presidential nomination, largely on the strength of his appeal to black voters. Accordingly, he has been attacked for his past opposition to forced busing as a remedy for school segregation in the 1970s (it was not wildly popular with black families either ). It follows that he will be attacked for noting he worked with segregationists to advance his agenda.
Second, the left does not particularly want Biden reminding people that the Democrats were the party of segregation as recently as within his lifetime (and the lifetimes of many voters). As much as the left enjoys throwing the race card indiscriminately, it would prefer to avoid those specifics.
Democrats have worked hard to whitewash their racist history . When this history comes up, the left shifts to a lazy narrative about the GOP becoming filled with racists following the passage of the Civil Rights Acts as part the “Southern Strategy.” The story of the political realignment of the South is much more complex , but the left can succeed with it if they keep the narrative shallow. Biden allowing for fraught complexities on an issue as sensitive as civil rights does not aid the left.
Third, while Biden is implicitly comparing Republicans to segregationists, he is not doing it harshly enough for the left. By suggesting that if he could work with Eastland and Talmadge, he could also work with Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he is implying—correctly—that McConnell is nowhere near as toxic. This suggestion is unacceptable to the left.
Fourth, and perhaps most important, attacking Biden as a segregationist sympathizer allows the left to dodge the substance of what he actually said. In addition to criticizing the “you’re the enemy” attitude of our current politics, Biden added: “I know the new New Left tells me that I’m ― this is old-fashioned. Well guess what? If we can’t reach a consensus in our system, what happens? It encourages and demands the abuse of power by a president. That’s what it does.”
The new New Left understandably does not like being attacked in this way, particularly while Biden is leading in the polls. The new New Left have abandoned Rev. Martin Luther King Jr’s frame that the American experiment is great and black Americans want to fully participate in it. Instead, the left is embracing an identity politics rooted in the idea that America is irredeemably founded in white supremacy and plunder and thus must be torn down in favor of some revolutionary replacement.
Politics is often called the art of compromise, but identarianism politicizes All The Things and renders every disagreement a personal attack . Ironically, Biden is critiquing the reasoning by which President Obama tried to use his “phone and pen” to unconstitutionally make immigration policies Congress rejected.
None of this is a defense of Biden as a politician. After all, Biden is implying today’s GOP is not much different from the Dixiecrats. And he was far more explicit in telling black Americans in 2012 that Republican presidential ticket Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan were “ going to put y’all back in chains .”
But black Americans may understand Biden’s latest point better than his critics do. This year, black Democrats in Virginia apparently had a more mature (or resigned) attitude when top Democratic officials turned out to have blackface photos in their pasts. They were less likely to call for resignations than political elites and woke pundits. It is a more practical approach than trendy identitarianism.
This more practical perspective may be why House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn is defending Biden , stating that his past work with Sen. Strom Thurmond was “similar to Biden working with Talmadge.” Indeed, five more members of the Congressional Black Caucus have jumped to his defense , noting that Biden’s remarks are being taken out of context and this call for decency is needed now more than ever.

The Supreme Court’s Reasoning In The Bladensburg Cross Case Is A Mess,thefederalist.com,Ilya Shapiro,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/supreme-courts-reasoning-bladensburg-cross-case-mess/,"By Ilya Shapiro June 21, 2019
Thursday morning, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in American Legion v. American Humanist Association that a 100-year-old World War I memorial cross in Bladensburg, Maryland, doesn’t “establish” religion. That’s the correct result (read my brief for Cato ), but the mish-mash of opinions—it took a paragraph to explain which justice was joining which aspect of the decision—leaves Establishment Clause jurisprudence in the muddled state it’s been for decades.
That is, much like in the Ten Commandments cases of 2005 , the cross here survived largely because it’s really, really old. Justice Samuel Alito, joined in full by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Brett Kavanaugh, and in all but two subparts by Justice Elena Kagan—Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch concurred in the judgment, but wrote separately—offered four reasons for a “strong presumption of constitutionality” in favor of “retaining established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols and practices.”
First, it’s “especially difficult” to identify the “original purpose or purposes” of such religiously expressive icons. Second, “as time goes by, the purposes associated with an established monument, symbol, or practice often multiply”; they may be maintained “for the sake of their historical significance or their place in a common cultural heritage.”
Third, the message they convey might also change over time. Consider, for example, the Statue of Liberty, Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, many American cities with religious names (Bethlehem, Penn.; Las Cruces, New Mexico; Corpus Christi, Texas; etc.), Arizona’s state motto ( Ditat Deus , or “God enriches”), and Maryland’s cross-filled flag.
Fourth, removing a historic monument “may no longer appear neutral,” but provide evidence of anti-religious animus. As Alito put it in one of the passages that likely led Breyer and Kavanaugh to call the opinion “eloquent” and Kagan to “find much to admire”: “A government that roams the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine will strike many as aggressively hostile to religion.”
Alito then explained how these four considerations apply to crosses such as WWI memorials, including the “solemn image of endless rows of white crosses” and the popularity of the poem “In Flanders Fields.” The Bladensburg Cross fits into that narrative. As Justice Antonin Scalia might have put it, this war memorial comes as a war memorial.
Justice Alito’s majority opinion thus does well not to apply the beleaguered Lemon test —looking to the purpose and effects of government action, as well as “entanglement” with religion—but in squeezing that sour fruit, he lost Justice Elena Kagan’s vote and thus his majority (leaving a plurality). Still, with Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Thomas) saying that Lemon is now “shelved” and Justice Kavanaugh noting that “the Court no longer applies the old test articulated by Lemon . . . [which is] not good law,” it’s clear that this nearly 50-year-old case is pretty much obsolete.
Alito himself noted that Lemon “presents particularly daunting problems in cases, including the one now before us, that involve the use, for ceremonial, celebratory, or commemorative purposes, of words or symbols with religious associations.” Moreover, as Kavanaugh explained, Lemon doesn’t inform Supreme Court decisions in other Establishment Clause contexts either, whether regarding religious accommodations in generally applicable laws, government benefits and tax exemptions for religious groups, religious expression in public schools, or the regulation of private religious speech in public forums.
Then why not go further and scrap Lemon explicitly? This area of law has long been plagued with judicial hand-waving at nebulous standards, producing results good for a particular case only, without real guidance about the kinds of actions regarding religion that governments can take (or allow to be taken on government property).
James Madison, arguably the Constitution’s most important framer, strongly opposed state religion because colonial Virginia was teeming with religious persecution. Preachers were jailed for simply publishing their religious views. The official state religion was integrated with many parts of the government.
This had a profound effect on Madison. When he wrote his draft of the First Amendment, Madison envisioned the Establishment Clause as the culmination of his philosophy on religion and government, with liberty of conscience as the centerpiece. His purpose was to ensure that people could exercise their faith free from compulsion. The Establishment Clause was thus a shield to defend “individual liberty of conscience.”
As justices Thomas and Gorsuch explain in their concurrences, the Supreme Court in future should return to the original public meaning of the Establishment Clause, which ensures liberty of conscience and protects people from truly “established” state religions that coerce belief and support. A non-coercive, harmless monument—a cross memorial, or a Star of David, or any other religious symbol—is not an establishment of religion. As seven justices correctly found here, tearing down an old war memorial instead establishes an anti-religious orthodoxy, with a mandate that religious symbols be eradicated from public life.
The Framers did not intend for that to happen, but maybe the fact that we’re fighting over ticky-tack things like this is a good indication that nobody in America is really trying to establish religion—compelling religious worship or financing, on penalty of state law—any more. The real dangers to the freedom of conscience now come more from government mandates and regulations that infringe on the free exercise of systems of belief, religious and secular alike.

African Americans Don’t Need Reparations. We Need To Take Responsibility For Our Lives,thefederalist.com,Emery McClendon,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/african-americans-dont-need-reparations-need-take-responsibility-lives/,"By Emery McClendon June 21, 2019
In 2007, much like today, liberals were demonizing the president and looking to shore up their base for the next major election. An issue dragged out of the political closet was the notion of paying reparations to blacks now for slavery dating back to before America’s founding. Here they go again.
The vehicle then, as today, is a bill to set up a commission for studying the idea of a national apology for slavery and post-Civil War segregation as well as possible taxpayer reparations payments to black Americans. Back then, the bill was sponsored by Michigan Rep. John Conyers.
This year, because Conyers resigned due to allegations of sexual misconduct, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee is carrying the torch for reparations with the apparent blessing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Several liberal presidential contenders also recently weighed in favoring reparations.
It’s significant that the congressional hearing for Jackson Lee’s House Resolution 40 on this issue was held on June 19. Known as “Juneteenth,” it is the anniversary of when blacks in Texas first learned about the end of the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and their freedom. It is now celebrated nationwide to commemorate the end of black enslavement in America. It is also a day when black Americans are supposed to celebrate opportunity and self-determination—values prized by those newly freed slaves in Texas.
It is ironic that blacks are still calling for reparations in 2019, and using Juneteenth to do it. We have had many opportunities to put ourselves on equal footing with other Americans and pursue the American Dream. But too many of us have failed to do so.
We failed after the Civil War, during the civil rights era, and with President Lyndon B. Johnson’s implementation of the Great Society and its major welfare initiatives. Those were supposed to be revitalizing times for blacks. Yet, in the last case, welfare only increased dependence and destroyed families. What happened?
Over the years, black leaders failed to bring their communities to prosperity by promoting and teaching sound principles for economic growth. They also failed to help people use the resources that are available to every American regardless of their ethnic background.
It is said that one reason LBJ built the modern welfare state was to help secure black votes for his party. Yet Democrats’ ill-conceived policies actually caused more poverty in the black community. It caused more blacks to look for a handout rather than seek a hand up through self-determination. It essentially made the black community increasingly dependent on the government.
Reparations are treated as the cure for inequality. But they are not. Successful blacks such as actor Danny Glover and author Ta-Nehisi Coates call for reparations during a period in our history when illegal aliens are being handed benefits intended for disadvantaged American citizens. They are draining taxpayer resources and our economy at an alarming rate.
Why should blacks want to seek reparations in the 21th century when slavery was ended by the Civil War more than 150 years ago? Why are Congress and others suddenly getting in on the act? It’s merely politics.
Reparations should not be a topic of discussion in today’s America. Progress and success should be our focus as we strive to achieve the American Dream. We should focus on keeping America great, not looking for another huge socialist payout.
Congress should instead be reminding black Americans that opportunities already exist for them as they have existed for generations. It’s up to individuals to take advantage of these opportunities and strive to succeed.
Let’s flip the script from reparations to personal responsibility. The latter will bring about lasting results that a reparations check can never do. Emery McClendon is a member of the Project 21 black leadership network and a tea party activist in the state of Indiana. Photo"
5 Things To Expect From President Trump Live-Tweeting The Democratic Debates,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/5-things-expect-president-trump-live-tweeting-democratic-debates/,"By Margot Cleveland June 21, 2019
When the top 20 Democratic presidential candidates trade jabs during the first set of their primary debates on June 26 and June 27, they’ll have more to worry about than a fellow contender landing a knock-out punch—at least if the Wall Street Journal is correct that President Donald Trump will live-tweet the event.
The harm the Democrats will inflict on each other when they square off in two groups of ten on back-to-back nights at NBC News is minor compared to the devastation the president can wreak in 280 characters by distracting the media and redirecting the focus to his narrative. If the past is any predictor, here’s what we can expect. 1. Coining New Nicknames
Trump’s penchant for nicknames is so prolific that there is an entire Wikipedia page summarizing the various monikers he has bestowed on politicians and media personalities. Trump has already christened several of the Democrats vying for the presidential nomination with names meant to both irritate the individual and educate the public, as well as send the media down a rabbit hole of epic proportions.
The president’s nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren proves the point. Calling the Massachusetts senator “Pocahontas” forces the media to repeatedly report the genesis of the pet name: Warren’s unfounded claim of Native-American ancestry for the apparent reason of gaming the affirmative action hiring practices of the modern university.
The nickname also unnerves Warren, so much so that she resorted to releasing a 23 and Me genetic analysis to “prove” her claimed Native-American ancestry and taping an entire video segment of her DNA reveal. Not only did the press report the “story” of Warren’s supposed proof of her Native-American bona fides, they even asked the president—the president of the United States—about it. “Who cares,” Trump scoffed, leaving a confused media in his wake.
Then, by week’s end, Warren’s attempt to shut down debate over the “scandal” brewing since 2012 when opponent Scott Brown first exposed her duplicity, blew up in her face when the Boston Globe was forced to correct its coverage . “Warren’s genetic ancestry was based not on Native American DNA, but on Mexican, Peruvian, and Colombian DNA,” the newspaper was forced to admit, and tests showed only a 1/64 to 1/1024 heritage—possibly lower than “the average European-American” in actual Native American DNA.
In addition to Pocahontas, Trump has already branded several other Democratic presidential candidates. There’s Sleep Creepy Joe for former vice president Joe Biden, High-Tax Andrew Cuomo for the New York governor, Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Alfred E. Neuman for South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Who’s next in line and what catch-phrase Trump will choose is as unpredictable as it is predictable that he will add one or more to his repertoire and the candidate and the media will respond as intended—dedicating a news cycle to non-news injected with a quick tweet. 2. Saying the Shocking
Equally predictable? That Trump will tweet something shocking, whether it be un-P.C., outright rude, or just bluntly speaking a truth the mainstream media refuses to report or covers only tentatively.
The ripest candidate for this approach is Kamala Harris, given her affair with the married former mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, because sex sells and highlighting the press’ double standard motivates the MAGA movement. There has been some coverage of Harris’s relationship with Brown, which Brown admitted to while acknowledging that during the affair he launched Harris’s political career with potentially quid-pro-quo political appointments.
But the scant coverage of Harris’ improprieties pales in comparison to the media’s focus on Trump’s proven (Marla Maples) or rumored (Stormy Daniels) past affairs, and none of Trump’s past misdeeds involved doling out political spoils, which Harris accepted.
Whether Trump takes aim at Harris for her sex scandal won’t be known until day two of the debates, when the California senator duels with three other front-leaders in the crowded Democratic pack: Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden, and Buttigieg. But if Trump does target Harris with a tweet, he’ll likely follow his formulistic approach that includes one or more of the following: buzzwords (“pathetic” “loser”), a nickname, misspelling a key word, InExplicable random capitalization, shocking language, and enough of the scandal to intrigue, but not enough to explain, forcing the media to do the job it has refused to do to date.
Or Trump might resort to an ambiguously worded attack on Harris or another candidate, with the media then paraphrasing the president and reporting the worst-possible interpretation of the tweet as fact and as proof that Trump is a racist, sexist, or homophobe. Once the media falls for Trump’s tactic, he’ll pounce and use the incident to further his fake-news narrative. My guess for a target here is Buttigieg. 3. Feeding the In-Fighting
Trump’s tweets will also likely pit two or three of the candidates (and their supporters) against one another. We saw this approach when Sanders took on the Democratic National Committee-anointed Hillary Clinton. Expect Trump to remind the socialist-leaning base of the Democratic Party that Sanders was robbed, while suggesting Biden waits in the wings to steal the nomination from the now-rightful heir. A simple “DNC robbed Bernie in 16 and now Biden’s ready to steal the nomination again,” tweet, better phrased by the master, will serve the purpose simply enough.
Then watch for Trump to further exploit the vast Democratic field and divided loyalties by tweaking Biden for failing to get the endorsement of his BFF, former President Barack Obama. As the debate unfolds, and the candidates unleash their prepared attacks on their fellow liberals, a mere smattering of tweets by Trump will amplify the soundbites, bringing the intramural debate into the limelight.
The status quo of the primary debates sees the parties playing to their base, while the general populace remains oblivious to the machinations riveting political junkies of all stripes. Then, when the general election rolls around, the candidates shift to more moderate tones and one happy family gets behind the eventual nominee.
But two nights of live tweeting by the president—more than a year out of the general election—will change this dynamic, first by highlighting, and thus fueling, party schisms, making it more difficult for inter-party riffs to heal. Second, Trump’s tweets will expose the extreme leftist positions championed by the Democratic presidential field to the normally uninterested apolitical American, making the transition to moderation a near impossibility. 4. Throwing Shade at Recalcitrant Republicans
Democrats won’t be the only ones likely targeted in any tweet storm: Look for Trump to also hit recalcitrant Republicans. John Kasich serves this dual purpose well. Think: “Alfred E. Newman has the appeal of Kasich. NOne.” Or “Kasich’s dad was a postman. Biden rides Am Trak. WHO CARES?”
Or maybe it’s the Never Trump fringe that takes some unfriendly fire. Trump could score a Twitter trifecta by slamming Democratic debate moderator Rachel Maddow. Comparing Maddow’s anti-Trump bias to that the president faces from some previously right-leaning pundits, like Bill Kristol and Max Boot, the president could successfully cast his Never Trump opponents as no better than his rabid, irrational critics on the left.
In the process, the president can castigate Maddow and her cohorts, playing the liberal media bias theme to his benefit. Stressing Maddow’s bias allows Trump to suggest to the party faithful that the MSNBC reporter plays favorites, and then by highlighting any partiality in her questioning of the candidates, Trump can sow further discord among the candidates and their supporters. 5. Celebrating His Accomplishments
The two nights of presidential Twitter won’t likely focus solely on snark and shade. Substance and success, or “winning bigly,” will likely share equal billing for the president. Whether it be the economy, jobs, judicial appointments, or deregulation, the president has plenty of accomplishments to tout, but the media continues to downplay or ignore them. Just by suggesting he’ll have his smartphone at the ready, Trump has put himself in the head of every Democratic contender.
Watch for Trump to jump the legacy media and take his message to the people under the guise of debate commentary. With every new, ridiculous proposal floated by the vying candidates, Trump can counter with the specifics on his successes.
Look also for the Democratic candidates to continue the Russia collusion turned obstruction hoax. While that may play to the left’s base, if Trump tweets out rejoinders, the moderate middle will see the candidates for what they are: conspiracy-obsessed caricatures worthy of disdain.
Trump can promote his survival of the Deep State’s attempts to undo the election results as one of his greatest accomplishments—and something it is doubtful any other Republican could have achieved. With a crafty tweet along these lines, Trump can easily parlay the debate into further evidence of the Democrats’ desperation.
While Trump’s top aides reportedly advised the president “to let the Democrats attack each other in the media and onstage while remaining outside of the fray,” in this case, Trump would be best served to ignore the guidance. Just by suggesting he’ll have his smartphone at the ready, Trump has put himself in the head of every Democratic contender.
The candidates must now focus, not just on what one of their primary opponents might say, and to which they will have an opportunity to respond in real time, but also on what the president is tweeting out, unanswered, to millions. Their campaigns are likely now crafting clever one-liners to preempt Trump’s tweets, but as the Republican primaries proved, you can’t beat Trump at his own game, so you’re better off not trying.

"Russell Kirk’s Gift To Conservatives, Reborn",thefederalist.com,Casey Chalk,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/russell-kirks-gift-conservatives-reborn/,"By Casey Chalk June 21, 2019
“The individual is foolish, but the species is wise,” wrote eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish statesman Edmund Burke, in a humorous articulation of conservatism. Nineteenth-century American satirist Ambrose Bierce, in his notorious Devil’s Dictionary , carried on this witty tradition in defining a conservative as one “who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others.” William F. Buckley, a leading light of twentieth-century conservatism, similarly defined the conservative in 1955 as “someone who stands athwart history, yelling Stop.”
It would seem, then, that the best means of determining a robust definition of conservatism in 2019 is to look the past. Russell Kirk’s Concise Guide to Conservatism , largely forgotten after its original publishing in 1957 and now re-released by Regnery, offers perhaps the best (and likely shortest, at 103 pages) definition available. An Essential Conservatism
Kirk’s guide is an impressive feat, presenting conservatism’s essential tenets in 12 chapters, all less than ten pages. Religious faith, conscience, individuality, family, community, just government, private property, power, education, change, and the republic are all addressed in pithy, yet accessible language.
Like Bierce and Buckley, Kirk’s conception of conservatism centers on what Edmund Burke called the “contract of eternal society,” or what G.K. Chesterton termed the “democracy of the dead.” It is suspicious of revolutions, top-down societal engineering, and technocratic sneering that views the traditionalist as ignorant and backward. As intellectual historian H. Stuart Hughes quipped, “conservatism is the negation of ideology.”
Nevertheless, Kirk in his first chapter, “The Essence of Conservatism,” presents what he views as the “chief principles” of American conservatism. Apart from a bow to the wisdom of the past, conservatives recognize a universal moral law that finds its origin in God — something that shouldn’t be controversial, given the Founders’ insistence in man’s rights “endowed by their creator.” Conservatives also prize variety and diversity over “uniformity and absolute equality,” meaning respect and safeguarding of alternative opinions in the public square.
Conservatives prioritize justice and equal rights, “but not to equal things,” a sentiment reminiscent of Jordan Peterson’s eschewing of “equality of outcome.” Conservatives prize property and freedom, while seeking to preserve checks and balances in political power. They recognize the need for true, deep community. They set an example for the world, rather than trying to remake it in America’s image. Conservatives are “suspicious of all utopian schemes,” and believe, with Lord Falkland, that “when it is not necessary to change, it is necessary not to change.” Conservatism and Religion
“The true conservative,” writes Kirk, “at heart is a religious man.” He cites a long list, including Washington, Adams, Madison, and Lincoln, among many other American statesmen, who all in their own way were deeply religious. Edmund Burke labeled religion “the basis of civil society, and the source of all good and all comfort.”
Kirk, in turn, says conservatives see “human society as an immortal contract between God and man,” that men are created in God’s image, and that “the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.” There is a utility to this reasoning: A society denying religious truth “lacks faith, charity, justice, and any sanction for its acts.” As scholar Arthur C. Brooks discovered more than a decade ago , conservatives, and particularly religious conservatives, are the most generous and charitable demographic in America.
Yet there is more to the argument. A religious society recognizes the transcendent quality of life and community more broadly, seeking to reflect, albeit imperfectly given our sinful natures, the eternal justice of the divine. Only proper recognition of the divine moral law can help us approximate a just society. Moreover, we are all ultimately going somewhere beyond here , meaning materialist, utopian, this-worldly answers to our problems won’t obtain. We can’t make our world perfect by “world planners, and civil servants and enactments.” We have to await God to fully realize a new, perfect world.
This search for justice focuses not on amorphous categories of “people,” or “the masses,” but on individual persons. As Orthodox theologian Alexander Schmemann observed, atheist socialist movements focus on impersonal societal categories; Jesus calls Christians to love this person, the man or woman in front of you.
Conservatism thus must inculcate a healthy conscience that possesses a loyalty to individual persons, rather than the more vague “society at large.” Indeed, it is foolhardy to expect impersonal laws or obligations to inculcate virtue. Rather, when man views the persons around him as individuals created in the image of God, he is more likely to love them and feel a certain obligation towards them. Conservatism and Community
This necessarily broadens the conversation to contemplate the broader community. Although individual persons must regulate their behavior through informed consciences, this does not negate the obligations placed upon the citizen. This begins, says Kirk, with the family. He writes:
The conservative feels that the family is the natural source and core of any good society; that when the family decays, a dreary collectivism is sure to supplant it; and that the principal instrument of moral instruction, ordinary education, and satisfactory economic life always must remain in the family.
The family is our very first “little platoon,” in the favorite Burkean phrase. Although Kirk writes more than 60 years ago, his reflections on the family could have been penned yesterday. Progressives attempt “to have the political state assume nearly all the responsibilities which the family once possessed.”
We observed this in the increasing number of stories of state intervention in parents’ decisions regarding their children’s sexuality , and the heightened tension between the sexes as women publicly — and with warm societal approval — deride their own husbands . Yet the family is not a “simple arrangement for the gratification of sexual impulses, and more than a mere housing device.” It is, rather, where we are taught “the meaning of love and duty, and what it is to be a true or a true woman.” Erode the family, and you inevitably erode the nation.
Indeed, the familial catechesis of children enables them to participate in their communities, as individuals learn to practice the love and sacrifice they have been taught in the home. Again prophetic, Kirk warns of “the centralization of production and distribution, the decay of rural patterns of living, the excessive mobility of population, the standardization of amusements and customs, the well-meant (though mistaken) drift in many quarters toward consolidation of local political and charitable functions into state and federal bureaucracies.”
Much of this can be blamed on allowing centralized power to assume the burdens of local community. This disastrously removes decision-making further away from the communities affected by those policies. Although it is “vexatious to serve on local school boards or to have to attend the meetings of private charitable societies, or to pay for local improvements out of local funds,” the alternative is to undermine the very existence of local communities. Conservatism and Government
This is not to say that government, even the federal government, is evil. As Kirk writes, “government is a necessary good — so long as it is just, constitutional, balanced, restricted government. Justice, order, and freedom are dependent upon a satisfactory balance between government authority and private rights.” Indeed, Kirk adroitly argues that the American political experiment is a conservative melding of Jewish morality, Roman law, and Christian dignity, while also a careful preservation of centuries of English law.
When a French reformer claimed America had created an entirely new thing based on abstract principles, John Adams retorted: “Fool! Fool!” Conservatism promotes subsidiarity, or what American political theorist Orestes Brownson called “territorial democracy,” the tenet that whatever political functions can be managed lower down the chain of power, all the better.
Given the weaknesses of human nature, conservatives recognize that all men and women “always will seek power.” Thus, power must be restrained through a political balance that avoids consolidating it in one branch or one level of government, while promoting ethical instruction and good laws.
This also extends to foreign policy, limiting political leaders’ attempts to wield various arms of power — the military, economic and political influence, U.S.-funded nongovernmental organizations— to remake the world in America’s image: “It is better not to do a thing at all than to do it by means which may imperil the whole complex civil social order.” Sadly the “conservatives” behind many of the global conflicts of the last twenty years have neglected this principle.
As should be evident, Kirk’s “manifesto” is a powerhouse of succinctly crafted articulations of conservatism. His excellent chapter on education, for example, includes the haunting lament that “many college graduates today cannot write a simple letter as well as a sixth-grade student would have written it fifty years ago.” This was written in 1957 .
Kirk’s guide has aged remarkably well, and remains a powerful summation of conservative principles and a warning if these principles are abandoned. Kirk witnessed their erosion at a time many conservatives wish we could return to. How much further must we fall before we heed Kirk’s warnings?

Biden Team Gripes To Press After Segregationist Gaffe,thefederalist.com,Tristan Justice,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/biden-team-gripes-press-segregationist-gaffe/,"June 21, 2019 By Tristan Justice
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is on defense this week after touting his friendly relationships with former segregationist senators as examples of his “civility.” Biden name-dropped former Sens. James Eastland (D-Miss.) and Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) at a Tuesday fundraiser as evidence of the former vice president’s ability to work successfully with others.
“At least there was some civility,” Biden said. “We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished.”
Biden’s remarks faced immediate backlash, and Democratic presidential rivals seized on the comments, putting the Biden campaign on defense.
First to attack the current Democratic front-runner was Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who called on Biden to apologize for using relationships with segregationist senators as evidence of “civility.” A unusually defiant Biden however, fought back.
“Apologize for what?” Biden told a reporter on Wednesday. “There’s not a racist bone in my body. I’ve been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period. Period. Period.”
Others joined Booker in piling on calls for Biden to apologize, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
“It’s 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of ‘civility’ typified by James Eastland. Eastland though my multiracial family should be illegal & that whites were entitled to ‘the pursuit of dead n*ggers,’” de Blasio posted on Twitter along with a picture of his black wife.

“If you ignore racism and if you don’t address issues of race with racists, then everything is fine, right?” Cortez told Politico. “That’s how you work with segregationists: By not confronting the racism and their institutionalization of second-class citizenship and a lack of fully recognizing African Americans.”
Other prominent Democrats came to Biden’s defense, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and high-ranking members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
“He has lived his life, he considers certain things a resource that he has worked across the aisle, that’s what he was saying,” Pelosi said to reporters at her weekly press briefing Thursday, reported Fox News.
U.S. Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), the House Democratic whip and highest-ranking African-American in Congress, also came to Biden’s defense.
“I don’t see anything different in what Biden said to what we all do over here,” Clyburn told reporters, according to The New York Times. “He didn’t say anything more than I would say to describe my work with Strom Thurmond and a few others.”
U.S. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus said that she hopes people will move on. “I certainly wish that he hasn’t have said it,” Bass told CNN. “I think there’s a lot of other examples of where he has worked in a bipartisan fashion, but I would like to see us move on from there.”
Reps. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), both members of the Congressional Black Caucus, also declined to join calls for Biden to apologize, reported CNN.
“I haven’t seen anything from Joe Biden that suggests at this moment that he should apologize,” Jeffries said. He serves as a member of the House Democratic leadership team.
Since his remarks, Biden’s record on civil rights has come under further scrutiny . While Biden has refused to apologize, he did attempt to refine his remarks at a Maryland fundraiser on Wednesday when speaking about his time served in the Senate, according to Politico.
“We had to put up with the likes of, like Jim Eastland and Hermy Talmadge and all those segregationists and all of that… We in fact detested what they stood for in terms of segregation and all the rest,” Biden told donors, Politico reported . “We restored the Voting Rights Act, we did it, and over time we extended it by 25 years not just five years.” Tristan Justice is a staff writer at The Federalist."
Franchise-Best ‘Toy Story 4’ Puts A Forky In It,thefederalist.com,James Dawson,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/franchise-best-toy-story-4-puts-forky-delightfully-done/,"By James Dawson June 21, 2019
Nine years ago, “Toy Story 3” seemed to wrap up the beloved series quite neatly by giving Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and company a new everything-old-is-new-again home with the adorable toddler Bonnie. Accordingly, news that Disney/Pixar would be going back to the toy box for yet another sequel couldn’t help but sound like a “Cars”-style milk-the-kids cash grab. Also, pre-release info implied the new installment would include a hammered-in female-empowerment angle that could overwhelm the fun with too much social-justice lesson-forcing.
Well, forget every one of those concerns. “Toy Story 4” is not only a more than worthy extension of the blockbuster brand, it is the finest of the four movies so far. To get an idea of how rare that is, try thinking of another cinematic fourth time at bat that became a mega-franchise’s best installment. James Bond’s “Thunderball?” Not even as good as its predecessor (“Goldfinger”). “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Pt. 2,” “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides?” No way. “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,” “Batman & Robin,” “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” “Terminator: Salvation,” “Superman IV: The Quest for Peace?” Please.
The main contender that comes to mind is “Mad Max: Fury Road,” which is unexpectedly fitting. That’s because Bo Peep (voiced by Annie Potts), who has appeared in all four “Toy Story” installments—but only briefly and with nothing to say in the last—is transformed here into an Imperator Furiosa-lite porcelain badass who even has her own custom-made set of wheels. Leaving behind the table lamp she formerly graced and taking along her three-headed sheep, she now scavenges in the wild as the cheerfully spunky alpha leader of other cut-loose rejects.
The screenplay (credited to Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom) manages to make Bo’s unlikely metamorphosis believable by giving her a good reason for going rogue and getting tough. She’s the latest victim of the oblivious thoughtlessness of children in the series who have lost interest in former treasures and cast them unsentimentally aside. These movies never have shied away from realistically showing that kids can be casually cruel in that regard, unconditionally loving something one minute and then coldly consigning it to the closet (or worse) the next.
A flashback reveals that Bo got separated from the rest of the gang when Molly, younger sister of the franchise’s original main human character Andy, allowed her mother to get rid of the lamp that Bo occupied. After escaping later from an antiques store shelf, Bo has been living off the grid and apparently thriving.
Including such a strong female character this time around may have been an attempt by Disney/Pixar to partially compensate for some embarrassing real-world #MeToo missteps. Former studio head and “Toy Story” director/co-creator John Lasseter (who co-directed “Toy Story 2” and has shared story credit on all four movies) exited the company in 2018 following allegations of sexual misconduct.
Regardless of what inspired Bo Peep’s power-up and promotion to the franchise’s front ranks, what matters is that the change doesn’t feel frustratingly forced or irritatingly agenda-advancing. She’s definitely the character who takes charge and wears the pants—or pantalettes—this time around, after she ditches her hoop skirt to get in action mode, but she rises to her new role with appealing aplomb.
As always, Woody the cowboy doll (voiced by a never-better Tom Hanks) is the movie’s heart, but Bo is the strategy-and-tactics brains of an operation to rescue the lovably dopey new character Forky (voiced by “Veep’s” Tony Hale). Created by Bonnie in kindergarten from things she finds in a wastebasket (a plastic spork, red pipe cleaner, googly eyes and a broken stick), Forky is being held hostage in the antiques store that Bo escaped. The ringleader doll there, Gabby Gabby, has a defective voice box she wants to replace with Woody’s. Her henchmen are several disturbingly creepy and clumsy ventriloquist dummies.
Christina Hendricks of “Mad Men” does a remarkable job of voicing Gabby Gabby with a mixture of menace and melancholy that makes her plight surprisingly moving. It goes without saying that tissues should be brought to any “Toy Story” movie, and this one is no exception. Amazingly, the villainous but tragic doll becomes one of the most interestingly layered and sympathetic characters you’re likely to see in any film this year.
At the opposite end of the emotional spectrum, the movie is filled with so many genuinely funny cast members it would be hard to pick a favorite. Tim Allen is back as the stalwart but somewhat simpleminded Buzz Lightyear, and Kristen Schaal is distinctively ditzy as Trixie the Triceratops. Archival recordings of the late Don Rickles, who gets an appreciation in the credits, are used briefly for his Mr. Potato Head. The movie’s human characters include the excellent Madeleine McGraw as Bonnie, taking over for Emily Hahn from “Toy Story 3.”
New toys include the perpetually posing motorcycle stunt rider Duke Caboom (voiced with hilarious intensity by Keanu Reeves), the pocket-sized Giggle McDimples (Ally Maki), and comedy duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as the plush-with-attitude pair Ducky and Bunny.
The movie’s stunning computer animation has become easy to take for granted by now, but several state-of-the-art scenes are standouts: a sweeping aerial view of a carnival, prisms and reflections of chandelier crystals dappling the shelves of the antiques store, a dark road bordered by woods.
The animators also do an impressive job of giving the toys so much character that they can be genuinely heartbreaking. Aside from the big tearjerker moments, even little details such as Forky’s awkwardly amusing walk and Gabby Gabby’s expressive eyes are small wonders.
First-time feature director Josh Cooley expertly navigates the story’s mix of adventure, comedy, trauma and drama. Also, one of the movie’s gentle morals is handled with sufficient subtlety that it doesn’t feel oppressively obvious: Woody teaching Forky to stop thinking of himself as trash, because someone loves him and needs him no matter how he regards himself. Another lesson, about being brave, independent, and slightly selfish enough to forge a new future, offers a surprisingly mature take on the occasional necessity of leaving old friends behind.
Be sure to stay until the absolute end of the credits, when the final Pixar logo appears, for one last gag that’s both funny and heartwarming. That makes it the perfect summation of the entire “Toy Story” series. If this really is the final bow for the franchise, as Hanks himself has claimed, it will be ending on a note so high that this definitely should be one of the year’s Best Picture nominees.

Keanu Reeves Is The Internet Boyfriend America Needs,thefederalist.com,Susanna Hoffman,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/keanu-reeves-is-the-internet-boyfriend-america-needs/,"June 21, 2019 By Susanna Hoffman
“The Matrix” and “John Wick” actor Keanu Reeves is capturing the 2019 spotlight as a celebrity completely unlike the rest of Hollywood. The Internet’s infatuation with the veteran actor’s unique kindness and charisma is making Reeves a role model America desperately needs.
Reeves is a notable action actor from the 1994 hit “Speed,” the first “Matrix” installation in 1999, and “John Wick” in 2004. It’s hard to pinpoint why Reeves became an Internet phenomenon. His 2019 roles in “John Wick: Chapter 3,” “Toy Story 4,” and “Cyberpunk 2077” likely brought attention. But the public is obsessed with something more.
A resurfaced video from 2011 shows Reeves, unaware of the camera, giving up his subway seat for a woman carrying a large duffel. Not only is Reeves kind and selfless, he also lives a quiet life despite his wealth. Numerous photos show Reeves riding the subway, a down-to-earth choice for a celebrity.
Another video circulating is Reeves’s profound response to a deep question in an interview with Stephen Colbert.
“What do you think happens when we die?” Colbert asked.
After a brief pause, Reeves replied, “I know that the ones who love us will miss us.”
This meme sums up just about everyone’s feelings for Reeves:
Reeves’s awestriking presence is best encapsulated in his humorous performance in the new Netflix Original “Always Be My Maybe.” Reeves appears as a glorified cameo of himself, playing up to his god-like status with dramatically profound lines and overwhelming swag.
Despite America’s obsession, Reeves has responded with grace and modesty. While presenting “Cyberpunk 2077” at Microsoft’s E3 2019 briefing, Reeves again showed his endearing humility.
“Walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking,” Reeves said.
“You’re breathtaking!” An audience member yelled.
Reeves immediately deflected the comment, responding, “ You’re breathtaking!”

Keanu Reeves is just the sort of humble and genuine celebrity America needs. In an era when celebrities compete for the spotlight by screaming progressivism and stripping on the red carpet, Reeves is a breath of fresh air. His popularity is also sending an important message, one that America desperately needs to hear.
Humility and wisdom are virtues, and you can earn respect by having them. Other Internet phenomenons like Taylor Swift’s new music video “ You Need To Calm Down ” and Lady Gaga posing in her underwear at the Met Gala show a lack of cultural discretion.
America needs Reeves’ maturity and kindness. We need a good and humble man reminding us what a role model looks like, and Reeves’ popularity shows that this kind of role model is exactly what America wants.

Why Trump’s Cyber Attack On Iran Was The Right Move,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-23-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/23/trumps-cyber-attack-iran-right-move/,"By David Marcus June 23, 2019
President Trump faced a difficult choice in the wake of Iran’s downing of an American drone over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Eventually, after ordering an attack, Trump decided against it, because the 150 estimated civilian casualties would have represented a disproportionate response to destroying an unmanned drone. But yesterday we found out he did pull the trigger on a different kind of response, and the United States launched a cyber attack against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, disabling some weapon systems.
Although the concept and capability of cyber warfare has existed since at least the 1980s, it is still in a very nascent, although dangerous stage. High-ranking military officials I have spoken to consider the cyber threat to the United States to be the greatest we face from foreign adversaries. Before looking at Trump’s action, and why it was a good move, it’s good to understand the current state of cyber warfare.
There are basically two types of cyber attacks that nations or non-state actors can employ. One is informational; the other degrades actual capabilities of computer networks. For obvious reasons involving Russia’s attempt to influence the 2016 election, the media in the United States has been focused on the informational side. This can include anything from social media election interference, as we saw from the Internet Research Agency, to spying through classified computer systems.
Informational cyber attacks can go on for long periods of time undetected. They are also very cheap to set up and operate. The United States is extremely vulnerable to these kinds of attacks precisely because our society is so free, while our adversaries can simply shut down websites, or the Internet. Thus the United States is struggling, along with social media companies themselves, to combat this growing threat.
The far more serious threat lies in attacks that degrade actual computing and network capabilities. The Pentagon’s top concern in this area is referred to as a cyber Pearl Harbor. This would look something like a foreign power shutting down the electrical grids in major U.S. cities. Such an attack could kill thousands of Americans very quickly. In fact, the military has studied the impact of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as a model of what might happen if we suffered such an attack.
A cyber Pearl Harbor which leveled that kind of death and destruction would almost certainly be viewed as an outright act of war that must be met with a conventional warfare response. However, smaller-scale degrading cyber attacks, such as the one Trump ordered, exist on a murkier spectrum of destruction and response. It is not clear exactly what level of degradation of computing capabilities would cross the line that calls for a conventional response. This is exactly why it was the right move for Trump.
This is likely not the first time the United States has used a destructive cyber attack against Iran. In 2010 the Stuxnet virus wreaked havoc on the Iranian nuclear program. It is widely believed that this virus was created and employed by the United States and Israel. The difference now is that the United States is actually taking credit for this most recent cyber attack. That is a far bolder move than it appears to be on its face, for a few reasons.
First, unlike informational attacks, destructive cyber attacks are a one-and-done enterprise. This is because once the attack happens, the enemy knows it happened and can quickly reverse-engineer the attack. Not only does this protect the enemy from future attacks involving similar software, it can also improve their cyber capabilities, in a sense that after you shoot them, they get to keep the bullet and try to use it on you.
But perhaps more importantly, by taking credit for the attack, the United States is sending a clear message to Iran that it has a powerful cyber arsenal and is not afraid to use it. In fact, America might be able to inflict a cyber Pearl Harbor on Iran. Without dropping a single bomb, it may be able to unleash enormous death and destruction across wide swaths of Iranian territory. This was a very serious cyber shot across Iran’s bow that still leaves in play the eventual option of conventional attack.
Many observers seem to think that President Trump backed down by not bombing a few military installations in Iran. But this cyber attack is in many ways more insidious and dangerous for the Iranian regime. By signing our name to it, the United States is sending a clear message that it is willing and able to use this newest weapon of war, to dramatic effect.
The future of warfare is now and the Pentagon knows it. How Iran responds will determine if greater cyber attacks might be employed. This was the right attack, it is the right threat to emphasize, and it is the dawn of a new kind of war that will shape the course of international relations.

Corpus Christi Is One Way For Christians To Remain Visible,thefederalist.com,Casey Chalk,06-23-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/23/corpus-christi-one-way-christians-remain-visible-secularizing-america/,"By Casey Chalk June 23, 2019
When I lived in Thailand for several years, our apartment straddled two major roads in Bangkok. Besides the horrific traffic, this also meant that we were right in the middle of any major Thai holiday, many of which possess a very obvious Buddhist character.
Several times a year, often on weekends, our family breakfast would be interrupted by loud religious songs played on megaphones mounted on trucks, accompanied by the pounding of drums and banging of cymbals. Looking over our balcony, we would see hundreds, sometimes thousands, of Thai Buddhists processing down our street.
It was a remarkable — if somewhat annoying — display of public piety and solidarity by the Thai people. We need more events like this in America, I told myself.
Of course, America has many public holidays that foster what I’ve elsewhere described as an important civic liturgy that binds the citizens of our nation together. Some remind us of our early history and founding (Thanksgiving and Independence Day); others of the sacrifice of our soldiers (Memorial Day and Veterans Day); and others of the heroism and brilliance of those intimately united to our shared history (Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Columbus Day). Our nation even celebrates some holidays of an explicit religious nature, like Christmas, although these have been more-or-less secularized for broader public participation.
The feast of Corpus Christi (Latin for “Body of Christ”), which the Catholic Church celebrates today, is also, although much less so, a part of a shared American experience. Immigrants from Catholic countries around the world have been celebrating this feast in America at least since the mid-nineteenth century, if not earlier (the city of Corpus Christi in Texas was settled in 1747).
Irish, Spanish, French, German, and Polish Catholic communities in the United States all have hallowed traditions honoring this feast, which includes a public procession of the faithful, the Eucharist held aloft for all to adore. If one pays careful attention while driving around any city or large town with a Catholic population, one is likely to see Corpus Christi celebrants today.
It would make little sense for the United States to adopt Corpus Christi as a national holiday given that its identity is tied to particular brand of Christianity, Catholicism (although it is honored by many predominantly Catholic nations). Indeed, even if one were to make an argument that America’s unique Christian heritage allows for honoring Christian holidays in the public square, many Protestants find the theology behind Corpus Christi disagreeable, if not blasphemous. All the same, there is good reason for Americans to encourage and, when appropriate, participate in such public displays of public piety.
Memorial events like Corpus Christi, whether they be explicitly Catholic, explicitly Protestant, or ecumenical, are confident in their movements in the public square. Corpus Christi processions draw the attention of passerby precisely because they are out of the ordinary. They remind people of faith, regardless of their affiliation, of their commitments to God.
When I was a Protestant and saw a Corpus Christi procession, I was intrigued, even if I disagreed with the theology behind the ceremony. Now as a Catholic, the event’s public nature bolsters my faith and inculcates a pride in a religious community willing to evince such courage.
These kinds of events also serve as a public, non-aggressive profession of faith. They declare something about Christianity without awkwardly knocking on doors or putting tracts in people’s hands. There is something interesting and even potentially provocative about a large group of people quietly and peaceably making a public statement about their beliefs. Like the presence of Jesus among the people, their very presence elicits a response.
Finally, public remembrances like Corpus Christi serve as an important foil to the ever-increasing high-profile events on the left. Pride parades are increasing in prominence and popularity across the United States. Those who criticize public festivals that celebrate various forms of sexual identity and behavior are met with ridicule or disdain , even by religious persons willing to acknowledge that pride parades are often defined by sexual libertinism, “self-indulgence and excessive individualism.” Solemn, respectful public acts of piety like Corpus Christi are all the more necessary in an America overwhelmed by anti-faith, anti-life protests by the Left.
When I commented to a Catholic priest there on the many public Thai Buddhist festivals that marched by my Bangkok apartment building, he nodded in recognition. “The Catholic Church in this country, and elsewhere, needs to be as public and proud of their religious holidays as the Buddhists are,” he commented.
In a nation like America that seems set to only become more secularized in the coming decades , public celebrations like Corpus Christi can remind the nation that although the Christian faithful may become a minority, we will be a vocal, proud minority. We aim to preserve our space in the public square, because we have just as much of a right to it as anyone else.
If you are a Catholic, I urge you to celebrate your local Corpus Christi procession. If you’re not, but you care about religious persons’ right to live and work in the public square, I urge you to at least lend your moral support to Corpus Christi. Or foster your own public religious celebrations. Declare to all who will listen that American men and women of faith are here, and we are not leaving.

Palestinian Leaders To United States: We Don’t Need Your Stinking Money,thefederalist.com,Erielle Davidson,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/24/palestinian-leaders-united-states-dont-need-stinking-money/,"Boycotting a conference explicitly designed to advance the economy of the Palestinian people evinces a great deal about Palestinian leaders’ actual objectives. Such maneuvers reveal that Palestinian leaders have no genuine interest in improving the lives of their people, but are more vested in perpetuating their people’s suffering for political gain on the international stage.
In addition to pressuring Arab states to refrain from attending (or in the case of Bahrain, from hosting), Palestinian officials also pressured Palestinian businesspeople not to attend. Even so, they would benefit from the opportunity to meet with some of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds.
Palestinian authorities have stated that anyone who attends the conference will be deemed a “ traitor ,” projecting a culture of fear onto the meeting and forcing many Palestinian-Arabs to weigh the possible economic gains against the violent retribution Fatah, the governing Palestinian political party, has promised.
Fatah has also called for “ days of violence ” against Israel in response to the conference, which anyone with a modicum of political acumen realizes is stunningly obtuse, given the conference is geared towards aiding Palestinians and Israeli officials aren’t even in attendance. Indeed, out of a desire to avoid politicizing the event, the Palestinians’ decision not to attend prompted the Trump administration to refrain from extending a formal invitation to Israeli officials.
The Palestinian Authority also attended a “counter-conference” in Bahrain last week, titled “The Holocaust of the Century in Bahrain… Its Signs, Consequences, and Ways to Deal With It,” bizarrely applying terminology that describes Nazis’ genocide against the Jews to an economic conference with a $50 billion proposed investment.
The boycott and calls for violence rehash the same unproductive methods the Palestinians have used in the past to thwart peace measures, only this time the incoherence of the boycott is made more evident by the fact Israel will not even attend. Palestinian leaders continue to promulgate the notion that the workshop is some devious machination of the West or President Trump or both, despite many Palestinian-Arab neighbors agreeing to attend and host.
If anything, their attendance shows the Palestinian-Arabs’ gradual isolation among the Gulf States, who have grown weary of the Palestinian Authority’s political gymnastics and obsession with destroying their Jewish neighbors. Bahrain will prove another missed opportunity for Palestinian leadership to engage with their neighbors in a significant way. Palestinian leadership sees the political capital to be had in human suffering, so any attempts to mitigate such suffering meet serious skepticism from Palestinian officials.
Since rejecting the suggested partitioning the 1937 Peel Commission, Arab leaders have thwarted the creation of an Arab state west of the Jordan River more than six times , depending on whether one considers refusal to talk to mean refusing the possibility of a state. Thus, if anything is to be gleaned from the Bahrain conference boycott, it is that the Palestinian leadership does not have a genuine interest in bettering the lives of their own people—and perhaps that they are quite unprepared for actual statehood.

Pete Buttigieg Faces Race-Related Backlash After South Bend Police Shooting,thefederalist.com,Chrissy Clark,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/24/pete-buttigieg-faces-backlash-after-shooting/,"June 24, 2019 By Chrissy Clark
Democrat presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigeig faced intense backlash in a South Bend town hall after a local police officer fatally shot a robbery suspect.
On June 23, South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O’Neill responded to a 9-1-1 call about car break-ins near the Central High apartment complex in the downtown area. Suspect Eric J. Logan was allegedly holding a knife and refused to drop it after O’Neill ordered him to.
O’Neill’s body camera and dashboard camera were inactive during the incident. According to South Bend police, their body cameras and dashboard cameras activate when officer’s emergency lights go off. O’Neill’s lights were not on, as he was looking for the suspect in a parking lot. He eventually found Logan in a car and made contact with him to ensure he was the rightful owner of that car.
According to police accounts, Logan then threw a knife at O’Neill, who responded by fatally shooting the man.
According to Logan’s family, he had no past record of theft, although his brother said he did have some drug problems. St. Joseph County Circuit Court records say Logan did have previous run-ins with law enforcement, including possession of coke and narcotics, a handgun violation, and dealing of coke and narcotics.
Logan’s family is also upset that he was taken to the hospital in a police cruiser instead of an ambulance. O’Neill called for an ambulance after the shooting, but it didn’t arrive quickly, so police say another officer suggested O’Neill drive Logan to the hospital to get him treatment more quickly, given his injuries.
Buttigieg has come under scrutiny for the shooting as the South Bend Police have not hired as many non-white officers as some say they should. O’Neill was white and Logan was black, which only adds to the tensions over this incident in South Bend and the national debate about policing in minority communities. “We have tried but not succeeded to increase diversity in the police department and we need help,” Buttigieg said the town hall on Sunday.
South Bend residents who showed up at the meeting expressed anger at Buttigieg and the South Bend Police. Crime has been a long-term problem in South Bend, and this incident highlights Buttigieg’s failure to address the problem during his seven years as mayor.
During the town hall, members of the community ridiculed Buttigieg and the police chief for their alleged inability to eliminate the police force of racists.
“Put them at the desk, make them do paperwork. Put the people that care about the fact that you different than me … make them the ones out there on the streets,” a South Bend community member said.
Due to the shooting, Buttigieg is taking time away from his 2020 presidential campaign to focus on his hometown. He has been nearly inactive on Twitter since the shooting. His only tweets have been to encourage South Bend citizens to attend the town hall and thanking city personnel who helped during a tornado that hit the South Bend area.
“Pete has a black problem,” said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio). “I don’t know one black person out of Indiana that supports him.” Fudge is the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Buttigieg trails behind current Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden by 13 points in his home state. In a South Carolina survey of 595 individuals, 18 percent of white voters said they would vote for Buttigieg, but 0 percent of black voters said they would.

Holocaust Museum Condemns Comparisons Of Border Security To Concentration Camps,thefederalist.com,Tristan Justice,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/24/holocaust-museum-condemns-concentration-camp-comparisons/,"June 24, 2019 By Tristan Justice
The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum released a statement Monday rejecting comparisons between migrant detention centers in the United States and the events that took place in the early 20th century.
“The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum unequivocally rejects efforts to create analogies between the Holocaust and other event, whether historical or contemporary,” the Museum stated. “That position has repeatedly and unambigiously been made clear in the Museum’s official statement on the matter – a statement that is reiterated and reaffirmed now.”
The Museum continued: “[A] statement ascribed to a Museum staff historian regarding recent attempts to analogize the situation on the United States southern border to concentration camps in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s does not reflect the position of the Museum.”
The comparisons of migrant detention centers on the United States’s southern border to the concentration camps Nazis ran in the 1930s and throughout World War II began by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) during an Instagram Live video .
“The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border, and that is exactly what they are. They are concentration camps,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
“I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say, we should not, that ‘Never Again’ means something,” the New York congresswoman continued, referring to a popular slogan used following the Holocaust. “The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing, and we need to do something about it.”
While many criticized Ocasio-Cortez’s claim as extreme, she doubled down on her comments and was supported by others including U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.).
“There are camps, and people are being concentrated. This is very simple. I don’t even know why this is controversial thing for her to say,” Omar told The Rebel. NEW VIDEO: Ilhan Omar doubles down on @AOC ’s concentration camp slur. pic.twitter.com/sBaUkAKLQI

Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, also came to Ocasio-Cortez’s defense.
“One of the lessons from the Holocaust is ‘Never Again’ – not only to mass murder, but also to the dehumanization of people, violations of basic rights, and assaults on our common morality,” Nadler wrote on Twitter. One of the lessons from the Holocaust is ‘Never Again’ – not only to mass murder, but also to the dehumanization of people, violations of basic rights, and assaults on our common morality.
