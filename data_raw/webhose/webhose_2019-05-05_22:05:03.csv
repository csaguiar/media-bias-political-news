Top House Democrat Says The Mueller Report Cover-Up Is Making Impeachment More Likely,www.politicususa.com,Sean Colarossi,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/06/top-house-democrat-says-the-mueller-report-cover-up-is-making-impeachment-more-likely.html,"Top House Democrat Says The Mueller Report Cover-Up Is Making Impeachment More Likely 1.5k Subscribe Print Flipboard
A top Democratic lawmaker said on Saturday that the handling of the Mueller report by attorney general William Barr is making impeachment more likely.
In an interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina said he had previously been one of the Democrats who didn’t want the party to go full-speed ahead on impeachment.
But that was before Donald Trump’s attorney general released his four-page summary and set off what appears to be a massive cover-up of the Mueller report.
“All of a sudden, we’ve got an attorney general who forecast what he was going to do,” Clyburn said. “He is undermining the process that we all thought would be fair and impartial.”
The Democratic congressman added, “The only thing left is for Congress to get the documents and see whether or not [Trump is] deserving of impeachment.”

Rep Clyburn said:
The founding fathers did anticipate that we could have somebody like this. That’s why they lay it out why we ought to consider impeachment when it needs to be considered. I have been a big supporter of our party’s position that impeachment should be something in the background not to be dealt with at this particular juncture. But all of a sudden now, we’ve got an attorney general who forecast what he was going to do. He’s now doing exactly what he said he was going to do. And he is undermining the process of what we all thought would be fair and impartial and we thought the American people would be able to share in the results. It is now clear that his summary, his four-page summary of two years of work, I understand 300 to 400-page document, is of such that we may need to see the whole document or subpoena the people who can speak to it. And then, if the document is made the way it is because of the Justice Department’s procedure or policy on not indicting a sitting president, then the only thing left is for Congress to get the documents and see whether or not he’s deserving of impeachment. Trump’s cover-up is backfiring
The strategy by Donald Trump and his hand-picked attorney general to first fudge the facts laid out in Mueller’s report, and then conceal the full report, has quickly backfired.
Not only haven’t the American people bought the claims that Trump is fully exonerated, but they want to see the full report.
The longer this cover-up continues, the more guilty Trump appears and the more hollow his post-Barr summary celebrations look. With each passing day, it seems more and more likely that there is something damaging in the Mueller report that this president and his allies don’t want the public to see.
Donald Trump thought this cover-up was a smart way to convince the public of his innocence, but it has done just the opposite, and it has the potential to make impeachment more likely.

Mormon church OKs baptisms for LGBT couples' kids,onenewsnow.com,Michael F. Haverluck,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://onenewsnow.com/church/2019/04/06/mormon-church-oks-baptisms-for-lgbt-couples-kids,"Mormon church OKs baptisms for LGBT couples' kids Saturday, April 6, 2019 | Michael F. Haverluck (OneNewsNow.com)
The Mormon church announced it will now allow the children of same-sex couples to be baptized and also declared that members of the LGBT community are no longer considered “apostates.”
“At the direction of the First Presidency, President Oaks shared that effective immediately, children of parents who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender may be baptized without First Presidency approval …” The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS) divulged in a statement . “A nonmember parent or parents (including LGBT parents) can request that their baby be blessed ...”
More LGBT-friendly
Additional new LGBT-friendly doctrine was revealed by LDS leadership, which has lightened its formerly strict opposition to LGBT behavior that considered those engaging in the LGBT lifestyle as living in direct defiance to biblical teachings.
“Previously, our handbook characterized same-gender marriage by a member as apostasy,” the First Presidency declared. “While we still consider such a marriage to be a serious transgression, it will not be treated as apostasy for purposes of Church discipline. Instead, the immoral conduct in heterosexual or homosexual relationships will be treated in the same way.”
It was impressed that the Mormon church will be more embracing and inclusive in its general dealing with the LGBT community.
“The very positive policies announced this morning should help affected families. In addition, our members’ efforts to show more understanding, compassion and love should increase respect and understanding among all people of goodwill. We want to reduce the hate and contention so common today,” the statement continued. “We are optimistic that a majority of people – whatever their beliefs and orientations – long for better understanding and less contentious communications. That is surely our desire, and we seek the help of our members and others to attain it.”
Adopting the rhetoric of LGBT activism, Mormon leadership is evidently turning a new leaf away from Scripture and biblical morality and toward the dictates of the LGBT community to become more seeker-friendly and politically correct in order to improve attendance.
“The former policy – announced in 2015 – had angered liberal and LGBT Mormons, and some 1,500 left the church in protest, according to one activist,” CNN reported .
However, LDS leadership insists that the Mormon church still adheres to the code of biblical morality regarding marriage.
“The church said that its doctrines on marriage and salvation – of which marriage is an integral part – will not change,” CNN Religion Reporter Daniel Burke explained. “LGBT Mormons are expected to be chaste – according to church teachings – but by no longer considering same-sex marriages ‘apostasy,’ the church has essentially lifted the threat of excommunication for gay couples, church experts said.”
Major LDS changes
The radical leftist policy is just the latest reconfiguration of the Mormon church’s previously conservative and biblically adherent doctrine – which has been consistently revised by the church’s leader new leader.
“The change marks the biggest move yet by church President Russell M. Nelson, who has made a flurry of changes to how the church functions since taking over the faith in January 2018,” The Associated Press (AP) noted .
However, the pro-LGBT move is in direct contrast to many of the more conservative policies employed by the Mormon church under its previous leader, under whom Nelson served.
“Thursday's announcement raises new questions about the revelations [declared by LDS leaders], since Nelson had also presented the now-defunct LGBT policy as a matter of God's will as divined by the church's previous president, Thomas Monson,” Burke pointed out.
While many evangelical conservative Christian leaders are averse to making concessions to the LGBT agenda, Equality Utah Executive Director and other homosexual activists consider the LDS move a win and a step forward for the LGBT community.
“Clearly this is a great development for the church,” Williams proclaimed, according to AP. “I think this will go a long way toward healing Latter-day Saint families that have LGBT members.”
LDS President Oaks impressed that it is church leadership’s desire for members and church policies to be “considerate,” and LDS Young Single Adult Bishop Ricard Ostler – an LGBT ally within the church – applauds this move.
""Our LGBTQ members have a difficult road, and I feel these adjustments help us better mourn, comfort and bear their burdens as they make their way forward,"" Ostler shared, according to Deseret News .

Moscow Slams NATO Black Sea Drills As Alliance Vows Support To Ukraine And Georgia | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/moscow-slams-nato-black-sea-drills-stoltenberg-vows-support-ukraine-and-georgia,"0 SHARES
The Kremlin has slammed NATO's multi-national ""Sea Shield 2019"" naval drills which kicked off in the Black Sea on Friday and will include limited Ukrainian defense forces. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said upon the military games' beginning, which also happens to mark NATO's 70th birthday: ""Having militarized NE Europe, NATO has decided to increase its military presence in the Black Sea.""
The Sea Shield 2019 is set to run from April 5 to April 13 and involves ""14 Romanian warships and six warships from Bulgaria, Canada, Greece, the Netherlands, Turkey with 2,200 troops will carry out joint combat tasks in the Black Sea region,"" according to Ukraine's Mission to NATO and the Romanian Ministry of National Defense. Aerial assets will also be deployed as part of the games. Prior drills on the Black Sea by war ships of the NATO Standing Maritime Group-2, via the AFP
Crucially, non-NATO countries Ukraine and Georgia will also take part — both of which have long been potential flash points between the west and Russia. However, officials reports say their involvement will be limited to coast guard maneuvers.
But NATO officials have described the exercise as ""a long-planned, annual exercise led by Romania"" and claimed that ""neither the patrols, nor the exercise, are linked to events in Ukraine.""
""Three Allied nations [Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey] border the Black Sea, and NATO regularly conducts exercises and operations in the Black Sea in order to maintain credible deterrence and readiness,"" a NATO official continued in response to questions from Russian reporters last week. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commemorating NATO's 70th in Washington on Wednesday, April 3, 2019. Image source: AP
On Tuesday US Permanent Representative to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison told reporters ahead of the NATO foreign ministerial meeting in Washington that the alliance was prepared to ramp up its defense posture in the Black Sea due to ""destabilizing"" and ""unacceptable"" behavior .
High on the agenda of the NATO foreign ministers during the Washington meeting marking 70 years of the alliance's existence was the Kerch Strait incident. As part of the conference NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow to release the Ukrainian vessels and their crews which had been held since the Nov. 25 incident .

Last week the Russian Navy reported heavy naval traffic through the Boshorus Strait into the Black Sea in preparation for the NATO exercises.
Meanwhile this week Russia reportedly conducted limited tests of its own defensive and offensive ship weapon in the Black Sea, in order to send a message in relation to the NATO build-up. Meanwhile, Russian navy tests ""Mosquito"" anti-ship missiles in Black Sea. https://t.co/O1arSmL1Fu — Lucian Kim (@Lucian_Kim) April 5, 2019
On Thursday NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters that the alliance plans to step up defense of Ukraine and Georgia in the Black Sea and Caucuses, as NATO is prepared to beef up its presence in the region .
According to Reuters :
He said the NATO allies had agreed on a package of measures to step up support for Ukraine and Georgia that included increased surveillance drills and “training of maritime forces and coast guards, port visits and exercises, and sharing information.” Ukraine and Georgia, which like Ukraine is a Russian neighbor and part of the former Soviet Union, are not NATO members.
But it doesn't appear the Kremlin is flinching, especially given that the 24 Ukrainian sailors still in pre-trial custody following the Kerch Strait incident have just had the Moscow’s Lefortovo court extended their arrest until April 24, according to TASS .
Russian officials say the men face up to 6 years in prison if found guilty on charges which include ""illegally crossing Russia’s state border"". Should that sentencing come, it will be sure to set off a new round of heated rhetoric, bringing tensions between Moscow and Washington to boiling point. Tags "

In the next war between Hamas and Israel, the Israelis will have to evacuate not only their “settlements” near the border with the Gaza Strip, but also Ashdod, Ashkelon, the Negev and Tel Aviv, Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, threatened on Saturday.He said that despite the recent ceasefire understandings with Israel, the Palestinians will continue to protest near the border fence with Israel. Sinwar, who was speaking to representatives of Palestinian factions and civil society organizations in the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave, said that his movement will continue to be ready for war with Israel to “defend the Palestinian people.” Hamas, he said, will be a “shield and sword” for the Palestinians.Sinwar said that if a war is “imposed” on the Gaza Strip, Israel will “suffer.” He added: “I pledge that the occupation will evacuate its settlements not only in the ‘Gaza Envelope,’ but also in Ashdod, the Negev, Ashkelon and even Tel Aviv. Remember this pledge. The fingers of the resistance in the Gaza Strip are on the trigger. We are today ten times stronger than we were in 2014 (in reference to the Operation Protective Shield).”Regarding the ceasefire understandings with Israel, Sinwar said Hamas did not pay any “political price.” The understandings, he said, “have no prices or political dimensions.”He further said that the understandings were not connected to any prisoner swap between Hamas and Israel, or the issue of the weapons of Palestinian terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip.“The understandings are not an alternative to Palestinian unity and partnership,” the Hamas leader explained. “There is no talk about the Palestinian right to resistance in all its forms, especially in the West Bank. Also, there is no talk about halting the March of Return.”The Great March of Return is the name Palestinians use to describe the weekly protests near the border with Israel which began in March 2018. Sinwar praised Egypt for its role in “easing restrictions” imposed on the Gaza Strip.“We have strengthened our relations with Egypt,” he said. “The Egyptians have thankfully played a big role in the easing of the restrictions.”Hamas claims that the Egyptian-sponsored ceasefire understandings include the expansion of the fishing zone, reopening the border crossings between the Gaza Strip and Israel, the delivery of additional Qatari funds, the launch of various humanitarian and economic projects in the coastal enclave, and solving the power shortage.The Hamas leader boasted that his movement has been successful in thwarting attempts to instigate unrest in the Gaza Strip. He was referring to recent anti-Hamas protests that erupted in various parts of the Gaza Strip to protest economic hardship. Hamas security forces brutally squashed the protests, arresting, beating and shooting scores of Palestinians.“During the last year, Hamas, together with our people, has scored a number of achievements,” Sinwar said. “The most prominent achievement has been the foiling of all attempts to destabilize civil peace in the Gaza Strip.”Hamas leaders have accused their rivals in Fatah and the Palestinian Authority of being behind the protests. They claim that the protests were part of a “conspiracy” to end the Hamas-rule in the Gaza Strip. Fatah and PA officials have dismissed the charges. Sinwar praised the ongoing protests alongside the border with Israel, and said they have placed the issue of the Gaza Strip blockade on the world’s agenda.

We can’t do it anymore,” Trump told Fox News’ Griff Jenkins when he asked whether the arrival of undocumented immigrants meant there was a second generation of people who could benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Trump characterized migration into the United States as being at record high levels. “There’s never been so many people coming up and that’s because they’re gaming the system and the system is changed for the worse because of what happened with Democrats and what they’ve done in terms of Congress,” Trump said. During the interview, he also questioned those who seek asylum in the United States, saying the system was being abused by gang members who suddenly say they don’t feel safe in their own country. “The asylum is being scammed,” he said. “You have gang members, tough people saying they’re afraid to be in their country. They’re not afraid, and then they’ll come up with flags, holding flags from their country.” During the interview, Trump doubled down on a message he gave Friday when he traveled to a Calexico for a briefing on immigration. “The system is full. We can’t take you anymore,” Trump said at the event that included law enforcement officials and local leaders . “Our country is full … Turn around.” Trump made it sound like his hands were tied on the issue. “When it’s full, there’s nothing you can do. You have to say, ‘I’m sorry, we can’t take you.’” The president also took the opportunity to insist that “there is indeed an emergency on our southern border.” Trump said there had been a sharp increase of border crossings. “It’s a colossal surge and it’s overwhelming our immigration system, and we can’t let that happen.” ""Our country is full, our area is full, the sector is full. Can't take you anymore, I'm sorry, can't happen. So turn around. That's the way it is.""President Trump participates in roundtable on immigration & border security at U.S. Border Patrol Calexico Station in CA. pic.twitter.com/L53gGOEYW4 — The Hill (@thehill) April 5, 2019 Support our journalism

To compliment this amazing article, here are the new crime figures from Germany, broken down for you by Tichys Einblick: The asylum-seeker crime rate was over 62% in 2017 (89% for males, 20% for female asylum seekers, regardless of age). In comparison, the crime rate for Germans is only 1.88%. The average duration of an asylum application in 2018 was just 3.55 months. That is, the 103,105 suspected asylum seekers had on average only 3.55 months to commit their acts. This means that in just 3.55 months, 54% of all asylum seekers become suspects, regardless of age and gender. And this despite the fact that in 2018 more than 44% of asylum seekers were children up to the age of 15 The crime rate over 3.55 months is thus 82% for male asylum seekers and 44% for female 17%, again irrespective of age. For the rest of the population, ie Germans and non-Germans without asylum seekers, the crime rate of 3.55 months is only 0.65%. Asylum seekers are more than 80 times as criminal as the rest of the population. 18.6% of suspected asylum seekers committed violent crimes (PKS key 892000), the rest of the population 8.6%. Asylum seekers commit violent crime more than 180 times as often as the rest of the population. There were 355 suspected asylum seekers in the area of murder and manslaughter, so almost every day. Incidentally, the country with the highest kill rate is El Salvador, with 82.8 killings per 100,000 inhabitants per year. In Western Europe, it is Belgium with 2 killings per 100,000 inhabitants and year. The city with the highest kill rate is Caracas, with 122 killings per 100,000 inhabitants per year (see here). The killing rate for asylum seekers in 2018 in Germany is thus 629 per 100,000 asylum seekers per year. Posted on 4/4/19 | 6:45 AM CEST Arnold Nussbaum
When I read their news I come to the conclusion that they are blind on one eye.

“…a conspiracy theory dubbed “The Great Replacement.” The theory — which claims that white populations are being gradually replaced with migrants…”
Okay let’s look at England. In 2006 just over 20% of primary school students in England were from an ethnic minority background and in 2018, just 12 years later it’s at 33%. That’s an increase of over 1% a year and that rate is not declining. (Source, page 8 of: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/719226/Schools_Pupils_and_their_Characteristics_2018_Main_Text.pdf )
So actually, in some European countries there absolutely is a rapid growth in ethnic minorities which is going to permanently transform the demographics in a significant way. Saying it’s all a ‘conspiracy’ flies in the face of the statistics. You can argue that having a multi-racial society won’t matter but to say these transformations aren’t happening is just disingenuous at best. Posted on 4/4/19 | 3:07 PM CEST J C

Replacement of indigenous population is a “conspiracy theory” and not a sinister plan of the pro-islamist Left??? Sweden’s current mohammedan population is projected to increase almost six-fold by 2050 according to Pew Research’s worst case scenario. That is the worst case scenario as of 2017.

@ Guy Their cause is to retain their societies norms, language, and culture. The refugees do not share their values – as evidenced by use of trucks/ autos used as weapons, veils and burkas, molesting women in train stations, Posted on 4/4/19 | 6:29 PM CEST peter lintner
“The attacker’s so-called manifesto referenced a conspiracy theory dubbed “The Great Replacement.” The theory — which claims that white populations are being gradually replaced with migrants — has been at the heart of identitarian campaigns for years.”
Conspiracy theory? It´s fascinating how can someone such blatantly lie. Go visit a website of any statistics office in any western country and compare the share of white population now with that from 20-30 years ago. The share of white population declining everywhere, while the share of migrant population increasing. Whites are being replaced by migrants in their home countrie as we speak. That´s not a conspiracy theory, that a simple fact that anyone can verify with just few clicks. The author must be living in parallel universe if she considers easily verifiable facts as conspiracy theory. Or maybe she takes us for idiots, who cant read simple charts.
In US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand the share of white population is projected to fall under 50% by 2040-2050, it was around 90% in 60-70s of 20th century. So is it a conspiracy theory when the share of a dominant population(whites) falls to minority in a lifespan of a single person? The replacement of population happening in western countries is unprecedent in human history. Something like this never happened before in peaceful times. And it´s going to have far-sight consequences. Posted on 4/5/19 | 2:09 AM CEST maciek maciek
European identitarians are European patriots. Replacement of indigenous European population is part of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan (google it) that is on the European Commission agenda.
Real far right and far left parties will come soon and the EU mainstream elitist parties are responsible for the approaching social unrest. Posted on 4/5/19 | 9:46 AM CEST Tom Cullem
Perhaps the threat of anger about lost communities, too much immigration from apposite cultures too soon, the weak response to challenges to western culture and art, the acceptance of “blackwashing” of white historical characters whilst screeching about “whitewashing” of fictional nonwhite ones, the snowflakes in the universities, the sacrifice of cultural cohesion through the unchallenged enthusiasm for multiculturalism.
People react to what they see in the streets outside their homes. Britain is a ruined country, and it was ruined by immigration and an unchallenged acceptance that the only kind of moral society was a multicultural society and cultural imperialism the greatest sin on earth.
If the EU and governments had taken seriously those concerns, the far right and the identitarians wouldn’t have had a leg to stand on.
Those Christmas markets in Germany now have to have armed guards and cement bunkers – really contributes to the holiday mood, doesn’t it? Did they need those 40 years ago?
The identitarians are only using the ammo the contemptuous, weak governments of Europe gave them. Posted on 4/6/19 | 5:31 PM CEST Viliam Sinka
Is by definition national/ethnic identity bad? Why? Will the EU identity be better? Will it not exclude people with non EU identities? It is interesting that some types of identities (e.g. LGBT ……) are considered good others not.

KLAVAN: Not Satire: The Times Really Is A Former Newspaper | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45571/klavan-not-satire-times-really-former-newspaper-andrew-klavan,"April 6, 2019 views
There are days, so help me, when it becomes impossible for me to tell the difference between the daily satires I write to kick off The Andrew Klavan Show and the world as it actually is. Just when I think I’ve painted the left in the most extreme terms in order to highlight the absurdity of their ideas and actions, the left actually pushes their ideas and actions to those same extremes and becomes more absurd than I could possibly have imagined.
For instance, I frequently mock the New York Times as “a former newspaper.” I thought this was satirical overstatement meant to underscore the fact that the Times has descended over the last two decades from a great, if liberal-leaning, paper, to a second-rate and sophomoric collection of left-wing hit pieces.
But on Thursday’s front page, the Times actually completed that descent, becoming something other than a newspaper altogether and thus turning my satire to reality.
“ Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed, ” the headline read. And here’s the lede: “Some of Robert S. Mueller III’s investigators have told associates that Attorney General William P. Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated, according to government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations.”
Later the Times added: “The officials and others interviewed declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel’s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Mr. Barr explained...”
So according to unnamed officials unnamed investigators told unnamed associates that the Mueller report was damaging to Trump but they won’t say how.
There are three bylines on this piece, and two more reporters are credited with contributed reporting. It took five so-called journalists to get a story that sounds like the old James Taylor lyric: “Someone said someone said something 'bout something else someone might have said about her.”
Now, this week I have been teaching at Hillsdale College as the Pulliam Distinguished Fellow in Journalism. And since I am such a distinguished journalistic fellow, I would like to use my moral authority to explain to the New York Times that one essential part of every news story is where the reported information comes from. Without that, how can the reader know what the story actually is? If anonymous sourcing is not a last-ditch technique used only under extreme conditions, it becomes a cheap trick that allows political stratagems to masquerade as news.
People — people in Washington especially — don’t speak to reporters out of the goodness of their hearts. They have agendas. They have motives. They have more or less inside information — maybe none. If I don’t know who they are and what they want, how can I judge whether they’re reliable and what they are trying to accomplish? In a story like this one — basically just a rumor passed along in a game of Telephone — that’s not merely an essential part of the story. That is the story.
At least the Times is honest about its own motives: “At stake in the dispute... is who shapes the public’s initial understanding of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history.” Stung by the fact that the whole world can now see that their two Pulitzer-winning years of reporting are in fact the biggest nothingburger ever seen outside of a state fair, the Times hopes that by piling on just a little more nothing, they can keep the hoax going until they can spin away their own journalistic malfeasance.
Donald Trump has a gift for making other people destroy themselves. Reeling under his bruising style, they try to remake themselves in his image in order to strike back — and instead they simply soil their own reputations.
The New York Times is now so steeped in Trump hatred, they have dragged themselves down beneath anything that can reasonably be called journalism. “Former newspaper” is not satire anymore."
Obama: I worry progressives may undercut Democratic allies,thehill.com,Tal Axelrod,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/news/437692-obama-im-worried-progressives-may-form-a-circular-firing-squad,"Obama: I worry progressives may undercut Democratic allies By Tal Axelrod - 04/06/19 10:43 AM EDT
Former President Obama expressed concern about the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, saying he feared it could end up undercutting allies.
Speaking at a town hall event on Saturday for the Obama Foundation in Berlin, the former president spoke about the need for compromise in politics, citing the Affordable Care Act as something that he said signified progress even though it did not achieve all of his aspirations for U.S. health care. ADVERTISEMENT
""One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States —maybe it’s true here as well — is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, 'Uh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be,' and then we start sometimes creating what’s called a 'circular firing squad,' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues. And when that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens,"" he said.
""So I think whether you are speaking as a citizen or as a political leader or as an organizer … you have to recognize that the way we structure democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you, and that by definition means you’re not going to get 100 percent of what you want,"" he added.
Obama, who began his career in politics as a community organizer in Chicago before becoming an Illinois state senator and, later, a U.S. senator, recounted the frustration he felt when politicians told him they could not deliver as much progress on an issue as he would like.
Still, Obama said his perspective has changed throughout his political career.
""You should take some time to think in your own mind and continually refine and reflect, 'What are my core principles?' Because the danger is if you don’t know what your principles are, that’s when you compromise your principles away,"" he said. ""You can’t set up a system in which you don't compromise on anything, but you also can’t operate in a system where you compromise on everything.""
Obama's remarks come as over a dozen Democrats vie for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination. Some candidates have angled to appeal to the party's burgeoning progressive wing that has garnered a reputation for criticizing politicians who, some say, have not taken bold enough steps to enact change.

Europes big election mess POLITICO,www.politico.eu,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-election-mess-chaotic-unpredictable-results/,"Maïa de La Baume
The process is intended to make the European election more like a national one, in the sense that a leader from one of the big parties wins the top job. It was first used to select Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014 but it's highly unclear that it will survive a second election cycle.
That is not least because one of its main backers last time, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), has moved to undermine it, by nominating a slate of seven contenders rather than just one lead candidate. That move has brought them closer to their ally Macron, who has declared his opposition to the Spitzenkandidat process. The Spitzenkandidat system might begin and end with Jean-Claude Juncker | Thomas Niedermuller/Getty Images
In recent days, the political rhetoric has sharpened. The hand-to-hand combat of the election season is now clearly underway.
“The pro-European forces have to fight together against populism and nationalism,” said Luis Garicano, a Spanish economics professor and a candidate on the Liberals’ slate. “However, I also think that the two incumbent powers, the Socialists and the EPP, have been to some extent responsible for the inability of Europe to solve the problems of citizens that have caused this backlash.”
Garicano, a member of the Ciudadanos party in Spain, laughed at the notion of Weber, a leader of Germany’s Christian Social Union, trying to portray himself as a reformer. “Personally, he doesn’t seem like an agent of change to me,” Garicano said. Shadowkandidat
Weber is trying to put pressure on others to stick to the Spitzenkandidat process — even though the European Council has insisted it cannot be bound by the system when it nominates a candidate for the Commission presidency later this year.
""It should not be forgotten that most of the European parties and many heads of state and government have supported the Spitzenkandidat principle,"" Weber said in a recent interview with the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. ""If they suddenly forget this, that would be a huge step backwards for the democracy and participation of voters in Europe.""
Weber faces uncertainty over whether the EPP's leaders in governments around Europe will stand by him, even if — as seems almost certain — he emerges as the leader of the largest bloc in the next Parliament. Weber is shadowed by rumors that he will be replaced by the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.

Liberals and Socialists could seek to form an alliance to block Weber’s candidacy, potentially leaving Barnier as a compromise alternative.
With nearly all of the EU's top jobs coming open later this year — not just Commission president but also president of the Council, president of the Parliament, president of the European Central Bank, and the high representative for foreign affairs — many of the big decisions will be influenced by the election but ultimately determined by horse-trading among power brokers.
Frans Timmermans, the nominee of the center-left Party of European Socialists (PES), is not even guaranteed a consolation prize given his party's weak standing in his home country of the Netherlands. His future depends on Prime Minister Mark Rutte staying in power and remaining committed to what appears to be a plan to send Timmermans back to Brussels as the Dutch commissioner despite their different party affiliations.
Timmermans took a shot at Weber on Wednesday as the election campaign intruded into the European Commission's midday news conference. His remarks came after he was asked about Weber's assertion that the Commission has been tougher on rule of law in Hungary — ruled by an EPP government — than Romania, which is run by Social Democrats.
“I can understand the feeling of embarrassment of Mr. Weber after all these discussions about Hungary,” Timmermans said, making reference to Weber’s previous close relationship with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Tortuous talks
The negotiations over the top jobs are almost bound to be tortuous as leaders try to achieve a balance among various political groups and geographical regions. Almost two months before the election, talks on the top posts are already under way.
The Irish government said that Prime Minister Leo Varadkar would raise ""the appointment of a new European Commission, Council president and high representative"" in discussions with Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel this week.
""When it comes to choosing people for these top jobs, there is a playoff between the president of the Commission and now the vice president, high representative, president of the European Parliament, and other positions,"" said Bobby McDonagh, a former Irish ambassador to the EU.
""The balances are extremely complex. There’s the right-left balance, but there’s also the east-west balance, which is probably even more important. There’s also the male-female balance. I don't think it will be acceptable in this day and age not to have a woman in one of the top jobs. And then there's large vs. small. For example, you can’t have another Luxembourger as president of the Commission,"" he said.
“The anti-EU camp is organized in a much more clear way and with clearer objectives than in 2014"" — Green official
""With all of those factors playing in,"" McDonagh said, ""the outcome may well be unsure right up until the last minute. It’s not just the selection for one job. It's the selection for a series of jobs.""
Even the bloc's most powerful national leaders can find their usual muscle is insufficient when it comes to swaying the outcome of deliberations over top EU posts — as evidenced in 2014 when German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.K. Prime Minister David Carmeron failed in their initial bid to block Juncker's candidacy.
This time, Merkel, who eventually came around to support Juncker, seems to be more willing to go along with the Spitzenkandidat process. Privately, she has expressed support for Weber, both in terms of keeping the Commission presidency in the control of her EPP political family, but also for installing the first German as the boss of the Berlaymont since Walter Hallstein served as the Commission's first president from 1958 to 1967.
But Macron, who upended French party politics by winning his own election as an independent in 2017, is fiercely opposed to the Spitzenkandidat system, with its links to traditional parties. That opposition gives Macron further incentive to block Weber's path, in addition to the traditional French reluctance to cede too much power to Germany.

Rumors have swirled for months that Macron will push either for Margrethe Vestager, the Danish liberal who is the current European commissioner for competition, or for Barnier, who is a long-standing member of the EPP, but has the advantage to Macron of being French.
Meanwhile, polls and projections show the strong rise of anti-EU parties creating a situation in which the mainstream groups will be forced to reach for smaller partners in order to form a majority coalition, potentially giving unprecedented leverage to the Greens and other smaller political families.
For some players, the unfolding competition between pro-EU and Euroskeptic forces is the preeminent theme of 2019, potentially marking a clear shift on the power dynamics within the bloc.
“The anti-EU camp is organized in a much more clear way and with clearer objectives than in 2014,” a Green official said. “People are not really interested in the Spitzenkandidat . They are interested in the ‘good vs. bad’ power dynamics.” Related stories on these topics:"

The charges come in connection with a long-term bribery scheme over construction contracts. A former municipal judge already pleaded guilty to his role in the case. This week, federal agents arrested former Hidalgo County Commissioner Arturo “A.C.” Cuellar Jr., 65, former Hidalgo City Commissioner John Cuellar, 56, and local attorney Daniel Garcia on fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy charges, information provided to Breitbart News by the U.S. Attorney’s Office revealed. The arrest comes just days after Rio Grande City Municipal Judge Leo Lopez pleaded guilty to his role in the case.
The two newly arrested politicians and the attorney are expected to go before a U.S. Magistrate Judge on Monday where they will be formally notified of the charges filed against them.
According to prosecutors, the city of Weslaco’s water plant was in violation of environmental regulations and needed heavy structural projects. In 2007, the city voted to issue $28 million in bonds to finance the water plant projects. That figure soon snowballed to close to $40 million. Investigators allege that three companies funneled millions in bribes to the political figures in order to secure the contracts.
From 2008 to 2015, Lopez received $3.7 million from multiple companies in order to secure the contracts. From those proceeds, Lopez allegedly shared $1.4 million with county commissioner AC Cuellar who then allegedly used a company he controls to funnel $405,000 to Weslaco City Commissioner John Cuellar. The funds were made to look like legitimate business expenses. The city politician then allegedly used his power to ensure that three construction companies got more than $38 million in contracts to rehabilitate the water plants.
Prosecutors also allege that $90,000 of the funds that the city commissioner received from AC Cuellar and Lopez were laundered through Garcia’s lawyer trust account.
Soon after the arrest, the City of Weslaco issued a statement revealing that the city welcomed the investigation and had been cooperating with the FBI. The statement revealed that the city had already sued one of the construction companies and had recouped $1.9 million.

Giving himself credit for tough diplomacy, President Donald Trump is describing a burst of activity by Mexican authorities to keep Central American migrants from getting to the U.S. border.
That’s an apparent mirage as Trump retreats from his latest threat to seal off the U.S. from Mexico.
Trump was wrong when he said last week that Mexico was doing “NOTHING” about migrants coming north. It markedly tightened migration controls during the Obama administration and detained over 30,000 foreigners in the first three months of this year.
And it’s not evident now that Mexico has suddenly cracked down as a result of his threat, “apprehending everybody” and making “absolutely terrific progress” in just a matter of days, as Trump put it Friday. Mexico’s apprehensions of foreigners have not surged.
During his visit to the border in Southern California on Friday, Trump denounced a landmark immigration case he blamed on “Judge Flores, whoever you may be.” The case in question was named for Jenny Flores, a migrant teenager from El Salvador in the 1980s, not a judge.
Trump’s recent statements on border matters and how they compare with the facts:
MEXICO
TRUMP, on why he is pulling back on sealing the border imminently: “Because Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days. They’re apprehending everybody. Yesterday they apprehended 1,400 people. The day before was 1,000. And if they apprehend people at their southern border where they don’t have to walk through, that’s a big home run. We can handle it from there. It’s really good. … Mexico, for the last four days, it’s never happened like that in 35 years.” —remarks to reporters Friday.
TRUMP: “Mexico has brought people back, they’ve told people you can’t come in. And that’s happened really, they’ve done, as I understand it, over 1,000 today, over 1,000 people yesterday, over 1,000 people the day before that. Before that they never did anything.” — remarks to reporters Thursday.
THE FACTS: This depiction of Mexico going from strikeout to home run is inaccurate at both ends.
Mexico reports that its interception and detention of migrants from the south are “about average” in recent months. Over the first three days of April, it apprehended 1,259 foreigners — not 1,000 or more a day, as Trump claimed.
“There is no very substantive change,” Mexico’s foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said this week. “There has not been a drastic change.”
“I don’t know what (Trump) was referring to,” he added.
Mexico is requiring migrants to register with authorities, but that’s been the case since President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office Dec. 1, Ebrard said. “What Mexico is doing as far as the review of the southern border — well, it’s the same thing it has been doing since this government began.” On Thursday, Mexico’s ambassador to the U.S., Martha Bárcena, told The Associated Press her country is working to make its own border “more orderly” but “migration will never be stopped.”
Mexico took a substantial step in 2014, implementing a “Southern Border Plan” that established checkpoints and raids to discourage migrants from riding trains or buses from Guatemala. Its detention of foreigners, almost all Central Americans, surged to 198,141 over the next year, from 127,149. Last year, it detained 138,612.
The White House has refused to substantiate Trump’s claim about Mexico’s migrant apprehensions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday credited Mexico with the “will” to help stem migration, but he did not cite results. Even as Trump claimed a Mexican crackdown, Pompeo said the U.S. needs to see action from Mexico, telling Fox News that it’s “one thing to talk about it.”
Trump has abandoned his vow to shut the border imminently. He now says that if Mexico does not continue cooperating on migrants, he will try to put heavy duties on autos from Mexico and revive his border-closure threat if that doesn’t work.

THE FLORES SETTLEMENT
TRUMP: “The Flores decision is a disaster, I have to tell you. Judge Flores, whoever you may be, that decision is a disaster for our country, a disaster.” — remarks at a meeting with local officials in Southern California.
THE FACTS: There’s no Judge Flores involved. Jenny Flores , a 15-year-old El Salvador native, was held in what her advocates said were substandard conditions, contending she was strip-searched in custody and housed with men. They launched a class-action lawsuit on behalf of migrant children in the country illegally. Her mother was a housekeeper in the U.S. who feared deportation if she picked up her daughter.
The case worked its way to the Supreme Court, which sided with the government and against the girl’s advocates. But the case gave rise to an agreement in 1997 setting conditions for the detention of migrant children and the codifying of those conditions in law a decade later. It generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days and guides how they are to be treated.

"Trump losing grip on Mexico, immigration",www.capitolhillblue.com,JILL COLVIN,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.capitolhillblue.com/node/77846,"White House Trump losing grip on Mexico, immigration Immigration experts say Trump’s own immigration policies have caused so much chaos along the border that they may be encouraging illegal crossings. By - April 6, 2019 President Donald Trump walks with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as they visit a newly constructed part of a border wall with Mexico in Calexico, Calif., Friday April 5, 2019.

Tensions are rising, fingers are pointing and the search for solutions is becoming increasingly fraught.
Overwhelmed by an influx of migrants at the border that is taxing the immigration system, President Donald Trump is grasping for something — anything — to stem the tide.
Trump, who campaigned on a promise to secure the border, has thrown virtually every option his aides have been able to think of at the problem, to little avail. He’s deployed the military, signed an emergency declaration to fund a border wall and threatened to completely seal the southern border. On Thursday he added a new threat, warning of hefty tariffs on cars made in Mexico if the country doesn’t abide by his demands.
Now, with the encouragement of an influential aide and his re-election campaign on the horizon, Trump is looking at personnel changes as he tries to shift blame elsewhere. The first move was made Thursday, when the White House unexpectedly pulled back the nomination of Ron Vitiello to permanently lead the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, where he had been acting director. The abrupt reversal was encouraged by top Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller and seen by some as part of a larger effort to bring on aides who share Miller’s hardline immigration views.
The president said he wanted to go in a “tougher direction.”
An empowered Miller is also eyeing the removal of Lee Francis Cissna, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which runs the legal immigration system, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal staffing matters. The White House did not respond to questions Friday about whether Trump was on board with that plan.
Trump has become increasingly exasperated at his inability to do more to halt the swelling numbers of migrants entering the country. Aides, too, have complained they are stymied by regulatory guardrails, legal limitations and a Congress that has scoffed at the president’s requests for legislative changes.
“There is indeed an emergency on our southern border,” Trump said Friday during a visit to the southern border in Calexico, California, where his frustration was evident. “It’s a colossal surge and it’s overwhelming our immigration system, and we can’t let that happen. So, as I say, and this is our new statement: The system is full. Can’t take you anymore.”
He went on to flatly declare: “Our country is full.”
Immigration experts say Trump’s own immigration policies have caused so much chaos along the border that they may be encouraging illegal crossings. The furor over family separations last summer helped to highlight the fact that families won’t be detained for long in the U.S. if they’re detained at all. And metering, in which people are asked to return to a busy port of entry on another day to seek asylum, may have encouraged asylum seekers to cross illegally, said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.
“This policy chaos, coupled with a sense that the U.S. government may at some point really shut down the border, has generated an urgency to migrate now while it is still possible,” he said.
Whatever the reasons for the migrant surge, there is a growing consensus that federal border resources are overwhelmed. While illegal border crossings are still down sharply from their peak in 2000, they have nonetheless reached a 12-year high. And while most illegal border crossers used to be single Mexican nationals coming to the U.S. in search of work, more than half are now parents and children who have traveled from Central America to seek refuge in the U.S.
Those families, along with unaccompanied children, are subject to specific laws and court settlements that prevent them from being immediately sent back to their home countries. Immigrant processing and holding centers have been overwhelmed, forcing officials to dramatically expand a practice Trump has long mocked as “catch and release.”
Indeed, ICE has set free more than 125,000 people who came into the U.S. as families since late last year and is now busing people hundreds of miles inland, releasing them at Greyhound stations and churches in cities like Albuquerque, San Antonio and Phoenix because towns close to the border already have more than they can handle.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also has voiced increasing exasperation, equating the situation to the aftermath of a Category 5 hurricane.
“We have tried everything that we can at DHS,” she said Thursday on CNN. “We are out of the ability to manage this flow and they need help.”
She recently called on Congress to consider changes to the immigration system. But those efforts have so far landed with a thud.
House Democrats would almost certainly reject any plans to simply deport unaccompanied minors or otherwise rewrite the law governing asylum or family detentions that they see as protecting young migrants who are often fleeing difficult conditions. In the Senate, where Republicans have the majority, there’s little interest in big legislative proposals this year, especially on a divisive issue like immigration. Trump’s ideas could be especially tough for senators facing re-election in 2020 in Colorado, Arizona and North Carolina, swing states with sizable Latino and immigrant populations.
In the meantime, tensions between agencies and at the White House have been bubbling up. At the Department of Homeland Security, officials have expressed frustration with colleagues at the department of Health and Human Services and at the Pentagon, accusing them of doing too little to help. And there are complaints about the White House and what some see as an effort by Miller to dismantle the leadership of the department, in part to shift the blame away from the White House.

Donald Trump Claims he Hasn't Read Full Mueller Investigation Report 'Though I Have Every Right to Do So',www.newsweek.com,Chris Morran,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-claims-he-hasnt-read-full-mueller-investigation-report-though-i-1388129,"On 4/6/19 at 11:18 AM EDT Share U.S.
While Attorney General William Barr reviews and redacts sensitive information from the nearly 400 pages of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report on the two-year investigation into Russian election interference, President Donald Trump claimed Saturday that he has not yet seen the document.
""I have not read the Mueller Report yet, even though I have every right to do so,"" tweeted Trump. ""Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion. Likewise, recommendations made to our great A.G. who found No Obstruction.""
Mueller submitted his report to Barr on March 22, and two days later Barr provided Congress a four-page summary of the investigation. According to that summary, Mueller found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, but made no conclusion regarding concerns the president may have illegally obstructed justice. Rather, Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein subsequently determined to not pursue the obstruction matter any further.
Trump's tweet continued, ""13 Angry Trump hating Dems (later brought to 18) given two years and $30 million, and they found No Collusion, No Obstruction. But the Democrats, no matter what we give them, will NEVER be satisfied. A total waste of time.""
While the president and his supporters have repeatedly claimed the Mueller findings exonerated Trump, recent reports have raised questions about the possibility that Barr provided an overly favorable version of the investigation.
Earlier this week, the New York Times cited a number of Mueller team members who said Barr did not “adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated.”
Similarly, the Washington Post reported this week that some special counsel investigators had complained about the Barr summary, claiming that it omitted potentially ""alarming and significant"" evidence of obstruction.
“The two reports raise incredibly serious questions about the legitimacy of the process of handling this report. That’s my view. It’s a game changer,” Gene Rossi, a former Department of Justice prosecutor, told Newsweek about these claims that Barr may not be sharing important evidence.
Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani slammed these reports, calling the anonymous sources, ""unscrupulous prosecutors"" who he claims “conducted an investigation that was a disgraceful overzealous exercise of government coercion... Now they are leaking what they couldn’t prove. They are cowards and liars.”
Likewise, Republican Senator John Kennedy claimed this week that releasing an unredacted Mueller report could put lives in danger. “I don’t want to get anybody killed by violating national security concerns,” Kennedy, of Louisiana, told CNN’s Manu Raju Friday morning.
House Democratics have repeatedly called on Barr to provide the full, unredacted version of the Mueller report. This week, the House Judiciary Committee granted Chairman Jerrold Nadler authority to subpoena the full report.
“We must make it harder for future presidents to behave this way,” said Nadler. “We need a full accounting of the president’s actions to do that work.”"

Allred: Trump Admin Working to Strike Down ACA ‘To Fulfill an Empty, Partisan Promise’ IAN HANCHETT 6 Apr 2019 During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Representative Colin Allred (D-TX) stated that “to fulfill an empty, partisan promise,” the Trump administration is working to strike down the Affordable Care Act in court.
Transcript as Follows:
“Hey everybody, I’m Congressman Colin Allred. I represent the 32nd district of Texas where I was born and raised.
My story could only happen in America.
I was raised by a single Mom who was a Dallas public school teacher, with the help of my teachers, coaches and mentors at the Town North YMCA who gave me the support I needed to chase my version of the American dream. Whether that was to play college football and then play in the NFL. Or to become a civil rights attorney and work in the Obama Administration.
That is who we are as a nation. We’re at our best when we look out for each other, just like the community in North Texas looked out for me.
That’s why this week, I was proud to lead a bipartisan resolution that puts the U.S. House of Representatives on the side of the people and protecting our health care.
In an attempt to fulfill an empty, partisan promise, the Trump Administration has decided to work to invalidate the entirety of the Affordable Care Act in federal court.
This is unacceptable. We can’t go back to the bad old days when people were denied care because they had a pre-existing condition.
I was elected as part of this new Congress to put an end to the sabotage of Americans’ health care, and we are working together to do just that.
Like many Americans, health care is personal for me. My mom is a breast cancer survivor. My wife Aly and I just had a baby. Both of those can count as pre-existing conditions.
My home state of Texas has the highest uninsured rate in the country. One in five people in my home of Dallas County don’t have health care.
North Texans don’t think this is a partisan issue, which is why I’ll work with anyone to protect the progress we’ve made, fight to lower costs and increase coverage. They want to know if you work hard and play by the rules, you can have good health care, that’s affordable.
That brings me to Natalie.
Natalie had a good job as a lawyer, and a beautiful family. She had two kids, Hugo and Mia, and was married to Nathan, a law professor at SMU.
I met Natalie on the same day the House voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I learned she had stage 4 cancer and that she had come to our event from chemotherapy. Natalie explained to me that her goal was to fight her cancer as long as possible so that her children, Hugo and Mia, would know her.
Natalie was worried about future moms like her who would lose their care if the Affordable Care Act was repealed.
She was concerned about a return to days with lifetime caps and discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions.
Sadly, Natalie died last year, but her fight goes on.
A fight to protect health care, that I am honored to carry forward with my colleagues on behalf of North Texans and millions of Americans like Natalie.
The American people are counting on us to get things done. I encourage my colleagues across the aisle to put aside politics, and join us in an effort to fix our health care system so it works better for everyone.
That’s why Democrats are advancing bold new legislation to lower health care costs and prescription drug prices – and why we’re working to strengthen protections for people with pre-existing conditions even further. A Congress that works For The People works to make health care more affordable, not to take it away.
Thank you.”

Florida’s Constitution is in the crosshairs.
A little more than two years ago, voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment that broadly legalized medical marijuana. In November, nearly two-thirds of Floridians signed off on an amendment to restore the right to vote to certain felons who’ve completed their sentences.
Backers of both proposals maintain that the constitutional changes don’t require action from the Legislature.
But Republican lawmakers are pushing a pot proposal and a voting-restoration measure that have sparked intense debate and, in one case, focused a national spotlight on Florida.
In the voting-rights skirmish, proponents of what appeared as Amendment 4 on the November ballot are likening House and Senate bills to Jim Crow-era policies designed to keep black voters from participating in elections.
State Rep. James Grant, the House bill sponsor, is accusing Amendment 4 backers of pulling a bait-and-switch on voters.
In an “I’m rubber, you’re glue” vein, both sides accuse each other of politicizing the issue.
Caught up in the clash are about 700,000 felons who --- depending on how legislators handle the issue --- might be able to vote in next year’s presidential election. Republicans and Democrats consider the Sunshine State critical for a White House victory.
Senate President Bill Galvano rejected arguments of critics who accuse Republican lawmakers of trying to use the legislation to protect President Donald Trump in 2020.
“I would say that they’re wrong. I would say that we’re trying our best to genuinely implement policy and enact policy … that meets the intent of the voters,” he said.
FORAY OVER FELONS’ FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS
Whether felons who’ve completed their time behind bars or on probation should have voting rights restored if they haven’t paid off all of their financial obligations has become a flashpoint as lawmakers grapple with carrying out Amendment 4.
Grant, a Tampa Republican who is a lawyer, has crafted a bill that’s shot him into the national spotlight, infuriated advocates of the amendment and spawned hundreds of phone calls and emails to legislators urging them to kill the proposal.
The constitutional amendment granted restoration of voting rights to felons “who have completed all terms of their sentence, including parole or probation.” It excluded people “convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense.”
Grant’s definition of what it means to have completed sentences has created the firestorm.
Under the House proposal (HB 7089), felons would have to pay all court fees, fines and restitution to be eligible for the automatic vote restoration.
The House proposal defines “term of sentence” as including “any cost of supervision or other monetary obligation,” a sticking point for proponents of the amendment.
“If it is in the four corners of the sentence, it is the sentence,” Grant told the House State Affairs Committee prior to a party-line, 15-6 vote Thursday on the bill.
The House measure would also require full payment of restitution or other financial obligations that have been converted to civil judgments, another point of contention for proponents of the amendment.
Cecile Scoon, a lawyer and an officer with the League of Women Voters of Florida, argued that the House measure would also allow state agencies, such as the Department of Corrections, to levy fines against felons, which they would have to pay to be eligible for the automatic vote restoration. That’s not what voters who supported the amendment envisioned, she said.
“This is why people are offended. This is redefining what is Amendment 4 and going well outside what was said when the people voted,” Scoon said.
Lance Wissinger, a convicted felon, said the House plan creates two classes of felons.
“What we are doing right now with the bill seems like it is targeting a certain demographic. It seems like it is going after people with low income, and it’s not giving everyone the opportunity to have their ability to vote back,” Wissinger said.
PATIENTS NOT SO HIGH ON HOUSE POT PLAN
Veterans, parents and medical cannabis operators are pushing back against a House plan that would limit how high Floridians can get when they smoke medical marijuana, saying proposed THC levels would drive patients to the black market.
The House plan would cap THC levels in smokable medical marijuana at 10 percent, a level the sponsor of the legislation maintains is based on science, but which patients and advocates contend is too low. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the intoxicating ingredient in marijuana that produces a euphoric effect.
The House Health & Human Services Committee on Wednesday approved the measure (PCB HHS 19-02), with Chairman Ray Rodrigues saying the cap is grounded in studies that found high levels of the euphoria-inducing cannabinoid were not effective in treating pain. Other studies linked smoking high-THC marijuana with psychosis, Rodrigues said.
“We believe that there’s science that shows greater than 10 percent THC has been linked to harmful effects, so that’s why we’ve chosen the 10 percent limit. There’s also science out there that has shown that less than 10 percent is effective for medical purposes, and so we have used that as the delineation,” Rodrigues, R-Estero, said.
The committee vote came about three weeks after lawmakers --- many of them, like Rodrigues, reluctantly --- succumbed to pressure from Gov. Ron DeSantis and overwhelmingly voted to repeal the state’s ban on smokable medical marijuana.
The bill also includes a provision that would allow veterans to get free medical-marijuana patient identification cards, which currently cost patients and caregivers $75 each year.
Waiving the fee for vets, however, drew the wrath of some patients who accused Rodrigues of using veterans as “scapegoats” for the controversial THC levels included in the bill.
“This is going to harm us,” Tanya Bailey, a veteran with the group “Vets for Buds,” told the panel.
“We need our medicine. We don’t know what to do,” Bailey said. “I have to oppose any amendment that’s going to ride on our backs to lower to 10 percent.”
ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS
Both legislative chambers this week passed versions of a state spending plan, with the House’s $89.9 billion budget about $400 million shy of the Senate’s version, which falls about $1 billion short of what DeSantis proposed.
The variance might seem relatively small, but it incorporates myriad differences that House and Senate leaders will have to resolve if the legislative session is going to end on time May 3.
The biggest schisms include education, health care and the state’s tourism agency, Visit Florida.
When asked by a reporter Thursday about the biggest challenge going into negotiations, House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, replied with a laugh that “the Legislature is made up of people.”
“The biggest issue is that we’re dealing with people, so people have different priorities about different things and different concerns,” Oliva said. “This is a process of building coalitions. You have to bring people together to come to a general agreement and hopefully to get most of what everyone wants, but it’s impossible to get everything that everyone wants.”
STORY OF THE WEEK: The House and Senate passed their versions of a state spending plan, coming in about $400 million apart.
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “If you go to Panama City, which I did this past weekend, it looks more like a neighborhood in Panama City, Panama, than it looks like Panama City, Florida.” Sen. Doug Broxson, R-Gulf Breeze, referring to the Panhandle community ravaged last year by Hurricane Michael."
"Ex-Sheriff Israel Continues to Fight for Reinstatement, but DeSantis Is Ready for Him",www.sunshinestatenews.com,Nancy Smith,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/ex-sheriff-israel-continues-fight-reinstatement-desantis-ready-him,"Ex-Sheriff Israel Continues to Fight for Reinstatement, but DeSantis Is Ready for Him By April 6, 2019 - 8:00am Scott Israel
In keeping with his pattern of defiance and reliance on recriminations, deposed Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel pledges to appeal a recent judge’s decision.
Following his suspension in early January by newly sworn-in Gov. Ron DeSantis, the sheriff had pledged to fight the decision. Holding his own press conference the same day, Israel declared the governor's decision had no merit, declaring it a political hit job.
In response Israel decided on a twofold strategy to get his job back; he intended to take his case the the Florida Senate, as well as to court. Early last month he filed his lawsuit against DeSantis’ decision. In the March 7 filing the claim stated the governor failed to adequately give reason for the dismissal, and called the executive order “an invalid exercise of authority. Sheriff Israel is entitled to reinstatement as Broward County sheriff.”
The governor responded to the suit by filing a motion to dismiss, declaring that he had acted within the parameters of the state Constitution, and therefore this was not an action reviewable by the courts. On Thursday, April 4, the judge agreed with DeSantis and had the case dismissed.
But immediately after the ruling, Israel’s lawyers announced they will take his case to another judge on appeal.
“The constitutionality of Sheriff Israel’s suspension will be tested in Florida’s appellate courts,” they said through a released statement. They also claimed this was overreach by the governor, prodded by the National Rifle Association.
DeSantis immediately responded in kind. “Scott Israel continues to live in denial,” he said in his own statement released Friday. “The court has recognized my authority as governor to suspend him for neglect of duty and incompetence and this appeal is just his latest delay tactic.”
The governor, an attorney with a law degree from Harvard, then elected to move beyond the appeal. He filed a request that the case be expedited and sent directly to the Florida Supreme Court, declaring the case should be resolved “sooner rather than later.” In late January Israel had filed a formal review by the state Senate. That review had been scheduled to take place this month, but it was delayed as a result of the court case, and now the subsequent appeal. The current session for the Senate comes to an end on May 3.
According to his latest filing, DeSantis stated he wants “a final ruling so the Senate can resume the process of formally removing him.” Any delay “limits the Florida Senate from carrying out constitutionally prescribed responsibility in the suspension and removal process.”
Reflective of his quick action taken to suspend Israel, done just days after his inauguration, DeSantis was fully prepared for the Israel move to appeal. “I am pleased that the court recognizes my authority as governor to suspend a public official for reasons of neglect of duty and incompetence.”

Florida Delegation Urges Trump to Protect Farmers From Mexican Competition,www.sunshinestatenews.com,Kevin Derby,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/florida-delegation-urges-trump-administration-protect-farmers-mexican-competition,"Florida Delegation Urges Trump to Protect Farmers From Mexican Competition By April 6, 2019 - 8:00am Okeechobee farming family fights to carry on
This week, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., continued to push against Mexico produce imports, calling on the Trump administration to protect farmers in the Sunshine State, as the Trump administration looks to replace NAFTA with USMCA.
Rubio and Buchanan rounded up senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle to call on Trade Ambassador Robert Lighthizer to protect farmers as negotiations with Mexico continue.
“While the Mexican government has refused to include a mechanism to correct this growing imbalance in the USMCA text, we still believe the Administration must ensure that clear rules are in place to defend domestic seasonal and perishable produce from unfair trade practices,” stated the letter. “We strongly insist that the Administration address this issue in a way that gives confidence to all seasonal growers that the federal government can and will act to counter legitimate injury from unfair imports from Mexico or any other country,” the senators and representatives wrote.
“Domestic seasonal and perishable produce growers deserve reasonable access to trade enforcement tools that are readily available to other agricultural and industrial producers in the U.S.,” they added. “Such an outcome would be good for American fruit and vegetable farmers, good for American families, and good for the nation’s food security.”
The signers includes Georgia Republican U.S. Sens. Johnny Isakson and David Perdue, Florida Democrat U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor, Charlie Crist, Val Demings, Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel, Alcee Hastings, Al Lawson, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Stephanie Murphy, Donna Shalala, Darren Soto, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Frederica Wilson and Florida Republican U.S. Reps.
Gus Bilirakis, Mario Diaz-Balart, Neal Dunn, Matt Gaetz, Brian Mast, Bill Posey, John Rutherford, Ross Spano, Greg Steube, Mike Waltz, Dan Webster and Ted Yoho.
Back in October, Rubio, Buchanan, Diaz-Balart, Lawson and then U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., unveiled the “Agricultural Trade Improvement Act"" which would adjust the Tariff Act of 1930 to “allow American specialty crop growers to request the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties.” Back in January Rubio, Buchanan and Lawson brought out the ""Defending Domestic Produce Production Act,"" a similar proposal which would ease certain thresholds to allow Florida farmers to petition the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate illegal subsidies and dumping of Mexican fruits and vegetables in the U.S. market.”
“Current law requires petitioners to demonstrate harm as measured from a nationwide and year-round perspective,” Buchanan’s office noted about the proposal. “This bill would acknowledge the unique circumstances of seasonal fruit and vegetable producers who are directly harmed by Mexico’s practices in various geographic regions during different seasons, including Florida growers during the winter months.”
“Our beleaguered growers continue to be harmed by Mexico’s unfair subsidies and illegal seasonal dumping,” Buchanan, who leads Republicans on the U.S. House Trade Subcommittee, said when the bill was brought out. “This legislation will level the playing field for a vital industry to Florida’s economy.”
Almost 100,000 residents of the Sunshine State work in agriculture, adding more than $12 billion a year to Florida’s economy. Since 2000, agriculture products imported from Mexico have cost Florida between $1-$3 billion. Add new comment"

Palestinian prisoners held in Israel have postponed their planned hunger strike that was scheduled to begin on Sunday.Palestinian sources said the prisoners decided to delay the hunger strike to allow more time for negotiations with the Israel Prison Service (IPS). Some 30 leaders of Hamas prisoner were scheduled to go on a hunger strike on Sunday morning to protest the installation of cell-phone jamming devices in a number of prisons.The prisoners are also protesting harsh measures taken by the IPS against inmates, following the stabbing of two guards in Ketziot Prison in the Negev last month.Sources claimed that the leaders of the Hamas prisoners on Sunday morning refused food, saying they were determined to launch their hunger strike.Negotiations between the prisoners and IPS officials were expected to continue later Sunday in an attempt to prevent the hunger strike, they added.The inmates demanded the removal of signal-jamming devices that prevent them from using cellular phones, lifting sanctions placed on some prisoners following the stabbing of two prison guards last month by Hamas prisoners, and the resumption of family visits.Following the stabbing of two guards at Ketziot Prison in the Negev, the IPS imposed restrictions on dozens of prisoners for their reported involvement in the incident, and for a subsequent riot that erupted in the prison.On Friday, unconfirmed reports said the IPS and the prisoners were close to reaching agreement to avert the hunger strike. However, the Palestinian Prisoners Center for Studies denied the reports and said that the inmates were preparing to launch their action on Sunday morning.Riad Ashkar, a spokesman for the center, said negotiations between the prisoners and the Israeli authorities were unsuccessful. He claimed that the IPS has offered to install public phones in the prisons which the prisoners would be permitted to use under the supervision of the authorities.According to Ashkar, the IPS told the prisoners that their demands would be discussed after Tuesday’s general elections. The prisoners, he said, don’t trust the authorities’ promises and insist on all their demands being met, in particular, the removal of the jamming devices.Ashkar described the reports about a possible agreement between the prisoners and the authorities as “rumors” and “lies” designed to “alleviate the state of tension and frustrate the growing solidarity with the prisoners.”In the first stage of the hunger strike, the leaders of the prisoners will refuse food, he explained. A week later, they will be joined by other prisoners who will refuse food and water. “These escalating steps will continue and develop into a comprehensive hunger strike on April 17, the anniversary of Palestinian Prisoner’s Day,” Ashkar added. Palestinians mark Palestinian Prisoner’s Day each year with rallies and demonstrations in solidarity with the inmates.Kadri Abu Bakr, head of the Commission for Palestinian Prisoners and Ex-Detainees, on Sunday warned that unless the Israeli authorities accept their demands, the prisoners will declare a hunger strike on Sunday.Abu Bakr predicted that the Israeli authorities would give their response to the demands by late Saturday.He claimed that the signal-jamming devices were harmful to the prisoners’ health. He also complained that the prisoners are not allowed to watch television or listening to radio. The prisoners, he said, are also demanding the right to use public phones to stay in touch with their families and the lifting of sanctions imposed on many of them after the stabbing of the two prison guards.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) — An Iranian news portal in Latin America has published an article claiming that Israel uses Palestinian prisoners for “new medical trials.”Despite citing no evidence for the claim, the HispanTV report Wednesday has spread to outlets across Latin America, including the El Ciudadano monthly in Chile and the website of an association of Cuban jurists. It was published on Uruguay’s La Republica website but taken down Friday after a reader complained. “This fake news crosses all limits of journalistic ethics,” said Ariel Gelblum, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s regional representative in Buenos Aires.The Argentine site Infobae first reported the Wiesenthal Center’s complaint.“HispanTV is for the Iranian regime to influence Latin America, through the presence of Hezbollah, its terrorist arm,” Shimon Samuels, the director of international relations for the Wiesenthal Center, said in a statement. “The charge of blood libel was used against Jews since the Middle Ages. Its use by Tehran is the crudest form of anti-Semitism.”HispanTV, which is operated by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, launched in 2011. In 2014, Iran announced plans to expand its media influence in Latin America.“Iran’s strong and rapidly growing ties with Latin America have raised eyebrows in the U.S. and its Western allies since Tehran and Latin nations have forged an alliance against the imperialist and colonialist powers and are striving hard to reinvigorate their relations with the other independent countries which pursue a line of policy independent from the U.S.,” the Iranian Fars News agency said.

Israel has the lowest rate of diet-related deaths worldwide, according to a major study published by researchers at the University of Washington.The most in-depth study of its kind to date, published in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet , revealed that globally, one in five deaths (11 million deaths) in 2017 were associated with poor diet, with cardiovascular disease the largest contributor, followed by cancers and type 2 diabetes. The countries with the lowest rates of diet-related deaths, however, were Israel (89 deaths per 100,000 people), followed by France, Spain, Japan and Andorra.At the other end of the spectrum, Uzbekistan received the dubious distinction of the country with the highest rate of diet-related deaths (892 deaths per 100,000 people), followed by Afghanistan, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu.The United Kingdom ranked 23rd worldwide (127 deaths per 100,000 people), the United States was ranked 43rd (171 deaths per 100,000 people) and China was ranked 140th (350 deaths per 100,000 people).Deaths related to diet have significantly increased from 8 million in 1990 to 11 million in 2017, researchers said, largely due to increases in the population and population aging. The findings reveal that sub-optimal diet is responsible for more deaths than any other global risk, including smoking.“This study affirms what many have thought for several years – that poor diet is responsible for more deaths than any other risk factor in the world,” said study author Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.“While sodium, sugar and fat have been the focus of policy debates over the past two decades, our assessment suggests the leading dietary risk factors are high intake of sodium, or low intake of healthy foods, such as whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds, and vegetables.”The study, part of the wider Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project, evaluated the consumption of major foods and nutrients such across 195 countries, and tracked trends concerning 15 dietary elements between 1990 and 2017. These included fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, milk, red meat, processed meat, sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids.An estimated 11 million deaths were attributable to poor diet worldwide in 2017. More than half of the deaths were attributed to diets high in sodium and low in whole grains and fruit.High consumption of red and processed meat, trans fat and sugar-sweetened beverages were ranked toward the bottom of dietary risks for death and disease in highly populated countries.Consumption of all 15 dietary elements were sub-optimal for almost every region of the world, researchers found. On average, the world only ate 12% of the recommended amount of nuts and seeds and drank approximately 10 times the recommended amount of sugar-sweetened beverages.“Limitations notwithstanding, the current GBD findings provide evidence to shift the focus, as the authors argue, from an emphasis on dietary restriction to promoting healthy food components in a global context,” said Prof. Nita Forouhi of Cambridge University’s School of Clinical Medicine.“There are of course considerable challenges in shifting populations’ diets in this direction, illustrated by the cost of fruits and vegetables being disproportionately prohibitive.”While most dietary guidelines recommend the daily consumption of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per individual, a 2016 study published in The Lancet revealed that purchasing the recommended amount would account for 52% of household income in low-income countries compared to 2% in high-income countries.“A menu of integrated policy interventions across whole food systems, internationally and within countries, is essential to support the radical shift in diets needed to optimize human, and protect planetary health,” said Prof. Forouhi.

Stephen Colbert Roasts Donald Trump: 'So Many People Can’t Stand Him',www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-stephen-colbert-show-1388126,"On 4/6/19 at 11:12 AM EDT Share Culture
Stephen Colbert used market research data to mock what he sees as President Donald Trump’s obsession with being well-liked on the latest episode of The Late Show on Friday.
Referring to Trump’s E-Score rating—composed of private E-Poll Market Research data typically used by marketing executives, advertisers and network stations—Colbert suggested the president would probably be displeased by his relatively low figures, likely caused by the fact that “so many people can’t stand him.”
“Donald Trump does not do well in these e-ratings,” Colbert said of the data obtained and released by New York Times on Monday. “His overall strong negative appeal was 39 percent compared to a strong positive appeal of just 14 percent.”
Information gathered from the E-Score ratings are used to help marketers, advertisers and networks determine personalities who appeal—and those who don’t—to viewers. According to the Times , specific data like the Q Score, for instance, measures audiences’ awareness and appeal of various TV personalities while also tracking an individual’s physical attractiveness and likability.
Most of those who viewed Trump positively were adults over the age of 55, while amajority of younger people viewed him negatively. Men across all ages also thought the president had a positive appeal compared to women.
Explaining the goal of the E-Score, Colbert claimed the “characteristics most associated with the president were 'aggressive' and 'mean,' two of the rejected seven dwarfs.” Colbert also noted Trump “scored high for being 'confident' and 'creepy.'”
E-Score data revealed 48 percent of viewers perceived Trump as “aggressive” while 38 percent viewed his as being “mean.” Trump also received relatively high scores for being “confident,” “creepy” and “insincere.” Meanwhile, he only scored between zero and four percent in the “sexy,” “impartial,” “handsome” and “physically” fit categories, which Colbert mocked with a series of unappealing pictures of the president.
“By the way, confident and creepy is the same combination score you’d give a spider your shower,” Colbert teased. “But here’s the part Trump’s really not going to like. His lowest scores were for the attributes of ‘sexy,’ ‘handsome’ and ‘physically fit.’”
Trump’s E-Score also revealed about 29 percent of viewers believed he was “overexposed.”
Only adding to Trump’s poor polling, the 72-year-old has seemingly flat-lined in his average approval rating. Following special counsel Robert Mueller’s findings of no collusion between Trump and Russian officials in the 2016 presidential election, Trump’s approval rating only jumped one-tenth of one percentage point, according to Real Clear Politics poll tracker.
Trump had a steady 43.1 percent approval rating before Meuller’s report on March 24 but increased to 43.2 percent in the poll released Thursday."
'RuPaul's Drag Race' Season 11: What's Next For Scarlet Envy After Elimination?,www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/rupauls-drag-race-scarlet-envy-1387412,"On 4/6/19 at 10:20 AM EDT Share Culture
After another week of intense competition, one queen was sent packing on RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 11.
Scarlet Envy raced for the gold during the Draglypmics challenge on episode 6, but the Canada queen just couldn’t keep up with the rest of her teammates, dubbed The People’s Republic of Glamazonia. When she failed to impress show host RuPaul Charles and the rest of the judging panel with her “All That Glitters” golden-hued runway look, Scarlet ended up in the bottom two along with Ra’Jah Ohara.
It’s never been a secret that Scarlet wasn’t the best dancer on the show, and despite her attempts to steal the spotlight during her Lip Sync For Your Life battle against Ra’Jah, her last dance to Donna Summer’s “Last Dance” didn’t make the cut, and she was eliminated.
Despite getting the axe, Scarlet told Newsweek she was proud of the experience and having the opportunity to meet and work with RuPaul.
“It’s a magnetic energy that she has, mother! It’s life changing to even think about it,” said Scarlet.
“Just the smallest interaction with her — even if it’s not advice that she gave directly to one of us, we all took it. Sometimes I go to bed and wake up and I’m in the work room again,” she continued. “Ru has taught me to dive in instead of using a step ladder, to just decide that you’re gonna get in the pool and jump. I guess to not second guess, to not wonder what if, to just do.”
In all, just having the confidence to actually audition for the show and land a spot—albiet only for a limited time — was enough to make Scarlet’s appearance a memorable one for her.
“The most rewarding part has been within myself, just knowing that I was gonna do this one day and if I wasn’t I was gonna try really hard,"" she said. ""And I tried, and I did it, and now that the seasons wrapped it’s just kind of experiencing the life change. The change within me has been the most rewarding experience.”
As for what she plans to do with all her Drag Race experience, Scarlet said she wants to “see the world,” and she’s taking her mom along for the ride.
“Another one of my goals is to take my mom to Paris, she’s never been. So that’s gonna be—fingers cross, legs uncross—very doable in the next year,"" said Scarlet. ""I wanna take her out and give her some wine and some carbs, a real vacation.""
“She has been so supportive, I come from a not-so-right background, rigorously based family. So [being on Drag Race has] been a whole full circle moment for me, my family, professionally—a totally different world from where I grew up compared to where I am now,” she said. “My mom is a seasoned professional and comes to many shows across the country. She deserves a vacation.""
There are still nine queens in the running for the title of RuPaul's Drag Race champion.
RuPaul’s Drag Race airs on VH1 on Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET."
Roger Stone Defends Donald Trump's Attack on Barbara Bush: 'Well She’s Dead and He’s President — Who Won that One?',www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/roger-stone-defends-trump-barbara-bush-attacks-1388115,"On 4/6/19 at 10:03 AM EDT Share U.S.
Longtime Donald Trump associate Roger Stone defended the president’s recent comments about late first lady Barbara Bush, writing in an Instagram post that “she’s dead and he’s president — who won that one?”
Stone alleged in the social media post, which featured a photograph of Bush, that she once “berated me in a drunken tirade after the campaign I managed for Ronald Reagan beat her husband” in Republican primary races.
He then went on to defend Trump, who has been under criticism for hitting out at Bush after a new biography revealed that the late first lady was not a fan of his. Biographer Susan Page, who was given access to Bush’s diaries, extensively details the late first lady's dislike for Trump dating back to the 1990s.
“She had a “countdown clock” for @realdonaldtrump presidency? Well she’s dead and he’s president — who won that one?” Stone wrote in the post. “Nasty, rude, vindictive, entitled , self-important - that’s the woman I had several unpleasant encounters with.”
In the biography, titled The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of a Dynasty , Bush said that she “probably” didn’t consider herself a Republican any longer due to the rise of Trump. According to the author, the comment was made two months before she died at the age of 92 in April 2018.
“Trump now means greed, selfishness and ugly. So sad,” the late first lady once wrote about the president in 1990, when he was a real estate mogul in New York.
Trump responded to the biography in an Oval Office interview with The Washington Times this week, during which he said that Bush had a right to be angry with him after the way he treated her sons.
""I have heard that she was nasty to me, but she should be. Look what I did to her sons,"" Trump told the news outlet.
During the 2016 presidential race, Trump ridiculed former President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was running against Trump for the Republican Party’s nomination. Trump repeatedly referred to Jeb Bush as “low energy” and that he “desperately needed mommy to help him.”
Stone’s defense of the president comes as he is wrapped up in several legal troubles of his own. He was indicted in January on seven counts in connection to the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling. The charges include lying to prosecutors, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Stone has maintained his innocence and will go to trial in November.

"Tucker Carlson Rips Dems, Twitter Culture For Putting Pressure on Public Figures to Apologize",www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-rips-dems-twitter-culture-putting-pressure-public-figures-1388072,"On 4/6/19 at 9:46 AM EDT Share U.S.
Fox News host Tucker Carlson went on a tangent about—what else—liberal politics during his Friday evening show, accusing progressives of creating a culture in which “lying is the currency of public life.”
He directed his ire in this particular case at Democratic presidential hopefuls who have apologized for controversial behavior—something Carlson has refused to do when met with boycott campaigns for his inflammatory comments about women and minorities.
At one point, Carlson suggested that Twitter was a platform wherein ""humor and dissent are criminal acts, where lying is the currency of public life, and where authorities whose names you don’t know can destroy you for thinking the wrong things.""
The host opened his spiel by mocking Pete Buttigieg — presidential hopeful and mayor of South Bend, Indiana — for expressing regret over once saying ""All Lives Matter,"" a phrase often used to undermine Black Lives Matter efforts. Then, he moved toward Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas representative came under fire in March for joking that his wife, Amy Hoover Sanders, did most of the child-rearing while he campaigned for the Democratic ticket.
“Beto O’Rourke, who is 46 years old and still skateboards, has no dignity,” Carlson began, seemingly upset that O’Rourke had acknowledged benefitting from white privilege. “He fell apart completely. He groveled and whimpered and abased himself. He even expanded the self-criticism and apologized for the way he was born.”
During the segment, Carlson also lampooned Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for stating that “diversity is our strength as a country.”
Carlson has been one of the most outspoken political commentators against immigration, once remarking in 2018 that it ""makes our country poorer, and dirtier, and more divided.""
“...There’s nothing liberal about any of this, obviously,"" the Fox News host opined. ""It is purely authoritarian, woke fascism....not just conventional lying—the ordinary truth-shading of everyday life—but terrifying, full inversion lies, the exact opposite of the truth, the kind of lies that regimes that seek total control must tell in order to maintain their power.""
It's not Carlson's first screed against apologies. When pressured to express contrition for his statements about immigration and a host of other racist and misogynistic remarks, Carlson said he refused to capitulate to ""Twitter mobs"" and thanked Fox News for its support amid a loss of advertisers.
The advertising boycott continued into this year when audio recordings were unearthed by Media Matters for America, a left-wing media watchdog. The recordings capture Carlson defending a polygamist found guilty of child rape, calling women ""primitive"" and describing Iraq as ""a crappy place filled"" with ""semiliterate primitive monkeys.""
In other recordings, he questioned the blackness of former President Barack Obama and said Martha Stewart's daughter was a ""c*nt"" who needed a ""spanking.""
More than 30 companies have yanked ads from his program over his remarks.

"Donald Trump 'doesn’t have a big enough spine to attend' Correspondents' Dinner, Says Michelle Wolf",www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/michelle-wolf-donald-trump-dinner-1388102,"On 4/6/19 at 9:37 AM EDT Share Culture
One year after making headlines with her controversial routine at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, comedian Michelle Wolf is firing shots off at President Donald Trump for his decision to once again skip the annual event.
Trump announced plans Friday to hold a campaign rally on April 27 instead of attending the dinner, marking the third year the president has been a no-show at the annual feast, which has often featured a comedian giving biting remarks of the politicians and press in attendance.
While speaking at a Power of Women NY event on Friday, Wolf said the president “doesn’t have a big enough spine” to appear at the gathering of journalists.
“You know, he’s probably just really busy because he’s got to golf and honestly, I don’t know if anyone really wants to watch him eat,” Wolf joked.
“So I think it’s probably for the best,” she continued. “He doesn’t have a big enough spine to attend. A person who can’t take someone making fun of them, I don’t really care about.”

As for why Trump decided to bail on the dinner yet again, the president said the event was “so boring” and “too negative,” likely referring to Wolf’s provocative appearance last year.
Trump was in Michigan for a rally on the night of the 2018 WHCD, and the year before that, he was busy with an event in Pennsylvania. At both rallies, the president criticized the “fake news” media and claimed he’d rather spend time with “ much better people ” like the folks at his event than members of Washington's media scene.
Wolf faced significant backlash following her appearance at the 2018 dinner, with a number of politicians and correspondents saying they were offended by her criticism and jokes, particularly the comments aimed at White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
“And of course, we have Sarah Huckabee Sanders. We are graced with Sarah’s presence tonight. I have to say I’m a little star-struck. I love you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid’s Tale . Mike Pence, if you haven’t seen it, you would love it,” Wolf said , later adding, “I actually really like Sarah. I think she’s very resourceful. Like she burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies.”
Following the Capitol Hill outrage sparked by Wolf’s attendance, the White House Correspondents' Association decided to break from the tradition of having a comedian host the dinner and chose American historian and biographer Ron Chernow instead. Author of six best-selling books, Chernow has covered the lives of many presidents and political figures throughout his career.
In 2011, Trump attended a Correspondents' Dinner, where host Seth Meyers roasted the reality TV star for his political aspirations.
""Donald Trump has been saying he will run for president as a Republican, which is suprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke,"" said Meyers while C-Span cameras filmed a stone-faced Trump amid the laughing audience members."
'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' Star Tati Gabrielle Says Prudence's 'Identity Will be Challenged' in Part 2 of Netflix Series,www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/chilling-adventures-sabrina-2-1387815,"Sabrina Spellman may be the protagonist of Netflix's original series, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina , but Prudence Night is—quite obviously—the head witch in charge.
As leader of the Weird Sisters, Prudence, played by Tati Gabrielle, is the queen bee at the Academy of Unseen Arts and High Priest Father Blackwood's favorite. She is everything the lead character is not—evil and menacing, the chic and immensely beautiful wicked witch of Glendale in a little black dress and high heels. Nothing seems to bring her more pleasure than torturing mortal boys aside from, of course, tormenting Sabrina, and viewers can't get enough of the life Gabrielle breathes into the sinister role.
On Part 2 of the Netflix series, released Friday, Prudence will continue to develop in her bewitching world, although Gabrielle revealed to Newsweek her character will face some rather difficult challenges throughout the new season, particularly surrounding her relationship to Father Blackwood.
It was revealed in Part 1 that Prudence was actually the Church of Night leader's daughter. But now that he has a son, his legacy's heir, where does that leave her? Prudence's new journey to answer that may bring some changes not just within her but also in her relationship with Sabrina.
Read Newsweek's full interview with Gabrielle below.
How do you feel about Prudence as a character, after all she experienced and did in Part 1?
Prudence is growing, which is really amazing because she’s much older. For her to have such a long life and continue to grow and learn herself—in Part 2 you’ll see her discover herself more and kind of find her own place—it’s really exciting to see her character grow so much over the two seasons, and possibly see that hard shell that she’s got kinda soften a bit.
Will she have the same feelings towards Sabrina in Season 2 or will there be more of a friendship between them?
That’s a super spoiler [laughs].
Is all the harrowing over at least?
Possibly. Their relationship definitely grows. I can say that. And it goes through a few more rounds.
What about the Weird Sisters as a collective? They had a few bumps in their relationship in Part 1, will they be back to being fully aligned in Part 2?
At the end of the day, they’ve spent their entire lives together, so no matter what happens, they continue to stick together because they are their own little family. As sisters, they’ll fight, and they’ll have disagreements and butt heads, but they’ll always remain tight.
How will Prudence’s favor with Father Blackwood change, now that he has a baby?
It definitely challenges Prudence’s identity in a way. It forces her to look at him a little differently and reanalyze the situation of wanting a father figure, wanting to be claimed.
Will she still be torturing mortal boys in Season 2?
A bit, but in more fun ways.
What about love for Prudence? Sabrina has two boys checking for her, when is Prudence going to get a love interest?
I can say maybe. Just maybe.
It would probably have to take a really special person to open Prudence up.
It would have to be someone who understands her and understands why her shell is so hard.
Do you think romance with a mortal boy is out of the question for Prudence?
With the new outlook that Sabrina has presented and introduced to our witch world, I feel like at some point Prudence could be swayed to think of mortals in a different light.
Other than Pru, what character do you love to watch on the show?
By far, Madame Satan. Michelle Gomez is a queen and every time she comes on the screen I’m like, “Oh My God, Michelle, yes!” She gives me everything. She gives me life. The way that she attacks that character, and she has so much fun with it and the little quips that she does, the full-body characterization, I love it. I love Madame Satan.
We haven’t seen much interaction between Madame Satan and Prudence. Is that something we can hope to see in the future?
Hopefully. That’s my hope, that at some point I’ll get to interact with her a bit more. Other than in the first season when Prudence came to school with Sabrina, we don’t cross paths often.
How did you end up doing your own hair on the show?
I actually came to my audition with the finger waves, because I cut my hair about six months before I got the audition. They were streaking my hair all the time for The 100, and I wanted to figure out a different style to wear my hair when I wasn’t on set. So I YouTube’d videos and I learned how to do it that way. My hair naturally is curly and I felt that Prudence would have something a little sleeker and more demure at the same time. So I did the finger waves. I booked the role and when we went into hair and makeup tests they really liked the finger waves. We tried other things, but the finger waves really seemed to be the strongest look.
The hair team on Sabrina , unfortunately, wasn’t familiar with my hair type. We had runs where they would try, but they just couldn’t work it. So I just said, ""Ok, it’s fine. I can do my own hair. It’ll just make everyone’s life easier including mine."" So I literally just ended up taking the reins myself and doing it. Over time, the hair team learned a bit more, so they were able to do the back for me. If you go back and see the back of my head over the course of Season 1 you’ll see the evolution. But they worked it out. Season 2 my hair is cut and the finger waves are gone.
What do you love the most about your character?
I love Prudence’s strength and resilience. She’s not gonna take any s**t from anybody, because she’s lived a life. She’s struggled. She was an orphan and she had to find her own place in the world. The way that she overcame, she’s like, ""No, I earned my place here and I’m not gonna let anybody take that away from me."" In that way, I’ve learned a lot from Prudence and it’s helped with my self-confidence. It’s been very enlightening to play her in that aspect.
When the show first came out there were a few people who took offense to Prudence being stereotyped as the angry black woman on the cast. What was your reaction to that?
It kinda caught me off guard, because it wasn’t anything that was on my mind while filming it. I knew Prudence had more depth than that and I was going to give that to her. I always looked at the world our characters are in as this colorblind world. The only races in our world are witches and mortals. That’s the only divide that we had. I was a little—not hurt—but it saddened me that some people didn’t necessarily see the depth within her hardness. The reason why the term ""mad black woman"" was even coined was because black women struggle and sometimes it jades them and sometimes it hardens them. To put that label on someone and limit their life experience or discredit their life experience is unfair to me. I saw some things but I was like, ""No, I know Prudence and I know where she’s going.""
Describe the show in three words.
Love. Trust. Conquering.

"Where Is Roman Polanski Today? Sharon Tate’s Widow Was Convicted on Child Rape Charges, Wanted Back in U.S.",www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/where-roman-polanski-today-sharon-tates-husband-has-been-long-accused-child-1387358,"Hollywood director Roman Polanski, who was once married to Hollywood star Sharon Tate, has been accused of five cases of sexual assault against children, as of 2017 according to Vox . Polanski pled guilty to one rape charge against a then 13-year-old, Samantha Geimer in 1977, but moved to France abruptly.
Polanski has done the opposite of denied his attraction to girls and teens. He released an autobiography titled Roman , in 1985, in which he announced and explained his attraction to teens as young as age 15. He seemingly reiterated his attraction to young girls when he told Martin Ames in 1979: “Judges want to f*** young girls. Juries want to f*** young girls—everyone wants to f*** young girls!”
The director also addressed his lack of prison time, where he could have spent up to 50 years behind bars, saying he did time in prison after fleeing for France. “As far as what I did: it’s over,” Polanski said to The Guardian in 2017. “I pleaded guilty. I went to jail. I came back to the United States to do it, people forget about that, or don’t even know. I then was locked up here [in Zurich] after this festival. So in the sum, I did about four or five times more than what was promised to me.”
Past the sexual assault accusations, Polanski has been vocal about still loving Tate. She and four others were brutally murdered in her home by Charles Manson’s family in 1969. At the time, Tate was nearly nine months pregnant with Polanski’s child. She was 26 at the time of her death.
“Even after so many years, I find myself unable to watch a spectacular sunset or visit a lovely old house or experience visual pleasure of any kind without instinctively telling myself how much she would have loved it all,” he said in the book Sharon Tate Recollection , written by Tate's sister, Debra. “In these ways, I shall remain faithful to her till the day I die.”
The director explained how loved Tate was by the Hollywood community. “In those days, she was not just the love of my life, she was the love of everyone's life,” he expressed. “Sharon was more than just stunning to look at. She wasn't naïve or stupid or a cliché starlet. What had impressed me most about her, quite apart from her exceptional beauty, was the sort of radiance that springs from a kind and gentle nature.”

"Based On the Writings Of Bruce Lee, 'Warrior' Explores a Forgotten Part of Chinese-American History",www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/warrior-breathes-life-bruce-lees-vision-san-franciscos-chinatown-1384270,"Almost half a century ago, legendary martial artist Bruce Lee pitched his vision of a TV show about a Chinese man navigating America’s Old West to studio executives. The story titled Warrior —set during the brutal Tong Wars of San Francisco’s Chinatown in the second half of the late 1800s—sought to tell a vital experience in Chinese-American history that had long been forgotten and almost entirely left out of school curriculums.
As expected, Lee was told the concept couldn’t be made. The reason was simple: Hollywood just wasn’t ready for a series that featured an Asian lead. Not yet.
After Lee passed away in 1973, the treatment for Warrior sat with his daughter in a box, gathering dust for decades, waiting for its time. And then it happened; Hollywood director Justin Lin (the Fast & Furious franchise, Star Trek Beyond ), having heard myths about the long-lost project, contacted Shannon Lee to see if they were true. “Justin asked me if I had the treatment,” Lee tells Newsweek , and after reading it he said, “we should make this the way your father wanted it to be made.” To accomplish her father's vision, Lee and Lin enlisted the help of scriptwriter Jonathan Tropper ( Banshee ), and the trio banded together to give life to Warrior .
Andrew Koji as “Ah Sahm” in Cinemax's ""Warrior."" HBO/David Bloomer The gritty 10-episode historical drama series — officially greenlit by Cinemax in 2017 — follows Ah Sahm (Andrew Koji), a young martial arts prodigy who emmigrates from China to San Francisco in 1878 “under mysterious circumstances.” There, Sahm is on a mission to find a specific woman but, in doing so, quickly gets caught up in a conflict between rival Chinatown tongs, also known as organized crime syndicates. “Fundamentally it’s a show about finding yourself, it’s a Chinese-American immigrant story,” Lin tells Newsweek . “Ah Samn is a character that came from this established structured world and through his journey, he’s going to break from that.”
This story is one that refuses to shy away from exploring the history of systematic racism and persecution against Chinese immigrants in America, the dirty politics of migration and culture clashes. Though it is exactly what Bruce Lee intended, accomplishing the karate master's vision wasn’t easy.
Since U.S. history books have primarily left out tales of the Chinese experience in the post-Civil War West, the show’s creators were forced into the arduous task of piecing together the puzzle themselves through months of grueling and unorthodox research into the years before the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882.
“They didn’t keep great records and what they had kept were destroyed in the fire of 1906,” Tropper says, which meant the research process involved “a lot of going to the library — there’s not much on the internet — finding chapters in books, pieces in travelogues, case copies of legal ordinances and lawyer’s letters to the court.”
“Our intention from day one was to right the wrongs of the past.""
The creators of Cinemax's ""Warrior."" (L-R) Executive producer Justin Lin, executive producer Shannon Lee and creator and executive producer Jonathan Tropper. Shutterstock/Andrew Walker Warrior ’s not your typical Bruce Lee Kung-Fu story. It does, however, pay homage to the Jeet Kune Do inventor’s teachings. “Bruce Lee’s estate gave us a lot of license to steal pieces of choreography from his movies,” Tropper says. “For fans, there are moments in every episode where they’ll recognize a particular sequence or a bit of character, even if it’s just imitations of Bruce Lee’s swagger.”
Although Lee was notoriously marginalized by Hollywood executives, his presence in American culture has had a widespread and lasting impact on the children of his generation and even today. “There was something about Bruce Lee's presence as an Asian-American growing up, this sense of empowerment, it was profound,” Lin, whose obsession with the martial artist began at a young age, says.
Shannon Lee thinks her father’s influence can be attributed to the way he espoused and lived his philosophy. “He was a deep thinker, self-educated, he was an experimenter and a constant learner,” she says. “And because of that, he created, lived and expressed this absolutely unique signature of a human being.”
While Kung-Fu films typically portray the hero as a pure spirited warrior, this series went with a more three-dimensional approach, subverting stereotypical tropes of the genre. Rather than regurgitate a protagonist that never has sex, doesn’t give in to temptations, and shudders at alcohol, Sahm was written as a multi-faceted, textured and flawed human being.
Sahm’s complexities coincidentally also did double-duty in shattering the one-dimensional treatment of Chinese characters in American cinema. “I remember watching Westerns as a child and always seeing Chinese-Americans in the deep background,” Lin says. “I thought ‘God, these are human beings with lives, with ambitions. What were they about?’”
The shallow portrayal of Asian-Americans in Hollywood over the years had effectively narrowed the pool of actors that could play the part of Sahm; a clear indictment of the lack of diversity and Asian representation in the industry. Early stages of the casting process saw Asian-American actors enter the room expecting to do one-liners, just like any other project they had auditioned for throughout their careers. “I remember pulling them aside and saying, ‘hey man, you’re going to have to up your game. If you want to be a lead, you have to be off book,’” Lin recalls.
Hoon Lee as “Wang Chao” and Olivia Cheng as “Ah Toy” in Cinemax's ""Warrior."" HBO/David Bloomer To make Warrior the right way, the show’s casting team spent upwards of a year traveling the world in search of actors. The result is a diverse cast of not just Chinese actors, but Asian actors from multiple continents including, America, Europe and Asia (Koji, who plays Sahm, is a British Actor of mixed Japanese and English heritage.) To add to the global feel, producers opted to re-create San Francisco’s Chinatown in South Africa, so they could build a comprehensive, era-accurate set from the ground up.
While Lin acknowledges that Asian representation in Hollywood is currently having a moment, and Warrior is part of that, he fears it might not last. “I feel like ‘diversity’ has become a buzzword and it might be cool today and then something else will come,” Lin says. “But it is always important. It's always about the opportunity. And that's something that I hope we don't lose sight of.”
Still, Asian-led projects have seen a vast improvement compared to two years ago. According to a University of Southern California study , 37 of the top 100 grossing films in 2017 had no Asian characters whatsoever, despite Asians making up 5.8 percent of the total population that year.
There are projects with predominately Asian casts in the works. Crazy Rich Asians — the first movie in 25 years with an all-Asian cast — is gearing up for a sequel that will be directed by Jon M. Chu and several other major studio films featuring Asian leads are also currently in development.
""I'm get excited when talented and diverse people get to showcase who they are,"" Lin says. ""When there are opportunities like that, we all win. We'll have better stories and more interesting points of views.""
Warrior premieres on Cinemax April 5, 2019.

‘Fortnite’ Reboot Van & Cards Explained - How to Respawn in Update 8.30,www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/fortnite-reboot-van-cards-explained-how-respawn-update-830-1388093,"On 4/6/19 at 8:41 AM EDT Share Gaming Fortnite Gaming
Fortnite update 8.30 is just around the corner, and Epic has announced one of its highlight features via a Dev Update video. Using the Reboot Van and Reboot Cards, players will be able to respawn squad members by meeting certain conditions.
Fortnite ’s Reboot Van is basically an exact replica of the Banner and Beacon system from Apex Legends . When squadmates die in Fortnite , they’ll drop a limited item called a Reboot Card. Reboot Cards look like this.
You must turn in a player's dropped Reboot Card to revive them. Epic Games
Reboot Cards can then be turned in at Reboot Vans. These vans are found at several prominent locations across the Battle Royale map. Once you turn in a card, all opposing players will be alerted via visual and audio cues that a respawn has begun. Squadmates will appear individually on top of the van. After each reboot the van has a short cooldown, and teammates will spawn with very little gear.
When you activate a Reboot Van, squadmates appear on the roof. Epic Games
For those who follow Fortnite closely, the Reboot Van has been a known quantity for quite some time. Files related to the feature first appeared in the 8.0 Season 8 update at the end of February. Adding more fuel to the fire, additional data strings were featured in the 8.20 Content Update on Tuesday. At the very least, it would appear Reboot Vans have been in the works at Epic since shortly after the launch of Apex Legends . After a few months of refining the concept, it appears it’s almost ready to be unleashed on the world. The 8.30 update is also expected to include additional nerfs for the Baller as well.
Fortnite is available on PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC and mobile. The 8.30 update is expected to go live on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.

Bill Maher Rips 'Attorney General Scissorhands' for Redacting Mueller Report Before Sending it to Congress,www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/bill-maher-rips-attorney-general-scissorhands-william-barr-redacting-mueller-1388092,"While President Donald Trump has claimed that the recently completed special counsel investigation completely exonerated him, comedian Bill Maher isn't so sure and mocked Attorney General William Barr for allowing the White House to redact the full report before sending it on to Congress.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned in his approximately 400-page report to Barr on March 22, and two days later Barr provided Congress with a four-page summary that Quote: d relatively little from the Mueller original and explained that the special counsel had left open the question of whether or not Trump had illegally obstructed the investigation. However, Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded on their own that no criminal charges would be pursued.
Last week, Maher called the Barr summary and his apparent reluctance to provide the full report to lawmakers, a ""high-tech coup."" And on Friday's Real Talk , the host said he received grief for this stance — at least until subsequent reports claimed that the full contents of the Mueller investigation may be more damaging to the White House.
""Last week after the show, people were calling me, saying, 'Bill, you really kinda went apesh*t there, doubling down on 'Trump is a traitor' even after the Mueller report came out.'"" said Maher during his opening monologue. ""Well, apesh*t doesn't look that bad this week.""
""Mueller's team started to leak this week, to say that the report was a lot worse than we thought,"" he continued, ""and Attorney General Scissorhands didn't let us see the real deal. And he's still busy redacting... by the time we see this, it's gonna be covered in more black ink than the governor of Virginia in 1984.""
The host sarcastically expressed a bit of hope that the attorney general might ultimately reveal the full contents of the Mueller report.
""It could be that Barr winds up doing what James Comey did at — remember the Hillary investigation? He comes out and says, 'Even though Hillary didn't do anything criminal, here's every little thing Hillary did wrong,'"" expIained Maher. ""I have a feeling Barr might do the same thing. He might come out and say, 'Even though what Trump did isn't criminal... Here's every little thing Hillary did wrong.""
Earlier this week, both the New York Times and Washington Post reported, citing anonymous sources, that Barr's summary of the Mueller investigation may not be an accurate representation of investigators' findings.
A person familiar with the probe told The Times that Mueller’s office had never requested that Barr release the report so soon. Two officials with knowledge of Barr’s thinking suggested that in writing his summary, Barr was cautious about deviating from a Justice Department practice to “not disclose derogatory details in closing an investigation,” The Times reported.

Why Trump's approval ratings barely budge | Opinion,www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/trump-approval-rating-mueller-shutdown-2020-1387436,"Why Trump's Approval Ratings Barely Budge | Opinion Frank Donatelli On 4/6/19 at 8:10 AM EDT Share Opinion
The two most discussed political stories of 2019 are, first, the longest federal government shutdown ever and second, the release of the “Top Line” findings of the long-awaited Mueller report. The first saw strong daily criticism of the Trump Administration from all quarters, over the president’s promise to “own” the shutdown. The second provided a substantial morale boost to the president and his supporters for the finding of “no collusion” from Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But there was one common denominator to both stories: The president’s approval rating barely budged. According to the political site “Real Clear Politics” which averages all of the publically available presidential polls, the president’s approval rating as of early April stands at 43.7 percent with 52.8 disapproval. All polls included were completed after Attorney General William Barr released his summary letter. President Trump and his allies have claimed vindication in speeches and media appearances across the country. Yet for all polls averaged by RCP for the first two weeks of March, ten days prior to Barr’s announcement, presidential approval stood at 42.8 percent, less than a 1 percent change even after the president’s best media week in memory. Additional surveys through Wednesday (April 3) show the president holding steady at slightly over 42 percent.
The shutdown of the federal government lasted over a month, from December 22, 2018 until January 25 of this year. As noted, the president took incoming fire from all quarters as large majorities of Americans opposed the shutdown. Yet the average of 28 surveys taken during that time revealed presidential approval of 41.6 percent. So the spread between the worst presidential news cycle and the very best ten days after the Barr announcement was 2.1 percent. Maybe the public isn’t paying attention. That would be troubling and unlikely, given the undeniable importance to the country of both stories. But maybe there’s something else involved. Maybe most Americans have already made up their minds about the president. The election outcome is unresolved, but these poll results offer important clues as to how each party will conduct their campaign efforts in the coming 20 months. For the Republicans, their candidate is seeking reelection and reelections are always first about the incumbent. If the public likes the body of work, they will win. Most incumbents do win reelection, as have recent presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Barack Obama. Losing incumbents were not selling what the public wanted. Jimmy Carter was a victim of oil embargos and hostages. George H. W. Bush was running at the end of a 12-year Republican cycle and voters were looking for change. Trump’s approval numbers are not good. However, as the surveys indicate, he has a rock-solid base that will stick with him regardless of events and circumstances, and he begins the race with the largest group of supporters of anyone. He’s already indicated his intent to double down on tried and true issues to boost support from groups that strongly favor him, such as older white voters, gun owners, evangelicals, and Republicans. His campaign will seek to expand the electorate vertically, not horizontally. Look for a continued heavy emphasis on the threats from mass immigration and unbridled free trade. He is also counting on a strong economy and his conservative judicial selections as “promises fulfilled.” The campaign’s policy wonks will be dwarfed in number by micro targeters, bloggers, and social influencers. Democrats face a strategic choice: Will they go for an expanded electorate horizontally, by appealing to moderate centrist voters or will they go vertically, and double down on the progressive activists that dominate the leadership of the party? All candidates will be making their “electability” case, but will have different tactical objectives and target voter groups depending on their strategic outlook. Former VP Joe Biden leads early national surveys of Democrats and defeats the president in key battleground states. However, this may be the product of higher voter ID. His ideological opposite, Bernie Sanders, also does well in these states, though not as well as Biden. In a good development for Democrats, even the lesser-known candidates run well against the president. Democrats have a bigger voter pool (50 percent plus of voters who disapprove of the president’s job performance) but bringing all such voters under one umbrella will be a challenge. No candidate is perfect and the reelect team will find weaknesses in whichever Democrat emerges. A race against a nameless Democrat will not be the same as one against a real candidate with strengths and weaknesses. Democrats need only look to the scars from the primary campaign in 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders that never fully healed. That opening allowed Trump to win a large number of voters who disapproved of him but disliked Clinton even more. It says here that high propensity voting centrists should be easier to win than lower intensity progressives. The Democratic candidates’ early focus on extra constitutional proposals such as court packing (rejected even by Franklin Roosevelt Democrats) and the abolition of the electoral college, and out of the policy mainstream measures like reparations and abolishing private health insurance, will make it more difficult for Democrats to ultimately win moderate voters looking for a change of direction, but not a constitutional rewrite. Past successful national Democrats (Carter, Clinton, Obama) have combined soaring rhetoric for reconciliation and a better future with enough specific policy proposals aimed squarely at making life better for the crucial middle class who feel squeezed by economic circumstance. Such voters might also be looking for a candidate that offers more cooperation rather than confrontation. A majority of Americans will be open to looking at the out party’s candidate and promises. Democrats will argue for a change in direction. Republicans will contend the Democrats’ change is too radical. Voters will be hearing it all—for the next twenty months.

The sixth weekend of the MLS season sees the two conference leaders go head-to-head, as D.C. United host Los Angeles FC.
Suggesting the game is an MLS Cup preview might be premature given the season is only five games old, but few would be surprised if these two sides were to feature prominently in the postseason.
Here’s everything you need to know ahead of this weekend’s clash. When and where is the game?
D.C. United returns to play in front of its fans after a successful trip to Orlando last week. For Los Angeles FC, meanwhile, this weekend’s outing marks a second consecutive road game and a first visit to Audi Field.
Kick-off is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET on Saturday, April 6. TV info
The game will be broadcast on FOX in English and on FOX Deportes in Spanish, as well as via the FOX Sports Go app. The game will also be streamed live on FuboTV and SlingTV. Odds
There's been little to choose from so far between the two sides and the bookmakers expect a very close game.
According to OddsShark, D.C. United is a +127 favorite, while Los Angeles FC is at +190 and the draw has slightly longer odds at +272. The over/under bar, meanwhile, is set at 3. Recent form
Both teams arrive into the weekend top of their respective conferences, albeit only by virtue of goal difference in D.C. United’s case. The Black and Red have won three of their four games so far and lead the Eastern Conference with 10 points.
With nine goals scored and just one conceded, D.C. United has the second-most prolific attack in the conference and the meanest defense in the league.
Wayne Rooney has already scored four times this season, including a spectacular goal in the 2-1 win in Orlando last week. Keeping the former Manchester United captain quiet will be high on the list of priorities for Bob Bradley’s men.
Los Angeles’ form has been similarly impressive and it sits atop the Western Conference with 13 points after four wins and a draw in five games.
The Black and Gold have been on fire offensively, scoring an average of three goals a game so far.
If Rooney has set the tone for D.C. United, Carlos Vela has done even better for his side, scoring six times in the first five games of the campaign.
Last week, the Mexican netted a hat-trick as Los Angeles thrashed San Jose' 5-0 away from home. Series record

"NCAA Final Four Brackets 2019: Where to Watch, Live Stream, Which Teams Are in It",www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/final-four-ncaa-march-madness-bracket-2019-virginia-michigan-state-texas-tech-1385897,"After two weeks and four round of games, the Final Four field for the NCAA men's basketball tournament has been set.
Virginia, Auburn, Texas Tech and Michigan State are the only four teams left of the 68 that entered March Madness, and one of them will be crowned national champion on Monday.
The Final Four gets underway on Saturday. Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the weekend.
When and where is the Final Four? The final act of the NCAA Tournament takes place at the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The National semifinals are scheduled for Saturday, April 6 with Virginia taking on Auburn at 6:09 p.m. ET, followed by Michigan State’s game against Texas Tech at 8:49 p.m. ET.
The National Championship Game tips off at 9:23 p.m. on Monday, April 8.
Where to watch the Final Four Both games will be broadcast live on CBS and will also be shown live on the NCAA’s website . Live streams will also be available via FuboTV, Sling TV, Hulu, YouTube TV and PlayStation Vue.
Which teams are in it? Virginia, Auburn, Texas Tech and Michigan State.
The Cavaliers are the only number one seed left in the tournament after beating Purdue in overtime on Saturday to secure a Final Four ticket for the first time since 1984, and only the third time in their history.
Last year, Virginia became the first number one seed to ever lose to a number 16 seed in the opening round, Tony Bennett’s men are desperate to put that disappointment behind them.
The Cavaliers entered the tournament as the fourth-favorites to win the title but are now the bookmakers’ pick, largely by virtue of having the meanest defense in the tournament, which has conceded a meager 55.4 points per game so far.
Michigan State arrives into the Final Four as the second favorite but has arguably secured the biggest scalp of all so far in the tournament.
The Spartans beat number one overall seed Duke 68-67 in the Elite Eight to secure a first trip to the Final Four since 2015 and their 10 th overall.
Eight of those Final Four spots have come under Tom Izzo’s stewardship and his experience could be crucial in the cauldron that is the final stage of an NCAA Tournament.
The 64-year-old led the Spartans to their second and so far last title in 2000 and will be hoping to add another one to his collection.
Auburn and Texas Tech, meanwhile, are making their debut Final Four appearances, but both have shown a knack for upsetting the odds.
The Tigers have knocked out number four seed Kansas, number one seed North Carolina and number two seed Kentucky on their way to Minneapolis.
The Red Raiders, meanwhile, eliminated number two seed Michigan in the Sweet 16, then sent number one seed Gonzaga packing in the Elite Eight.

March Madness 2019 Predictions: Odds for Every Team in the Final Four,www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/march-madness-odds-ncaa-final-four-virginia-michigan-state-auburn-texas-tech-1384692,"March Madness has entered its final stretch. Of the 64 teams that entered the NCAA Tournament, only four are still standing.
Virginia is the only number one seed left in the tournament. It's now the bookmakers’ favorite to win the national title, after reaching the Final Four for the first time since 1984 and for only the third time in its history.
Bovada has the Cavaliers as a +150 favorite to win the tournament.
Should Virginia triumph on Monday, it would be a true redemption story, coming just a year after the Cavaliers became the first number one seed to be knocked out by a number 16 seed.
Having made light work of Gardner-Webb and Oklahoma in the first two rounds, Virginia was pushed all the way by Oregon in the Sweet 16 and needed overtime to beat Purdue in the Elite Eight.
If the Cavaliers are the favorite to win the title, its opponent on Saturday sits at the opposite end of the spectrum. A number five seed, Auburn is the lowest-ranked team of the Final Four participants and at +600 it has the longest odds.
The Tigers, however, have shown a knack for upsetting the odds so far on the way to making the Final Four for the first time in their history.
Auburn has knocked off number four seed Kansas, number one seed North Carolina and number two seed Kentucky on its way to the Final Four.
The absence of Chuma Okeke is a major blow, however, given the sophomore forward was the Tigers’ third most prolific scorer.
Auburn will need all the firepower it can summon on Saturday, as Virginia boasts the meanest defense in the tournament, conceding a meagre 55.4 points per game.
On the other side of the bracket, Michigan State enters the final weekend of March Madness as the second-favorite to win the national title. The Spartans’ odds stand at +185 and few would bet against them, particularly after their 68-67 win against Duke in the Elite Eight .
Knocking off the number one overall seed saw Michigan State punch a ticket to the Final Four for the first time since 2015 and the 10 th overall—the most of the remaining teams.
While the win against Duke was considered a surprise because of the Blue Devils’ form, the Spartans had barely broken sweat in the first three rounds, as they dispatched Bradley, Minnesota and LSU.
Like Auburn, Texas Tech is also making its Final Four debut and, like Auburn, it doesn’t have the bookmakers on its side. However, while the Red Raiders are +425 to claim a first national title, opponents will underestimate them at their peril.
Texas Tech trounced number two seed Michigan in the Sweet 16 and then eliminated number one seed Gonzaga in the Elite Eight.

'Time For Ilhan' Documentary Maker Says Rep. Ilhan Omar Has What It Takes To Lead—But She Can Never Become President,www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/time-ilhan-documentary-maker-says-ilhan-omar-has-what-it-takes-lead-she-can-1387186,"""Are you president now?""
As Ilhan Omar helps her three children get ready for the day, that is the question on her youngest daughter's mind in the opening moments of a documentary following Omar's swift political rise.
""President of this house?"" Omar laughs. ""Yes.""
""My mom is president,"" her daughter responds.
At the time this scene was filmed in 2016 for the documentary Time for Ilhan , Omar had yet to become a household name, and was making her first run at public office, successfully vying for a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives.
Fast forward three years later, however, and Omar, a 37-year-old mother of three who came to America as a refugee, has made headlines across the country and around the world as the first Somali-American, first African-born American, and one of the first two Muslim American women to serve in the U.S. Congress.
But, as Norah Shapiro, the director behind Time For Ilhan, noted in an interview with Newsweek, one thing Omar can never become, under current U.S. laws, is the very thing her daughter envisioned her to be: president.
""There is something special about her,"" Shapiro, who left a decade-long career as a public defender to pursue documentary filmmaking, said. Within minutes of meeting Omar, Shapiro said she knew the young candidate was ""somebody special.""
""I think it's the same thing that you're seeing by tens of thousands, which is [that] there's something about her that is disarmingly direct and disarmingly human. She does not comport and carry herself like your typical politician...She's very funny and she's very real,"" Shapiro said. ""And I've seen this not only in my own reactions with her, but as I'm standing behind the camera as a fly on the wall or traveling with her or any number of things, she connects with people in a way that is very special.""
In addition, Shapiro said, Omar's ""view of elected politics and why she running and what she was running for and what she was running against was incredibly important and compelling...That's what motivated me [to make this documentary].""
However, despite having what it takes to lead, Shapiro said, ""unless the Constitution of the United States gets changed,"" Omar's rising star could never reach the top job in the White House ""because Ilhan is not American-born.""
""While she is 100 percent American, we do have laws in this country that require the president to have been born in the United States,"" Shapiro said.
Omar, who was born as the youngest of seven siblings in Somalian capital Mogadishu in 1981 and saw her mother pass away when she was just two-years-old, fled Somalia with her family during the Civil War. She spent four years at a refugee camp in Kenya before arriving in the U.S. in 1995.
The Minnesota politician started her political career off by managing city council campaigns before going on to work as a senior policy aide for politicians in the state.
She saw her first major political success in the 2016 state assembly race documented in Time for Ilhan, which saw her unseat a 44-year incumbent to join the state's legislature.
Then, in the November 2018 elections, Omar rocked the political world once again by becoming, along Michigan's Rashida Tlaib, one of the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress.
The country, and indeed the world, still has yet to see how far Omar's star might rise. However, Article II of the Constitution states that ""no person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States...shall be eligible to the office of President,"" which imposes a clear limit on her aspirations.
While Shapiro said she believes Omar has the makings of a great leader, she said the Minnesota politician herself does not appear to oppose the limitations enforced by the Constitution, even if they set a ceiling on her own political ambitions.
""It's interesting. Ilhan and I did an interview with a local reporter after one of our screenings and the reporter asked her if she thought that that rule was unfair or if it should be changed and I thought she was going to say one thing and she surprised, I think both of us, myself and the reporter, and she said 'No',"" Shapiro said. ""She thought that was appropriate that that law is appropriate and she was in support of it, which I thought was really interesting.""
Shapiro herself said that she also was not ""sad"" knowing there is a constitutionally imposed cap on Omar's ambitions.
""Before making this film, I would say I fit in the category of people who are fairly cynical or a bit pessimistic about politics in this country and I definitely have come out on the other side feeling much more optimistic about the possibilities,"" she said. ""But, the caveat on that is, I would say that is about what is possible at the local level, at the grassroots level.""
""I am very interested in politics obviously, but, the money in politics that plays out at the national level and in particular at the presidential level leaves me a little cold,"" she said.
As a result, Shapiro said she was ""not sad about Ilhan, at least at this point in time, being someone who is ineligible to run for president and I think there are incredible ways for her to be effective...at presenting her local constituency and even at the national and international level.""
Already, Shapiro noted, Omar is ""at the epicenter of some really important questions that actually occupy the international arena...love it or hate it.""
Noting the recent controversy around some of Omar's heated language on Israel, Shapiro said that as a Jewish director herself, she believed that ""there were some reactions that I thought were appropriate and she was held accountable in some ways that I thought were right."" But other reactions, the documentarian said were ""vile, vitriolic"" attacks that Shapiro said were ""very, very much central"" to Omar's identity.
""I had my own issues with some of the language she used and I was very clear about that, but, at the same time, I think that she's asking really, really important crucial vital questions,"" Shapiro said. And, she said: ""I think there is abhorrent Islamaphobia and racism involved in a lot of the vile, vitriolic stuff that she is subjected to.""
The film director said she had been targeted on social media simply for having made a documentary about Omar.
""What I can say is I have received my share of trolls and garbage on social media too and my only point about that is that that's a tiny little fraction of the kind of crap that Ilhan is exposed to.""
Still, ""the thing that impresses me the most is to watch Ilhan conduct herself,"" Shapiro said. ""I've heard her say the Michelle Obama phrase, 'when they go low, we go high,' and I do see her responding consistently with graciousness and staying on point.""
Shapiro said that while the Constitution sets limits on politicians like Omar — for now — she hopes that younger generations will watch Time For Ilhan and leave inspired to pursue their own ambitions, political or not.
""My heart's desire,"" the documentarian said, ""is that there will be future Ilhans who see the film, who either haven't thought of themselves in that position, or who have thought about it, but think there are too many barriers in place, will think to themselves, 'you know what, I can do this'.""
For those without political ambitions, she hopes that the documentary will serve as proof of ""something important, positive and productive"" in politics and inspire generations ""to take action,"" vote ""and be optimistic about what's possible in participatory democracy.""

"President Trump on Immigrants who Scale Dangerous, Sharp-Edged Border Wall: You 'Deserve Whatever You Can Get'",www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/president-trump-immigrants-who-scale-dangerous-sharp-edged-border-wall-you-1387962,"President Donald Trump, only a day after walking back his pledge to shut all ports of entry along the country's border to Mexico, visited U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in California, where he seemed to challenge immigrants to scale the fencing and walls along the border.
Trump spent Friday afternoon in Calexico, California, located on the border with Mexico, across from the much larger city of Mexicali. According to the Washington Post , the president was on hand to visit a new two-mile section of border fencing. However, the new structure is not part of Trump's often-promised wall. Rather, notes the Post , it is a long-planned replacement for older fencing in that area.
While looking at the fencing, Trump made comments that appeared to both tout the structure's integrity and challenge immigrants who attempt to scale it.
“If you want to climb that, it's pretty sharp up on top, too,"" said the president, according to CNN . ""If you want to climb that then you deserve whatever you can get, but it’s very, very hard. It’s meant anti-climb. It’s called anti-climb, so it’s a great wall and… I think it looks fantastic — very see-through, so you’re able to see the other side, which is a very important element.""
While the president may think a sharp-edged wall would deter illegal border crossings, immigrants have long risked their health and lives to enter the U.S. at various points along its shared border with Mexico.
Harvard professor Ieva Jusionyte wrote in the book Threshold about her experiences working as an emergency medical technician (EMT) on both sides of the U.S. border with Mexico.
In an excerpt published in The Atlantic , Jusionyte recalls tending to a woman injured while attempting to scale a border fence.
""She had climbed a ladder on the other side of the steel border wall, but was unable to hold on to the structure and fell down from a height of about 24 feet,"" she writes of the woman who had broken both legs in the fall. ""We were told that she had been lying there for two hours when a Border Patrol agent found her.""

Even without border fencing, the combinations of dessert conditions and dangerous water crossings results in hundreds of migrant fatalities per year. According to 2017 data from International Organization for Migration , the Pima County, Arizona, office of the Medical Examiner, reported an average of more than 160 dead ""undocumented border crossers"" each year between 2010 and 2016.
Both Jusionyte and IOM pointed to a policy known as ""prevention through deterrence"" as a culprit in the growing number of injured and dead migrants in recent decades. This strategy, put in place in 1994 by President Bill Clinton, focused immigration enforcement on population centers, effectively shunting migrants off to more harsh, remote crossings. In more urban areas, the fences got taller and more difficult to scale.
""The shifting design of the border fence produces particular forms of injuries: The sharp edges on top of the previous fence, made of corrugated sheet metal left over from the Vietnam War, amputated limbs; the tall, slatted steel wall we have today fractures legs and ankles,"" writes Jusionyte, who said that EMTs in Arizona border towns were repeatedly called out to deal with migrants injured from falls and began referring to the area as ""ankle alley.”

I couldn't find any circuit design that works for 6 leds ,so I'll be happy if you help me out. power source 5v2a, I have 555 timeric and bunch of common transistors and resistors tnx Re: efficient led driver circuit? Hi, How much heat do you expect? 10mA per LED should be sufficient. With about 2V at the LED, then the remaining voltage at the resistor is about 3V. This generates about 30mW of heat ... you barely can feel this. Klaus Please don´t contact me via PM, because there is no time to respond to them. No friend requests.

Klaus thanks for the reply, I don't know much about electrics, there are 6 leds and honestly I don't know how to put them together, In parallel or series? I configured into 3 groups of parallel and in each 2leds in series , one 10 ohm resistor at the end, is this ok? Re: efficient led driver circuit? why 6 leds? are you using them as indicators for something? you have 5V output, one led to indicate 5V is on/off needs one resistor and one led 2V across the led, 3V across the resistor, at 10 mA means you need a 300 ohm resistor 300 ohm is a standard value. if you're building is by hand, get a 1/4 watt so its easy to handle. 1 members found this post helpful. 16 Re: efficient led driver circuit? With a 555 you could build a current regulated boost converter. Fairly simple as custom power design goes but it is custom power design. Off-the-shelf LED controllers can be found that are designed for exactly with with an application circuit you can copy. Note that Linear LED driving can be fairly efficient if you can minimize the linear drop by putting the right number of LED's in series. For example if your LED's really are 2V with 5V you can drive 2 in series dropping 1V across a linear current source. That's 80% efficient with no switching needed. 1 members found this post helpful.

European Union says German carmakers colluded on emissions technology,ednews.net,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/sience/361387-european-union-says-german-carmakers-colluded-on-emissions-technology,"1 2 3 4 5 European Union says German carmakers colluded on emissions technology A- A A+
The European Union has accused German carmakers of colluding together in a cartel in a bid to withhold technology aimed at reducing harmful emissions.
VW group (Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche), BMW and Daimler acted illegally by working together to delay introducing two emissions reducing technology, the European Commission said on Friday.
Findings from a preliminary inquiry concluded that all of them held a so-called “circle of five” meetings to rig competition in emissions technology.
""We are concerned that this is what happened in this case,"" said EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Friday.
“As a result, European consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology”.
The Commission said that one of the technologies was made to filter emissions in petrol cars, while the other would have cut harmful nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel cars.
""Restricting competition on innovation for these two emission cleaning systems ... denied consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars,"" the EU competitions regulator said in a statement.
A BMW statement said it would earmark a sum ""which is likely to exceed one billion euros"" against potential fines, while adding that it ""will contest the EU Commission's allegations with all legal means if necessary.""
A spokeswoman from Daimler, which makes Mercedes-Benz cars, told news agency AFP the firm was aware of the report but had already been cooperating with investigators and ""does not expect to receive a fine in this matter"".
Volksawgen’s VW Group said it would not comment until a later date.
It is unclear as to what the punishment could be, but it is likely that a large fine could be slapped onto the carmakers accused of collusion.
Daimler was given a €2.93 billion fine in 2016 for 14 years of collusion over fixed prices.
Germany’s car makers have taken a reputational hit after the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal, in which the firm admitted to rigging millions of diesel cars to cheat emissions tests.

Evolution Government Culture Science Technology Economic Growth Liberalism Biology Social Institutions Book Reviews Incremental, bottom-up, trial-and-error innovation yields moral progress, superior technologies, and greater wealth. Top-down mandates from centralized authorities are more likely to produce ethical disasters, technological stagnation, and persistent poverty. ""Bad news is man-made, top-down, purposed stuff, imposed on history,"" Matt Ridley writes in The Evolution of Everything . ""Good news is accidental, unplanned, emergent stuff that gradually evolves.""
Ridley, a British journalist who has written extensively about science, economics, and technological progress, begins by explaining the fundamentals of biological evolution by natural selection: Biological complexity evolves through random mutation followed by non-random survival. Ridley then argues that the Darwinian process is a ""special theory of evolution"" embedded in a more ""general theory of evolution that applies to much more than biology.""
Decentralized evolution by trial and error, Ridley asserts, is the chief way improvements have emerged in all sorts of human endeavor, including ""morality, the economy, culture, language, technology, cities, firms, education, history, law, government, God, money, and society."" As the 18th century Scottish philosopher Adam Ferguson argued, these phenomena are the result of human action but not of human design. By book's end, Ridley has adeptly dismantled all forms of creationism, divine and progressive.
Consider the evolution of culture. More and more, cultural anthropologists have come to accept the view that—to quote a recent paper in Behavioral and Brain Sciences —""human cultural groups have all the key attributes of a Darwinian evolutionary system."" As Ridley explains, ""Our habits and our institutions, from language to cities, are constantly changing, and the mechanism of change turns out to be surprisingly Darwinian: it is gradual, undirected, mutational, inexorable, combinatorial, selective and in some vague sense progressive.""
One example: the institution of marriage. As our hunter-gatherer ancestors evolved into herders and farmers, polygamy became more common, since some men could now accumulate the resources needed to support and defend more than one woman and their progeny. However, polygamy has a big downside: Male sexual competition produces lots of violence. While some 80 percent of the distinct cultures identified by anthropologists still sanction polygamy, monogamy is by far now the most common form of marriage. Why?
The University of British Columbia anthropologist Joseph Henrich and his colleagues argue that societies that adopted normative monogamy increased their social solidarity and trust, thus enhancing ""the competitive success of the polities, nations and religions that adopted this cultural package."" The upshot is that in the modern world, cultures where polygamy still thrives tend to be marginalized, poor, and violent. Henrich and his colleagues also speculate that ""the peculiar institutions of monogamous marriage may help explain why democratic ideals and notions of equality and human rights first emerged in the West."" This egalitarian impulse, interestingly, may be behind the evolving inclination toward including same-sex unions in the institution of marriage.
What about the evolution of economics? Prior to the 18th century, top-down extraction of wealth by elites from hapless serfs and peasants was the nearly universal form of economic and political organization among settled societies. The result was persistent and pervasive poverty. As the University of Groningen economist Angus Maddison has shown, economic growth proceeded at the stately pace of less than 0.1 percent per year in Western Europe for more than 18 centuries, rising in constant dollars from $425 per capita in AD 1 to $1,200 in 1820.
Toward the end of that period, a socioeconomic mutation—market liberalism—arose in Britain and the Netherlands. As it spread around the world, the mutation proved highly advantageous to the societies that accepted some degree of it, enabling them to prosper. This ""great enrichment,"" as the University of Illinois at Chicago economist Deirdre McCloskey calls it, boosted average incomes 10- to 20-fold in those countries where it took hold.
Ridley cites entrepreneur Nick Hanauer and economist Eric Beinhocker, who suggest that unfettered commerce is ""best understood as an evolutionary system, constantly creating and trying out new solutions to problems in a similar way to how evolution works in nature. Some solutions are 'fitter' than others. The fittest survive and propagate. The unfit die."" The consequence of competition is constant innovation, which the economist Joseph Schumpeter neatly summarized as ""creative destruction."" After accounting for the contributions of labor and capital, economist Robert Solow calculated that nearly 90 percent of the improvements in living standards is due to technological progress.
How about technological evolution? ""Biology and technology in the end boil down to systems of information...and both evolve by trial and error,"" writes Ridley. ""Technology is in [a] sense a continuation of biological evolution—an imposition of informational order on a random world.""
Every technology is built by recombining earlier technologies. Ridley makes the arresting but persuasive claim that, far more often than not, ""scientific breakthroughs [are] the effect, not the cause, of technological change."" In other words, technologists' tools are what enable basic researchers to uncover nature's secrets. One modest example is the invention of the microscope in the 1590s by a Dutchman, Zacharias Jansen, who made spectacles for a living. Another is the automated gene sequencer introduced in 1987 by Applied Biosystems, which paved the way for the Human Genome Project.
Ridley also suggests that scientific central planning, especially in the form of public funding of research, poses problems. In 2015, for example, the Institute for International Economics found that research and development in ""the business sector had high social returns, and hence contributed to growth, but there was no evidence in this analysis of positive effects from government R&D."" It would be really surprising if government R&D did not help give birth to some technological breakthroughs—nuclear power and the Internet leap to mind. Still, a 2014 paper published in PLOS Medicine estimated that 85 percent of research resources are wasted.
What's more, a 2015 study in PLOS Biology alarmingly suggested that half of all preclinical research is irreproducible. Replication and cumulative knowledge production are cornerstones of the scientific process. This means that in the U.S. about $19 billion in annual public biomedical research funding is, arguably, squandered.
And then there is the evolution of government. States emerged from protection rackets in which a gang monopolizing violence demanded payment of goods and services—taxes—in exchange for promises to defend local farmers and artisans from predation by rival gangs. ""Tudor monarchs and the Taliban are cut from exactly the same cloth,"" Ridley provocatively claims.
But two or three centuries ago, the fractured polities of Western Europe provided an open, speculative space where novel ideas about property rights, free trade, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and limits on government could mutate and grow. Where those bottom-up conceptual ideas took hold, technological innovation sped forward, incomes rose, and civil liberties were recognized.
Once established, liberal societies are veritable evolution machines that frenetically generate new mutations and swiftly recombine them to produce a vast array of products, services, and social institutions that enable ever more people to flourish. So far liberal societies are outcompeting—in the sense of being richer and more appealing—those polities that are closer to the original protection rackets."

It has been ten years since John Travolta and Kelly Preston experienced every parent’s nightmare when their son Jett died unexpectedly at age 16.
Just a few days before what would have been Jett’s 27th birthday, Preston paid tribute to her beloved son and celebrated other children who also have autism in an emotional Instagram post.
In the touching black and white photograph shared by the actress, 56, late Friday, Jett beams as he lays between his two parents in a big bed and they both kiss him on the cheek.
“To my sweet love, Jett… you are in our hearts forever,” Preston lovingly wrote in the caption.
“I send love to all of the beautiful autistic children and the wonderful people who love them. May we all shine and grant love and respect to children with special needs” she added, along with hashtag acknowledging April is Autism Awareness Month.
RELATED: John Travolta’s 16-Year-Old Son Dies
Jett died in January 2009 while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas. The teen had hit his head on a bathtub after suffering a seizure at his family’s vacation home at the Old Bahama Bay Hotel on Grand Bahama Island.
Prior to his death, his famous parents chose to keep his disorder private, however, they have since spoken out about his autism and other medical conditions.
In 2003, Preston revealed that Jett had Kawasaki Syndrome — a condition typically associated with inflammation of the arteries — when he was 2 years old.
Preston, who also said Jett suffered from asthma, blamed household cleaners, fertilizers and pesticides for causing her son’s autism disorder and lobbied for more detailed labeling on chemical products.

Throughout Jett’s life, his parents always spoke highly of their first-born, referring to him as “the most wonderful son two parents could ever ask for.”
In 1994, Travolta told PEOPLE how much he loved fatherhood. “I can’t imagine what life would be like without Jett,” he heartbreakingly said, 15 years before his son’s untimely death.

“Innovation”: the latest GOP smokescreen on climate-change policy,www.vox.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/1/4/18166400/republicans-climate-change-innovation-policy,"Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) explains how handouts to fossil fuel companies spur innovation. William B. Plowman/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images The politics of climate change are shifting against the GOP. Polling shows that majorities of Republicans accept that climate change is a problem and support steps to address it. It is mainly the stubborn core of far-right conservatives, mostly older white men, that still rejects reality altogether. It’s a crucial juncture for the party. There are two ways it could go. The first is a good-faith search for conservative-friendly climate solutions. A handful of Republicans have taken this route, supporting a bill called the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act , introduced in the House in November and (in a slightly different form) the Senate earlier this month . It would implement a $15 carbon tax, rising at $10 a year, with all the revenue returned as per-capita dividends, aiming to reduce US carbon emissions 40 percent within 10 years and 90 percent by 2050. It’s a credible, ambitious climate effort. It’s got two Republican co-sponsors in the House and one in the Senate. The problem is that most GOP funders and elected officials remain devoted to the cause of protecting fossil fuels, and protecting fossil fuels is, by definition, incommensurate with serious action on climate change. So most of the party’s prominent figures have opted for the second route: bullshitting. In some cases, it’s just an incoherent pastiche. For a particularly pungent example, check out this December op-ed from Holman Jenkins Jr. , the longtime Wall Street Journal editorialist. Another recent rhetorical gambit from Republicans is a retreat from “climate change is a hoax” to “we don’t know how much humans contribute,” which, as I wrote recently , is just another way of denying the science. (There is much uncertain in climate science, but human contribution is not part of it. We are definitely causing global warming.) And when science denial becomes sufficiently untenable, the final line of defense, now as ever, is economic: Anything government does to counter climate change will just mess up the economy and cost taxpayers money. Recently, the American Action Forum — run by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was once head of the CBO under G.W. Bush and a reasonably respected conservative wonk — produced a “ study ” of what the Green New Deal resolution would cost. The resolution contains no actual policies, mind you, so the “study” was ludicrous guesswork from top to bottom, producing the Austin-Powers sounding price tag of $93 trillion. However, with clean energy technologies so visibly booming, coal so visibly dying, and the Green New Deal in the headlines, a purely negative message is not enough. GOP “moderates,” the ones who still want to appear on Meet the Press , need some kind of positive message. It won’t be a carbon tax, at least not for the bulk of the party, at least not any time soon. As right-wing lobbyist and ideological enforcer Grover Norquist says , the vast bulk of elected Republicans are against it. So what can the positive message be, then? The answer, it seems, is “innovation.” What “innovation” means to the GOP As The Hill recently noted , a growing number of Republicans have “settled on innovation as their primary position to counter progressive Democrats” on climate change. Innovation “has a critical role,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) said. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) told Fox News Sunday in November, “What the US needs to do is participate in a long-term conversation about how you get to innovation, and it’s going to need to be a conversation again that doesn’t start with alarmism.” Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), current chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, wrote a New York Times op-ed called “ Cut Carbon Through Innovation, Not Regulation .” The US has reduced emissions recently not through “punishing regulations, restrictive laws or carbon taxes,” he writes, “but because of innovation and advanced technology, especially in the energy sector.” He touts “investment, invention, and innovation.” There’s no arguing: These are nice words. You’d be hard pressed to find an analyst in any field of economic policy who is against invention and innovation. Indeed, I have trouble recalling a single articulation of the anti-innovation position (though I’m open to correction). But in the remainder of the op-ed, Barrasso — who has a lifetime score of 8 percent from the League of Conservation Voters — reveals what he means, and as climate policy, it is ... unimpressive. Rather than taxes, regulation, or legislation, Barrasso is eager to offer subsidies to the nuclear industry. He also wants to subsidize various uses for carbon dioxide captured from fossil fuel combustion — like enhanced oil recovery, which uses CO2 to force more oil out of the ground. (Needless to say, Barrasso is not among the co-sponsors on any carbon tax bill.) That’s it. There’s not so much as a mention of whether these particular subsidies to large energy incumbents might produce the emission reductions needed, or any emission reductions at all. And Barrasso frames them as an alternative to policies that cost taxpayers money — as though subsidies are free. Most recently, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced a counter-resolution in the House to the Green New Deal, called the Green Real Deal. The #GreenRealDeal is a love letter to America’s innovators. We can solve climate change through innovation, not regulation. https://t.co/GD976T1fVQ — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) April 3, 2019 It isn’t a climate policy. Like Paul Ryan’s infamous child-poverty initiative , it is an attempt to repackage familiar conservative policies — in this case, sporadic subsidies to favored industries, along with a promise of deregulation — under a fresh label. This is such bull***t. First it was a hoax. Then the science was uncertain. Then we were “alarmists.” Then any fix was too expensive.Now it will be fixed with “innovation.” https://t.co/srnhavvTSm — Sheldon Whitehouse (@SenWhitehouse) January 2, 2019 Taking innovation seriously The Washington Post’s indispensable Catherine Rampell points out one key bit of incoherence in this position: “Taxing carbon is exactly how you get faster innovation . That’s kinda the point.” And that’s true — but we should go further. The fact is, we have driven innovation in a number of clean-energy technologies, including solar panels . We know how to do it. And it involves more than carbon taxes (and random subsidies). As carbon policy expert Hal Harvey (head of Energy Innovation and co-author of a recent book on effective climate policies) told me in our recent conversation , the form of policy help a technology needs depends on where it is on the learning curve. For early-stage technologies — tech still in basic research or prototyping, like algae fuels or advanced nuclear — good old-fashioned R&D spending helps, both for government research and to induce private-sector research. For technologies trying to bridge the “valley of death” between prototype and market viability, or trying to expand a small but growing market segment, performance standards and other regulations that help. And for mature technologies with developed supply chains, price-based instruments like carbon taxes help. They induce sales volume, and — this is key — scale is the single biggest driver of innovation . Nothing improves engineering, economizes supply chains, and drives down prices like economies of scale. Energy Innovation In other words, innovation does not happen by magic or pure entrepreneurial pluck. It is induced by market-shaping policies. Conservative fanfic to the contrary, no technology has ever developed in a “free market.” Trace any innovation back far enough and you find a shaping role for government policy and assistance — not at every stage the dominant driver, but never absent, never “neutral.” Government has always played an active supporting role in technology development, “picking winners and losers.” (Two book recommendations on this: State of Innovation by Fred Block and The Entrepreneurial State by Mariana Mazzucato.) This is just as true for the innovations that have helped the US reduce emissions (fracking, energy efficiency, and renewable energy) as for any other. The innovations Barrasso now touts did not spring forth from the ether — they trace back to smarter government policy than the kind he advocates. “What these folks don’t seem to understand is that most successful US innovations have required significant federal R&D funding, as well as policies that create market opportunities to get technologies deployed,” Lindsey Walter of the policy shop Third Way says. “We need policy to do both. And I don’t hear these newfound advocates for innovation calling for either.” In very broad strokes, Republicans are correct that innovation is central to climate policy. Seen from a certain angle , the climate challenge is simply the challenge of scaling up and substituting clean technologies for dirtier ones. We know how to accelerate technology development and innovation. But it has nothing to do with the strategy Republicans like Barrasso favor, which is to protect incumbent industries from any standards that might in any way constrict them, taxes that might in any way cost them, or laws that might in any way disturb them — and instead subsidize their efforts to remain viable. Taking innovation seriously means instituting a rising carbon tax. It means tripling or quadrupling the US energy-research budget and substantially increasing (ideally performance-based) grants, tax credits, prizes, and other financial incentives. And it means implementing and gradually tightening performance standards, on both energy efficiency and pollution. Taxing, spending, and regulating: These are all things a true climate-innovation agenda requires. And they are all things the Republican Party, in its current configuration, is incapable of supporting. That’s why they’re bullshitting."

Move over, Jonas Brothers, the J Sisters are ready to rock.
On Friday, just hours after the band released new single “Cool”, Kevin, Joe, and Nick stepped out in New York City for a triple date with their leading ladies, Danielle Jonas, Sophie Turner, and Priyanka Chopra.
Though the couples looked stylish as they were captured heading into dinner at Chinese restaurant Mr. Chow, it was the photos taken after their gathering that really stole the show.
Inside of a private jet, Danielle, 32, Sophie, 23, and Priyanka, 36, posed together for a cute “sister-in-laws” photo, while declaring themselves the Jonas Sisters.
“The #Jsisters are finally together!! @daniellejonas @sophiet ” Priyanka captioned the sweet shot.
Sophie also shared the snap to her Instagram Stories and captioned it with, “J sisters comin atcha” From left: Sophie Turner, Priyanka Chopra, Danielle JonasPriyanka Chopra/Instagram
Of course, the Jonas Brothers couldn’t resist commenting on the photo of their lovely ladies and left three “cool” emojis underneath — a nod to their new song.
The snap even caught the attention of Mama Jonas herself, who praised her daughter-in-laws and wrote, “Love this Love you Dilly’s!!” (Dilly is slang for daughter-in-law.) Priyanka Chopra/Instagram

Just as the Cubs suffered another disaster at the big league level, the org had a rough day overall as well, winning just one contest.
But that one featured a combined shutout.
And Miguel Amaya did create a highlight in one of the losses...

In the middle innings the Sounds jumped all over starter Duane Underwood, Jr. (3.1 IP, 4 H, 4 R, 4 BB, 2 K) and his replacement Brian Duensing (IP, 5 H, 3 R, 0 K). The lone bright spot on offense was Donnie Dewees , who finished a perfect 3-for-3, with a triple and homer.

Game Recap
The Smokies got on base plenty in this one, but tough to win a game when your team goes 2-for-20 with runners in scoring position. It wasted a strong effort by Cory Abbott in his first AA start.
Top Performers Cory Abbott: 5 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 2 K Ian Clarkin: 2 IP, 2H, 2 K Nico Hoerner: 2-4, 2B, RBI, BB, SB (1) Charcer Burks: 1-2, RBI, 3 BB, SB (1) P.J. Higgins: 1-3, R, 2 BB Vimael Machin: 1-4, BB
Injuries, Updates, and Trends
Nico Hoerner has already drawn three walks over his first two games in AA. He was very aggressive and drew few free passes in the AFL last season, so if there was one concern regarding his jump up to this level of competition, it was going to be his plate discipline and pitch recognition. I have seen him expand a couple of times on pitches well off the plate, but so far, so good.

Outside of his performance, the team also received an encouraging start from Bryan Hudson , featuring a 6-to-1 K-to-BB ratio. Free passes and missing bats have been an issue for the big man throughout his career. Hopefully, he can keep this up.

Game Recap
The winning (and only) run of the game crossed the plate in the bottom of the 2nd off an RBI ground out by Rafaelin Lorenzo . It was a good piece of managing by Buddy Bailey as it was a runners on the corners, one out situation, with the catcher hitting. Bailey put the runner on first in motion which eliminated the possibility of what would have been an inning-ending double play. And hats off to Lorenzo for executing. Cam Sanders (photo by Rikk Carlson)
The real story of the game was the combined shutout begun by Cam Sanders , extended by Jeffrey Passantino , and finished off by Riley McCauley .
Obviously a great way for Sanders, the son of former Cubs and Rockies swingman Scott Sanders , and a 12th round selection out of LSU to kick off his first full professional season. He has a live arm capable of hitting the mid-90s but has struggled a bit repeating his delivery and throwing strikes. Most likely a releiver down the road but the organization is developing him as a starter in order to get him more work and force him to develop his secondary offerings. The roadmap is probably laid out along similar lines to the one Bailey Clark is traversing.
Passantino returns to South Bend after spending part of 2018 with the club as a swingman, as well as a successful stint in Eugene as a starter. He's a polished four-pitch guy with a stout build on a 5'9"" frame. A very unusual look for a pitcher.
I didn't get to see his inning of work, but McCauley successfully followed Dakota Mekkes as the closer at Michigan State in 2017, but struggled last year as the team experimented with him in a larger role. The Cubs also stretched him out this spring so don't be surprised to see him used in a multi-inning role this season with the potential to slide into any open rotation slots later on.
Top Performers Cam Sanders: 5 IP, 3 H, 0 R, BB, 2 K (W, 1-0) Jeffrey Passantino: 3 IP, H, 0 R, 0 BB, 6 K Riley McCauley: IP, K (S, 1)"

Happy Tartan Day! This is actually a North American celebration, beginning in Canada in the 1980s, but adopted in this country thanks to people who recognized that the Declaration of Arbroath (adopted in the Scottish city of Arbroath in the year 1320) is an ancestor of, and model for, the U.S. Declaration of Independence.
So, before I wrap my MacDonald tartan muffler around my neck and go out into the remaining cold of a Chicago April, I'll tell you a bit about the Declaration of Arbroath.
According to National Records of Scotland (www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/learning/features/the-declaration-of-arbroath), "" The Declaration was written during the long war of independence with England which started with Edward I's attempt to conquer Scotland in 1296. When the deaths of Alexander III and his granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway, left Scotland without a monarch, Edward used the invitation to help choose a successor as an excuse to revive English claims of overlordship. When the Scots resisted, he invaded.""
(Norway? Seriously? I'll check later! But that's how deeply the name Margaret goes back in Scottish history, the 13th century.)
England's King Edward "" refused to allow William Wallace's victory at Stirling Bridge in 1297 to derail his campaign."" (You remember Stirling Bridge, fellow ""Braveheart"" watchers -- ""They can take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM!"" is apocryphal, but still powerful stuff.)
The diplomatic niceties of battling the English, with whom they wouldn't unite until 16o3 (when James VI of Scotland became James I of Great Britain), and how the declaration was actually meant as a letter to the pope, asking him to acknowledge Scottish independence, can be glossed over at this point as longer than what I want to achieve in this post.
I want to call more attention to the glorious words the barons who put their seals on the declaration put into the document. (Yes, they sealed it. This was so long ago that such things weren't signed.) Here's the best part:
"" It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honors, that we are fighting, but for freedom -- for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.""
Let freedom ring. Happy Tartan Day!

José Quintana had dominated the Milwaukee Brewers. Quintana was also one of the few bright spots in the Texas series, but the Cubs tailspin continued in full force as Q had no fastball command. The bullpen was terrible, and the offense showed up late and a little bit short.
The Brewers win was their sixth straight. The Cubs loss was their sixth straight. The 1-6 start for the Cubs is their worst since 1983. The Cubs have started 1-6 or worse only 9 times. The Cubs managed a winning record just once after such a start and they finished second in that campaign.
It is early. This is a team that is capable of putting a run together. There are enough arms that can get hot, but the margins are getting smaller by the day for this team to turn it around.
Source: FanGraphs
The mood of the evening was set early. The first four Brewers reached base and the Cubs were down 2-0 before the first recorded out. The double play gave Quintana a chance to settle in, but Quintana loaded the bases with one out. He loaded the bases by walking his counterpart Brandon Wood ruff and Lorenzo Cain . A Ryan Braun blast gave the Brewers a 6-0 lead and the Cubs never managed to bring the tying run to the plate again.
The Brewers made it 8-0 with back to back blasts from Hernán Pérez and Yasmani Grandal in the third inning. Quintana would be lifted after just three innings. The Cubs offense continued to do its thing. Brandon Wood ruff was roughed up in the fourth inning. Kyle Schwarber pulled a ball through the shift and Willson Contreras was drilled with a two seam fastball running in. Daniel ""Who needs Bryce Harper "" Descalso launched a no doubter to get the Cubs on the board. Jason Heyward drew a walk, but the Cubs were close to leaving him planted at first base after back to back strike outs. Kris Bryant hit a gapper that Heyward scored on without a throw to cut the Brewers lead in half. Woodruff struck out Anthony Rizzo looking to end the fourth.
Brad Brach was the first Cubs reliever and he worked around a two out walk for a scoreless frame. Chase Anderson was the next Brewers pitcher, and the Cubs moved within three after a Willson Contreras home run. Daniel Descalso struck out to end the inning.
Brad Brach retired the first batter of the fifth inning, but Grandal singled which was the end of Brach's outing. Carl Edward Jr. was the choice and it worked as well as it has so far this season as Orlando Arcia blasted a two run shot to make it 10-5. Edwards retired the next two batters, but the runs hurt as Chase Anderson retired the next six Cubs batters he faced.
Brandon Kintzler pitched the seventh and allowed the Brewers to add a field goal. Those runs would prove pivotal as the Cubs offense provided another later rally. Jason Heyward hit a two run home run against Matt Albers in the eighth inning. The Cubs bats came to life in the ninth inning down big for the second night in a row. The first three Cubs reached, and all three would score. Unfortunately the next three Cubs batters grounded out to end the threat and the Cubs night.

As South Carolina governor, Hollings helped guide the state through desegregation, The Associated Press reported. He campaigned against desegregation during his run for governor in 1958 but wrote an anti-lynching law that targeted the Ku Klux Klan, according to The Post and Courier.
He later denounced segregation and, in 2015, asked that his name be removed from Charleston’s federal courthouse so that it would instead honor J. Waties Waring, the judge who orchestrated the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that desegregated the nation's public schools.

Friday Open Thread,3chicspolitico.com,Ametia,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://3chicspolitico.com/2019/04/05/friday-open-thread-93/,"The parents indicted in the college-admissions scandal were responding to a changing America, with rage at being robbed of what they believed was rightfully theirs.
APR 4, 2019
..
Ever since the scandal became public, two opinions have been widely expressed. The first is that the schemes it revealed are not much different from the long-standing admissions preference for big donors, and the second is that these admissions gained on fraudulent grounds have harmed underprivileged students. These aren’t quite right. As off-putting as most of us find the role that big-ticket fundraising plays in elite-college admissions, those monies go toward programs and facilities that will benefit a wide number of students—new dormitories, new libraries, enriched financial-aid funds are often the result of rich parents being tapped for gifts at admissions time. But the Singer scheme benefits no one at all except the individual students, and the people their parents paid off.
The argument that the scheme hurt disadvantaged applicants—or even just non-rich applicants who needed financial aid to attend these stratospherically expensive colleges—isn’t right either. Elite colleges pay deep attention to the issue of enrollment management; the more elite the institution, the more likely it is to be racially and socioeconomically diverse. This is in part because attaining this kind of diversity has become a foundational goal of most admissions offices, and also because the elite colleges have the money to make it happen. In 2017, Harvard announced with great fanfare that it had enrolled its first class in which white students were in the minority.
When I was a prep-school college counselor 25 years ago, I thought that whatever madness was whirring through the minds of the parents was a blip of group insanity that would soon abate. It has only gotten more and more extreme. Anyone can understand a parent’s disappointment if he had thought for 17 years that his child would go to Yale one day, only to learn that it’s not in the cards. But what accounted for the intensity of emotion these parents expressed, their sense of a profound loss, of rage at being robbed of what they believed was rightfully theirs? They were experiencing the same response to a changing America that ultimately brought Donald Trump to office: white displacement and a revised social contract. The collapse of manufacturing jobs has been to poor whites what the elite college-admissions crunch has been to wealthy ones: a smaller and smaller slice of pie for people who were used to having the fattest piece of all.
In the recent past—the past in which this generation of parents grew up—a white student from a professional-class or wealthy family who attended either a private high school or a public one in a prosperous school district was all but assured admission at a “good” college. It wasn’t necessarily going to be Harvard or Yale, but it certainly might be Bowdoin or Northwestern. That was the way the system worked. But today, there’s a squeeze on those kids. The very strong but not spectacular white student from a good high school is now trying to gain access to an ever-shrinking pool of available spots at the top places. He’s not the inherently attractive prospect he once was."

The Charleston Post & Courier reports :
Ernest Frederick “Fritz” Hollings, the charismatic and quick-witted former U.S. senator and South Carolina governor who became one of the state’s most important national political figures, died early Saturday after a period of declining health. He was 97.
“Our father, Fritz Hollings, was dedicated to his family, the United States Senate and the people of South Carolina,” his three surviving children said in a statement. “He was a hero for us and millions of Americans.
He would serve in Washington, D.C., for nearly 40 years, all but two of which were as the “junior” senator from South Carolina to Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond. Hollings rose through the ranks of the Democratic leadership to become chairman of the powerful Commerce Committee. In 1984, he briefly ran for president of the United States, failing to gain much traction. Ernest “Fritz” Hollings, who helped smooth integration in South Carolina before spending 38 years in the U.S. Senate as an advocate for impoverished Americans, has died https://t.co/jkPIXANoRK"
