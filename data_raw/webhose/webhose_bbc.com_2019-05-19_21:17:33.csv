Jane Manchun Wong: The woman scooping Silicon Valley - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Alli Shultes Technology Reporter,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47630849,"Image copyright Jane Wong Image caption Jane Wong spends up to 18 hours every weekend combing through code She was the first person to get a detailed look at Facebook's new dating feature before the designs were released to the public.
She discovered that Airbnb was testing a new flight integration feature that alerted hosts on the website when their guests' planes landed safely.
And she sounded the horn when Instagram began experimenting with augmented reality profile pictures.
Silicon Valley's tech firms like to make a splash when they unveil new features. But half a world away, a Hong Kong-based software engineer has made it her ambition to spoil their scoops.
Jane Manchun Wong is a 23-year-old technology blogger and app researcher famous for uncovering new features before they launch.
By reverse-engineering popular apps such as Facebook and Instagram, she is able to preview changes that are still in testing mode. She shares the designs from her Twitter account, which is watched closely by journalists eager for a scoop - and the companies hoping to avoid landing at the centre of one.
'Outburst' on Twitter Feature-hunting is just a hobby for Ms Wong. She doesn't profit from her scoops, although she has been offered jobs by media organisations eager for her exclusives.
But some of Ms Wong's scoops are so big that they threaten to impact the stock market, leading some to accuse her of insider trading.
When Facebook announced its new dating feature last spring, the Match Group - which owns the dating app Tindr and website Match.com - saw stocks plunge by more than 20%.
And so when Ms Wong tweeted the first public screenshot of Facebook Dating's homepage a few months later, she faced a Twitter storm of comments saying that she was purposefully manipulating the market for her own profit.
""Not everybody understands computing and information security, and sometimes when people see something I post they overreact,"" she said.
Ms Wong said that the accusations caused her to have an ""outburst"" on Twitter.
""I felt very angry,"" she said. ""But I don't see a lot of trolling. It's hard for them to find a talking point against me.""
A white-hat hacker Despite being a hacker, Ms Wong tries to stay on the right side of trouble. Even as a young child, her tricks tended to delight more than to aggravate.
She told the South China Morning Post in an interview that one of her earliest hacks was to manipulate a software program that calculated typing speed. By changing the underlying JavaScript code, she hacked her way to first place in a school-wide competition.
She credits her father with kick-starting her interest in technology - not because he encouraged programming, but because she taught herself valuable subversion skills while trying to get past the passwords he set on the family computer as a kid.
And, like her dad, the Silicon Valley tech giants are having to up their game to avoid getting hacked by Ms Wong.
""Since I started getting some interest and the companies started monitoring my tweets, more companies have been improving their app security,"" she told the BBC.
""That is one of my points of doing this... companies will improve their app security so it's harder to break in.""
Turning heads in Silicon Valley Ms Wong can tell her scoops are causing a stir at the tech firms she tends to hack most regularly. After sharing the screenshots of Facebook's Dating homepage, she said the company quickly added some code that prevented her from taking any more photos from her phone.
Image Copyright @wongmjane @wongmjane Report Image Copyright @wongmjane @wongmjane Report Sometimes the features she discovers quickly disappear - which is what happened to a Facebook map she found that showed nearby friends' locations. A Facebook web address that listed all publicly available wi-fi networks in a given location also disappeared quickly after she tweeted about it.
Employees sometimes get in touch with her on Twitter, complimenting a code crack and sometimes offering referrals to work at their tech firms.
And more and more often, companies are guarding their updates until moments before announcing new features. According to Ms Wong, when Instagram announced the launch of their vertical video platform IGTV last summer, they didn't publish the code until half an hour before the announcement.
""I knew that they were going to have a keynote, I kept frustratingly tapping the refresh update, refresh update app,"" she said.
""Normally when companies test experimental features, they publish the changes to a production version of the app and then [...] turn the feature on for certain users. Then when they launch, they switch the feature flag on for everyone.
""For this feature, they used a different approach - and they indicated it was because of people like me.""
Image copyright Jane Wong Image caption Ms Wong scooped Instagram's announcement of its vertical video platform For the love of apps Ms Wong says she spends up to 18 hours every weekend combing through code. That's in addition to her paid work as a freelance bug bounty hunter, reporting security flaws to companies before a malicious hacker is able to access their software.
So why does she do it?
Ms Wong says that a lot of her motivation comes from a love of the apps that she uses on a daily basis, and a desire to understand the changes that are on the way.
When an app update is released, the description of the changes on the App Store usually just mention fixes and improvements. ""I don't find that particularly transparent,"" she said. ""I want to crowd-source the change-log by myself.""
She also told the BBC that reverse-engineering apps helps her learn more about code. She is pursuing a degree in computer science at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in the US, but is currently taking a break from her studies.
""Once I find a pattern, it will only take five minutes to break the code. But oftentimes in the process I learn something new,"" she said."

Cars were crushed when the crane fell from a building site and into a road in the South Lake Union district, the Seattle Fire Department said.
Two were killed working in the crane and two were killed in their cars.
A woman and her baby, and a man in his 20s, were injured and taken to hospital, officials said.
The incident happened at about 15:30 local time (22:30 GMT) on Saturday.
Witness Esther Nelson told the Seattle Times that the crane appeared to break in half during strong winds.
""Half of it was flying down sideways on the building, the other half fell down on the street, crossing both lanes of traffic,"" she said.
The building under construction was badly damaged. The development is to house a new Google Seattle campus and about 150 new flats, the Seattle Times reported.

The disabled Christians reinterpreting the Bible - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Damon Rose Bbc News,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48054113,"The disabled Christians reinterpreting the Bible By Damon Rose BBC News 28 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel
Like many disabled people, I am often approached by Christians who want to pray for me to be healed. While they may be well-intentioned, these encounters often leave me feeling judged as faulty and in need of repair. So I set out to discover what Christianity has to offer disabled people beyond promises of miracle cures. Image copyright SARAH DOUSSE
From time to time, without warning or encouragement, I get approached in the street by Christians who tell me they want to pray for me to get my sight back. Since I became blind as a teenager this has been a regular yet annoying by-product of being an independent disabled person who can walk about on the street.
The last time this happened was on the London underground. The train was packed full of people all studiously ignoring each other when a man put his hand on my shoulder and asked if he could pray for my sight to be restored. But more about that later.
I had always assumed that everyone knew these encounters are a fact of life for people who are visibly disabled. But when one day I told some colleagues about my latest brush with a would-be healer, they were variously fascinated or outraged that anyone would have the cheek to impose their beliefs on me about something so personal.
At this point I should perhaps confess that I am not religious. The message I've taken from the Christians who've offered me healing is that I need to be ""fixed"" - just as Jesus ""fixed"" disabled people in the Gospels. Far from converting me, this has put me off Christianity. So I was interested to learn that it also annoys some disabled Christians.
Reverend Zoe Hemming, vicar of St Andrews Church in the village of Aston in Shropshire, is a part-time wheelchair user who lives with chronic pain. She's had her own encounters with strangers offering healing prayer and says she finds this approach can be ""spiritually abusive"".
""I've been in situations where I've been talking to another wheelchair user in church and somebody was so determined to pray for us and we just kept ignoring them because we were in the middle of a conversation. In the end he just put his arms on both our shoulders and just prayed. It was really annoying and very disempowering. I was furious."" Healing hands
Of course, Christians who offer healing do so because, in the Gospels, Jesus healed the sick and commanded his disciples to do the same.
At my school, we learned all about the healing miracles Jesus performed. He told a ""cripple"" that he was healed and should pick up his stretcher and walk. He cured a blind man or two, healed a woman with a haemorrhage and another who was bent double. He even brought his friend Lazarus back from the dead. Find out more
Damon Rose is one of the producers behind the BBC Ouch disability talk podcast
For Candida Moss, the Edward Cadbury Professor of Theology at the University of Birmingham, these stories can be alienating for readers who, like her, are disabled.
""I think the main problem for disabled people reading the Bible is that while Jesus does spend a lot of time with people with disabilities, every time he meets them, if they encounter him with faith, he heals them and so he's sort of like this cathartic scourge that wanders around eradicating disability from the world.""
Another difficulty, says Prof Moss, is that disabled people are often used by the Gospel authors to beef up Jesus' credentials, showcasing his divine powers.
""When Jesus meets people with disabilities, he fixes them and that's a sign that he is powerful,"" she says. ""That relegates people with disabilities to just being there to show the power of God. They're not really real characters or real people who have feelings and needs and personalities. That pushes them to the margins of the story.""
But Lyndall Bywater, a Christian who writes and teaches about prayer and is herself blind, says it's important to understand the historical context of Jesus' healing miracles. While disabled people today might bristle at descriptions of the ""pity"" Jesus feels for the people he heals, Ms Bywater says Jesus was operating at a time when being disabled meant being poor, unemployed and excluded from mainstream society.
""There was obviously no welfare state, so you'd have been begging on the side of the road. Your life condition would have been pretty terrible and I think pity from Jesus in that context is probably a lot about that sense of exclusion, that sense of destitution that he saw.""
Another motive, she says, was the fact that many disabled people were banned from worshipping at the temple as, under religious law at the time, they were deemed ""unclean"".
""Jesus did heal physical illness a lot and I think some of that was because it did restore people to social dignity at the time.""
So if Jesus met me today, empowered as I am with my job and my guide dog, would he still think I need healing?
Lyndall Bywater is sceptical: ""If Jesus was walking the streets now,"" she says, ""I don't know if he would be healing in the same way. I don't think Jesus would look at you and think 'there is someone who needs pity'."" God has a wheelchair
Some Christians are going even further in rethinking what the Bible has to say about disability. Among them is 16-year-old Becky Tyler, who in 2017 preached to 6,000 people at the Christian festival Greenbelt. Tyler has quadriplegic cerebral palsy and communicates using eye-gaze technology and a speech synthesizer. She tells me she talks to God every day inside her head.
""God says to me that He loves me a lot. He says that I am made in His image and that my disability doesn't make me any less than an able-bodied person. He loves us all the same.""
Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone born with a severe disability, Becky hasn't always believed this.
""When I was about 12 years old, I felt God didn't love me as much as other people because I am in a wheelchair and because I can't do lots of the things that other people can do. I felt this way because I did not see anyone with a wheelchair in the Bible, and nearly all the disabled people in the Bible get healed by Jesus - so they are not like me.""
She felt alienated by much of what she read in the Bible - until she was given new food for thought.
""My mum showed me a verse from the Book of Daniel (Chapter 7, Verse 9), which basically says God's throne has wheels, so God has a wheelchair.
""In fact it's not just any old chair, it's the best chair in the Bible. It's God's throne, and it's a wheelchair. This made me feel like God understands what it's like to have a wheelchair and that having a wheelchair is actually very cool, because God has one.""
If you think this is a random moment of silliness from a teenager, Prof Candida Moss says Becky has chanced upon a fresh but perfectly legitimate reading of the Old Testament.
""We don't get many descriptions of what God is actually like but we get one of them at the beginning of Ezekiel,"" she says. ""The Prophet has this vision of the Heavenly throne room, where God resides and God is sat on this throne that is pretty much on fire.
""But it's also described as having wheels within wheels attached to it. And following this scene, if you think of all the scenes of the Bible laid out chronologically, God is always sat in this wheeled throne and in fact moves - leaves the city of Jerusalem - on the wheeled throne and returns to it later on the wheeled throne."" Image copyright Getty Images
Although God is depicted walking in the Bible, Prof Moss says this happens earlier - in the Garden of Eden.
""It seems like God is a wheelchair user maybe a thousand years before human beings themselves have thought about wheelchairs.""
So is God disabled? ""That is certainly a way to read it"" says Prof Moss, admitting that for many, this is a jaw-dropping and theologically challenging idea: ""Yes, it's very counter-intuitive to the image of divine power that we grow up with in Sunday school or Church, but that's precisely why we should look at these passages - because they challenge us to reconsider what we think is important and what we value highly.""
Prof Moss is part of a group of academics who are carving out a new ""theology of disability"". It's a relatively new academic field, which has only really taken off in the past 10 to 15 years, inspired by pioneering texts like The Disabled God: Toward a Liberatory Theology of Disability (1994) by Nancy L Eiesland. The body of Jesus
For the Reverand Zoe Hemming, these contemporary readings of Christian scripture have provided new ways of seeing - and coming to terms with - her own disability.
""I can't believe it took me this long to realise it,"" she says, ""but when Jesus rose from the dead, his risen body still had scars,"" explaining that crucifixion left holes in his hands and feet as well as his side.
""It was profound for me to realise that the most powerful symbol of the disabled body in the Christian story is His.""
She says she is glad that Jesus didn't come back from the dead as physically whole and perfect. ""He came back better than perfect,"" she says. ""He wore his scars because they told his story.
""That's the Jesus that I find in Christianity, not the one that wants to normalise everybody.""
Prof Moss says the fact that Jesus retains his scars after the Resurrection suggests that disabled people might also retain their disabilities in the afterlife - something she hopes for herself.
""I think that if I'm not disabled in heaven, I'm not myself so I certainly hope I'll still be disabled in heaven. I certainly hope that I don't feel pain in heaven - that seems antithetical to what heaven is. But I still want to be me. And I don't think that I would be me without the conditions that I have. It's shaped who I am, how I think, what I do. Everything about my life involves this part of myself, which is integral to who I am.""
I understand this. My visual impairment, along with the things I've come to love and cherish as a result of having it, is so bound up with my identity, I would feel a bit weird if I were to suddenly not be blind. That said, I think on balance it would be quite handy being able to see.
I asked Lyndall Bywater, who is also blind, if she would like to be disabled in heaven. ""Oh no I hope not,"" she replies. ""That isn't because I think that there's anything wrong with being blind and I've thoroughly enjoyed it thus far. I just want to be able to get in a sports car and drive a sports car. That's really what I want to do. So I'm desperately hoping."" Image copyright SARAH DOUSSE
But despite her personal hopes, she believes some people will retain their disabilities in the afterlife.
""The Christian message does have in it this sense of restoration,"" she says. ""Now what restoration looks like for each of us may well be different. I suspect there might be some surprises in heaven as to people that are like: 'Do you know what, I have still got this disability because restoration for me was never about that.'""
Prof Candida Moss thinks disability may not have the same meaning in heaven as it does in this life: ""I don't know if you would need to see in heaven. Saint Augustine has a whole conversation about how he's not sure it's necessary to be able to see in heaven to love God. That might be because, when you look at descriptions of heaven, people just kind of stand around singing to God, so it might not be as necessary to be able to see because I don't really know what it's like. None of us do.""
Next time a Christian approaches me and offers healing, I might try to challenge their theology with some of the new interpretations of scripture I've learned from disabled Christians.
The notion that God and Jesus could be interpreted as being disabled may not be mainstream, but it's a message that is more empowering for disabled people than the idea that we are all faulty and in need of repair. And who knows, maybe if we were approached with the message that God loves us as we are, more disabled people might welcome that conversation.
I was really taken by something Lyndall Bywater said to me. She said the ""sighted world"" might find it difficult to believe, but she thinks that being alive and at peace with yourself while being blind is a bigger miracle than having your sight restored.
And it's true. I like me and I like the ""blind person"" things I do - for want of a better way of putting it.
At the start of this article, I told you about a man who spoke to me on a packed London underground train. Normally when people offer to pray for me to be healed, I say 'No'. But this man told me that he was a recovering drug addict and alcoholic who had himself been healed by prayer. I got the sense that he really needed me to let him pray over me, so I said 'Yes' and let him lay his hands upon me.
I can't claim to be cured of blindness as a result of his prayer, but I'll never forget how happy and grateful he appeared to be.
To me it felt very much like the roles had unintentionally been reversed, and that it was the disabled man during the encounter who had given out a dose of healing. The man left the train after giving me a very big manly hug. I felt quite good too, and smiled wondering what the other people in the carriage had made of it, as I plugged my headphones back in.

The town of Ii in northern Finland wants to be the world's first zero-waste community.
They stopped using fossil fuels - and the municipality is reducing CO2 emissions faster than any other community in Finland.
Their target is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2020, which is 30 years ahead of the EU's target.
Since 2012 they've invested heavily in geothermal, solar and wind energy projects that have paid off: they now generate a profit of half a million euros a year.
They believe the key to successful climate action is education from a very young age. So how is Ii raising an environmentally conscious generation?

The UK is due to elect new MEPs on 23 May, after Brexit was delayed amid continuing parliamentary deadlock.
Several parties have launched their campaigns already but Conservative chair Mr Lewis told the BBC his focus was on next week's local elections.
The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, or sooner if a deal is agreed.
This means the UK must now hold European Parliament elections on 23 May if it wants to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.
But if agreement can be reached among MPs before 22 May, the UK could cancel its participation in the elections.

But asked about Conservative campaign plans on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lewis said: ""As a government, our first priority is to not have to fight the EU elections.
""I think we should be doing everything we can to respect that 2016 referendum, if and when we are at the point where we are definitely fighting those EU elections then we will take some decisions about that.""
He said there was ""still time"" for the UK Parliament to approve the withdrawal agreement - which it has so far rejected three times - in time so the UK could leave the EU and would not have to take part in the elections at all.
He rejected reports about donors deserting the Conservatives, saying that 2018 had been a ""record peacetime fundraising year"".
Some Conservative members reportedly plan to back the Brexit Party at the elections, and Conservative councillors in Derbyshire are refusing to campaign at all in protest at the failure to have left the EU.
Mr Lewis said: ""I don't deny the frustration people in our party have over where we are on Brexit. I share that frustration, I want to get this done so we don't fight those European elections.""
He added: ""I hope that Conservative members, colleagues, volunteers, activists will come to want to not just vote for, but campaign for Conservatives to get elected, because ultimately Conservative representation is better than any other party.""

She said: ""Honestly I think the discussions so far have been productive, they've gone into a lot of detail, there seems to be a willingness on both sides to move towards some form of consensus.
""But as yet we haven't seen the government move on any of their red lines, we're having further discussions this week and hopefully we'll see some movement.""
At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 73 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU.
But earlier this month, she agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament."

The electoral authorities ruled last month that only two parties - both loyal to President Patrice Talon - met the requirements to take part.
New electoral laws mean a party had to pay about $424,000 (£328,000) to field a list for the 83-seat parliament.
Internet access has been restricted with social media and messaging apps blocked in the West African nation.
Five million people are registered to vote in the country, known as one of Africa's most stable democracies.
'Fuelling turmoil' Rights activists have criticised a ban and crackdown on peaceful protests by those angered by the opposition's exclusion as well as the arrests of political activists and journalists.
""The growing wave of arrests and detentions in Benin is extremely troubling, particularly in the context of elections,"" François Patuel, from UK-based Amnesty International, said in a statement.
""Banning peaceful protests and detaining those who speak up against the exclusion of opposition parties from the legislative election will only fuel political turmoil.""

President Talon, a former businessman known as the ""king of cotton"", came to office in 2016 on a modernist ticket.
He says the electoral reforms were intended to bring together the country's several hundred political parties into streamlined blocs.
He has also overseen laws barring health workers from striking and limiting strikes by other civil servants or government workers to 10 days a year.

The couple were welcomed to a boarding house in the village of Asni by the girls, who waved flags and sang songs.
During the visit, the pregnant duchess was given a traditional Moroccan henna tattoo, which is intended to bring luck to her first child.

The photographers might have been there for the bump; the journalists to see the last royal visit before the baby is due. But Harry and Meghan were there to show that a royal visit could have real purpose.
So the focus was unremitting; from start to finish in the dusty mountain town of Asni, Harry and Meghan homed in on education and in particular opening it up to girls, and granting them opportunities that women have been denied.
There was no pomp, little ceremony, not too many handshakes; they wanted to meet the teachers and students, to encourage them, to shine a spotlight on their work.
A while ago a palace official told me that in 2019 we would start to see Meghan's influence and interests; they could not have been clearer today. Harry and Meghan are determined to do things differently. Image copyright Getty Images
The couple visited classrooms, where most of the girls speak French.
The duchess asked: ""Qu'est-ce que tu veux etre quand tu quittes l'ecole? - What do you want to be when you leave school?""

Flights diverted after Gatwick Airport 'drone sighting' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-48086013,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Three flights were diverted to Stansted Three flights have been diverted after a possible drone sighting at Gatwick Airport.
EasyJet flights from Barcelona and Amsterdam were diverted to Stansted, as was a British Airways flight from Heraklion, Greece.
All three later landed at Gatwick more than 90 minutes after their scheduled arrival time.
Gatwick said it had investigated an ""unconfirmed sighting of an object"" outside its exclusion zone.
A spokeswoman confirmed an Aer Lingus pilot made the initial report.
The airport added: ""Following a full assessment, the airport has remained fully operational throughout.""
How can a drone cause so much chaos?
Stansted Airport said it did not anticipate any further diversions.
A suspected drone closed the airport for 33 hours in December, disrupting the journeys of about 140,000 passengers. A huge police operation and the Army eventually brought the incident under control.
Military anti-drone equipment, which can detect the flying machines and disable them by jamming radio signals, remained at the airport until March.
Both Gatwick and Heathrow are investing millions of pounds into their systems to prevent future flight disruption."

San Diego synagogue shooting: Rabbi talks about the attack - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48085514,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The shooting happened at a synagogue in Poway, north of San Diego A rabbi who was injured in the deadly shooting at a synagogue near San Diego on Saturday has described the moment he faced the gunman.
Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein says he lifted his hands when he saw the ""murder terrorist"". The man shot and the rabbi lost his right index finger.
One woman died and two other people were injured in the attack.
A 19-year-old man named as John Earnest was arrested shortly afterwards in Poway, north of the Californian city.
America's gun culture in 10 charts The threat of rising anti-Semitism in US The attack comes exactly six months after a shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 people were killed, thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history.
What did the rabbi say? Rabbi Goldstein was walking into the banquet hall at the synagogue when he heard a noise - what he thought initially was a table falling over or a congregation member collapsing.
""As soon as he saw me, he started to shoot toward me and that is when I put my hands up,"" Rabbi Goldstein said on NBC's Sunday Today programme. ""I cannot erase that face from my mind.""
He held up his hands to shield himself but his fingers ""got blown away"".

Lori Kaye, who helped found the synagogue with Rabbi Goldstein, was shot dead in the attack.
""Everyone in the community knew her,"" he said. ""I'm just so heartbroken and saddened by the senseless killing.""

Worshippers attacked, again By Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor
The routine is all too familiar. Another murderous attack on a place of worship, this time in San Diego, followed by the obligatory offer of prayers. ""Thoughts and prayers to all those affected"", tweeted President Donald Trump.
Then, during a brief on-camera statement, Mr Trump said it looked like a hate-crime. ""Hard to believe,"" he added. Sadly, it is not hard to believe at all.
Anti-Semitic incidents in the US surged 57% in 2017 - the most recent data available - the largest year-on-year increase since the century-old Jewish advocacy group began collecting data in 1979, says the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremism in the US.
The horrendous attack in San Diego follows the deadliest attack on Jews in US history at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October. It will now be added to the ADL figures. And the numbers, to tragic results, continue to rise.
How did the attack unfold? Sheriff Gore said officers were called to the Chabad synagogue just before 11:30 (18:30 GMT) after the man opened fire with an ""AR-15 type"" assault rifle.
He said an off-duty border patrol officer had fired at the suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle, but had not not hit him.
The suspect was later arrested by another officer, said San Diego chief of police David Nisleit.
""He clearly saw the suspect's vehicle, the suspect jumped out with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" Mr Nisleit said.
""As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody, he clearly saw a rifle on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle.""
San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told reporters that investigators were reviewing the suspect's social media activity and examining a virulently anti-Semitic ""open letter"" published online.
In the letter, which appeared on the online forum 8chan hours before the attack, the author - who identified himself as John Earnest - said he had been inspired by the attack on two Christchurch mosques last month, as well as the Pittsburgh shooting last October.
The racist, anti-Semitic document that police are investigating in relation to the shooting makes 10 references to Robert Bowers - charged with killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh - whom the author John Earnest calls an ""inspiration"".
Authorities later said Mr Earnest was under investigation in connection with a fire at a mosque last month.
How has the Jewish community reacted? ""All of the Jewish community across the country is concerned,"" Joel Rubin, a Democratic Strategist and member of the Tree of Life synagogue, told Fox News on Saturday. ""My daughters go to Hebrew school and we see police cars often in front of the school, guarding it. That's not the situation in America we want to be living in.""
Meanwhile, the Times of Israel published a blog post headlined, ""Synagogue shootings - now a thing"" .
Image copyright EPA Image caption A message of support outside the Chabad synagogue near San Diego In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack, members of the US Jewish community began openly questioning whether the era of seeing the US as a safe haven was over.
""I had been dreading and expecting this day, and more like it, for two years,"" wrote the Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank, in a column titled ""Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews"" .
As Pittsburgh reeled, its teenagers mobilised Mr Trump has publicly condemned anti-Semitism, and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" to suggest he bore any responsibility for it, but many have accused him of using coded anti-Semitic language.
The ADL publicly called on him to stop using tropes such as ""global special interests"" and ""those who control the levers of power"" - both of which he ran in an ad alongside pictures of prominent Jews - as well as his claim that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville, after white nationalists chanted ""Jews will not replace us""."
"Fewer Brits choosing EU countries for holidays, travel firm says - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48087469," Image caption Spain is still the most popular destination for holidaymakers, says Thomas Cook Fewer British holidaymakers have booked a summer holiday inside the European Union this year amid continuing Brexit uncertainty, Thomas Cook has said.
The travel firm says almost half (48%) of the holidays it sold up until the end of February were to non-EU destinations, up 10% on last year.
Despite this, the firm says Spain is still its most popular destination.
Its findings chime with separate Post Office figures showing currency sales for long-haul destinations have jumped.
Sales of the Japanese yen were up 12% so far this year compared with last, while sales of the Indonesian rupiah have increased by 9%, Post Office Travel Money said.
'Better value holiday' Image copyright Kevin Coles ""Brexit has made us as a family think and for the first time we are going to Turkey,"" said Kevin Coles from Northamptonshire.
""The value of the pound there (against the lira), versus the euro (in eurozone countries) makes it a much better value holiday."" He adds: ""We will holiday in the UK in the summer and maybe look at Cyprus, Turkey or Dubai for autumn half term.""
""For us it's less to do with the travel arrangements, although the possibility of delays and long queues is in the back of your mind. ""
'Faring well' The currency figures are based on Post Office transactions between 1 January and 23 April. The Post Office accounts for about a quarter of all UK currency transactions.
It said the biggest growth in currency sales so far this year has been for the Egyptian pound, which has seen a 687% year-on-year increase.
Thomas Cook - through which 19 million people book holidays each year - said after Spain, Turkey had proved the most popular destination for its holidaymakers, accounting for a quarter of its flight-only bookings so far.
Thomas Cook said Tunisia was also ""faring well"" with package bookings to the country double that of last year, with flight-only bookings up four-fold.
Tourism to the country fell dramatically after a 2015 terrorism attack in the resort of Sousse in which 30 British tourists and eight others were killed by a gunman with links to Islamic State.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office lifted its travel ban against the country last year, prompting British operators to renew flights to Tunisia's Mediterranean coast.
Thomas Cook has made two profit warnings in the past six months following drops in holiday bookings. In March, it detailed plans to close 21 stores across the country and cut more than 300 jobs.
Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said it was still too early to tell the impact on bookings of the UK's exit from the European Union being delayed to the end of October.
But he said there was ""little doubt that the prolonged uncertainty around the manner and timing of Britain's exit from the European Union has led many customers to press pause on their holiday plans for this summer"".

'I used to sell my packed lunch to my schoolmates' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Suzanne Bearne Business Reporter,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47785649,"Image copyright Ennismore Image caption Sharan Pasricha has opened Ennismore hotels in Europe and the US The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Sharan Pasricha, boss of boutique hotel group Ennismore.
Sharan Pasricha's entrepreneurialism first became evident when he was just six years old.
He was in the first year of primary school, and started selling the sandwiches his mum made for him to his schoolmates.
""I was making a good profit, and so I decided to ask my mum to make me more sandwiches for lunch,"" recalls the 38-year-old, who grew up in Mumbai in India.
Image copyright Ennismore Image caption The Hoxton Hotel in Amsterdam ""It was great until I started getting greedy and doubling the price.""
A parent approached his mother at a school event, and complained about the rocketing price tag. The bold youngster was caught out.
""The racket came tumbling down,"" he says with a laugh.
Sharan is a natural storyteller, dishing out anecdotes about how hustling has permeated his life.
His first professional taste of entrepreneurship came at 22, when he co-founded UK-based Rush Media, a student media and marketing agency which he ran for three years after leaving university in London.
Image copyright Ennismore Image caption Ennismore hotels, such as this one in Paris, target hip millennial travellers His enterprising spirit caught the attention of an uncle in Delhi, who lured Sharan back to his homeland to take over his leather garment business.
""It was very tough,"" admits the fast-talking Sharan. ""I was 25, and I was running an organisation of 300 people in the manufacturing business. But it was educating. I learnt about sales, finance, supply chain, margins, and people skills.""
Despite his lack of experience, he says he turned the business around, and sales and profits jumped.
After three years Sharan quit the job to study for a master of business administration qualification at London Business School, while also doing an internship at the private equity firm Better Capital.
It was at Better, where he worked on investments in hotels and student accommodation, that he discovered his calling.
More The Boss features:
'We made more than five billion teabags last year' 'Why I quit as a barrister to follow my dream job' 'A lot of the team started to get ill' 'Muslims don't date, we marry' ""Hotels are an interesting intersection of neighbourhood, design, community, operations, and food and drink. I thought, 'imagine if you could craft a career around these amazing things you're passionate about'.""
Within a year of graduating in 2011, he set up Ennismore Holdings, backed by private investors, and the group went on to buy the trendy Hoxton Hotel in east London for £65m in 2012.
His first move was to revamp the Shoreditch-based hotel, whose brand had become ""tired"", and he ended up spending a year virtually living in the hotel.
""I walked in and introduced myself to the 40 staff who worked there and said, 'I'm going to be hanging out with you'. I learnt by doing.""
Image copyright Ennismore Image caption The Hoxton hotel in Williamsburg, New York Sharan also brought in outside help, hiring members club Soho House to run the restaurant, as well as upgrading the bedrooms, and creating a hireable events and meetings space called The Apartment.
Sales and profits climbed, and he quickly realised the hotel wouldn't just be a one-off project.
""There was an opportunity to grow and scale the brand. We thought, 'how do we do this again in London?'. We spent a lot of time in different neighbourhoods.""
The group opened a second London hotel in Holborn in 2014, and has since expanded to Amsterdam, Paris and the US, with hotels in New York, Portland and Chicago. Sites in Los Angeles and Southwark in London are in the pipeline.
Image copyright Ennismore Image caption The Gleneagles Hotel is more traditional than Sharan's other sites Ennismore's boutique hotels tend to be in fashionable locations and boast trendy decor.
However, in a surprise move, Sharan decided to branch out in 2015 and bought the traditional Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland.
Opened in 1924, the listed hotel has in recent years been more associated with golfers than hipsters, boasting three of its own courses - one designed by former golf star Jack Nicklaus.
But Sharan, whose wife is Scottish, had often stayed at the hotel, and when it came up for sale he jumped at the opportunity.
Image copyright Ennismore Image caption A suite at the Gleneagles Hotel ""Our thesis was here's an amazing brand with an amazing history, but it had lost what it was.
""So we looked back through the archives at how we could bring it back to the roaring 1920s and 30s, when it was part of the social calendar, and people would get the train up from London.""
He says Ennismore has refurbished the hotel, retaining its Scottish identity, but injecting a more contemporary feel.
According to its latest accounts, Ennismore Holdings had revenues of £20.7m in 2017, up from £14.6m the previous year. Pre-tax profit fell from £7.7m to £6.8m as the firm reinvested in its hotels.
Image copyright Ennismore Image caption Sharan is a self confessed ""control freak"" ""Curating an urban hotel concept that not only works in London but also travels well is hard,"" says Melinda Stevens, editor of Condé Nast Traveller, which earlier this year named Sharan as one of ""The 44 people changing the way we travel"".
She says the challenge for Ennismore now is to keep growing in an ever more competitive market.
""The 'boutique hotel' concept has become something of a cliché really - it's nothing new. So there's a lot of competition in cities such as London, and it's tough to stand out.
""Possibly Sharan's strength comes from the fact he doesn't come from a traditional hotel background, so doesn't have any hang-ups in what you can and can't do.""
Sharan admits that work can sometimes take over, but he has started to delegate so he has more time to spend with his wife, Eiesha (a businesswoman and the daughter of Indian billionaire Sunil Mittal), and their two children. The family live in London.
""I kind of needed to know everything about the business, I'm a control freak,"" he admits.
""It's been an interesting transition, and I'm still learning every day. But I've brought in really smart people who I rely on, and have managed to let go."""

Here's your briefing on some of the most important and interesting stories happening in the week ahead. 1) Ramadan gets under way Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An Iftar meal being prepared at a homeless shelter in Bangladesh
The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins next weekend (when it exactly begins depends on when you see the full moon where you live).
It is the most important month in the calendar for the world's 1.6 billion Muslims, who will fast between dawn and sunset to bring themselves closer to God. Drinking, smoking, sex and ""sinful behaviour"" are also forbidden during fasting hours.
Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, the holy month moves forward roughly 11 days every year. This means for Muslims in the Middle East, Ramadan is moving further away from the longest day of the year (and therefore fasting hours are getting shorter by the year).
In the United Arab Emirates, for example, people will fast for just under 15 hours this year . In the year 2030, it will come down to only 10 hours. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's it like for a family fasting during Ramadan? 2) Do you have anything to add, Mr Barr?
Donald Trump's attorney general, William Barr, will have some tricky questions to answer this week.
Let's rewind a little: special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his investigation into the actions of President Trump and his team.
Mr Barr then wrote a summary of Mr Mueller's report, and gave a press conference reiterating his points before releasing a redacted version of the report.
However, once they'd read the report, Democrats accused Mr Barr of misleading the public and of partisan behaviour. Democratic leaders in Congress said it was ""clear"" the report ""appears to undercut"" Mr Barr's characterisation of it.
He's now agreed to testify before two senate committees, one on Wednesday and the other on Thursday.
If you need to catch up, here are eight things we learned from the Mueller report . 3) Japan gets a new emperor
On Tuesday, Japan's ageing Emperor Akihito will become the first emperor to stand down in two centuries. His son, Crown Prince Naruhito, will take over on Wednesday.
It's the start of a new era in Japan - its name, Reiwa (which signifies order and harmony) will appear on coins, newspapers, driving licences and official paperwork. ( Here's more on the significance of the term and the new era .)
If you're in Japan, it's worth being prepared: the country is celebrating a 10-day holiday, and many basic facilities will stop. Banks will be closed for the whole holiday and the government says ""those planning to withdraw large sums of money during the holiday are advised to do so in advance"".
There's some interesting context about this abdication, too: it is leading to debate about the future of the royal family, and in particular the rule that women may not become emperor. More on that here: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female 4) Squeaky bum time
It was a term coined by former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson for that period of a football game or season when things start to get rather tense.
We are well and truly into squeaky bum time now. With two games of the Premier League season left, only two teams can still win it, and it's the closest title race in years.
Manchester City and Liverpool are neck-and-neck at the top, and both teams are displaying strong form. Liverpool are on course to gain one of the highest ever Premier League points totals - but may still not win it.
This could be a deciding weekend in the title race - Liverpool are away at Newcastle United, and Man City play Leicester City.
It's not likely to be decided this weekend... but everything is possible. Related Topics "
The Wandering Earth and China's sci-fi heritage - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Xueting Christine Ni Chinese Culture Writer,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-47769882,"Image copyright Netflix Image caption The Wandering Earth debuts on Netflix on 30 April The Wandering Earth has been billed as a breakthrough for Chinese sci-fi.
The film tells the story of our planet, doomed by the expanding Sun, being moved across space to a safer place. The Chinese heroes have to save the mission - and humanity - when Earth gets caught in Jupiter's gravitational pull.
Based on Hugo Award winner Liu Cixin's short story of the same name, Wandering Earth has already grossed $600m (£464m) at the Chinese box office and was called China's ""giant leap into science fiction"" by the Financial Times. It's been bought by Netflix and will debut there on 30 April.
But while this may be the first time many in the West have heard of ""kehuan"" - Chinese science fiction - Chinese cinema has a long sci-fi history, which has given support to scientific endeavour, offered escapism from harsh times and inspired generations of film-goers.
So for Western audiences eager to plot the rise of the Chinese sci-fi movie, here are five films I think are worth renewed attention.
Dislocation Huang Jianxin, 1986
For most in the Western world, their first encounter with Chinese cinema came from directors like Wu Tianming (The Old Well, The King of Masks) and Zhang Yimou (House of Flying Daggers, Raise the Red Lantern).
Image copyright NANHAI FILMS Image caption Dislocation explores themes of work and artificial intelligence in a surreal dreamscape They were largely preoccupied with themes like the loss of youth, tradition versus change, and creating the rural aesthetic most people associated with Chinese film.
But China in the 1980s was a scene of rapid modernisation, urbanisation and Westernisation, and films started responding to the impact of this massive change.
In Dislocation, a scientist creates an android version of himself to attend the endless meetings that rob him of his time, in a black comedy of mechanisation and bureaucracy.
Huang's take on the debate on artificial intelligence is superbly delivered against a surreal Kafka-esque dreamscape, with stark lighting and suspenseful music, making this film a delight to watch.
Hopefully the new interest in kehuan will see it gain an official release in the West.
Warrior Revived Li Guomin, 1995
A grown-up style of kehuan emerged in the 1990s, reflecting the themes of identity versus technological advancement which were also occupying Western sci-fi at the time.
Image copyright Shanghai Film Studios Image caption The low budget appearance of Warrior Revived never gets in the way of its creative energy In Warrior Revived, police officer Song Da Wei dies a gruesome death on duty and ends up in a decade-long coma. He's brought back to life by a ""miracle cure"" from a biologist who has found a way to repair defective DNA.
The genetically enhanced Song finds himself uncomfortable with the cyberised world around him, and excluded by his old comrades. Meanwhile, the heavily maimed villain he gave his life to destroy is plotting to steal the gene formula and wreak his revenge.
Like a lot of great cyberpunk movies before the age of CGI, this early mainland kehuan impresses with its high kitsch, low-budget, imaginative approach.
The villain's lair is filled with neon tubes, hand-crafted lab controls and walls covered with plastic bowls in the best traditions of the Tardis.
What it lacks in sleekness it more than makes up with innovative costume designs and soundtrack, diligent camera work and the sheer energy from the cast.
Wonder Boy Song Chong, 1988
The 1980s brought a slew of Hollywood sci-fi films made for children, but which appealed equally to adults - like Explorers, Flight of The Navigator, and D.A.R.Y.L. - and filmmakers in China were taking a similar route.
Image copyright Children’s Film Studio Image caption Wonder Boy remains popular and is still occasionally played out on national TV Produced by the Children's Film Studios and hailed as the nation's first children's fantasy film, Wonder Boy tells the story of a child born with the ability to generate electricity.
Bei Bei is bullied by neighbours and kept in isolation by parents who want to protect him, but is still a caring and mischievous little boy, who uses his powers to help others and have fun in equal measure.
When Bei Bei is taken away to be experimented on - by a non-governmental, possibly foreign group - a handful of the close friends he has made come to his rescue.
Well-loved for its humour and accessibility, Wonder Boy is remembered in China as a great classic, and still enjoyed by children today when it is repeated on both national television and streaming services.
Reset Hong-Seung Yoon, 2017
Produced by Jackie Chan and winner of the 2017 Grand Remi for Best Feature and Best Actress, Reset is a time travel thriller, which addresses a Chinese preoccupation with personal roles in a culture that so totally promotes the good of society.
Xia Tian (Yang Mi) is a senior researcher of wormhole technology and a single mother. When her young son is kidnapped, she is forced to hand over her research, but when the villain murders her child anyway she is forced to test her own discoveries into time travel in order to save his life, and maybe undo her own betrayal of the programme.
Image copyright Beijing Yaoying Movie Distribution Co Ltd Image caption Reset explores the identity struggle facing many modern Chinese women The film is an exploration of the plight of a New Chinese Woman, who walks the line between the roles of highly skilled professional and loving mother. The psychological exploration is fantastic. With several versions of Xia being generated by her repeated time travel, the face-off between our heroine and these alternate selves, including a darker, damaged one, creates an amazing tension which is missing from so many Western takes on this classic trope.
A female-led space kehuan story that also deals with single parenthood couldn't be more relevant in a society that is simultaneously beginning a golden space age, and struggling with attitudes to women's emancipation.
Super Mechs Cui Junjie, 2018
Wuxia, or kung fu fantasy, is so intrinsic to Chinese pop culture it was almost inevitable that its tropes would be incorporated into Chinese sci-fi.
Image copyright Seven Entertainment Pictures Produced exclusively for IQiyi, China's version of Netflix, Super Mechs is set in 2066 in a world where humanity has begun to experience genetic mutations which leave some people with X-Men style super powers.
Global criminal organisations are threatening the order of society and private entities are stepping up to uphold it by developing highly advanced mechanised power suits.
Hero Xiao Qi is an ordinary office clerk enlisted by the Dragon Clan, who reveal to him his latent mutant ice powers, before arming him with a robotic power suit and sending him on a mission. Little does Xiao Qi know that he will be greeted by another mech-suited warrior with fire-based powers who will fight him to a standstill.
The ""warriors with opposite powers"" trope is a staple of the wuxia genre, but the film falls deeper down the rabbit hole when this deadly opponent is revealed to be Xiao Qi's long-lost brother.
Add in ancient warring clans, fast-paced action between the sleek computer-generated mechanical fighters and a cheeky sense of humour from our protagonist, and the high budget Huayi Brothers production appeals to fans of superhero, kung fu and toku/tecuo films alike.
The works of stalwart wuxia authors like Jin Yong are steadily being translated into English, so we will certainly see more from this sub-genre reach our screens.
Acknowledging the rich and varied Chinese science fiction tradition does not at all detract from the pride in the success of Wandering Earth.
With China's growing middle class and increased youth spending power, Chinese filmmakers are increasingly catering for a booming domestic demand for entertainment, and no longer worry as much about making their films palatable for export.
But with more East-West co-productions in the pipeline, like the animated Next Gen which originated from a Chinese web comic, it is certainly a sensible decision for companies like Netflix to bring films from platforms like IQiyi, to an English speaking audience, and that is going to include kehuan.
Western audiences may not immediately ""get"" some of these films, or may feel that some elements do not flow to their expectations.
But Wandering Earth and the titles above are the product of China's culture and worldview. And to some extent, it's what makes them different that will pique interest, fascinate and entertain.

An algorithm wipes clean the criminal pasts of thousands - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Dave Lee North America Technology Reporter,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48072164,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: AI helps clear cannabis conviction backlog This month, a judge in California cleared thousands of criminal records with one stroke of his pen. He did it thanks to a ground-breaking new algorithm that reduces a process that took months to mere minutes. The programmers behind it say: we’re just getting started solving America’s urgent problems.
Piero Salazar is sitting at a wooden table, swamped by paperwork. His anxious family looks on.
He’s one of around 50 or so people who have come to this community centre in San Fernando, near Los Angeles, to take part in an “expungement clinic” - a free service for those looking to get their criminal records removed or reduced. A team of lawyers, working pro bono, sit behind a long counter and call people forward when their number is up.
On this Saturday morning, most here, Mr Salazar included, are seeking to have cannabis-related convictions expunged under California’s Proposition 64, a measure passed in 2016 that made marijuana legal in the state. As part of the new law, those with prior convictions could now seek to have them struck off their record.
Image caption Piero Salazar was one of around 50 people attending the expungement clinic “It makes me feel better to know I’m not a felon,” says Mr Salazar, filling in his forms.
Monique Herrera is here with her young son.
“I want to just get this off. Get clean. Do what I have to do and have a better life.”
It’s estimated there are a million people in California with a cannabis-related charge in their past, an invisible shackle that blocks opportunities to get housing, jobs and thousands of other things most of us would regard as necessities.
Yet, fewer than 3% of people thought to qualify have sought to have their records cleared since the passing of the new law.
It’s thought many are overwhelmed or intimidated by the complex expungement process. The clinic may only come to town once every few months, if at all. Others simply don’t know expungement is possible.
But now, work to automate this entire ordeal has begun - with remarkable results.
The district attorney's plan “I formed the opinion that this is really our responsibility,” said George Gascon, San Francisco’s district attorney.
Though almost 10,000 people in the city were predicted to be eligible for expungement, just 23 had come forward.
So in January 2018, Mr Gascon pledged to proactively review past marijuana cases - but there was a snag.
Image caption San Francisco's District Attorney George Gascon quickly realised doing the task manually would take too long “When we started to do this by hand, we recognised very rapidly that this was going to take a long time.”
He enlisted Code For America, a non-profit organisation that works on creating Silicon Valley-esque solutions to problems within the many antiquated systems powering the US government.
The group had made Clear My Record, a tool that can analyse text in court files, using character recognition to decipher scanned documents.
It discards any record involving a violent crime, as such records do not qualify. For those that remain, the tool automatically fills out the necessary paperwork. In other words, the algorithm replaced the process being done manually at the expungement clinics.
Working with San Francisco’s raw data, Code For America was able to identify 8,132 eligible criminal records in a matter of minutes - in addition to the 1,230 found manually already. They dated as far back as 1975, the year in which the city started digitising its files.
And so it was, on 3 April, that San Francisco judge Samuel K Feng signed them all off - reopening life opportunities for thousands of people.
Human review For cases it wasn’t sure about, the algorithm would refer up to a human.
“It isn’t an algorithm doing something in isolation,” explained Evonne Silva, who helps lead Code For America’s work with the criminal justice system.
“It is actually very much a partnership with the government - the policy, the technology and the process combined.”
Image caption The algorithm is able to interpret the district attorney's raw crime data For Mr Gascon, who is standing stand down this year in order to care for his ailing 90-year-old mother, the move will form a core part of his legacy.
“We created this war on drugs,” he said.
“We - the criminal justice system and society in general - harmed many communities throughout the years. I felt that we had an obligation to right that wrong.”
'The worst of government' You’ll find the Code For America offices in downtown San Francisco, on a street where some of the city’s most visible problems - drug addiction, homelessness - are well out in the open.
The people working for Code For America’s founder Jennifer Pahlka could (and often did) work for the mega corporations of the technology industry. But, instead, they’re here.
“What we can bring is a challenge to the conventional wisdom that says anything in government technology is going to take many years and cost many millions of dollars,” said Ms Pahlka, who served as deputy chief technology officer under President Obama.
“It just requires having a little bit of technology competence. To run an algorithm on a large database, for instance - that's not difficult, technically, and we shouldn’t make it so.”
Image caption The algorithm essentially automates what takes place at the expungement clinic Code For America’s work expands beyond criminal justice and into other areas of need. Ms Pahlka’s team has simplified the system for families to get quickly gain access to social support in an emergency - such as a single mother becoming suddenly unemployed.
In 37 California counties, the process for applying for food stamps has, thanks to a Code For America initiative, been reduced from almost an hour to just eight minutes.
“We work for people who need the government to work the most, because those are also the people who often get the worst of government,” Ms Pahlka said.
“We've got a lot of people in the country right now who need a real safety net. They need to sort of get bounced back when they hit a hard spot. They need the criminal justice system to not pull them down into a cycle of what can become persistent poverty and incarceration.”
'We're not moving quickly enough' This way of thinking is gathering pace. Earlier this month, prosecutors in Los Angeles County announced they too would adopt Clear My Record. They estimated that 50,000 records could be automatically identified for reduction or removal. San Joaquin County, also in California, will use the tech to clear around 4,000 more. Code For America says it aims to help clear 250,000 cannabis convictions this year alone.
“The only downside is that we’re not moving quickly enough,” said Jay Jordan, executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, an advocacy group campaigning for justice reform.
Image caption Following San Francisco's lead, other counties in California are now adopting the technology “We live in a technological age. This is the way that we're supposed to be doing business. And if it streamlines government, saves taxpayers money, and makes us safe… it's a no brainer.”
Mr Jordan says that clearing records is a vital part of rehabilitation, a move that reduces the risk of so-called generational poverty. There are said to be 40,000 “collateral consequences” for those living with a criminal record - more than half relate to employment.
“It affects large swathes of our community,” Mr Jordan said. “People from communities of colour, and urban communities around this country, are riddled with folks with convictions.”
'Asking the world to forgive you' Back in San Fernando, the co-host of the expungement clinic knows these restrictions intimately. As a teen, Anthony Turner committed a number of crimes, including car theft, drink driving and drugs charges. It meant, at 19, he started what would become 12 years in prison.
Image caption Anthony Turner says having a criminal record removed is like ""asking the world to forgive you"" Now 40, he’s an image of reformation. He co-owns a charming community cafe with his wife, Cherokee. He has a 15-year-old son who loves baseball - but Mr Turner isn’t allowed to coach his little league team.
Even though he himself isn’t eligible for criminal record expungement, Mr Turner has devoted his free time to helping others get that help - through running clinics, and lobbying alongside advocacy groups.
He acknowledges some people feel a criminal record is the consequence you bear for committing a crime. But he urges people to look beyond that.
“I say to those who feel that it's tough luck, what they should do is look into themselves and ask what they have wanted to be forgiven for in their lives.
“Because that's what you're doing - you're asking not just for a specific person’s forgiveness, you’re asking the world to forgive you.”

Salmon farming 'pays £100m in British taxes' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-48076828,"Salmon farming 'pays £100m in British taxes' By Douglas Fraser Business and economy editor, Scotland 29 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright PA The salmon farming industry claims to contribute more than £100m in British taxes, although it is controlled by parent companies in Norway.
The industry's trade body commissioned independent economic research into salmon farming's economic impact, partly to face down criticism of it.
The study found turnover of more than £1bn.
The amount of gross value added - a measure of the output from the sector - was £365m at last year's prices.
The impact of the turnover spent through wages and taxes, and the indirect impact on spending through other sectors in Scotland, is thought to take the total impact to double that of revenue, at more than £2bn. Fish farms fail on environmental standards
Richard Marsh, author of the study at 4-consulting, reckoned that the scale of the sector's impact through the economy, including its tax contribution, is higher than most other sectors of the economy.
Much of the spending by the industry takes place in Scotland, and it is a big investor in capital goods. This year, a major new fish feed production plant is to be opened at Kyleakin on Skye. Image copyright Getty Images
The corporation tax contribution for last year is thought to have been £50m, and £24m was paid to HMRC through income tax and national insurance. A further £37m was directly paid, net, on production and products.
Richard Marsh calculated that £76m was paid in wages. The average pay for its 2,300 employees in 2018 was £34,000.
A more detailed study published in 2017, and commissioned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise, found a higher level of value added, though it covers a wider range of aquaculture. The Scottish Salmon Producers Association (SSPO) does not see the way of compiling figures as being comparable.
The SSPO's Hamish Macdonell said: ""An overall economic impact of more than £2bn represents a major benefit to the Scottish economy in itself but with average salaries of £34,000 for the 2,300 people directly employed, the sector is injecting extremely valuable resources into some of Scotland's most fragile, sparsely populated, rural areas as well.""

Climate change being fuelled by soil damage,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48043134,"Environment in multiple crises - report
About 3.2 billion people worldwide are suffering from degraded soils, said IPBES chairman Prof Sir Bob Watson.
""That's almost half of the world population. There’s no question we are degrading soils all over the world. We are losing from the soil the organic carbon and this undermines agricultural productivity and contributes to climate change. We absolutely have to restore the degraded soil we’ve got.""
Prof Watson previously led the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
""Governments have focused on climate change far more than they have focused on loss of biodiversity or land degradation. All three are equally important to human wellbeing.""
Soil expert Prof Jane Rickson from Cranfield University, UK, added: ""The thin layer of soil covering the Earth's surface represents the difference between survival and extinction for most terrestrial life.
""Only 3% of the planet's surface is suitable for arable production and 75 billion tonnes of fertile soil is lost to land degradation every year."" She said soils form at a rate of 1cm in 300 years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brazil lost more than one million hectares of primary forest in 2018
There's uncertainty about the exact level of global soil degradation. But the major hotspots are reported to be in South America, where forests are being felled; sub-Saharan Africa; India and China. Soil scientists in both the biggest Asian nations are worried that their ability to grow their own food may be compromised.
In the US, some soils are being restored as forests take over poor quality land previously worked by small farmers, but others are still being degraded. Image caption The Fen Blow is composed of peaty particles lifted into the air on windy days
The UK is not immune either. Some maize fields in south-west England suffer major soil loss with heavy rainfall because growing maize leaves bare soil exposed. Heavy rain is more likely under climate change. Erosion is also a long-standing issue in the fertile Fens, where, on dry windy days, peaty soil particles sometimes form a kind of smog called the ""Fen Blow"".
Peat has a high carbon content – and a recent paper suggests there’s far more carbon being lost from peatlands than previously thought.
And on the chalky hills of southern England, chemical-intensive crop farming is said to have caused the loss of over a foot of soil in some places.
Soils are ""incredibly important"" for our well-being, said Dr Joanna Clark from Reading University.
""We all know that crops are grown in soil, but soils are important for climate change as well. There's three times more carbon stored in soil than there is in the atmosphere. So imagine if all that carbon was released, we’d get runaway climate change. So we need to keep the carbon in the soil.""
The simplest way to protect soils while combating climate change is to let forests grow back. This option is favoured by fans of re-wilding.
But some farmers believe they can continue to produce food by changing the way they farm to enhance the soil.
Brexit could give the UK greater flexibility on how to spend public money on farming - enabling much more leeway to reward farmers for capturing carbon in the earth. But there are more than 700 soil types in the UK alone, so it won’t be simple."
Obesity: Study of 2.8 million shows increased disease and death risks - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48088391,"Image copyright Getty Images A major study has highlighted the scale of the obesity problem in the UK, with a significant risk of death and disease attached to weight gain.
People with a body mass index (BMI) of 30-35 were at 70% higher risk of developing heart failure than their healthy weight peers (18.5-25 BMI).
The study of 2.8 million adults showed even slightly overweight people were twice as likely to get Type 2 diabetes .
Public Health England said ""sustained action"" was needed to tackle obesity.
The study, to be presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Glasgow, also showed:
For those with a BMI of 35-40, the risk of Type 2 diabetes was almost nine times higher, and 12 times higher for sleep apnoea People with severe obesity (BMI of 40-45) were 12 times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes and had a risk of sleep apnoea that was 22 times greater People with a BMI of 40-45 had triple the risk of heart failure, high blood pressure, and dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of cholesterol and other fats in the blood) BMI of 40-45 was also linked to a 50% higher risk of dying prematurely from any cause The study's author, Christiane Haase, of healthcare firm Novo Nordisk which funded the work, said: ""With the number of people living with obesity almost tripling worldwide over the past 30 years (105 million people in 1975 to 650 million in 2016), our findings have serious implications for public health.""

We calculate BMI using the standard formula of a person's mass in kg divided by the square of their height in metres (kg/m2) and display it to one decimal place.
Where a user's data is entered in imperial units, we first convert to metric and then carry out the BMI calculation.
The BMI result is assigned to a standard category:
Less than 18.5 - underweight
18.5 to 24.9 - healthy weight
25 to 29.9 - overweight
30 to 39.9 - obese (split into two categories for the new study)
40 and over - very obese (also known as morbidly obese)
Obesity and depression linked in children Low calories 'reversed type-2 diabetes' Obesity set to overtake smoking as risk Child obesity 'far worse than thought' The research found that the risk of developing serious health problems was highly dependent on whether or not people already had issues at the start of the study.
For example, having high blood pressure at the start of the study was strongly associated with developing dyslipidaemia, chronic kidney disease and Type 2 diabetes.
Researchers looked at health, death and BMI data from more than 2.8 million adults between January 2000 and July 2018 from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
This was linked with hospital data to estimate the risk for serious health problems.
But the authors stress that their findings show observational differences, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and they point to a number of limitations:
the study participants must have seen their doctor and had their weight measured for a reason other, unmeasured factors may have influenced the results Victoria Taylor, nutrition lead at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""More than a quarter of UK adults (28%) are obese and it's something that we urgently need action on.""

US markets pick up amid global sell-off,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45957674,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AFP US stock markets have begun to recover from a global sell-off, regaining most of their losses in the final hour of trading.
The three major indexes closed between 0.4% and 0.6% lower, having earlier been down over 2% with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both at six-month lows.
The recovery comes after sharp falls in European and Asian markets, with London's FTSE 100 on track for its worst monthly performance in a decade.
Asian stocks also fell overnight.
Analysts said it was hard to pinpoint the global falls on one particular factor.
In Europe, they said the sell-off had been exacerbated by fears over the situation in Italy, which has the second-highest national debt in the eurozone.
The European Commission has told the country to revise its budget , the first time it has ever made such a request.
Meanwhile, there are also fears over the impact on trade of the current situation in Saudi Arabia, where the Kingdom is facing pressure over the death of prominent Saudi critic journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The country is one of the world's largest oil exporters and investors are concerned about the threat of possible sanctions.
ING strategist Benjamin Schroeder blamed ""a concoction of concerns"" for the falls, saying investors' overall sentiment was suffering from trade tensions, fears over Italy and Brexit.
While Charles Schwab analysts said these general fears were ""exacerbating already skittish global sentiment"".
Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said the general tone was ""not good"". He said it was ""hard to say"" what was driving the falls, but ""the old adage that the market hates uncertainty holds true"".
""But it's not all geopolitical noise and fears about rates - some notable earnings announcements have also rocked confidence,"" he said, noting that disappointing performances from 3M and Caterpillar had hit the Dow's performance. Related Topics"
Sri Lanka attacks: Face coverings banned after Easter bloodshed,www.bbc.com,admin,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48088834/,"Home / WORLD NEWS / Sri Lanka attacks: Face coverings banned after Easter bloodshed Sri Lanka attacks: Face coverings banned after Easter bloodshed 3 hours ago WORLD NEWS
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A ban has been put in place but no specific mention of the niqab or burka was made Sri Lanka has banned face coverings in public, following a spate of suicide attacks on Easter Sunday that killed at least 250 people and injured hundreds.
President Maithruipala Sisirsena said he was using an emergency law to impose the restriction from Monday.
Any face garment which “hinders identification” will be banned to ensure national security, his office said.
The niqab and burka – worn by Muslim women – were not specifically named.
The move is perceived as targeting the garments, however.
Sri Lanka remains on high alert eight days after Islamist attacks that hit churches and hotels.
Dozens of suspects have been arrested, but local officials warned that more militants remained at large. How many people are affected?
Sri Lanka has a sizeable and centuries-old Muslim population – out of 21 million, just under 10% are Muslim.
Only a small number of women are thought to wear the face-covering niqab, or the burka – a one-piece veil that covers the face and body.
Last week a Sri Lankan MP had proposed a ban on women wearing the burqa, saying it should be outlawed on security grounds.
According to news outlet India Today, the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, an organisation of Muslim clerics in Sri Lanka, had also asked women to avoid wearing face coverings.
Over the weekend thousands of Sri Lankan troops stood guard on the streets, protecting churches and mosques.
Sunday church services were cancelled across the country as a precaution, but worshippers in the capital gathered to pray outside St Anthony’s Shrine, which was badly damaged in the attacks.
The number of people arrested in connection with the bloodshed rose to 150. Sri Lankan authorities are also hunting for around 140 followers of the jihadist group Islamic State, which has said it was involved in the bombings, but has not given details.
On Friday, the father and two brothers of the alleged organiser of the attacks, Zahran Hashim, were killed in an operation by security forces.
Hashim, who blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo, founded an Islamist group, the NTJ, which authorities have said was behind the attacks."

Sixth of UK workers 'overeducated' says ONS - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48091971,"Almost a third of graduates 'overeducated' for their job 29 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says 31% of graduates are overeducated for the job they are doing.
For those graduating before 1992, the number was only 22%, but this jumped to 34% for those graduating after 2007.
London had the highest proportion of overeducated workers in the UK, with about 25% overqualified for their job.
Graduates in arts and humanities were more likely to be under-using their education. 'Persistent phenomenon'
""We note that the incidence of overeducation does seem higher for certain age groups,"" and in particular for those aged 25 to 49 years, it said.
""The relatively high incidence of overeducation for the 35 to 49 years age group indicates that overeducation is a persistent phenomenon in the UK labour market,"" it said.
The overeducation rate for all workers of about 16% for 2017 is largely unchanged since 2006.
And, while it says it can not be sure, the ONS says priorities for some people over-and-above money may contribute to their below-par post-graduation earnings. This, it says, may account for the unchanging rate of overeducation.
The ONS said it assumed education was a measure of ability and did not distinguish it from skill. It also said it assumed wages as its measure of productivity, meaning the research does not show whether overeducation has an effect on output per worker. What does overeducation mean?
""A person can be overeducated if they possess more education than required for the job,"" the ONS says.
But it also uses the term to mean when a worker's skills and knowledge are not being used.
""It can also be seen as a form of underemployment, hence contributing to the extent of labour market slack,"" the national stats gatherer says.
However, a degree still attracts higher earnings, according to government data from earlier this month. And two degrees will yield even more.
Graduate earnings figures show that up to the age of 30, postgraduates typically earn £9,000, or about 40%, more than those without degrees.
This is double the £4,500 per year gap - about 21% - between those with an undergraduate degree and non-graduates. Case study: Elizabeth
Elizabeth graduated recently from the University of Manchester with a degree in chemical engineering. She has not been able to find a degree-level job and has worked a succession of minimum wage jobs.
""I'm sad to have become one of those statistics of female graduates who never become engineers, and dread the next 50 years in minimum wage jobs, because I have no way of getting out of the situation. I should have realised people don't want to employ women in that field,"" she said.
""I regret my choice of degree every day. I could have been doing anything by now. People ask me why I am a kitchen porter when I can speak languages and have a degree. It's sad that people who are less qualified are much further on in their career than me.
""A lack of a driving licence seems to have proved a huge hindrance to my progression, and in many ways might have been more useful than the degree."" "
Quietly-spoken investor seeks change at Barclays - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48091024,"Image copyright Matt Greenslade Image caption Edward Bramson wants a seat on the board of Barclays. A 68-year-old who speaks so quietly that it can be difficult to hear what he says is making a big noise at Barclays bank.
Edward Bramson has amassed a 5.5% stake in the bank and on Thursday is urging shareholders to elect him to the board.
He wants the bank to scale back its investment division to boost returns at the lender.
Barclays counters that it is already making efforts to boost performance and that he should not be on the board.
'Some sympathy' While few expect him to win at the annual general meeting, Mr Bramson - who was born in the UK and left for the US in the mid-1970s - does have a message that resonates with some major investors.
""We have some sympathy with the concerns he's raised... mainly around the performance of the investment bank and cost control,"" David Cumming, chief investment officer for equities at Aviva Investors, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
""The issue we have is that he's been pretty successful in terms of critiquing aspects of Barclays performance, but hasn't really offered a credible alternative strategy,"" he added.
Barclays on the radar of activist investor Mr Cumming has said Aviva will not back Mr Bramson's attempt to get on Barclays' board, even though the insurer also has a stake in Mr Bramson's investment vehicle, Sherborne Investors.
The approach Mr Bramson is taking at Barclays is similar to he one he has taken at other companies. He buys up a stake, tries to get elected to the board by other shareholders and then sets about cutting costs to boost returns for investors.
'No brainer' It has earned him the title of ""activist"" investor - although it is different from the louder style used by others who also make their money by trying to force through change at companies.
Carl Icahn, for instance, has a twitter account and appears on television channels when embarking upon his efforts to overhaul companies.
Image copyright Getty Mr Bramson's bank challenge is not expected to be successful In 2015, Mr Icahn had his sights on Apple and wrote open letters to chief executive Tim Cook saying the shares are ""still dramatically undervalued"" . He gave interviews in which he described his belief that the shares should be worth more as a ""no brainer"".
Mr Bramson, in contrast, offers his opinion behind closed doors in meetings with influential investors as he tries to win their support.
He is rarely photographed, but the Financial Times has described how he dresses in high-waisted trousers and speaks with a Transatlantic accent.
'Enhanced value' Born in 1951, Mr Bramson is said to have left the UK for New York in 1975 after becoming disillusioned with Harold Wilson's government. His move Stateside was also reportedly precipitated by getting stuck in a lift during one of the power cuts which hit the UK in the early to mid-1970s.
He started out his investment career in private equity - buying companies and selling them off later - through his Hillside Capital business before tweaking his investment approach in 1986 when he founded Sherborne.
Its website lists only one other manager, Stephen Welker, and provides this description of their investment approach: ""We seek to enhance value in our portfolio companies by offering our participation on the board, rather than through majority ownership and control of the company.""
""Our firm's approach provides current shareholders with a new alternative. In the absence of an operational turnaround, shareholders in underperforming companies can choose to continue with the existing situation, sell their shares at a loss, or hope a buyer for the whole company may emerge offering a modest premium to a depressed share price,"" it adds.
Since 2003, when he concentrated his turnaround investing activities as a minority shareholder in publicly-Quote: d companies, Mr Bramson has pursued 10 activist campaigns, six of which saw a member of Sherborne Investors joining those boards.
For instance, in 2011 he became chair of fund manager F&C after tabling resolutions which led to investors voting off the incumbent.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Barclays chief executive Jes Staley He can show persistence.
Take Electra investment trust as an example. He first started building a stake the business, which owns companies such as dining chain TGI Fridays, in 2014, but took two attempts to get elected to the board.
At the time he told the Daily Telegraph in a rare interview : ""Even if we don't win the vote, we're not going away. I've told the board: I think we're OK. They think we're scum, which is fine. It's fear of the unknown.""
In the end he prevailed, stepping down as chief executive in March 2018, just as he was starting to build his stake in Barclays.
He remains on Electra's board and his biography on the website states he has never received any remuneration from the company.
But, it can be a brutal business. So that Electra could return £2bn to investors, it sold off most of its investments. Last year it attempted to find a buyer for what was left but is now in the process of winding itself up.
While Mr Bramson is not expected to be successful on Thursday, the bank's board and its chief executive Jes Staley will be looking for clues as to whether he will walk away - or keep rattling for change."
Apple defends removing parental control apps - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48092151,"Image copyright Getty Images Apple has defended its decision to remove a number of parental control apps from the App Store, citing security concerns.
Several app-makers complained to the New York Times that Apple had taken their products off sale when it launched its own similar tools.
But Apple said the apps were removed because they ""put users' privacy and security at risk"".
It said the apps had been given time to make changes to meet Apple's rules.
The latest version of Apple's iOS mobile operating system added Screen Time tools, which let people see how much time they spend using their favourite apps.
The tools also let parents control how much time their children can spend on apps and websites.
Some app-makers claimed Apple had removed their products from the App Store after Screen Time was launched, and said it was trying to limit competition.
However, in a blog post, Apple said it had taken action against apps that were using ""risky"" Mobile Device Management (MDM) to control children's smartphones.
Apple announces new services Is Apple about to expand its TV business? Many corporations and organisations use MDM to control what employees do on their phones. It lets businesses keep an eye on what staff are doing, and even wipe their phones remotely.
Apple said it was not appropriate for family-focused time management tools to use MDM.
""MDM gives a third party control and access over a device and its most sensitive information, including user location, app use, email accounts, camera permissions, and browsing history,"" Apple said in a blog.
""It is incredibly risky - and a clear violation of App Store policies - for a private, consumer-focused app business to install MDM control over a customer's device.
""Contrary to what The New York Times reported over the weekend, this isn't a matter of competition. It's a matter of security.""
The company said it had given a number of affected apps 30 days to submit updated software that did not break its rules. It said many of the companies did make changes and were not removed.

Bambang Brodjonegoro said President Joko Widodo had chosen to relocate the capital in ""an important decision"".
The new location is not yet known. However state media reports one of the front runners is Palangkaraya, on the island of Borneo.
Jakarta, home to over 10 million people, is sinking at one of the fastest rates in the world.
The announcement comes after Mr Widodo declared victory in the country's general election earlier this month, though official results will not be announced until May 22.
Why move the capital? The idea of moving the capital has been floated several times since the country gained independence from the Dutch in 1945.
In 2016, a survey found that the mega-city had the world's worst traffic congestion . Government ministers have to be escorted by police convoys to get to meetings on time.
The planning minister says snarl-ups in Jakarta costs the economy 100 trillion rupiah ($6.8bn, £5.4bn) a year.
There has also been a huge programme to decentralise government for the last two decades in a bid to give greater political power and financial resources to municipalities.
Jakarta metro to battle notorious traffic Why Indonesia's capital Jakarta is sinking Jakarta is also one of the fastest-sinking cities in the world.
Researchers say that large parts of the megacity could be entirely submerged by 2050 . North Jakarta sunk 2.5m (eight feet) in 10 years and is continuing to sink an average of 1-15cm a year.

Image copyright Image caption The suspect was being detained at Silivri prison, on the outskirts of Istanbul One of two men detained two weeks ago by Turkey on suspicion of spying for the United Arab Emirates has killed himself in prison, prosecutors say.
The suspect, identified as Zaki Hasan, was found hanged in his cell in Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, on Sunday.
He allegedly confessed during interrogation that he and the other suspect had spied on Arab dissidents.
Turkish officials said they were also probing possible links to the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Khashoggi – a prominent US-based critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – was killed by Saudi agents when he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October.
A UN special rapporteur has said he was “the victim of a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated by officials of the state of Saudi Arabia”, but the Saudi government has insisted it was a “rogue operation”.
The UAE is Saudi Arabia’s closest Arab ally, but there has been no evidence to suggest that it was involved in Khashoggi’s death.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One of the two suspects is said to have arrived in Turkey days after Jamal Khashoggi was killed
The two men detained in Turkey on 15 April were charged four days later with “political, military and international espionage” after they allegedly confessed to spying on exiled dissidents and students for the UAE.
At the time of their detention Turkish officials said that one of the two suspects had arrived in Turkey only a few days after the killing of Khashoggi. The other suspect had arrived later to assist his colleague, the officials added.
The men were subsequently identified by TRT Arabic, a subsidiary of Turkey’s state broadcaster, as Palestinians. It said Mr Hasan was a 55-year-old retired senior Palestinian intelligence official.
The Istanbul prosecutor’s office said in a statement that Mr Hasan was found hanging from a bathroom door in his cell by prison guards when they arrived to give him food on Sunday morning.
An investigation had been launched and a post mortem carried out, it added.
The UAE has so far not commented on Mr Hasan’s death or his arrest."
Norway finds 'Russian spy whale' off Arctic coast - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48090616,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is this whale a Russian spy? A beluga whale found off Norway's coast wearing a special Russian harness was probably trained by the Russian navy, a Norwegian expert says.
Marine biologist Prof Audun Rikardsen said the harness had a GoPro camera holder and a label sourcing it to St Petersburg. A Norwegian fisherman managed to remove it from the whale.
He said a Russian fellow scientist had told him that it was not the sort of kit that Russian scientists would use.
Russia has a naval base in the region.
The tame beluga repeatedly approached Norwegian boats off Ingoya, an Arctic island about 415km (258 miles) from Murmansk, where Russia's Northern Fleet is based. Belugas are native to Arctic waters.
Norway's public broadcaster NRK has put out a video showing the beluga's harness being released.
Prof Rikardsen told the BBC that the harness ""was attached really tightly round its head, in front of its pectoral fins and it had clips"". He said there was a GoPro attachment, but no camera.
""A Russian colleague said they don't do such experiments, but she knows the navy has caught belugas for some years and trained them - most likely it's related to that,"" he said.

International outcry over Russian 'whale jail' Russia jails Norwegian for spying on submarines What makes Russia’s new spy ship Yantar special? A Russian reserve colonel, who has written previously about the military use of marine mammals, shrugged off Norway's concern about the beluga. But he did not deny that it could have escaped from the Russian navy.
'Combat roles' Interviewed by Russian broadcaster Govorit Moskva, Col Viktor Baranets said ""if we were using this animal for spying do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'please call this number'?""
""We have military dolphins for combat roles, we don't cover that up,"" he said.
""In Sevastopol (in Crimea) we have a centre for military dolphins, trained to solve various tasks, from analysing the seabed to protecting a stretch of water, killing foreign divers, attaching mines to the hulls of foreign ships.""
The dolphin facility in Crimea used to be under Ukrainian control, but was seized by the Russian navy in 2014, when Russian forces took over the peninsula.
Prof Rikardsen, who teaches at the University of Tromso, said ""belugas, like dolphins and killer whales, are quite intelligent - they are Arctic animals and quite social, they can be trained like a dog"".
He said the harness was difficult to remove - the last clip was undone by attaching a hook to it and letting the whale drag the Norwegian fishing boat.
""The beluga had come to the boats repeatedly for two or three days, looking for food, with its mouth open,"" he told the BBC.
""It's a challenge now if the whale will adjust to natural food. Also it needs to find a group - if not, it will probably still come up to a boat.""

Mastercard and Visa agree to cut overseas card fees - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48098100," Mastercard and Visa have both agreed to cut their fees for tourists using their cards in the EU, after a long-running battle with the European Commission.
The credit card firms will now charge retailers around 40% less on non-EU credit and debit cards payments.
The European Commission said the deal would lead to ""lower prices for European retailers to do business"".
Ultimately, the commission said this should lead to lower prices for tourists to the European Union.
The European Commission, which has waged a decades-long crackdown on payment and credit card fees, believes that so-called interchange fees - which the credit card firms charge businesses for accepting payments from consumers - result in higher prices.
According to the terms of the deal, Visa, the world's largest payments network operator, and rival Mastercard, will charge a 0.2% fee on non-EU debit card payments carried out in shops and a 0.3% fee on credit card payments, the Commission said.
This would bring their fees in line with those charged for EU cards.
'Important milestone' The newly agreed rates will come into force on 19 October and apply for five years.
Ultimately the hope is that the EU agreement will make it cheaper when a person uses their debit or credit card overseas.
Visa said it had played ""a central role negotiating a resolution that achieves the best outcome for all parties.""
""European merchants and cardholders continue to enjoy the significant benefits of international card payments, both in store and online, which make an important contribution to European economies,"" it added.
Mastercard said the closure of this antitrust case ""was an important milestone for the company"".
Earlier this year, the European Commission fined Mastercard €573m ($650m, £504m) for anti-competitive behaviour.
It said Mastercard had prevented retailers using cheaper banking services outside their home country.

Labour is planning a ""revolution"" for the UK economy, John McDonnell has told the BBC.
The shadow chancellor was speaking to Newsnight for a series of reports to mark 40 years since the election of Margaret Thatcher.
He said he saw parallels between today and 1979 when Mrs Thatcher swept to power in a major political sea-change.
""Things aren't working for people, so they're looking for change,"" Mr McDonnell said.
Asked whether Labour's plans represented evolution or revolution he said: ""OK it will be a revolution. Transformative - because we are going to change society and that's what's demanded of us now.""
He added: ""And do you know? I think most people accept that now. We'll do it by taking people with us. But it will be done on a very pragmatic basis.

Labour is advocating higher taxes on the wealthy and companies, a major expansion of public investment, the re-nationalisation of certain utilities and moves to give many more workers a direct financial ownership stake in their firms.
Critics and advocates alike say this would represent a major break from the Thatcherite legacy of lower taxes, free markets, deregulation and privatisation.
'Something big' Speaking in the same Newsnight film on the future of the UK's economic settlement, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, agreed the UK was on the verge of a major change.
""I do think there is something happening, something big. Politics is now debating ideas again from first principles. We went through a few years - the Blair years, the Cameron years - where it was all about managerial politics... now we are having a more fundamental debate about our economy.""
But she rejected Labour's policy agenda, particularly on tax and a bigger role for the state.
""I think higher taxes just choke economic growth,"" she said.
""Money that is taken in taxes is money that can't be invested in the wider economy. I look at countries like Japan and Korea which run very successful economies and the size of the state is lower.
""There's no reason we can't be more successful. Our challenge as a government is to raise economic growth. Getting growth up means more money is going into tax and public services.""

He has not been seen since 2014, when he proclaimed from Mosul the creation of a ""caliphate"" across parts of Syria and Iraq.
In this new footage, Baghdadi acknowledges defeat at Baghuz, the group's last stronghold in the region.
It is not clear when the video was recorded. IS says it was shot in April.
The footage was posted on the militant group's al-Furqan media network.
A US State Department spokesman said the tapes would be inspected by analysts to ascertain their authenticity, adding that the US-led coalition remains committed to ensuring any IS ""leaders who remain are delivered the justice that they deserve"".
What does he say? Baghdadi says that he has had pledges of allegiance from militants in Burkina Faso and Mali, and talks about the protests in Sudan and Algeria - saying jihad is the only solution to ""tyrants"". Both countries have seen their long-term rulers overthrown this month.

At the time, he appeared to be trying to shift attention away from his group's crippling losses, BBC Middle East correspondent Martin Patience says.
But this latest 18-minute video addresses the losses head on.
""The battle for Baghuz is over,"" he says, before adding: ""There will be more to come after this battle.""
He also reportedly says the group is fighting a ""battle of attrition"".
Defeated, but not giving in Analysis by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner
For his hardcore followers, there is almost as much symbolism in this video as there is content.
The underlying message is not just one of survival against the odds. The optics here are vintage Osama Bin Laden: the jihadist leader squatting cross-legged in an anonymous room beside a short, personalised, paratrooper version of an AK assault rifle, the quasi-military fishing waistcoat, the attentive companions calmly discussing plans, and the long, prematurely ageing grey beard (he is only 47).
Over the last five years, Islamic State has largely eclipsed al-Qaeda on the media front. At the same time, IS has been reaching out to potential jihadist affiliates in areas of Africa and Asia that have previously looked to al-Qaeda for support.
The overriding aim of this video is clear: to show that despite its resounding military defeat IS has survived and that its leader, with a $25m bounty on his head, is still at large.
What happened to the 'caliphate'? At its peak, IS ruled over 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) stretching across the Iraq-Syria border.
But by 2016 it was a group in retreat. The next year, it lost Mosul in Iraq, depriving Baghdadi and his followers of the city where they had declared the caliphate's creation.
In October 2017, they were driven from Raqqa , in Syria.
They continued to lose territory throughout 2018, culminating in the group retreating to Baghuz.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared they had taken control of the town , announcing the end of the five-year ""caliphate"" in March 2019.
Who is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was born in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq.
As a child he is said to have had a passion for Koranic recitation and religious law, chastising members of his own family for falling short of his stringent religious standards.
But it was during his time in graduate school, when he was completing a Master's and PhD in Koranic Studies at Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies, that he became involved with hardline Islamist groups.
Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? By the end of 2000 he had embraced Salafist jihadism, and would go on to become involved with al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) - from which the Islamic State militant group was born.
Since his 2014 public appearance he has remained silent for long periods, punctuated only by unconfirmed reports of his death and a few unverified audio recordings."

Fishermen in Norway discovered a friendly Beluga whale in the waters - equipped with mysterious equipment from Russia.
One marine biologist said no scientist used equipment like it - and he was convinced the Russian navy had been training what was obviously a tame whale used to humans.
The fishermen and local animal rescue freed the whale of its harness and sent it on its way. 29 Apr 2019"
"Woodstock 50 anniversary festival cancelled, investor says - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48100010,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Miley Cyrus had been lined up to appear at the festival A three-day festival to mark the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock festival has been cancelled four months before it was due to take place, the main financial backer says.
Rapper Jay-Z, singer Miley Cyrus and the Killers band had all been booked to play at Woodstock 50 in New York state.
The chief funder said it could not ensure the ""health and safety of the artists, partners and attendees"".
The festival organiser ""vehemently denied"" it had been cancelled.
""Woodstock 50 vehemently denies the festival's cancellation and legal remedy will (be) sought,"" the organiser told US local newspaper the Poughkeepsie Journal.
Image Copyright @woodstockfest @woodstockfest Report Image Copyright @woodstockfest @woodstockfest Report But Japanese PR and advertising giant Dentsu Aegis Network whose investment arm Amplifi Live is the lead funder for the festival, said it had a clause in its contract with the organisers that gave it the option to cancel the festival.
Reports suggested that $30m (£23.2m) had already been spent on booking the artists. Dentsu declined to comment on the figure, but told the BBC that all contractual obligations had been met.
The firm said the decision to cancel the festival had been made after careful consideration.
""As difficult as it is, we believe this is the most prudent decision for all parties involved,"" the firm added.
Artists including Dead and Co, Imagine Dragons, The Lumineers, Chance the Rapper, Sturgill Simpson, Halsey and Cage the Elephant had been lined up to play at the three-day event due to take place from 16 to 18 August.
Around 100,000 people were expected to attend.
First signs of problems emerged when the festival tickets did not go on sale on 22 April as planned.
The original August 1969 Woodstock festival, billed as ""three days of peace and music,"" is regarded as one of the pivotal moments in music history symbolising much of the idealism of the 1960s."
Google owner Alphabet misses sales forecasts - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48099862,"Image copyright Reuters Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its shares drop in after-hours trading after the internet giant missed revenue forecasts.
Alphabet, which also owns YouTube, reported $36.3bn (£28bn) in sales for the first quarter, below expectations of $37.33bn.
Profits also fell during the three months to 31 March.
It was impacted by a fine from the European Commission for blocking rival online search advertisers.
Google had to pay €1.5bn (£1.3bn) after it was accused of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party competitors from displaying search adverts between 2006 and 2016.
Including the fine, Alphabet's operating profit dropped to $6.6bn from a previous $7.6bn.
Sales growth slowed to 17% in the first three months of the year, below the expansion rate of the previous three months and down from a 26% increase in the same period last year.
Alphabet's share price dropped nearly 7% in after-hours trading.
Ad fears Alphabet also said that the rate of growth in ""paid clicks"" decelerated, slowing to 39% growth compared to 59% at the beginning of 2018.
Under the model, companies pay a fee each time one of their adverts is clicked on.
Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the firm was experimenting with its ad products as users grow reliant on mobile devices and that it was seeing revenue volatility as a result.
The majority of the firm's revenues (84.5%) came from Google's ad business, which sells links, banners and commercials across its own websites and apps and those of partners.
Google's three billion users help make it the world's largest seller of internet ads, according to market research firm EMarketer.
George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Another EU fine won't have washed well with investors, but in reality it's not the cheque on its way to Brussels that's causing the shares to drop.
""Instead, it's a nasty combination of growth in traffic to Google ads slowing and lower revenue per click from those ads that's upset the market."""
Alex Hales withdrawn from England World Cup squad - BBC Sport,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/48090055,"Alex Hales withdrawn from England World Cup squad 29 Apr Read more about sharing. Alex Hales was previously suspended and fined by the ECB following an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September 2017 Alex Hales has been withdrawn from England's preliminary World Cup squad to ensure the team is ""free from any distractions"", the England & Wales Cricket Board has said.
Last week, a spokesman for the batsman said he had been suspended following an ""off-field incident"".
Hales, 30, was part of a provisional 15-man squad named for the World Cup.
A statement from Hales' management company said the decision has left him ""devastated"".
ECB chief Ashley Giles said: ""I want to make it clear this is not the end of Alex's career as an England player.""
The ECB has refused to say what Hales has done to warrant his withdrawal, citing confidentiality concerns.
Hales missed Nottinghamshire's One-Day Cup games last week for what the county described as ""personal reasons"".
The incident happened last year, and the player's spokesman added: ""While the issue is not cricket-related, he accepted it was right he was suspended.""
The ECB says he has also been removed from the England squad for the one-day international against Ireland on Friday, as well as the Twenty20 international and ODI series against Pakistan.
A replacement for the World Cup squad must be named by 23 May, when final squads are submitted to the International Cricket Council.
""We have thought long and hard about this decision,"" added Giles, the ECB's managing director of England men's cricket.
""We have worked hard to create the right environment around the England team and need to consider what is in the best interests of the team, to ensure they are free from any distractions and able to focus on being successful on the pitch.
""The ECB and the PCA (Professional Cricketers' Association) will continue to aid Alex and work alongside his county club Nottinghamshire to give him the support he needs, to help him fulfil his potential as a professional cricketer.""
Hales' management company said in a statement it is ""hugely disappointed at the treatment"" of the cricketer.
It said the ECB ""insisted on Alex taking certain rehabilitation measures following his suspension"" and that, ""at every stage, Alex fulfilled his obligations and both he and his representatives were given assurances that any suspension - again under the ECB's guidelines - could not affect his selection for the World Cup"".
The statement added: ""The fact all those assurances seem to have been rendered meaningless has understandably left Alex devastated. He will take time to reflect on both his actions and the subsequent decisions, but will receive the support from his team he deserves.""
Hales has played 11 Tests, 70 one-day internationals and 60 T20 matches for England.
He is now regarded as a white-ball specialist, however, and in 2018 signed a new contract with Nottinghamshire to play only limited-overs matches until the end of the 2019 season.
It is the second time he has been suspended, following his punishment - which also included a fine - for an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September 2017.
The England limited-overs batsman did not face any criminal charges, while team-mate Ben Stokes was cleared of affray at a trial.
In addition to the incident in Bristol, Hales was charged in relation to ""inappropriate images"".
Speaking to the Guardian earlier this month, the batsman said the fallout from the incident had been a ""lesson learned the incredibly hard way"", and subsequently told BBC Sport he believed he deserved a ""second chance"" after he and his team-mates were ""caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time"".

US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein quits - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48100665,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Rod Rosenstein: ""We enforce the law without fear or favour"" Rod Rosenstein, the US deputy attorney general who oversaw the special counsel inquiry into President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia, has resigned.
Mr Rosenstein, who had a fraught working relationship with Mr Trump, will step down on 11 May in a departure that had been expected for months.
In his letter, he paid tribute to Mr Trump, even praising the president's ""courtesy and humour"".
Mr Trump once tweeted an image showing Mr Rosenstein jailed for treason.
Mr Rosenstein - who was originally appointed by Republican President George W Bush - had been expected to resign in March following the appointment of William Barr as attorney general.
But the justice department second-in-command stayed in the job a while longer to help Mr Barr manage a redacted public release of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
The report did not determine that the Trump campaign had conspired with Russia to sway the 2016 election, but did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Mueller report - in 60 seconds What does Rosenstein's resignation letter say? In his letter, Mr Rosenstein praises some of what he calls the Department of Justice's achievements and its employees' ""devotion to duty"".
""I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humour you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity,"" he wrote, addressing the president directly.
""The Department of Justice pursues those goals while operating in accordance with the rule of law. The rule of law is the foundation of America. It secures our freedom, allows our citizens to flourish, and enables our nation to serve as a model of liberty and justice for all.""
He goes on to say that ""truth is not determined by opinion polls"".
""We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.""
In his conclusion, he echoes one of Mr Trump's campaign slogans: ""We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first.""
The White House said Mr Trump had already nominated Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen to replace Mr Rosenstein.
The White House revolving door: Who's gone? A not-so-subtle rebuke Rod Rosenstein is leaving the justice department, and he's doing it on his own terms.
Not too long ago, such a dignified exit would have come as a real surprise to most observers.
Donald Trump frequently seemed to view Mr Rosenstein as an internal threat. It got so bad that Mr Rosenstein reportedly expressed fear that he would be unceremoniously sacked via presidential tweet.
Rosenstein managed to navigate the hazardous terrain of the Trump administration, however, seeing the special counsel investigation that he initiated to its conclusion. It is that Russia inquiry, with its no-Trump-conspiracy conclusion and open question on presidential obstruction, that will be Mr Rosenstein's legacy.
Mr Rosenstein announced his departure with a six-paragraph mini-lecture on the importance of respect for the rule of law, and of a justice department free from political influence.
That could be viewed as a not-so-subtle rebuke of the president's near-constant badgering of justice department officials, although it will almost certainly fall on deaf ears.
Perhaps, however, it will allow the long-time government lawyer a measure of satisfaction, believing he had the last word.
In this administration, that is a not unremarkable achievement.
Why were Rosenstein and Trump at odds? In May 2017, Mr Rosenstein was left in charge of appointing someone to oversee the Russia investigation after Mr Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.
Jeff Sessions, who was attorney general at the time, had already recused himself, meaning that his deputy had to take on the responsibility.
Mr Rosenstein surprised the White House by appointing Mr Mueller, a former FBI director.
The deputy attorney general spent the past two years overseeing Mr Mueller's work and defending the inquiry from attacks by Mr Trump, who continually condemned the probe as a ""witch hunt"".
Mr Rosenstein's departure seemed imminent after the New York Times last September reported that he had discussed ousting Mr Trump.
Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper said Mr Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording the president in order to prove he was dysfunctional.
He had supposedly cited the 25th amendment of the constitution, which allows for the removal of a president if deemed unfit for office.
Mr Rosenstein dismissed the claims as ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"", and a justice department source told the BBC at the time that the comment had been sarcastic.
But former acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe said in a TV interview that Mr Rosenstein was serious when he suggested wearing a wire inside the White House to covertly tape the president.
Mr Trump accused Mr Rosenstein on Twitter of ""illegal and treasonous"" activity.
While the deputy attorney general managed to weather that controversy, Mr Trump in November retweeted an image of the deputy attorney general behind prison bars.

WeWork office giant plans US share listing - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48100017,"Image copyright WeWork Shared office provider WeWork has filed paperwork to enable it to list its shares on the US stock market as it seeks further funds for expansion.
The firm offers shared office space and services, allowing clients to shrink or grow their number of desks for the period they need them for.
Founded in the US in 2010, WeWork is already London and New York's largest private office occupier.
But it has yet to make a profit, with losses last year doubling to $1.9bn.
""After a lot of thought, last week we decided to file the first amendment to our submission, which is a step towards allowing us to decide to become a public company,"" chief executive Adam Neumann wrote in a letter to staff.
The firm's business model is based on short-term revenue agreements and long-term loan liabilities.
Ratings agencies have given it a ""junk"" or risky credit score because it has borrowed heavily to fund its expansion.
Despite this, the firm - which operates in 600 cities globally - was valued at some $47bn by private investors when it raised fresh funding in January.
Are internet unicorns really worth billions? Flexible office space 'set to soar' Is Uber really worth $90bn? The flexibility of WeWork's business model has proved popular with small employers and workers who enjoy the modern collaborative feel of a shared office, as well as larger employers who are not forced to sign long leases on expensive, bespoke, trophy buildings.
Perks such as free beer for tenants of WeWork offices in New York proved so popular that the company was forced to impose a four pint limit per person after reports of inappropriate behaviour.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Several US start-ups have rushed to list their shares recently The New York firm said it had filed its registration for the public stock market listing confidentially in December.
The confidential filing allows firms to kickstart the listing process before providing key information about their finances.
""This process will enable WeWork to make the decision to become publicly traded, subject to market and other conditions,"" it said.
The firm provided no information on how much money it would seek to raise, its valuation or the timing of its offering.
The plan to sell shares comes after Japanese tech giant SoftBank invested $2bn in the company in January, well below the $16bn WeWork was reported to have been seeking.
WeWork's plan comes amid a rush of share listings from similar start-up firms including ride-hailing app Uber and other tech firms including online scrapbook company Pinterest."

India student leader 'a symbol of protest' against PM Modi - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48090304," Image caption Mr Kumar is a candidate for the Communist Party of India A district in one of India's poorest states has made national headlines in the ongoing general election after a firebrand student leader decided to run for a seat there. Kanhaiya Kumar, who was charged with ""sedition"" for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans and spent a few weeks in jail in 2016, is a candidate from Begusarai constituency where voting was held on Monday. Neha Thirani Bagri reports.
It is early morning in the Bihari village of Bihat, when Kanhaiya Kumar emerges from his home.
He is immediately swamped by young men rushing to shake his hand, asking to take selfies with him, wearing t-shirts emblazoned with his image.
Mr Kumar, who grew up here, shot to fame in 2016 when he was arrested and charged with sedition.
Then a student union leader at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, he was accused of chanting anti-India slogans at a campus event to commemorate the anniversary of the hanging of Mohammed Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri man convicted of plotting the 2001 attacks on the Indian parliament.
Kanhaiya Kumar: India's most loved and loathed student His arrest became the rallying cry for critics of the Hindu nationalist politics of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with student protests organised across the country.
Mr Kumar is still fighting the charge of sedition, a colonial-era statute that has been used to clamp down on dissent in India, which he calls ""completely false propaganda.""
""Kanhaiya Kumar has become a symbol of protest against the politics which is represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" said Sanjay Kumar, director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.
Mr Kumar has since completed his PhD. On Monday, he had his first foray into politics, when he ran for election in the constituency of Begusarai in the fourth phase of polling in the Indian election. Votes will only be counted in late May.
The constituency was once a communist stronghold known as the ""Leningrad of Bihar.""
""This was not a choice, to enter politics. It was a forced responsibility,"" Mr Kumar said during a full day of campaigning before his constituency went to the polls.
Mr Kumar is from the Communist Party of India (CPI), the influence of which has been waning over the past few years.

If they are attempting to invoke a particular religion and change the character of the state, then, of course, we will oppose this.""
While Mr Modi swept to a historic victory in India's last election in 2014 on the promise of better days ahead, many rural Indians have been disappointed with rising unemployment and an agrarian crisis.
Mr Modi and other BJP leaders have been criticised for spouting communally-charged rhetoric and remaining silent in the face of increasing religious violence.
Kanhaiya Kumar: 'Sedition' student returns to JNU with fiery speech The main opposition Congress party has struggled to mount a strong challenge, though gained some momentum with victories in key state elections last year.
Bihar, India's third most populous state, elects 40 members out of 545 to India's lower house of parliament. In the 2014 general election, the BJP won 22 of the 40 seats.
On Monday, Mr Kumar went up against BJP's Giriraj Singh, who once said that those who oppose Mr Modi should go to Pakistan. It was a three-way contest with the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which has fielded a Muslim candidate.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Kanhaiya Kumar talks about his politics ""Right now, people's real issues have vanished from the conversation,"" said Mr Kumar.
He has become known for often emphasising education, jobs, public healthcare, and minority rights in his speeches.
Mr Kumar has garnered the support of civil rights campaigners, activists, and celebrities from across India.
His outsized social media presence has also made him particularly popular with young people, many of whom are drawn towards Mr Kumar's charismatic personality, fiery oratory, and local roots.
'Connect with the young' Videos of his speeches, often critical of the BJP and right-wing politics, have garnered millions of views on YouTube and Facebook.
""Kanhaiya's thinking connects with us young people,"" said Pankaj Kumar, 24, adding that he often shares the politician's speeches with his friends on WhatsApp.
""If Kanhaiya wins at least we will have pride - it was because of him that Begusarai became famous in India and even the whole world.""
 Image caption Mr Kumar's fiery speeches have drawn in voters Mr Kumar's speeches have also attracted a sizeable number of Muslim voters - many in the district were vocal supporters of him.
""People with power in this country are only thinking about how to create religious division,"" said Mohammed Shoaib Alam.
""Kanhaiya will raise his voice for the issues of poor people,"" he added.
While Mr Kumar's popularity has drawn national attention to the contest for the parliamentary seat from this remote constituency, his victory is far from certain.
""All odds are against him,"" said Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, adding that Mr Kumar did not benefit from having the backing of a large political party or coalition or the consolidated vote from one community.
""If he pulls this off - and he is massively popular on the ground - it would just be a testament to his individual political skill.""

Operators say government should lose oversight of rail - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48096549," An independent body should oversee the rail network, according to Britain's railway companies.
In submissions made to a government-appointed review into rail, the firms also said long-distance routes should be serviced by more than one company.
The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) added that control of commuter routes could be handed over to local authorities.
It suggested commuter routes could be organised in a similar way to Transport for London in the capital.
Local government oversees timetables and organisation in London, with private operators subcontracted to provide the services.
""We are suggesting replacing the current franchise system as it stands at the moment,"" RDG regional director Robert Nisbet told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""These proposals would result in a much more joined-up railway and greater accountability to passengers.
""We believe that would be best done by a system of dynamic contracts around the country.
""There would be an overarching apolitical body that would be in charge of this system, dealing with the trade-offs, but also policing it and issuing rules that bind and fines that bite.
""We are putting forward what we think is a compelling vision for both the public and private sectors working together in partnership, underpinned by an easier fare system which would deliver the best fare for any passenger whenever they took their journey.""
The Strategic Rail Authority, which was established in 2000, used to carry out this role, but it was abolished in 2004.
Cable thefts lead to more train delays, says Network Rail Operators say government should lose oversight of rail Rail regulator orders Network Rail to improve performance Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said: ""In the major northern cities, and across the Northern Powerhouse, this devolution would make it possible to integrate transport better.
""This is already being worked towards, with more touch-in-and-out travel within - and in between - our towns and cities in the North.
""This would be used by more of us as passengers if the government supports the fare system being reformed more quickly.""
If you found the plot of Avengers: Endgame hard to follow - constant jumps backward and forward in time and endless reprises of old plots - then you can give up now on trying to understand what is happening on the reshaping of the railways.
There has been constant discussion of the best structure for the industry since privatisation in the late 1990s.
There is a well-established pattern: pressure for change gradually builds up to a reorganisation, which is given a short period of grace before the cycle begins again.
We are at the late stages of a cycle, with Keith Williams, the former British Airways chief executive, in charge of delivering the new structural plan.
The Rail Delivery Group's plans follow the Avengers: Endgame model - there are blasts from the past and missed ideas that have been tried before. The idea for a new central, non-political rail authority is both.
There was a Strategic Rail Authority, which did some good - and along the way, trod on many important people's toes - which might have played a part in its eventual disbanding in 2004.
Handing control of commuter routes to local authorities is an extension of what has already happened on some London commuter routes, with the creation of the London Overground, while the idea for competition between inter-city operators is straight out of Sir John Major's original privatisation blueprint.
Mr Williams' task is to make sense of this convoluted plot and produce a plan that survives beyond the normal cycle of change.
Currently, most UK rail services are operated by fixed-term franchises, which involve the Department for Transport (DfT) setting out a specification covering areas such as service levels, upgrades and performance.
Train companies then submit bids to run the franchise and the DfT selects one of the applicants.
Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said the RDG was proposing a ""deregulated free-for-all"" that would lead to fare rises for customers.
The RDG's vision is likely to be seen as an attempt to stave off nationalisation, as proposed by Labour.
But the government has said privatisation has helped ""transform"" the industry.
The UK's rail network has been beset by problems, with the East Coast Mainline brought back under government control in May - for the third time in a decade.
Image copyright PA Last year, hundreds of trains were cancelled amid a huge timetable reorganisation on services including Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern.
This month, Stagecoach was barred from three rail franchise bids, including one in partnership with Virgin Group. The DfT disallowed the bids because they did not meet pensions rules.
Virgin was bidding to renew the West Coast franchise in partnership with Stagecoach and France's SNCF.
Stagecoach had also applied for the East Midlands and South Eastern franchises, both of which have been rejected.
Keith Williams, former chief executive of British Airways, is due to deliver a report on the future of the industry this autumn.

How tech is bringing Israelis and Palestinians together - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Melissa Jun Rowley,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48053200,"Image copyright Tech2Peace Image caption Palestinian Zada Haj says the Tech2Peace program has helped her make new Israeli friends Israeli and Palestinian youths are joining together, learning new skills and engaging in conflict resolution dialogue thanks to a number of new technology partnerships in the troubled region. Can tech really make a difference?
Israel may be known as the Start-up Nation, famed for its tech start-ups that are supported by one of the largest venture-capital industries per capita in the world.
But Israeli-Palestinian relations have been relentlessly grim ever since the foundation of Israel in 1948 and the subsequent Arab-Israeli conflict that has been rumbling on ever since.
Initiatives like Tech2Peace are trying to bridge divides between the two communities.
Israel and the Palestinians ""I joined the programme alone, but made many great friends from both Palestine and Israel, who I am in touch with today,"" says participant Zada Haj.
 In a fractured land, many young people from opposite sides never meet each other The student and volunteer-led programme brings Israeli and Palestinian youths together to learn tech skills - 3D and graphic design, website creation, app development - and to engage in conflict resolution dialogue.
Ms Haj says she had ""zero knowledge"" of animation or 3D modelling before, but by the end of the session she was able to turn her ideas into creation and develop skills that would help her get a job.
Palestinian entrepreneur Adnan Awni Jaber also says Tech2Peace was the gateway for him to make Jewish friends in Israel.
""I believe that technology can break walls between any two sides of the conflict because it's borderless,"" he tells the BBC.
""There's no physical border than can keep these two sides from contacting each other.""
Image copyright Adnan Awni Jaber Image caption Jerusalem-born Adnan Awni Jaber says technology can ""break walls"" between people Abdallah Sakran, another programme participant, says talking both politics and tech brought his group closer together.
""At first it was awkward, but by the third day we were discussing deep thoughts and our political opinions,"" he says. ""The tech seminar part had us helping each other and asking questions.""
Tomer Cohen, a Tech2Peace co-founder who's an Israeli, participated in peace camps when he was growing up in Israel, but found that after the programmes finished, the friendships that had developed disappeared. The young people on both sides would go back to their regular lives.
So when he and his Israeli and Palestinian co-founders were thinking of ways they could foster long-term partnerships between youngsters, they came up with the idea of giving them life skills that could enable them to continue working together.
Image copyright Tomer Cohen Image caption Tech2Peace co-founder Tomer Cohen believes tech skills help create longer-term friendships ""We thought, OK, let's do this with technology and programming,"" says Mr Cohen. ""When young people come to our seminar, they're not thinking, 'OK, you're Palestinian and I'm Israeli,' they're thinking, 'I want to improve my life and you want to, as well. We have something in common'.""
Closer co-operation also make commercial sense, argues Israeli-American investor and entrepreneur, Yadin Kaufmann.
He started the Palestinian Internship Program (PIP) in 2014 to provide young Palestinian graduates with work experience at leading Israel-based companies.
""For most Palestinians, being a part of PIP is the first time they've encountered an Israeli other than at a checkpoint,"" says Mr Kaufmann.
""For most Israelis it's the first time they're able to speak with a Palestinian and work with them on a professional level.""
More Technology of Business
Tracking the toxic air that's killing millions Could a computer ever create better art than a human? How can you stop your kids viewing harmful web content? How does it feel to be watched at work all the time? Should cyber-security be more chameleon, less rhino? In 2008, he founded Sadara Ventures, the first venture capital firm to target the Palestinian tech sector exclusively. Sadara is now supporting six portfolio companies that have raised $70m (£54m) in venture capital funding so far.
Mr Kaufmann's latest initiative, the Palestinian Partnership Fund, would provide grants for joint ventures between Palestinian entrepreneurs and companies in Israel, other countries in the Middle East and the US.
The US Congress is currently considering whether to fund the programme.
""I realised there was an opportunity to do something interesting from a business perspective, but also to create a smaller scale 'start-up nation' next door,"" says Mr Kaufmann.
""If we could succeed in doing that it would be good for the Palestinians, and make Palestine more of a real economy rather than a donor-dependent one.""

For example, Palestinian software firm, Exalt Technologies, has 20 engineers building cloud infrastructure support for Nokia's 5G team based in Israel.
""There is no doubt that there are many political and economic constraints on Palestine, but the media... highlights aspects of destruction, instead of focusing on the resilience and love for growth and life, despite hardship,"" believes Exalt boss, Tareq Maayah.
Exalt has worked with Cisco's Israeli and US teams for a decade on integrating software across the company's wireless network, and has developed Android and iOS applications for HP Indigo, a division of HP's graphic arts business that was originally an Israeli company.
But until January this year, many engineers from both sides had never met.
HP Indigo's Israeli engineers and the firm's chief executive made a trip to Exalt's office in the Palestinian city of Ramallah.

""I could feel the sense of pride when Exalt's engineers demonstrated their work for HP during the meetings, especially since they saw our Palestinian female leaders in action, who are developing their own technology sector.
""It was important that we do this so everyone could enjoy themselves, as they experienced authentic Palestinian food!""
But will such collaborations lead to a stronger economy for the region and potentially a resolution of the conflict?
That remains unlikely, believes Magid Shihade, faculty member at the Institute for International Studies at Birzeit University on the West Bank, while onerous trade restrictions remain in place.
Under the Paris Protocol between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government, Palestinians cannot import what they like from abroad and are prevented from developing their own products freely.
""The first step for change is to remove all Israeli restriction in trade, thus letting Palestinian and Israeli businesses collaborate on an equal footing,"" says Mr Shihade.
But Israel believes such restrictions are necessary to maintain its security in the troubled region.
The issues are difficult and deeply embedded, but at least technology is helping to foster dialogue - an essential prerequisite for peace.

Japan emperor: Akihito's human touch - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Rupert Wingfield-Hayes Bbc News,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48093668,"Image copyright Getty Images On a beautiful spring morning last week, I stood on a street corner on the western outskirts of Tokyo. For hundreds of metres in each direction, the road was lined, three-deep, with eager, excited faces. Then, with almost no warning, a large black limousine approached over a bridge, motorcycle outriders on either side.
As the car slipped by, for a few brief moments, we could see Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko leaning forward waving gently. A ripple of applause and waving of plastic flags from the crowd, and they were gone.
To me, it all seemed a little anti-climactic. And I was not alone. Nearby an elderly lady was chastising a policeman.
""Why did they go so fast?"" she demanded to know. ""Usually they drive much slower than that. We hardly got any chance to see them.""
The policeman smiled patiently. Clearly, he had no control over the speed of the motorcade.
I had expected a few hundred hardcore groupies to turn out for this final visit by the royal couple to the imperial tombs. Instead there must have been 5,000 or more. Some were dabbing away tears as the crowds began to disperse.
""I am grateful for what they have done for the Japanese people,"" said a lady wearing an exquisite spring kimono. ""I waved at them with the feeling of deep gratitude for all these years.""
""I am really moved,"" said her friend. ""I hope he can rest and have a peaceful life after so many years on duty.""
Kaoru Sugiyama, wearing a large floppy sunhat, had also come with a group of friends.
""I am not from the generation that experienced the war,"" she said. ""But when you look back, it is the emperor that has kept peace in Japan through his reign. So I wanted to come and see him on his last visit, to show my gratitude. I wanted to tell him, 'thank you'.""
What is it that Emperor Akihito has done to inspire such feelings?
The consoler in chief In January 1989, upon his father's death, Emperor Akihito succeeded to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
It was an optimistic time. Japan was rich, at the height of its post-war economic boom. Sony was about to buy Columbia Pictures and Mitsubishi was on the verge of buying the Rockefeller Center in New York. The talk, in much of the world, was of Japan the new ""superpower"".
Image copyright AFP Image caption Japanese Emperor Akihito in ceremonial outfit, 1990 But a year into his reign, calamity struck. The asset bubble burst and the Tokyo stock market collapsed, losing 35% of its value. Nearly 30 years on, Japanese stocks and land prices are still below 1990 levels.
For most Japanese people the Heisei era - the name means ""achieving peace"" - has been one of economic stagnation. It has also been one marked by tragedy.
In January 1995, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake ripped through the city of Kobe, toppling buildings and motorway viaducts and starting fires that burned for days, turning the sky above the city black. Around 6,000 people were killed.
In 2011, an even more devastating quake hit off the north-east coast. At magnitude 9, it was the fourth largest earthquake ever recorded. It unleashed a giant tsunami that smashed into the coast of northern Japan, sweeping away whole towns and killing nearly 16,000 people.
The prince taking Japan into a new era Your questions on Japan's emperors Why a woman can't take the throne It was after that second disaster that Emperor Akihito did something no emperor had ever done before. He sat down in front of a TV camera and spoke directly to the Japanese people.
Two weeks later, the emperor and empress arrived at an evacuation centre in a stadium outside Tokyo.
People were camped on the floor, a few meagre possessions piled around them. Most had fled the radiation cloud ejected from the damaged nuclear plant in Fukushima. They had left almost everything behind, unsure of when, or if, they would be able to return to their hometowns.
The emperor and empress knelt on the ground with each family in turn, talking to them quietly, asking questions, expressing concern.
Image copyright ISSEI KATO Image caption Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko talk with evacuees from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami Japanese people had never seen an emperor behave like this before. To conservatives it was a shock. This is not how the direct descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu should behave. But many more Japanese were deeply moved by the emperor's very human show of empathy.
""He has moral authority,"" says Prof Jeff Kingston, from Temple University in Tokyo. ""And he's earned it. He is the consoler in chief. He connects with the public in a way his father never could.
""So he goes to shelters and not like a politician going for a photo op, to wave and leave. He sits with people and drinks tea and engages in conversation in a way that was unthinkable in the pre-1945 era.""
The sins of the father Emperor Akihito does not have the appearance of a revolutionary. He is small, modest and softly spoken. His words and actions are tightly constrained by Japan's post-war constitution and, unlike Britain's Queen Elizabeth, he is not Japan's head of state.
Instead his role is much more vaguely defined as ""symbol of the state and unity of the people"". He is banned from expressing any political opinion.
And yet within the tight straitjacket of his ceremonial role, Emperor Akihito has managed to do some remarkable things.
The first thing you need to remember is that Akihito is the son of Hirohito, the god-like emperor who reigned over Japan during its nearly 15-year rampage across Asia in the 1930s and 40s. Akihito was 12 when the war ended with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
 Emperor Hirohito and Prince Akihito reading a newspaper At some point in his education, some say under the influence of his American tutor Elizabeth Gray Vining, Akihito became a confirmed pacifist, and he remains so today. He has told people his greatest contentment comes from knowing that during his reign, not a single Japanese soldier has been killed in war or armed conflict.
The emperor has made it his job to reach out to Japan's former enemies and victims. From Beijing to Jakarta, Manila to Saipan, he has sought to heal the wounds inflicted under his father.
""He created a new role for the emperor, and that is the nation's chief emissary for reconciliation, criss-crossing the region, making gestures of atonement and contrition. Basically, trying to heal the scars of wartime past,"" says Prof Kingston.
Image copyright Keystone-France Image caption Wedding of Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko, 1959 In the 1990s that was relatively uncontroversial. Japanese politicians encouraged the emperor, arranging a landmark trip to China in 1992. But as he has grown older, Japanese politics has moved dramatically to the right.
The old ""apology diplomacy"" is out of favour, as is pacifism. The current prime minister, Shinzo Abe, had vowed to rid Japan of its pacifist constitution. He and others on the right want to bring back patriotic education, and expunge what they call the ""historical masochism"" of the post-war era.
 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe walks past Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko during an annual memorial service for war victims, Tokyo, 2014 In subtle, but determined ways, Emperor Akihito has repeatedly shown his disdain for the revisionists. In 2015, on the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, Mr Abe gave a speech.
""He basically said that the peace and prosperity we enjoy today is owing to the sacrifice of the three million Japanese who died during the war,"" says Prof Kingston.
""The next day, Akihito was having none of that. He made a speech saying the prosperity we enjoy today is down to the hard work and sacrifice of the Japanese people after the war.""
To the millions of Japanese watching on TV, it was an unmistakable slapdown.
On another occasion at a royal garden party in Tokyo, a right-wing member of the Tokyo metropolitan government proudly told the emperor that he was in charge of making sure all teachers stand and face the flag when they sing the national anthem.
The emperor gently but emphatically admonished the bureaucrat.
""I am in favour of individual choice,"" he said.
The long farewell Throughout his reign, the emperor has been inseparable from his most important companion and advisor, Empress Michiko. She was born a commoner, and has, at times, found life in the imperial household extremely hard. In 1993, the empress collapsed from mental exhaustion and for two months she lost the ability to speak.
Image copyright Alamy Image caption Empress Michiko married Emperor Akihito in April 1959 Writing recently, she spoke of her awe at her husband's resolve.
""His duties required of him in his role are the utmost priority at all times and personal matters take second place,"" she wrote, ""and that is exactly how he has lived these nearly 60 years.""
But for some time, Emperor Akihito has been in declining health. He has had cancer and major heart bypass surgery. Those close to him say he has become increasingly worried that poor health would incapacitate him and make it impossible for him to carry out his official duties.
As far back as 2009, the emperor began quietly agitating to be allowed to hand the throne to his son. This is no easy task.
The post-war constitution makes it clear emperors are to serve ""for life"". And so, according to Prof Takeshi Hara, of Japan's Open University, the politicians ignored the emperor's requests.
""Over the course of nine years, none of the governments sympathised with the emperor's feelings,"" he says. ""They felt that if they complied with the emperor's desire to abdicate, this would show the emperor has power to make important decisions, and that is against the constitution.""
 Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako with their pet dog Yuri. It is a very Japanese conundrum. In increasing desperation, Prof Hara says the emperor and imperial household agency cooked up a scheme.
""The emperor and the Imperial Household Agency were growing more and more impatient,"" he says. ""So someone in the Household Agency leaked the information to NHK (Japan's national broadcaster). Then NHK broadcast news of the emperor's request.""
It was a huge scoop for Japan's national broadcaster and it broke the impasse. A month later the emperor went on TV for a second time to appeal directly to the Japanese people, explaining his wish to step down and hand the throne to his son.
Opinion polls showed the overwhelming majority of Japanese supported the emperor's wish. Mr Abe and the conservatives had no choice but to comply. It has taken nearly another two years, but now Emperor Akihito will finally be able to enjoy his retirement.
The country will officially begin a new era on 1 May, when Crown Prince Naruhito ascends to the Chrysanthemum Throne as the new emperor."
Jeopardy: How a pro gambler 'cracked' US game show - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Jonathan Berr Bbc News,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48032235,"Image copyright Jeopardy Productions Inc Image caption Professional gambler James Holzhauer Jeopardy - the iconic US trivia game show where contestants must answer clues ""in the form of a question"" - has never come across a contestant quite like professional gambler James Holzhauer in the decades it has been on air, writes Jonathan Berr.
Not only has Mr Holzhauer become only the second contestant in the show's history to earn more than $1m (£773,000) in one go, he has also hit the milestone over his multi-game spree faster than anyone in the show's history.
No one has come close to catching the Las Vegas sports bettor, who has been training for years for his moment in the spotlight.
""I've thought seriously about how to approach a potential Jeopardy appearance since 2012,"" Mr Holzhauer told BBC News in an email during his winning streak.
""I did look into some statistics on how to best approach the game board, and that played a part in my strategy,"" adds Mr Holzhauer, who holds a mathematics degree from the University of Illinois and prepared for the game's more esoteric categories by reading children's books.

'Cracking' the rules Mr Holzhauer has been impressing fans and former players since 4 April with his calm demeanour and cat-like reflexes as he buzzes in with correct responses on 607 questions to clues from categories that range from the serious, like History, to the whimsical, like Occupational Verbs.
Most Jeopardy players focus on any particular category by solving the easy clues first, then work their way to the higher-value difficult ones. Mr Holzhauer takes the opposite approach.
His technique of targeting the ""expensive"" difficult clues first (as opposed to progressing from easy to hard) has triggered complaints from detractors who say it ruins the flow of the game, but praise from others who say he has ""cracked the Jeopardy code"".
He also has made hefty bets on ""Daily Double"" questions where players can risk as much as their entire score in one answer (a so-called ""true daily double"") - but rarely do.
This strategy of bouncing around the board - seemingly at random - in hunt for the ""Daily Double"" prizes is named the ""Forrest Bounce"" after former contestant Chuck Forrest. But unlike his predecessors, Mr Holzhauer is willing to risk far more money.
Fivethirtyeight.com, a website dedicated to odds and polls, has dubbed Mr Holzhauer ""the man who solved Jeopardy"".
Skip Twitter post by @emilylightningg I can’t be the only person who thinks #JamesHolzhauer is somehow cheating. He gets every double jeopardy. And is just way too confident and good to be real. #jeopardy
— Emily Dachs (@emilylightningg) April 15, 2019 Report End of Twitter post by @emilylightningg
According to the website, Mr Holzhauer has wagered $25,000 twice on Daily Doubles, topping the previous record of $19,000 for these types of bets.
He also places heavy wagers on the show's climactic final question dubbed ""Final Jeopardy"".
Jeopardy's staff, including long-time host Alex Trebek, reportedly are not fans of the ""Forrest Bounce"", arguing that it disrupts the natural order of the show.
But regardless of how he picks his questions, he still must buzz in first - and most importantly - give the correct answers.
One thing that future contestants will not be able to copy from Mr Holzhauer are his shout-outs to friends and family during Final Jeopardy, a practice that the show's producers no longer allow, according to an announcement he made on his Facebook page.
Is the strategy paying off? Though Jeopardy is a battle of wits, it can be physically and mentally gruelling since producers tape five episodes at a time, according to Brad Rutter, whose $4.8m in winnings over 14 years is the most of any Jeopardy player.
""You can study some stuff, but it's not like there is any real canon of knowledge that you can sit down and memorise,"" he told BBC News.
""You have to have a brain that works that way and pick it up over the years.
""There are a few things that come up all of the time like presidents and world capitals and Shakespeare that you would be well served to study before going on,"" he advises.
Image copyright Brad Rutter Image caption Brad Rutter has won more money on Jeopardy than anyone else Washington Post Columnist Norman Chad has likened Mr Holzhauer's dominance to ""the most fearsome, dominant individual-sport athletes of the past couple of generations such as boxer Mike Tyson, swimmer Michael Phelps and tennis player Serena Williams"".
Ken Jennings, whose own winning streak captured audience imaginations in 2004, tweeted: ""This is absolutely insane. I've always wanted to see someone try Jeopardy wagering this way who had the skills to back it up.""
Jeopardy trivia facts
The 35th season premiered in September 2018 Holds the Guinness world record for most Emmy awards (34) won by a game show The only other contestant to top $1m in one go was Ken Jennings, whose 74-game winning streak yielded $2,520,700 Ken Jennings needed 33 games to break the $1m bar. But is it good TV? Not everyone is a Holzhauer supporter.
He has become a sensation on social media where some Twitter users are debating his skill, and even calling for him to run for president.
TV critics and Jeopardy fans are split on whether his success is thrilling or boring.
In a recent, column in Variety, TV critic Daniel D'Addario argued that Mr Holzhauer's achievement was ""a thrilling achievement and deadly dull television"".
Andy Saunders, who operates the independent site called The Jeopardy Fan, argues that Mr Holzhauer is good for the game and is making it even more exciting.
""There will be people who will try to emulate him,"" Mr Saunders hopes.
Though Jeopardy is hugely popular, its history was rocky. The show survived two cancellations.
After current host Alex Trebek was hired in 1984, the ""cerebral"" test of wits wasn't an easy sell and producers resisted pressure to dumb the show down.

Data from Nielsen, cited by AdAge, indicates that an average of 10.3 million viewers tuned in during the first 12 days of Mr Holzhauer's run.
The show is now considered so iconic that its host's recent announcement of his cancer diagnosis was national news.

Contaminated blood scandal: Inquiry hearings to begin - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Jim Reed Reporter,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48094150,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would."" A public inquiry into what has been called ""the worst treatment scandal in the history of the NHS"" is to start taking evidence on Tuesday.
Some 4,800 people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. More than 2,000 are thought to have died.
Thousands more may have been exposed through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth.
One victim's widow says she wants ""justice"" and people held to account.
Su Gorman's husband, Steve Dymond, died aged 62 on 23 December last year of organ failure - ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man.
'The wonder drug' Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme in April 2018, Steve said: ""It's not the life I imagined in terms of dreams, in terms of ambitions.
""It's become a life of sickness, illness, worry, anxiety.
""When I talk about my wife, I talk about her as my widow in waiting.""
Long reads on this subject Aged eight, Matt (pictured) was given blood products contaminated with HIV - when he found out, he couldn't tell a soul Liz married twice - the same NHS scandal killed both her husbands Steve was born in 1956 with a mild form of haemophilia, a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting properly.
He played rugby at school and studied Russian at university where he met his wife, Su, waiting on a train platform.
""He had a massive bruise on his thigh the size of a postcard and it worried me,"" she remembers.
""Steve was not in the habit of getting treatment, so he said he would get it checked out. That was the first time they injected him with a 'wonder drug' called Factor VIII.""
Image copyright Family photo Image caption Steve and Su on their wedding day At the time that new drug was made from the pooled blood plasma of tens of thousands of donors.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the NHS was importing Factor VIII from the US, where high-risk groups like prisoners were paid to give blood.
The first sign that something was very wrong came in about 1983.
Reports of a new form of cancer started to emerge, first in the gay community then among other groups like haemophiliacs.
Around this time, Steve had a minor accident and went to the local hospital to get it checked out.
Image copyright Factor VIII/Marc marnie Image caption Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s ""The young registrar took a packet off the shelf and treated him with Factor VIII. The bruise disappeared after an hour, so it was totally unnecessary,"" said Su.
""Shortly after, they called him back and said he had been exposed to HIV.""
The testing process took 18 months - an ""absolutely terrifying"" period.
Some 1,200 British haemophiliacs were infected with HIV in this way, including many young children of primary school age. Only 250 are still alive today.
Steve was one of the lucky ones.
""It was a huge relief. He was told he was clear of the HIV but no mention was made of the Hepatitis C at that point,"" says Su.
The 'silent killer' Hepatitis C is a virus now thought to affect more than 150 million people, some 2% of the world population. Yet it was not discovered and named until 1989.
It was not until 1993, then living and working in France, that Steve was told he had the condition.
At the time the couple were trying again for a baby. They were immediately taken off the IVF programme.
Image copyright Family photo Image caption Steve Dymond died in December of organ failure, ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man ""Steve was told bluntly that the [possible] consequences were liver cirrhosis, cancer, a transplant, premature death,"" says Su.
""Within 24 hours [of diagnosis] we found out we would never have children and that he was going to die early.""
Damage was done It was only in 2013 that a new drug was approved that could successfully eliminate the Hepatitis C virus from Steve's body.
By then, though, the damage was already done. Scans showed his liver was cirrhotic and a bunch of cells showed the early signs of cancer.
His health declined quickly in the last 18 months of his life.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Steve Dymond speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in April last year In late December 2018 he woke at home coughing up blood.
""They took him to intensive care. He knew I was there and he said to me, 'I love you',"" says Su.
""The last thing he said was he wanted those who had done this to him to repent. Then at one in the morning, as he was holding my hand, he left me.""
The inquiry A public inquiry into the scandal was first announced in July 2017.
Since then, campaign groups estimate that more than 150 infected haemophiliacs like Steve have died.
The inquiry will consider evidence from approximately 2,500 people, most of whom were infected with, or affected by, contaminated blood products such as Factor VIII or IX.
Victims and relatives want to know why warnings about the safety of the medicine may have been ignored, why plans to make the UK self-sufficient in blood products were scrapped, and why many documents and patient records appear to have been lost or destroyed.
The inquiry, led by retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, could last for more than two years.
Ahead of the public hearings, the government announced more financial support for people in England affected by the tragedy, to a total of £75m from £46m.
Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The contaminated blood scandal was a tragedy that should never have happened and has caused unimaginable pain and hurt for victims and their families for decades.
""I know this will be a difficult time for victims and their families - but today will begin a journey which will be dedicated to getting to the truth of what happened and in delivering justice to everyone involved.""
Image copyright Family photo ""I want to see justice,"" says Su.
""I want to see people called to account, I want to see anybody found to have behaved inappropriately, criminally or negligently made to explain themselves.
""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would, and that's a promise I intend to keep.""

Trade war: What you need to know about US-China talks - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48089004,"US-China trade war in 300 words How did we get here?
The US, which accuses China of unfair trading practices, imposed tariffs on $250bn (£193.2bn) worth of Chinese products last year.
Beijing has retaliated with duties on $110bn worth of American products.
Tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods were due to more than double at the start of the year, rising from 10% to 25%.
But both countries agreed to suspend tit-for-tat tariffs after they struck a truce in December , and began negotiations to work towards a deal.
US President Donald Trump recently said the US and China had agreed on ""a lot of the most difficult points"" but that ""we have some ways to go"". What are the sticking points?
Sticking points in negotiations in recent months have included how a deal would be enforced, issues around intellectual property protection, and how fast to roll back tariffs.
Gary Hufbauer from the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington said enforcement was a crucial issue, but remained optimistic about the prospect of a deal.
""China will make lots of promises, the US remains sceptical on implementation,"" he said.
Still, he expects a deal to be announced by mid-May. The latest round of talks are expected to be followed by further negotiations in Washington on 8 May.
The US accuses China of stealing intellectual property and wants Beijing to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies. It also wants China to buy more US goods to rein in a lofty trade deficit.
Mr Xi addressed some of these concerns last week at the Belt and Road forum in Beijing ahead of the trade talks.
He said China would boost efforts to secure intellectual property protection, increase imports of goods and services and ensure a fair trading environment for firms.
But what makes trade negotiations particularly difficult to resolve is the fact they are part of a broader power struggle between the world's two largest economies.
China's growing influence has put many Western governments - and particularly the US on the defensive . Some in China see the trade war as part of US efforts to curb its rise.
Against this backdrop, there is a view that the trade deal will not put an end to a US-China rivalry , which is already playing out in the technology sector. What's at stake?
The trade war is already having an impact on the world economy.
International Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinath said the escalation of US-China trade tensions was one factor that had contributed to a ""significantly weakened global expansion, especially in the second half of 2018."" The IMF cut its growth forecast for this year by 0.2 percentage points to 3.3%.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also said tariffs imposed by the US and China last year had slowed economic growth in the world's two largest economies.
Beyond the tangible economic fallout, some fear the trade war is challenging the multilateral system which has governed global trade for decades, including through the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
""The system is already fragile. An all out trade war, in which both sides break their WTO commitments, will be very damaging,"" Mr Hufbauer said. Related Topics"
Police car warning before Tyereece Johnson's moped death - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-48095471,"Police car warning before Tyereece Johnson's moped death 29 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Google Image caption The moped and Met Police car crashed near Trinity Road's junction with South Park Road in Wimbledon Police cars following three teenagers on a moped were told repeatedly to pull back before it crashed and one of the teenagers died, an inquest heard.
Tyereece Johnson, 16, died on 17 July 2017 after being thrown from the moped, which was believed to have been involved in an attempted robbery.
Inner West London Coroner's Court also heard a pursuit across south London had not been authorised.
A report by the police watchdog will be released at the inquest's close.
The trio were being tracked by a police helicopter feeding information on their location to cars on the ground in the early hours of 16 July, the inquest heard. 'No helmets'
The court was told that on at least two occasions, a female officer could be heard saying over the radio: ""Can you try not to follow the vehicle too closely please?""
PC Lee Hunt, a tactical pursuit adviser on the night of the crash, told the court he did not authorise a pursuit, because the trio were not wearing helmets and due to the risk to other road users and pedestrians.
He advised that police cars attempted to position themselves ahead of the moped and lay down a stinger device to bring it to a halt.
He also told the inquest he was unaware there were two police cars following the moped.

KPMG fined £6m over ‘improper’ audit - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48102857,"Image copyright Getty Images KPMG has been fined £6m, ""severely reprimanded"" and told to undertake an internal review over the way it audited an insurance company.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it related to the 2008 and 2009 audits of Syndicate 218, a firm based at the Lloyds of London market.
Mark Taylor, a partner at KPMG, and former partner Anthony Hulse have both each been fined £100,000.
Douglas Morgan, a director at Syndicate 218, was also reprimanded.
It is not unusual for big auditing firms to be severely reprimanded over their work, particularly when a fine is involved.
UK audit giants 'should be broken up' KPMG audit work unacceptable - watchdog But an FRC spokesman said: ""While [a reprimand] has no effect financially, it is a stain on their reputation and will be considered by other companies when they are thinking about changing their auditors.""
The FRC said it had begun investigating the audits in 2012 and commenced action against the two firms in 2016.
It said that in both 2008 and 2009, KPMG made ""insufficient inquiries"" about the process that Syndicate 218 used to review insurance claims and to ensure its financial reserves.
""Consequently, there was insufficient evidence to provide an unqualified audit opinion,"" the regulator said.
Image copyright AFP Image caption KPMG has been in the spotlight for its audit of Carillion It also said that Mr Morgan, an in-house accountant, had handled the review process within Syndicate 218 in a ""wholly improper"" way.
It said he had failed to keep proper records and to properly disclose information to the company's board and auditors.
Mr Morgan has been excluded from membership of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants for two years.
KPMG, which is one of the Big Four accountancy firms, has been in the spotlight for its audit work.
The FRC is investigating the accountancy giant's audit of the government contractor Carillion, which collapsed under £1bn of debt last year.
In June 2018, the FRC also found an ""unacceptable deterioration"" in KPMG's work and said it would be subject to closer supervision.
A KPMG spokesman said: ""We are disappointed that aspects of our 2008 and 2009 audits were found not to have met the standards set by our regulator.
""Since this work was conducted, we have changed our insurance audit approach considerably, including how we work with actuaries when auditing insurance claims reserves.
""We will continue to work hard to put historical matters such as this to rest as quickly as possible."""
Minor earthquake close to Irish border in County Donegal - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48102567,"Image copyright Google Maps Image caption The epicentre was about 15km (nine miles) north-east from Ballyshannon in County Donegal A minor earthquake has been recorded in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, according to Geological Survey Ireland.
The Irish government-backed research body confirmed that the quake occurred at 21:18 local time on Monday and that it had a magnitude of 2.1.
Earth tremors were heard across the border in Northern Ireland, including parts of County Fermanagh.
Geologists say earthquakes in Ireland are very rare.
Details of the quake were first reported by the Irish National Seismic Network , which is run by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in co-operation with the Geological Survey of Ireland.
It said the epicentre was about 15km (nine miles) south-east of Donegal town and 15km north-east of Ballyshannon.
The network has asked members of the public who experienced the tremors to contact them with information.
Director Dr Martin Mollhoff said: ""In 40 years we have only recorded around 200 earthquakes.
""The largest was a 2.4 magnitude in Buncrana. We have never recorded anything larger onshore.""

Earthquakes in Ireland are actually quite rare.
According to the Irish National Seismic Network, Ireland is the quietest place for seismic activity in Europe.
Most are recorded to the south-east or north-west of the island - mainly around Donegal and Wexford.
The island is covered in lots of fault lines, according to the Geological Survey of Ireland.
""Ireland started in two different continents and then merged. We've got a 1.8 billion year history,"" said geologist Dr Siobhan Power.
""The faults that are in Donegal are a continuation of a fault in Scotland.""
He said there could be no earthquakes for a few years, and then there are ""very small earthquakes that are just about being felt"".
""That's why when something like this happens, people talk about it,"" he added.
Geologist Dr Siobhan Power said normally an earthquake of this magnitude would not be felt.
""But in the quietness of the evening and close to epicentre, it can be,"" she said.
The earthquake was recorded by seismometers across the island.
""There are six seismometers that make up the official network - Donegal, Louth, Galway, Dublin, Wexford and Kerry,"" said Dr Power.
""The earthquake was picked up in Donegal at 21:18:23 BST and it then filtered through to the others (in the above order) with a gradual reduction in the signal.
""The rest all recorded the earthquake in under a minute.""
However, another explanation for the tremors has been suggested by the Irish border on Twitter.
@BorderIrish , which is more known for its musings on Brexit, said: ""Sorry. Beans.""

'Yeti footprints': Indian army mocked over claim - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48101717,"Image copyright Indian Army Image caption India's army said it had found footprints of the Yeti The Indian army has claimed to have found footprints of the yeti, sparking jokes and disbelief on social media.
The army tweeted to its nearly six million followers on Monday that it had discovered ""mysterious footprints of mythical beast 'Yeti' at the Makalu Base Camp [in the Himalayas]"".
The yeti - a giant ape-like creature - often figures in South Asian folklore.
There is no evidence proving yeti exist but the myth retains a strong appeal in the region.
Is the Himalayan Yeti a real animal? Why don't people see the yeti any more? And the army has now added to the legend by sharing pictures of ""footprints"" in the snow on an official Twitter account.
Image Copyright @adgpi @adgpi Report Image Copyright @adgpi @adgpi Report Although the footprints were discovered on 9 April, the army made the discovery public only after deciding that it matched earlier theories about the yeti, according to a report in the Times of India .
Reacting to the disbelief on social media, the army said the ""evidence"" about the yeti had been ""photographed "" and ""handed over to subject matter experts"".
""So, we thought it prudent [to go public] to excite scientific temper and rekindle the interest.""
The yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman, is a legendary creature that is said to inhabit the upper reaches of the Himalayas. Stories of people seeing the yeti or its footprints are common in parts of India, Nepal and Bhutan.
In 2013, research by a British scientist concluded that the legendary Himalayan yeti may in fact be a sub-species of brown bear.
Twitter users reacted with disbelief that the Indian army would make such a bold claim about the footprints of a ""mythical beast"".

And in 2013, DNA tests on hair samples carried out by Oxford University genetics professor Bryan Sykes found that they matched those from an ancient polar bear. He said the most likely explanation for the myth is that the animal is a hybrid of polar bears and brown bears."

Det Supt Rachel Shields said police were not complacent about the risk posed by several gangs behind a spate of overnight robberies.
Two people were arrested on Tuesday after police foiled a bid to steal a cash machine at Nutt's Corner in County Antrim at about 03:30 BST.
It was the 14th incident of its kind in Northern Ireland since 1 January 2019.

Trump sues Deutsche Bank and Capital One over Democrat subpoenas - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48102647,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Trump's three eldest children. Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr, also joined the lawsuit US President Donald Trump has sued two banks in a bid to stop them handing over his financial records to Congress.
The lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One was filed after Democrat-led committees issued subpoenas for information on his finances.
His three eldest children and the Trump Organisation joined the lawsuit, which argues there are no legitimate grounds for investigating his business affairs.
Leading Democrats said they would not be deterred by the blocking attempt.
A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman told the New York Times: "" We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations ""
There was no immediate comment from Capital One.
What does the Trump lawsuit say? The lawsuit was filed in New York on Monday and aims to block the banks from complying with the subpoenas issued by the Democrat-controlled Congress, which is investigating the Trump family's financial dealings.
Both banks are involved with Mr Trump's real estate projects.
Trump financial disclosure: What did we learn? Eight legal headaches for Trump What happened to fears over Trump's business? The filing says the subpoenas ""have no legitimate or lawful purpose"".
""[They] were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the president and his family,"" it alleges.
It adds: ""No grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one.""
The filing also says that Democrats are hoping ""they will stumble upon something they can expose publicly and use as a political tool against the President"".
Why were the banks subpoenaed? The House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees issued subpoenas to Germany's Deutsche Bank, which is one of the Trump Organisation's major lenders, and a number of other financial institutions earlier this month.
The committees are reportedly seeking documents and materials relating to the bank's longstanding relationship with Mr Trump and his family.
Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the subpoenas were part of an investigation ""into allegations of potential foreign influence on the US political process"".
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly ordered Deutsche Bank to provide records of Mr Trump's accounts Mr Schiff and fellow Democrat Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Commission, described the lawsuit as ""meritless"".
""[It shows] the depths to which President Trump will go to obstruct Congress's constitutional oversight authority,"" they said in a joint statement.
""He will find that Congress will not be deterred from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities,"" it adds.
In 2017, the bank rejected requests by Democrats in the House of Representatives to provide details of the president's finances, citing privacy laws.
That year it was also reported that special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia , had ordered Deutsche Bank to provide records of Mr Trump's accounts."
TalkTalk service at bottom of Ofcom poll for third year running - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48103617," TalkTalk has failed to improve its standing on customer complaints in Ofcom's annual survey - the broadband provider has come bottom of the table for the third year running.
In 2017 it shared the honour with Virgin Media, but in 2018 and 2019 the prize was all TalkTalk's.
Its customers were most likely to be unhappy with the outcome of complaints.
A spokeswoman for TalkTalk said the data showed an ""improving trend"" on the number of complaints.
The Ofcom report notes that the handling of customer complaints could be improved ""across the industry"", with only half of those who make a complaint to any provider ending up happy with the result.
The top two reasons for complaining were poor or unreliable connectivity, and issues with broadband speed.
However, the total number of complaints to Ofcom about broadband services fell by 23%. The survey also found:
Customers have to wait an average of one minute 37 seconds for calls to be answered by customer service agents TalkTalk call waiting times were the shortest (33 seconds) and Plusnet the longest (six minutes 47 seconds) One company stood out with a sharp rise in complaints. Plusnet's share more than doubled in the last quarter of 2018.
The telecoms regulator notes that, at the time, the firm had experienced problems with a new billing system.
'Hard to hide' ""It's hard for TalkTalk to hide from the fact that their customer service isn't up to scratch,"" Ofcom's director of market intelligence Iain Macrae told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""We absolutely think that the firms need to up their games in the way they handle complaints.""
He added that the regulator was encouraged by the fact that the total number of complaints to broadband providers had fallen.
""We're pleased that Ofcom's data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk,"" a spokeswoman for the firm said.
""And while some of the results in the quality-of-service report are disappointing, we are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us.""
The provider would continue to ""enhance"" the services it offered in response, she added.

Fan Wei is the second Canadian to be sentenced to death this year. Ten others, including five foreigners, were also sentenced on Tuesday.
Relations between Canada and China have been tense since the December arrest of a Huawei executive in Vancouver.
Canada has accused Beijing of arbitrarily applying the death penalty, and have requested clemency for Mr Fan.
In January, another Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, had a 15-year jail term increased to a death sentence - prompting condemnation from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Beijing rejected his comments, saying that Canada was practising ""double standards"".
On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told journalists that Canada is ""very concerned"" by this latest death sentence.
""Canada stands firmly opposed to the death penalty everywhere around the world,"" she said.
""We think that this is a cruel and inhumane punishment, which we think should not be used in any country. We are obviously particularly concerned when it is applied to Canadians.""
Global Affairs Canada said in a statement that the country ""has raised our firm opposition to the death penalty with China, and will continue to do so"".
The diplomatic agency said representatives attended the 30 April verdict and sentencing trial for Mr Fan, and have called on China to grant clemency to him.
The latest case is likely to further inflame the months-long diplomatic row which started when Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Vancouver on the request of US authorities.
Two other Canadian citizens, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, are also being held by China and face accusations of harming national security.
The Jiangmen Intermediate People's Court in southern Guangdong province said that Fan Wei was the leader of the drugs ring. Another suspect, Wu Ziping, whose nationality was not made clear, was also given a death sentence."

The Defender model was built at the firm's Solihull factory near Birmingham until 2016.
The firm says the new model has been designed and engineered in the UK and its new engines built in Wolverhampton.
JLR also says it plans ""significant investment"" at Solihull to support the production of its next generation of Range Rover and Land Rover models. Final testing
In January 2016, some 67 years of the 4x4 being made at Solihull came to an end.

JLR says the 2020 Defender is now entering its final phase of testing. 'British design'
James Attwood is deputy editor at Autocar magazine, and says there had been little prior expectation that the new vehicle would be built in the UK.
""Reading between the lines it always looked like it would be built in Slovakia, particularly after they [JLR] had invested such a large sum in their new plant there,"" he says.
""But it is still very much a British design. And, of the range of engines that are going to be built for the new vehicle, a number are going to be built in the UK.""
He adds: ""Jaguar and Land Rover already make a number of cars in other countries and they are still very much seen as British cars."" "

An inquiry found 456 patients died after being given opiate drugs at Gosport War Memorial Hospital between 1987 and 2001.
A review has since been carried out by Kent and Essex Police to assess if there was ""sufficient new evidence"".
Relatives have been told a ""full investigation"" will begin.
Three previous investigations into 92 of the deaths by Hampshire Constabulary resulted in no charges being brought.

Speaking at a press conference afterwards, he promised a ""thorough and independent"" investigation with a range of offences, including murder, to be considered.
He said police would not be interviewing hospital staff but meeting families individually to collect statements on their relatives' experiences of the hospital.
He said a new medical expert panel would also be set up to ""prove or disprove the causational link between opioids being administered and deaths"".
Image caption Assistant Chief Constable Nick Downing is leading the latest police investigation He said: ""We need to look at what is new or different to submit to the CPS. I am satisfied that there is new and different material for us to consider.

She said: ""We challenged and we challenged when we saw the corrupt evidence that so-called experts had submitted but the CPS slammed the door shut in our faces.
""This immoral disaster was perpetuated by a club culture ... officials protected each other.

She said: ""After all this time you can understand why the families are distrustful of the process, having already endured three police investigations. We hope it'll be different and it will reach its rightful conclusion.""
Gosport MP and health minister Caroline Dinenage said she hoped families would ""get access to the truth"".
She said: ""I know that some families would prefer a much faster conclusion. I also have many constituents who've worked at the War Memorial Hospital past and present, with great professionalism and integrity.
""That's why it's important that the investigation is done with the utmost care and thoroughness.""

It also found an ""institutionalised regime"" of prescribing and administering amounts of opiate medication that were not clinically justified.
The report said the quality of previous police investigations had been ""consistently poor"".
It found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication on the wards, which was overseen by Dr Jane Barton .
Dr Barton retired after being found guilty by a medical panel of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999.

A misconduct inquiry was launched after an officer allegedly had sex with a vulnerable woman in a room inside a London police station.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the officers were part of a disbanded ""impact unit"".
Scotland Yard said it was ""fully co-operating"" with the inquiry.
In all, 12 officers or former officers are being investigated.
Mobile phone messages The sex allegation is said to have happened in a room at Charing Cross Police Station in about February 2016.
It stemmed from mobile phone messages which then highlighted ""concerning behaviours"", the Met said.
The IOPC probe is considering allegations that officers had:
Bullied and taken part in inappropriate behaviour towards other officers Been violent towards women and taken advantage of vulnerable people Used controlled substances, including steroids Used racist, misogynistic and other discriminatory language Perverted the course of justice by deleting messages relevant to a criminal investigation Failed to report wrongdoing The police watchdog has notified eight PCs and two sergeants that they are being investigated, while the Met said another PC and a former PC who is no longer with the force are also part of the inquiry.
Three PCs and a sergeant have already been placed on restricted duties, while one PC has been suspended in relation to the investigation, Scotland Yard said.
""The MPS takes all allegations of wrong-doing extremely seriously,"" the force added.
IOPC Regional Director Sal Naseem said they were ""serious allegations"" and it was ""vital for public confidence that these are independently investigated""."

Samsung unveils TV that can switch to vertical mode - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48103625,"Image copyright Samsung Image caption How would you like to watch TV? Landscape or portrait? Samsung has unveiled a TV that switches from a horizontal, landscape-style orientation to vertical - so it can easily display smartphone content.
The 43in device is called Sero and comes with an integrated easel-like stand upon which the screen pivots.
It will go on sale in South Korea towards the end of May and cost 1.89m won (£1,250).
One TV analyst said it was an interesting concept - but might have limited applications.
Sero will come with a microphone and Samsung's virtual assistant Bixby built in. It can also be set up to display photographs, a clock face or other images.
Among the content users might choose to watch on it may be a new series of shows by Snapchat, designed for mobile consumption and set to be launched in May.
Image copyright Samsung Image caption The Sero will initially be sold only in South Korea It was an interesting design but faced challenges in the TV market, said Matthew Rubin at market research firm Futuresource.
""The use case for the Sero, beyond that of a regular landscape position TV, is limited, especially with a relatively high price tag,"" he said.
""A lot of content from the likes of YouTube is already in landscape mode.
""It is telling that the TV will initially launch in South Korea, which is a market with very high mobile phone usage, so the likely success can be gauged quite early.""
The South Korean tech giant is known for its sometimes experimental TV designs. In 2017, it showed off a TV with a wooden frame that is designed to display artwork and look more like a painting when not in use.
And earlier this year at the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas, the firm unveiled a 75in (190cm) television made of modular micro LED panels.
The BBC asked Samsung whether the Sero is likely to be released outside South Korea. A spokeswoman said: ""Samsung will review global launch plans after the launch of 'The Sero' in Korea."""

The woman bringing Mandarin to Uganda,www.bbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47657451,"The woman bringing Mandarin to Uganda By Catherine Byaruhanga BBC Africa, Kampala 25 March 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption Wang Li Hong Sooma in a class in Kampala, Uganda Wang Li Hong Sooma, who moved to East Africa from China more than two decades ago, is determined to teach Ugandans how to speak Mandarin.
She and her Ugandan husband, Ayub Sooma, are organising nine-month intensive courses for secondary school teachers to learn China's dominant language.
The first 30 teachers have now completed their training and have started holding Mandarin classes in schools across the country.
The couple, who own their own secondary school on the outskirts of the capital, Kampala, can be seen as the perfect symbol of blossoming China-Uganda relations.
Together they can chat in a mixture of English, Mandarin and some of the local language Luganda. Image copyright Wang Li Hong Sooma Image caption Wang Li Hong Sooma (R) and Ayub Sooma (L) faced opposition at first to their union
They met 26 years ago in Beijing, when Mr Sooma was studying at Tsinghua University.
Though at first, Mrs Wang says, it was not easy for them to be together.
""It was a war! At that time, they thought I was a very loose girl to date a black boy. But I knew he is very honest and has a good heart to help other people.""
They now have three children and Uganda has been their home since 1996. New frontier
In that time, the economic relationship between China and Uganda has grown tremendously and the couple are in a perfect position to capitalise on that. How easy is it to learn Mandarin? There is no alphabet, just thousands of characters. There are so many that no-one can give a definitive total, but it is believed to be around 60,000 It uses a tonal system - four-and-a-half tones are used, meaning a single word can have many meanings ""Ma"" can mean mother, horse, hemp, or a reproach
Getting the right tone : Tone one - A fairly high, even tone Tone two - A rising tone, much like the sound at the end of a sentence with a question mark Tone three - Falls then rises. Like the second, but must dip first Tone four - Sharp falling tone, a little like how the end of a sentence with an exclamation mark sounds Half tone - Pronounce words with light tones in about half the time you would a normal word, without putting emphasis on it
They want to turn their school into a new frontier for Mandarin and Chinese culture.
Their teacher-training programme is being paid for by the government in Beijing - though it is not clear how much is being stumped up for the initiative. Image caption Another 40 secondary school teachers have signed up to learn Mandarin
""They are funding these Chinese teachers [from China], their salary and their accommodation. They also help the trainees - providing their food, their accommodation and some allowance,"" says Mrs Wang.
Most Mandarin lessons in Africa are taught through Chinese government-run Confucius Institutes.
The first opened in Kenya in 2005 and there are now nearly 60 across the continent.
Some schools in Zambia and Tanzania also offer the subject, and the scheme in Uganda is sub-contracted to Mrs Wang by the Confucius Institute. You may also be interested in: Can Chinese migrants integrate in Africa?
Forty more teachers are now enrolled and classes start at 08:00 and finish at 22:00 from Monday to Friday.
To become fluent and be able to teach a language within nine months is a huge undertaking, though Pavin Mulokwa, a teacher from the western district of Mbarara, sees it as an opportunity to broaden her job prospects.
Another trainee, Praise Twebaze, agrees and hopes it will enable him to travel too.
""We can go beyond lands where they use English but as well to lands where they use Chinese,"" he says.
For 13-year-old Denis Mulungi, the Mandarin lessons he has just started at Lubiri Secondary School in central Kampala could shape his future career.
""Learning Chinese, it can help me get good jobs in future. Learning Chinese can help me go abroad. It could be easy for me to communicate with other people who know Chinese, if I go to China."" Chinese imperialism?
It is not just the Ugandans who see this course as a life-changing opportunity.
Gao Ya Hui, who has been teaching Mandarin in Uganda for a year, says it has changed her perceptions of Africa. BBC When I came here it changed my stereotypes about African people"" Gao Ya Hui Mandarin teacher in Uganda
From Xian city in central China, the 39-year-old left her husband and child behind to come and teach but was warned by family and friends not to because of ""diseases and war"".
""When I came here, it changed my stereotypes about African people. When I go back to China, I will introduce the real Africa to the people in China and change their way of looking at Africa.""
But some, like Fred Muhumuza - a Ugandan economist who has followed the growth of trade between China and Uganda - says questions have been raised about China's motives for funding such a scheme and whether the initiative has been forced on the Ugandan government.
He lists some the concerns he has heard: ""Is this Chinese imperialism? Taking over Africa's resources, taking over even Africa's cultures and languages and wiping out everybody else?"" Narrowing the trade gap
Aggrey David Kibenge, Uganda's education ministry spokesman, dismissed such apprehension, saying it was not political and that it was not unusual for a foreign government or organisation to support the teaching of a particular language. Image caption Lubiri Secondary School in Kampala is already holding Mandarin classes
Supporters of Mandarin lessons point to the benefits for Uganda from economics and trade: Giving young Ugandans a better chance at competing on the global stage and an opportunity to narrow a massive trade gap.
According to the World Bank data, Uganda's imports from China were $622m (£474m) in 2013 and rose to $985m in 2017.
These are mainly consumer goods, machinery, electronics and textiles.
However, exports of Ugandan products to China reduced over the same period from $71.9m in 2013 to $33.4m in 2017.
Mrs Wang's goal is to have 100 teachers trained up and teaching Mandarin in 50 Ugandan schools - both those that are privately and government run - by 2021.
She sees it as a win-win situation, giving the example of how Chinese students have benefited from learning English in their understanding of America.

Prosecutors allege that the eight formed a ""baby gang"" - Italian slang for teenage gangs - called ""the Orphanage Group"". They shared video clips of their assaults, it is alleged.
The violence took place in Manduria, 47km (29 miles) east of Taranto.
Antonio Cosimo Stano was reportedly mentally disabled and lived in fear.
Some Italian media liken the ""baby gang"" to the teenage thugs in the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, who found sadistic violence thrilling.
The six detained youths are 17-year-olds, and the two adults aged 19 and 22.
Taranto police visited Mr Stano's dilapidated home on 5 April, after a neighbour told them he had suffered a robbery. They found that the pensioner was shabby, malnourished and living in abject poverty.
Medics brought him food and water, but when police returned the next day they found he had not eaten or drunk anything and ""barely managed to open the front door"", a police report said. Taunted as 'madman'
He was admitted to hospital but died on 23 April. There are suspicions that he died of severe internal injuries, but post mortem results have not yet been released.
Reports say he was punched, beaten with sticks and kicked repeatedly, in the street and in his home.
Italy's Ansa news agency says Mr Stano ""had a mental disability and was unable to defend himself and react"".
He was ""victimised and tortured for months"" by 14 youths in Manduria, according to the Italian news channel TG3.
In hospital he had two operations, for a gastric perforation and intestinal bleeding, the daily Il Giornale reported.
The gang reportedly called him ""the Madman of the Village of the Child"" - using the name of a youth club opposite his home.

He pitched it as a way of promoting ""reconciliation and peace"", but critics saw an attempt to strengthen his grip on power.
Mr Maduro was the chosen successor of Hugo Chávez, the founder of Venezuela's ""Bolivarian Revolution"" - a form of socialist populism with a strong emphasis on social welfare.

Apple iPhone sales drop at record pace - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48110709,"Image copyright Getty Images Sales of Apple's iPhones fell at their steepest-ever rate, according to data for the three months to the end of March.
The firm said revenue from the iPhone dropped by 17%, compared with the same period a year earlier, to $31bn.
However, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said sales were stronger towards the end of March, including in China where it cut iPhone prices to boost demand.
Apple lifted its outlook for the three months to June.
That sent shares more than 5% higher in after-hours trading.
The company had warned of slowing iPhone sales earlier this year , especially in China, where Apple competes with cheaper rivals such as Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi.
Apple unveils TV streaming platform When will you next buy a phone? But Mr Cook said price adjustments in China, lower Chinese taxes on the iPhone and new trade-in and financing deals helped sales start to recover toward the end of the quarter.
He also credited improving demand for products such as the Apple Watch, along with progress in US-China trade talks.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Oprah Winfrey at the launch of Apple TV+ in March ""The trade relationship, versus the previous quarter, is better. The tone is better,"" Mr Cook told Reuters. ""The sum of all of this together, it helped us.""
Apple has lifted its guidance for its third quarter revenue to between $52.5bn and $54.5bn.
For the three months to March, total sales hit $58bn compared to analysts' estimates of $57.3bn.
However, that is below total sales of $61.1bn in the second quarter last year. And while demand improved in China, sales in the region were still down by 20%.
Profits for the second quarter fell to $11.5bn compared to $13.8bn in the same period a year ago.
Apple is attempting to shift its reliance on the iPhone towards services and last month unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, to take on the likes of more established companies such as Netflix.
Services revenue rose to $11.4bn from $9.8bn in the same quarter last year.
But Yoram Wurmser, principal analyst at eMarketer, said long-term growth in services and, to a less extent, other devices ""depend on having as many users as possible in the Apple ecosystem, and that's still primarily about the iPhone"".
""The long-term growth of the company still depends directly and indirectly on iPhone sales,"" he added.

The beluga whale - if that's really its name - found in Norway's waters can certainly tick that box.
But it appears to have committed an absolutely basic rookie sleuthing error.
The reason it's causing suspicion among Norwegian fishermen and scientists is that it was wearing a harness and a label saying it was from St Petersburg in Russia.
Russia has denied any wrongdoing - and so far the beluga is refusing to talk.

If there's one thing we know about cats, it's that they do whatever they want, whenever they want.
Admittedly, they're inscrutable and impossible to second guess, so that's possibly why the CIA thought they'd make excellent field operatives.
In the 1960s, it's estimated $14m (£10.7m) was spent on a project to fit listening devices inside cats. The idea was for them to prowl around picking up vital Russian intelligence.
But it ended in failure on day one - when the cat was run over by a car outside the Soviet embassy in Washington. Bat bombs Image copyright peters99
They're silent, operate under the cover of darkness and often live in secretive hideouts in caves.
Impeccable credentials for any spy - and a seemingly irresistible combo for America.
During the Second World War, a dentist suggested fitting one million bats with tiny incendiary devices.
The idea was to then drop them over Japanese cities where they'd find buildings to roost in - and then explode, causing a fire storm.
Various tests were carried out - including accidentally burning an aircraft hanger down - but the idea never really took off. Actual listening bugs Image copyright Windy Soemara
A clear case of thinking of the title first and then working backwards, genuine attempts have been made to create ""fly on the wall"" spies.
Back in 2008, the New Scientist reported how the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had tried to develop cyborg insects - with wires inserted into their nerves so they could be controlled.
The possibilities were tantalising - the chance of flying tiny listening devices into your enemy's lair.
Similar projects have already been tried, with varying success, with sharks, rats and pigeons.
With the advance of technology, the focus now is on building tiny listening devices that look like real bugs. Wrongly accused Image copyright Dgwildlife
The use of animals in espionage has gone on for years - whether it's messenger pigeons in World War One or dolphins used by countries including the US, Russia and Israel to carry out underwater searches.
But spare a thought for those innocent beasts caught on the wrong side of enemy lines.
In 2007 the Iranian army arrested a team of 14 ""spy squirrels"" found near a nuclear enrichment plant. It was never entirely clear what they were up to.
Birds have also caused a lot of paranoia among the intelligence agencies. Image copyright clu
In 2013, the Egyptian authorities detained a stork - and not just because of the suspicious package it was doubtless carrying in its beak.
It was fitted with a tag which rang alarm bells for the security services.
However, it was innocent. The tag was being used by French scientists to track the bird's movements. The Hartlepool monkey Image copyright PA Image caption H'angus the monkey is the mascot at Hartlepool United
Although being accused of espionage is bad enough, at least the stork and squirrels lived to tell the tale.
Unlike the poor Hartlepool monkey.
As legend has it, a French ship was wrecked off the coast of north-east England during the Napoleonic Wars.
The people of Hartlepool had never seen a monkey before - nor, for that matter, had they ever set eyes on a Frenchman.
Mistaking its chattering for the language of the enemy, they convicted the monkey of being a French spy and hanged the animal on the beach. Related Topics "
Plan to secure internet of things with new law - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48106582," Image caption More and more internet of things devices are being sold The rapidly growing ""internet of things"" (IOT) - internet-connected gadgets - would have to be made more secure under proposed new laws.
Security vulnerabilities that could be targeted by hackers have been found in everything from toy dolls to internet-connected ovens in recent years.
The new laws would mean such devices would have to come with unique passwords, for example.
One expert said it was a ""positive step"" to protect consumers.
There will be 14.2 billion internet-connected devices in use worldwide by the end of 2019, according to market analysts Gartner.
These include connected TVs, smart speakers and home appliances with internet connectivity.
These devices often become the targets for cyber-attackers who hack them in order to steal personal data, spy on users or remotely take control of devices to otherwise misuse them.
Trust the label The proposed legislation, launched by Digital Minister Margot James, would also introduce a new labelling system to tell customers how secure an IOT product is.
Ms James said it was part of the UK's bid to be a ""global leader in online safety"".
Retailers would eventually be barred from selling products without the labels although initially the scheme would be voluntary.
To gain a label and enter the market, IOT devices would have to:
come with unique passwords by default state clearly for how long security updates would be made available offer a public point of contact to whom any cyber-security vulnerabilities may be disclosed The proposed laws follow a voluntary code of practice for IOT manufacturers that was published in the UK last year.

Cyber-security expert Ken Munro, who has exposed many flaws in IOT devices, told BBC News the proposed legislation was a ""positive step forward, helping to fix the mess that is consumer smart product security"".
""It's important that government doesn't allow the proposed regulation to be watered down during consultation. The proposals are limited, but a good start,"" he said.
""I'm particularly pleased to see product security labelling being proposed, so that buyers can make informed decisions.""

People in the US use car parking spaces for offices - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Sophie Williams Bbc News,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48114878,"People in the US use car parking spaces for offices By Sophie Williams BBC News 1 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption People are paying for parking spots and installing desks outside People in the US are occupying parking spaces to show alternative ways of using them.
People have been posting images of themselves using the hashtag #WePark showing themselves working in car parking spaces in San Francisco.
The group pays for the space and creates makeshift offices, using Wi-Fi from free internet zones or by using their mobile phones as hotspots.
The movement has since spread further afield to France.
WePark was started by Victor Pontis after he set up a desk in a parking space last week.
The entrepreneur told the BBC that the idea for WePark came from Twitter.
""Somebody posted a photo of a truck that someone set up with bike parking on it and somebody mentioned 'What if you could work out of a parking spot?' I thought it was a pretty funny idea and I decided to do it last Thursday,"" he said. When is a free parking space not free
After his successful test, he decided to invite others to join him at a spot near San Francisco's City Hall. Around 30 people turned up throughout the day.
He said: ""I think it's saying that we have prime real estate in our city and some of the nicest areas with the most sun and really close to transit or close to a park or close to a lot of shops and right now we're using that for street parking and charging either $3 or $2 an hour and there are a lot of other uses for that. Image copyright Connie Huang Image caption Mr Pontis said around 30 people joined throughout the day
""The streets are places where people are living and not just depositing cars."" Community feel
Jean Walsh among those who joined the first official WePark. She told the BBC that it helps highlight the ways in which car parking spaces could be utilised in the city.
""We live in a very expensive real estate market. It's just so crazy to think the way we use our street is not reflective of that and so those parking spaces are just dirt cheap compared to all of the other real estate in San Francisco.
""So it's fun to shine a spotlight on that and look at why we would allow this to be used for a giant metal box all day when we could have people playing here, it could be a park, it could be a bike lane or a pick-up drop-off area.""
According to Cushman & Wakefield, a US commercial real estate company, rent in San Francisco's CBD has rocketed to a record $84.16 per square foot - up 9.7% year on year.
Ms Walsh said the working space had a community feel.
She said: ""It was great. Everybody had access and were sitting there working. It was lovely. Someone brought doughnuts, a vase, flowers and a table cloth. I think it's going to be even more fun and advanced next time. You have 12 people working out of a space instead of a vehicle just sitting there doing nothing all day. It's a great use of space."" Changing mindsets
The movement has already spread to France where 21-year-old Valentin Décarpentrie set up his own office in a Toulouse parking space.
After finding out about WePark on Twitter, he says he ""decided to follow the movement"" and duplicate it. He said that one person wanted to park in the space but left after seeing Mr Décarpentrie's parking ticket. Image copyright Valentin Décarpentrie Image caption Valentin Décarpentrie set up his own office in a Toulouse parking space
The entrepreneur says he thinks the idea will continue ""because it has already gone international and mindsets are changing about global warming.""
He said: ""People are starting to act and this is a cheap way to do it.""
""Office spaces are expensive and here in France if your company is less than one year old, no one wants to rent you anything, even with warranties. But that's not the real problem, because working remotely is a perfect alternative. The other real problem is the cities that just don't do anything to reduce the polluting cars' activity.""
It's not the first time campaigners have tried to take control of parking spaces in their area. Brenda Puech filled a car parking space in London with plants and chairs in a bid to make a space for the community.
She was evicted from her mini-park, according to the Hackney Gazette. However because of its popularity, people in Hackney were able to apply for a permit to open their own mini-park under a trial scheme. "
Kashmir attack: Tracing the path that led to Pulwama - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47302467,"The Kashmiri art bringing Hindus and Muslims together
Others speak of his frustration with the political situation in Kashmir. ""He was saddened by militants 'dying like chickens', without putting up a fight or inflicting casualties on the other side,"" said Altaf, another relative, who arrived with hundreds of villagers to attend Dar's funeral the day after the attack.
The support extended to the family is unsurprising given that many Kashmiris resent Indian security forces and accuse them of human rights violations. In the past few years, funerals of militants in south Kashmir have drawn large crowds. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Relatives and neighbours in Dar's house in Gundibagh
Jibran Ahmad, a Pulwama resident, says: ""You become a militant in a police station or an army camp, not inside the four corners of your house.
""Many of those arrested by police in 2016 joined the militancy. Perhaps they thought it was better than being humiliated every day.""
Some of the men joining the militants recently have been highly educated and come from financially stable families. A federal minister told India's parliament in December that at least 26 of these new militants in 2018 were graduates and he referred to them as ""misguided youth"". Why did 2018 see more violence in Indian-administered Kashmir?
Sushant Sareen, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, an independent think tank, says part of the problem is that violence is ""glorified"".
""In most societies there is no social sanction given to people who indulge in violence. In Kashmir, however, there is social sanction - a certain amount of 'coolness',"" he says. Image copyright Abid bhat Image caption Kashmir has been racked by protests that often turn violent
He adds: ""When stone pelting is happening, should the government hunker down and do nothing? When people pick up arms, should they do nothing?""
No army ever wants to fire on unarmed civilians, he says.
One policeman based in Kashmir who wished to remain anonymous says India's approach has not worked. He said he did not want to be identified because he feared being rebuked by his superiors for speaking publicly about such a sensitive issue.
""When you kill one militant, two more are ready to join. Political outreach is important but in recent years we have focused on killing militants,"" he says.
Author and counter-terrorism expert Ajai Sahni says India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has demonised the valley and ""created an enemy for the entire country"" which may be a ""successful election strategy but is disastrous for national security"".

William Barr: Five questions for US attorney general - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Anthony Zurcher North America Reporter,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48071191,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Attorney General William Barr will return to Capitol Hill for the first time since his justice department released a redacted version of the Mueller report into 2016 Russian election meddling. Democrats will be waiting and ready to grill him.
At the moment the attorney general is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and the equivalent House committee on Thursday - although there's ongoing dispute over the format of the latter hearing. (Democrats want to have a staff lawyer conduct extended questioning outside of each member's five-minute allotted time.)
It's unclear at this point how this will all play out, but what is clear is that there are a number of lines of inquiry awaiting the attorney general. Here's a look at some of the questions that might be in store. When did you decide there was no obstruction - and why?
Donald Trump, in an interview last week with Fox News host Sean Hannity, said that Mr Barr made up his mind that the president did not commit obstruction of justice ""right on the spot"" after receiving the Mueller report.
That cuts against the justice department line that it took several days to review the report and craft the attorney general's four-page letter summarising its findings. It may cause some Democrats to suspect that Mr Barr never actually considered the possibility of presidential obstruction and that an unsolicited June 2018 memo to the justice department about presidential immunity from obstruction charges was indeed an accurate reflection of his views (and quite possibly a prime reason why Mr Trump picked him for the job).
In his two-page summary of the Mueller report, Mr Barr concluded there was ""not sufficient"" evidence to merit prosecuting Mr Trump because there was no underlying crime of conspiracy with Russia and no evidence of ""corrupt intent"" by the president.
That was before the Mueller report detailed the long list of possible presidential obstruction, including requests for White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mr Mueller and attempts to have then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions resume oversight of the investigation or curtail its scope.
A report by the Washington Post on Tuesday night that Mr Mueller wrote to Mr Barr in late March to complain that the attorney general's four-page memo ""did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance"" of the special counsel's report only raises the stakes.
Expect Democrats to go point by point through these specific instances and press Mr Barr to explain why each action didn't meet the threshold for criminal charges. Did you mischaracterise Mueller's obstruction analysis?
In the obstruction section of his report, Mr Mueller explained that he felt bound by justice department guidelines that prohibited the indictment of a sitting president. Because a president would not be able to present a defence at trial, he reasoned, it would be improper to express a view about whether or not a president had engaged in criminal conduct.
Those, in a nutshell, are the ""difficult issues"" that the special counsel said prevented his office from making a ""traditional prosecutorial judgement"". Twice, however, he noted that the report did not exonerate the president.
Mr Barr, in his two-page letter, seemingly glossed over this reasoning, instead saying the Mueller report ""sets out evidence on both sides"" but, in the end, ""did not draw a conclusion - one way or the other"". The attorney general then put aside the question of whether a president could be indicted and concluded that the evidence was not sufficient in any case.
Democrats in Congress may challenge Mr Barr's decision to make this determination rather than, say, leaving it to the House of Representatives to review the information as part of an impeachment inquiry.
The attorney general will be pressed to explain why he acted as he did - and why he didn't more clearly explain in the first instance why Mr Mueller left the obstruction issue an open question. When will it be Mueller's turn?
Watching Mr Barr duck and weave under hostile questions is all well and good, but the man Democrats really want to hear from is the special counsel himself. They'd love to ask him how close the multitude of various contacts Trump campaign officials had with Russians came to criminal conspiracy and how confident he is that various witnesses - including Mr McGahn - are telling the truth.
Mr Barr will get those questions, too, but chances are his answers will be less than revelatory. If and when Mr Mueller finally steps out of the shadows it will be the kind of high drama seldom seen on Capitol Hill.
For the moment, Mr Mueller is still an employee of the justice department, reporting, ultimately, to Mr Barr himself. The House Judiciary Committee has extended an invitation to the special counsel to appear publicly, but they've yet to receive an answer. The attorney general could speed the process along, if he wanted to.
At the very least, Democrats will want Mr Barr to explain why he doesn't seem to be much help. Why all the redactions?
The Mueller report was made public with roughly 36 pages of redacted material. At the time of its release, Mr Barr explained that this action covered four categories of material - dealing with ongoing investigations, grand jury proceedings, sensitive intelligence data and ""peripheral third party"" information.
For Democrats in Congress, the redacted version - or even a slightly less redacted one - isn't good enough. Mr Nadler has said he wants his committee to see the full report and ""underlying evidence"".
Expect Mr Nadler and others to press Mr Barr to more fully explain his reasons for withholding the full document from Congress - and provide insight on how the justice department might respond if he receives a congressional subpoena demanding it. What were the origins of the Russia investigation?
Democrats will get most of the attention during Mr Barr's Capitol Hill appearances this week, but it's worth remembering that Republicans will have just as much time to ask their questions. Expect many of them to try to shift the focus to the early days of the Russia investigation and the now-controversial figures - like FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Director Andre McCabe and Obama administration intelligence officials - who played key roles in what began as a counter-intelligence investigation.
Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Obama White House ""spied"" on his campaign. While there's no evidence of that, the justice department did obtain a secret warrant to surveil Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, and used an FBI informant to approach Page, George Papadopoulos - who also advised the Trump team - and Sam Clovis, the campaign's national co-chair.
Several weeks ago, in Senate testimony prior to the Mueller report's release, Mr Barr said that he also believed the government had spied on the Trump campaign.
Republicans will probably encourage the attorney general to expand on his allegations and, perhaps, reveal more about who started the investigation - and why. "

Schalke have had a difficult campaign and only eased their relegation worries with a surprise win over local rivals Borussia Dortmund on Saturday.
They appointed club legend Stevens as interim manager to the end of the season last month following the departure of Domenico Tedesco, who was sacked on 14 March following the embarrassing 7-0 Champions League defeat by Manchester City.
Wagner spent four years as coach of Borussia Dortmund's second team before joining Huddersfield in 2015.

South Africa: Is the gap between rich and poor widening? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Peter Mwai Bbc Reality Check,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48023890,"South Africans go to the polls on 8 May with, the gap between the rich and the poor set to be a key issue.
It is Africa's most industrialised economy - but it is also one of the world's most unequal.
The opposition says this has been getting worse under the ANC, which has been in power for a quarter of a century.
So is this true? BBC Reality Check looks at the numbers.
Measuring inequality One measure used by economists to illustrate the degree of inequality within a country is known as the Gini scale. It's based on personal income - the higher the number, the greater the inequality.
On this scale, a zero value represents a completely equal society and 100 the most unequal.
It doesn't tell the whole story but it is at least a starting point for looking at inequality in South Africa both over time and compared with other countries.
South Africa is more unequal than others Gini score
Figures for 2014 except Namibia (2015) and US (2013) Source: World Bank data
By this measure, and using data published by the World Bank, South Africa has the highest level of inequality in the world.
Its neighbours Namibia and Mozambique are close behind, with Brazil also making its way into the top four.
If we then look at the change in this measure over time, and take the period since the ANC came to power in 1994, inequality rose through the 1990s to a peak in 2005.
Since then, it has not changed significantly.
High inequality has not changed Gini score
Source: World Bank data
So, based on the Gini data, critics of the ANC government are correct to point out that inequality is very high in South Africa.
But they are not correct in saying that it's getting worse, at least not over the last decade for which data is available.
Slower economic growth For several years after it came to power, the ANC government made progress in reducing poverty and improving access to basic services.
This was helped by years of decent economic growth - but now that has slowed.
The result is that, overall, South Africans are now poorer.
Income per head - that is, the total output of the economy divided by the population - has fallen fairly steadily since 2010.
Joblessness rises as growth slows Source: World Bank
Unemployment has continued to rise over this period.
The opposition Democratic Alliance leader, Mmusi Maimane, says the gap between ""economic insiders and outsiders"" has grown.
""There is no indication of it closing. We are a country split in two,"" he says.
And Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a minister in the South African presidency, says: ""Inequality has remained stubbornly high.""

Using the South African government's own measure of poverty - any household earning below $55 (£42) per month - the official data shows that between 2006 and 2011 the proportion below that level dropped from 51% to 36.4%.
But by 2015, this proportion had risen again - to 40%.
""On the whole, the poor have not been the direct beneficiaries of economic growth,"" says Carlene van der Westhuizen, a South African economist who has written a report for the US-based Brookings Institution.
Image copyright AFP Differences in employment incomes were the largest contributor to inequality in South Africa between 2006 and 2015 , according to a joint World Bank and South African government report.
""Access to higher levels of education and stable labour market income are key determinants for households to achieve economic stability in South Africa,"" the report says.
The country's welfare system has been credited with reducing extreme poverty but sustaining it will prove costly for government finances.
Which groups are most affected? A higher proportion of black South Africans have historically lived in poverty compared with Asian and white South Africans.
And between 2011 and 2015, the proportion of black and Coloured (mixed-race) people in poverty increased, according to government data.
Poverty and race in South Africa Percentage living below poverty line
Source: Statistics South Africa
A little over 10% of the working population is white - but this group earns nearly three times the average wage of black South Africans, who make up nearly three-quarters of the labour force.
Although wages have increased for all racial groups, the middle earners have lost the most in the post-apartheid era.
Wages for high income earners are growing at almost twice the rate of those of the lowest earners, according to the World Bank.
And the share of total income for the richest 1% doubled in the 20 years after 1994 to levels comparable with those seen in the United States.
