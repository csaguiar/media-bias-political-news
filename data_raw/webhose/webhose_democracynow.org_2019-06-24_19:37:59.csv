NOAM CHOMSKY : I want to make a couple of remarks below about the severe difficulty of maintaining and instituting democracy, the powerful forces that have always opposed it, the achievements of somehow salvaging and enhancing it, and the significance of that for the future. But first, a couple of words about the challenges that we face, which you heard enough about already and you all know about. I don’t have to go into them in detail. To describe these challenges as “extremely severe” would be an error. The phrase does not capture the enormity of the kinds of challenges that lie ahead. And any serious discussion of the future of humanity must begin by recognizing a critical fact, that the human species is now facing a question that has never before arisen in human history, question that has to be answered quickly: Will human society survive for long?
Well, as you all know, for 70 years we’ve been living under the shadow of nuclear war. Those who have looked at the record can only be amazed that we’ve survived this far. Time after time it’s come extremely close to terminal disaster, even minutes away. It’s kind of a miracle that we’ve survived. Miracles don’t go on forever. This has to be terminated, and quickly. The recent Nuclear Posture Review of the Trump administration dramatically increases the threat of conflagration, which would in fact be terminal for the species. We may remember that this Nuclear Posture Review was sponsored by Jim Mattis, who was regarded as too civilized to be retained in the administration—gives you a sense of what can be tolerated in the Trump-Pompeo-Bolton world.
Well, there were three major arms treaties: the ABM Treaty, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty; the INF Treaty, Intermediate Nuclear Forces; the New START treaty.
The U.S. pulled out of the ABM Treaty in 2002. And anyone who believes that anti-ballistic missiles are defensive weapons is deluded about the nature of these systems.
The U.S. has just pulled out of the INF Treaty, established by Gorbachev and Reagan in 1987, which sharply reduced the threat of war in Europe, which would very quickly spread. The background of that signing of that treaty was the demonstrations that you just saw depicted on the film. Massive public demonstrations were the background for leading to a treaty that made a very significant difference. It’s worth remembering that and many other cases where significant popular activism has made a huge difference. The lessons are too obvious to enumerate. Well, the Trump administration has just withdrawn from the INF Treaty; the Russians withdrew right afterwards. If you take a close look, you find that each side has a kind of a credible case saying that the opponent has not lived up to the treaty. For those who want a picture of how the Russians might look at it, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , the major journal on arms control issues, had a lead article a couple weeks ago by Theodore Postol pointing out how dangerous the U.S. installations of anti-ballistic missiles on the Russian border—how dangerous they are and can be perceived to be by the Russians. Notice, on the Russian border. Tensions are mounting on the Russian border. Both sides are carrying out provocative actions. We should—in a rational world, what would happen would be negotiations between the two sides, with independent experts to evaluate the charges that each is making against the other, to lead to a resolution of these charges, restore the treaty. That’s a rational world. But it’s unfortunately not the world we’re living in. No efforts at all have been made in this direction. And they won’t be, unless there is significant pressure.
Well, that leaves the New START treaty. The New START treaty has already been designated by the figure in charge, who has modestly described himself as the greatest president in American history—he gave it the usual designation of anything that was done by his predecessors: the worst treaty that ever happened in human history; we’ve got to get rid of it. If in fact—this comes up for renewal right after the next election, and a lot is at stake. A lot is at stake in whether that treaty will be renewed. It has succeeded in very significantly reducing the number of nuclear weapons, to a level way above what they ought to be but way below what they were before. And it could go on.
Well, meanwhile, global warming proceeds on its inexorable course. During this millennium, every single year, with one exception, has been hotter than the last one. There are recent scientific papers, James Hansen and others, which indicate that the pace of global warming, which has been increasing since about 1980, may be sharply escalating and may be moving from linear growth to exponential growth, which means doubling every couple of decades. We’re already approaching the conditions of 125,000 years ago, when the sea level was about roughly 25 feet higher than it is today, with the melting, the rapid melting, of the Antarctic, huge ice fields. We might—that point might be reached. The consequences of that are almost unimaginable. I mean, I won’t even try to depict them, but you can figure out quickly what that means.
Well, meanwhile, while this is going on, you regularly read in the press euphoric accounts of how the United States is advancing in fossil fuel production. It’s now surpassed Saudi Arabia. We’re in the lead of fossil fuel production. The big banks, JPMorgan Chase and others, are pouring money into new investments in fossil fuels, including the most dangerous, like Canadian tar sands. And this is all presented with great euphoria, excitement. We’re now reaching energy independence. We can control the world, determine the use of fossil fuels in the world.
Barely a word on what the meaning of this is, which is quite obvious. It’s not that the reporters, commentators don’t know about it, that the CEO of the banks don’t know about it. Of course they do. But these are kind of institutional pressures that just are extremely hard to extricate themselves from. You can put yourself in the—try to put yourself in the position of, say, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank, which is spending large sums in investment in fossil fuels. He certainly knows everything that you all know about global warming. It’s no secret. But what are the choices? Basically he has two choices. One choice is to do exactly what he’s doing. The other choice is to resign and be replaced by somebody else who will do exactly what he’s doing. It’s not an individual problem. It’s an institutional problem, which can be met, but only under tremendous public pressure.
And we’ve recently seen, very dramatically, how it can—how the solution can be reached. A group of young people, Sunrise Movement, organized, got to the point of sitting in in congressional offices, aroused some interest from the new progressive figures who were able to make it to Congress. Under a lot of popular pressure, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined by Ed Markey, actually placed the Green New Deal on the agenda. That’s a remarkable achievement. Of course, it gets hostile attacks from everywhere: It doesn’t matter. A couple of years ago it was unimaginable that it would be discussed. As the result of the activism of this group of young people, it’s now right in the center of the agenda. It’s got to be implemented in one form or another. It’s essential for survival, maybe not in exactly that form, but some modification of it. Tremendous change achieved by the commitment of a small group of young people. That tells you the kind of thing that can be done.
Meanwhile, the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists last January was set at two minutes to midnight. That’s the closest it’s been to terminal disaster since 1947. The announcement of the settlement—of the setting mentioned the two major familiar threats: the threat of nuclear war, which is increasing, threat of global warming, which is increasing further. And it added a third for the first time: the undermining of democracy. That’s the third threat, along with global warming and nuclear war. And that was quite appropriate, because functioning democracy offers the only hope of overcoming these threats. They are not going to be dealt with by major institutions, state or private, acting without massive public pressure, which means that the means of democratic functioning have to be kept alive, used the way the Sunshine Movement did it, the way the great mass demonstration in the early ’80s did it, and the way we continue today.

"Noam Chomsky: We Must Confront the “Ultranationalist, Reactionary” Movements Growing Across Globe | Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/27/noam_chomsky_we_must_confront_the," Technology, where he taught for more than 50 years.
AMY GOODMAN : Today, a Democracy Now! special, an hour with Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned dissident and father of modern linguistics. In April, Noam Chomsky visited his hometown of Boston, where he was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for more than half a century. He now teaches at the University of Arizona, Tucson. Over 700 people packed into the Old South Church to hear him speak. Later in the broadcast, we’ll air my on-stage interview with him, but first we turn to his speech.
NOAM CHOMSKY : If you’ll indulge me, I’d like to start with a brief reminiscence of a period which is eerily similar to today in many unpleasant respects. I’m thinking of exactly 80 years ago, almost to the day, happened to be the moment of the first article that I remember having written on political issues. Easy to date: It was right after the fall of Barcelona in February 1939.
The article was about what seemed to be the inexorable spread of fascism over the world. In 1938, Austria had been annexed by Nazi Germany. A few months later, Czechoslovakia was betrayed, placed in the hands of the Nazis at the Munich Conference. In Spain, one city after another was falling to Franco’s forces. February 1939, Barcelona fell. That was the end of the Spanish Republic. The remarkable popular revolution, anarchist revolution, of 1936, ’37, ’38, had already been crushed by force. It looked as if fascism was going to spread without end.
It’s not exactly what’s happening today, but, if we can borrow Mark Twain’s famous phrase, “History doesn’t repeat but sometimes rhymes.” Too many similarities to overlook.
When Barcelona fell, there was a huge flood of refugees from Spain. Most went to Mexico, about 40,000. Some went to New York City, established anarchist offices in Union Square, secondhand bookstores down 4th Avenue. That’s where I got my early political education, roaming around that area. That’s 80 years ago. Now it’s today.
We didn’t know at the time, but the U.S. government was also beginning to think about how the spread of fascism might be virtually unstoppable. They didn’t view it with the same alarm that I did as a 10-year-old. We now know that the attitude of the State Department was rather mixed regarding what the significance of the Nazi movement was. Actually, there was a consul in Berlin, U.S. consul in Berlin, who was sending back pretty mixed comments about the Nazis, suggesting maybe they’re not as bad as everyone says. He stayed there until Pearl Harbor Day, when he was withdrawn—famous diplomat named George Kennan. Not a bad indication of the mixed attitude towards these developments.
It turns out, couldn’t have known it at the time, but shortly after this, 1939, the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations began to carry out planning about the postwar world, what would the postwar world look like. And in the early years, right about that time, next few years, they assumed that the postwar world would be divided between a German-controlled world, Nazi-controlled world, most of Eurasia, and a U.S.-controlled world, which would include the Western Hemisphere, the former British Empire, which the U.S. would take over, parts of the Far East. And that would be the shape of the postwar world. Those views, we now know, were maintained until the Russians turned the tide. Stalingrad, 1942, the huge tank battle at Kursk, a little later, made it pretty clear that the Russians would defeat the Nazis. The planning changed. Picture of the postwar world changed, went on to what we’ve seen for the last period since that time. Well, that was 80 years ago.
Today we do not—we are not facing the rise of anything like Nazism, but we are facing the spread of what’s sometimes called the ultranationalist, reactionary international, trumpeted openly by its advocates, including Steve Bannon, the impresario of the movement. Just had a victory yesterday: The Netanyahu election in Israel solidified the reactionary alliance that’s being established, all of this under the U.S. aegis, run by the triumvirate, the Trump-Pompeo-Bolton triumvirate—could borrow a phrase from George W. Bush to describe them, but, out of politeness, I won’t. The Middle East alliance consists of the extreme reactionary states of the region—Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt under the most brutal dictatorship of its history, Israel right at the center of it—confronting Iran. Severe threats that we’re facing in Latin America. The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil put in power the most extreme, most outrageous of the right-wing ultranationalists who are now plaguing the hemisphere. Yesterday, Lenín Moreno of Ecuador took a strong step towards joining the far-right alliance by expelling Julian Assange from the embassy. He’s picked up quickly by the U.S., will face a very dangerous future unless there’s a significant popular protest. Mexico is one of the rare exceptions in Latin America to these developments. This has happened—in Western Europe, the right-wing parties are growing, some of them very frightening in character.
There is a counterdevelopment. Yanis Varoufakis, the former finance minister of Greece, a very significant, important individual, along with Bernie Sanders, have urged the formation of the Progressive International to counter the right-wing international that’s developing. At the level of states, the balance looks overwhelmingly in the wrong direction. But states aren’t the only entities. At the level of people, it’s quite different. And that could make the difference. That means a need to protect the functioning democracies, to enhance them, to make use of the opportunities they provide, for the kinds of activism that have led to significant progress in the past could save us in the future.

Scott Warren Provided Food & Water to Migrants in Arizona; He Now Faces Up to 20 Years in Prison | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/29/scott_warren_provided_food_water_to,"Scott Warren Provided Food & Water to Migrants in Arizona; He Now Faces Up to 20 Years in Prison Story May 29, 2019 No More Deaths volunteer and activist. Links Donate
An Arizona humanitarian aid volunteer goes to trial today for providing water, food, clean clothes and beds to two undocumented migrants crossing the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona. If convicted, Scott Warren could spend up to 20 years in prison. Warren, an activist with the Tucson-based No More Deaths, is charged with three felony counts of allegedly “harboring” undocumented immigrants. For years, No More Deaths and other humanitarian aid groups in southern Arizona have left water and food in the harsh Sonoran Desert, where the temperature often reaches three digits during summer, to help refugees and migrants survive the deadly journey across the U.S. border. Warren was arrested on January 17, 2018, just hours after No More Deaths released a report detailing how U.S. Border Patrol agents had intentionally destroyed more than 3,000 gallons of water left out for migrants crossing the border. The group also published a video showing border agents dumping out jugs of water in the desert. Hours after the report was published, authorities raided the Barn, a No More Deaths aid camp in Ajo, where they found two migrants who had sought temporary refuge.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We turn now to southern Arizona, where a humanitarian aid volunteer is heading to trial today for providing food, water and shelter to two undocumented migrants. Scott Warren of Ajo, Arizona, faces up to 20 years in prison after being charged with three felony counts for allegedly harboring undocumented migrants. Warren is a geographer who volunteers with No More Deaths and Ajo Samaritans, two southern Arizona-based humanitarian aid organizations. For years, the groups have left water and food in the harsh Sonoran Desert to help refugees and migrants survive the deadly journey across the U.S. border.
AMY GOODMAN : Warren was arrested January 17, 2018, just hours after No More Deaths released a report detailing how U.S. border agents had intentionally destroyed more than 3,000 gallons of water left out for migrants crossing the border. The group also published a video showing border agents dumping out jugs of water in the desert. Hours after the report was published, authorities raided Warren’s home in Ajo, where they found two migrants who had sought temporary refuge. Amnesty International and other human rights groups are now calling for the charges to be dropped against Warren.
In a moment, Scott Warren will join us from Tucson, but first I want to turn to a short documentary by Laura Saunders for The Intercept about the work of humanitarian aid workers, including Warren, on the border. It’s titled “Let Them Have Water.”
MIMI PHILLIPS : We savor our desert, but this desert, right around our town, where we recreate, held 57 bodies, 57 remains of human beings, last year. Fifty-seven. Do you find remains in your parks, in your golf courses, in your neighborhood playgrounds? What would that make you feel like?
UNIDENTIFIED : May the spirits of our brothers and sisters walk in beauty for eternity. Thank you, creator.
SCOTT WARREN : I am Scott Warren, and I’m a geographer. And I have lived in Ajo for about six years now. The moment that really changed for me, got me involved in a big way, was moving here to Ajo and just experiencing the border in a more visceral way, being here in the summer, running into people in the desert who had walked across the desert and were in need of water, meeting other folks who were doing humanitarian aid. It just seemed like, if not the most important, one of the most important issues facing this place. For me to not be involved in that would be like not being fully engaged and fully present in this place.
So, groups like No More Deaths and Samaritans, Humane Borders, Aguilas del Desierto and the Armadillos, for instance, have all provided humanitarian aid and done search and rescue in different ways here in the desert. We went from finding human remains every other month to like finding five sets of human remains on a single trip hiking through the Growler Valley and then going back a week later and finding two more sets of remains, and then, on a single day of searching, finding like eight sets of remains and bodies of people who had died in adjacent areas of the bombing range and on Cabeza Prieta. So just this like scale of this crisis, of the humanitarian crisis and the missing persons crisis, just blew wide open.
CÉSAR ORTIGOZA : My name is César Ortigoza, and I’m the president of Armadillos Search and Rescue. We’ve been doing this for almost six years. We’re proud in our sticking together for a long time, you know? This work is really necessary for the families that are in need of our help.
OFFICER : What’s going on, guys?
CÉSAR ORTIGOZA : Yeah, we’re going to La Muela right now.
OFFICER : Oh, La Muela? La Muela?
CÉSAR ORTIGOZA : La Muela, yeah. We’re searching for a guy that was left out there.
OFFICER : Oh, you’re searching for a body?
CÉSAR ORTIGOZA : Yeah, uh-huh.
OFFICER : Is it just one that you know of? Or…
CÉSAR ORTIGOZA : Yeah. Well, there is three, actually.
OFFICER : Three?
CÉSAR ORTIGOZA : You know, but one of them is the more recent. We hope to find him today.
It’s really grateful to have all these people, these volunteers, because we might belong to different families, we might not even be related to each other, but inside here we have to be a family, you know?
ARMADILLOS SEARCH AND RESCUE MEMBER : [translated] In your hands, Lord, we ask this morning that you help us reach the place where the people that need your help are. Father, we ask this so that we can help them, as it is the mission we carry in our hearts.
CÉSAR ORTIGOZA : We just have to be realistic and know that we have to be strong. You know, even though it breaks our hearts to find these remains, we have to be strong and keep on going, you know, because, otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to do this job. About three months ago, we found the remains from a little boy or girl, probably 5, 6 years old. And it’s really sad to think what they had to go through and how they died. And knowing that their families won’t be able to see them anymore, it’s really, really hard. But we have to keep on doing it. You know, it’s really necessary.
ARMADILLOS SEARCH AND RESCUE MEMBER : [translated] Do you have it in your hand?
CÉSAR ORTIGOZA : Our responsibility is just to give them the coordinates. And once they have it, that’s really up to them if they come over and get him.
SCOTT WARREN : In January of 2018, I was arrested by Border Patrol and charged with harboring. In the Border Patrol criminal complaint against me, they said that I was providing food, water, beds and clean clothes to two men, and so they charged me with harboring. Went through Border Patrol custody and then appeared in front of a judge and was released on my own recognizance. And that was over a year ago, and we’ve been engaged in various legal proceedings leading up to a potential trial sometime later this year.
MIMI PHILLIPS : I’m Mimi Phillips. I moved to Ajo about 15 years ago. And about eight or nine years ago, a group of us began a small version of the Samaritans here. I guess every time I look at Scott, I think of my own son. And it’s unconscionable to think that he’s been charged with felonies for doing what, as a parent, I would be so proud of what he had done. And I know his parents are proud.
SCOTT WARREN : People have always crossed in the Ajo area. People have always been walking through the desert. People have always been finding ways to come here through the desert. But what happened is it was turned into a major industrial-scale operation in the 1990s and early 2000s, as they really pushed people out into places like these, in these deserts and mountains. What had been really a small-scale thing, local organizations that move people and goods through the desert, a small handful of Border Patrol agents that might go out and try to interdict people or might be involved in finding people who had died, or local residents who would respond to people who needed food and water, that all just completely mushroomed into this massive, massive industry.
MIMI PHILLIPS : You reach a point where you say, “Enough. You know, whatever the consequences are, enough.”
Drivers with permits should come together to be able to approach law enforcement. And everyone else…
How many more bodies? It’s just not OK. You know, we’re here, and we will leave the water. And we are a real community that isn’t a scary place to live.
SCOTT WARREN : I think one important thing is that people here in Ajo and other local communities on the border have always been providing humanitarian aid and have always responded to people being in need. People here have, you know, provided food and water to folks who are crossing the desert who are in desperate condition. They have responded to rescue people who are in the desert. They have found and recovered the bodies and the bones of people who have died in the desert. So, that’s been going on for forever, basically, and has been a fact of life for people who live here.

AMY GOODMAN : “Let Them Have Water,” a short documentary by Laura Saunders for The Intercept . When we come back, we go to Tucson to speak with Scott Warren, who was arrested in January of 2018 in Ajo, Arizona. He goes on trial today. Stay with us.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : Julieta Venegas. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We’re joined now in Tucson, Arizona, by Scott Warren, the humanitarian aid volunteer who’s heading to trial today for providing aid to two undocumented migrants. He faces up to 20 years in prison after being charged with three felony counts for allegedly harboring undocumented migrants. He was arrested in January 2018 at a location called the Barn, which was used by humanitarian volunteers. Warren is a geographer who volunteers with No More Deaths and Ajo Samaritans.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re also joined in Tucson by another member of No More Deaths, Catherine Gaffney.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Scott, why don’t you lay out what happened on that day in January 2018, when you were at the Barn, as well as other volunteers? Explain who exactly raided and what happened to you there.
SCOTT WARREN : Thanks. I was at the Barn, which is a property in Ajo. It’s used by a variety of—excuse me—humanitarian groups that stage from that property to go out in the desert and put out water and do search and rescue and that sort of thing.
On that day in January of 2018, we were preparing for a group of high school students to arrive, who were going to volunteer to do some of this humanitarian work. It’s a pretty common thing, that student groups will volunteer. And on that day, a couple of Border Patrol agents had set up surveillance kind of across the way from the Barn in an area where they could kind of watch what was happening there. And at some point, they said that they saw me speaking with two men who they somehow determined to be illegally present in the United States.
And so, they set up kind of an operation to raid the Barn, through what they called a knock-and-talk operation. And so, about 5:30, late in the afternoon, early evening, a kind of a convoy of Border Patrol and sheriff’s deputy vehicles entered the Barn, the property there, and at that point I had informed them that they were on private property, and they didn’t have a right to be there. And they persisted and sort of went to the entrance of the Barn. And by the time I kind of arrived at the entrance, where they were kind of looking inside the building, they had already had these two men, who were, they determined to be, illegally present in the country, and they were sort of detaining them. And then, at that point, they informed me that they were going to arrest me and that I was being arrested for harboring.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Scott, I wanted to ask you about this—most people who are not familiar with your part of the country don’t realize that the Arizona desert area is the most deadly place for migrants. And about, what, 38 to 40% of all the deaths along the border occur in the desert areas of Arizona?
SCOTT WARREN : Yeah. Arizona, along with South Texas, are two of the worst areas, really, where we’re finding the most—the highest numbers of people who have died crossing the border. Those numbers that you reference are really disturbing, but they’re just the numbers of bodies and human remains that we have found in the desert. So, we assume that there are many more.
All across Arizona, there are many people who die in the desert, who have died in the desert. The particular area where I live, often called the Ajo corridor, is in southwestern Arizona, and it’s particularly brutal. Many, many people have died there. And this is the area on parts of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and in Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Barry Goldwater bombing range, where we have increasingly been finding many, many bodies and bones of people who have died while crossing the desert.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And ironically, southern Arizona, it was really the center of the copper industry, the state of Arizona, for the entire United States. And for decades, migrant Mexicans, from Mexico, were the ones who worked in many of these mines, weren’t they? And they were legal then to come and work in the mines, but now are suddenly considered, in recent decades, illegal to be able to come into the country.
SCOTT WARREN : That’s a really interesting point that you bring up. Where I live, Ajo, it’s a former copper mining town, a former company town. Everything was controlled by the company. Everybody who came in and went out sort of had to be vetted by the company. Throughout much of the 20th century, particularly early in the 20th century, it was really these copper companies that determined who came and who went. And they were the ones that sort of dictated the nature of the border and sort of who was allowed to be there.
So it’s really fascinating to me to look at how, even though so much has changed—you know, my town is no longer a copper mining town. The mine closed in the '80s. It's very much a postindustrial economy. But in that void, the postindustrial void, we’ve had this massive growth of the border security industry. It’s enormous, enormous across southern Arizona, across all of the border. And by all measures, it looks like it’s going to continue growing.
AMY GOODMAN : Scott Warren, let’s talk about the timing of the raid in January of 2018, just hours after No More Deaths, your organization, released a report detailing how U.S. border agents had intentionally destroyed more than 3,000 gallons of water left out for migrants crossing the border. The group also published a video that showed border agents dumping out jugs of water in the desert. Explain the significance of this, the timing, that same day.
SCOTT WARREN : This was a report released by No More Deaths on the morning that I was arrested. And the report was the second in a series of reports called “The Disappeared” series. And this particular report looked at how humanitarian aid supplies left in the desert were being destroyed by Border Patrol agents. And there was a whole report that was associated with that and a pretty detailed analysis, that you mentioned. The things that really went viral were a couple of those videos, the trail cam videos and others, that showed agents destroying water and dumping out water.
So, this happened on the morning of my arrest. And through various measures now, we’ve learned more of that story. But the report was released that morning, and then agents set up surveillance on the Barn that afternoon and then arrested me that evening.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I’d also like to ask Catherine Gaffney—you’re a volunteer with No More Deaths. Could you talk about the crackdown on people who are trying to assist some of the migrants for humanitarian purposes? I think Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse revealed in a report that there’s been a 30% increase since 2015 in the number of people arrested annually allegedly for harboring or assisting undocumented migrants. But that’s nationwide. What have you been seeing?
CATHERINE GAFFNEY : That’s right. And this is really a somber moment for us, as we go to trial today. Scott is being prosecuted for, as you mentioned, providing food, water, clean clothes and beds to two people who asked him for help. So, what we’ve seen in No More Deaths recently is really an escalation of a long-standing war on the lives of undocumented migrants and undocumented communities in this country. The crisis of deaths and disappearances on the border has been ongoing. There’s more than 7,000 known deaths in the last two decades, and, as Scott said, that’s a vast undercounting of the true number of people who have died or gone missing. But what we’ve really seen in the last several years is a ramping up of attacks, not only directly on the lives of undocumented people crossing through the border, but also on those who make it their work to stop and help people and try to prevent these deaths and suffering.
And that’s not only through humanitarian aid groups such as No More Deaths and in many other search-and-rescue and humanitarian aid groups that work in the borderlands, but, frankly, on the daily lives of many people in the borderlands for whom it’s a normal occurrence for someone to come knock on your door asking for a glass of water or asking for help. So, when we see the expansion of the harboring statutes to criminalize such basic acts of human care, it’s really a concerning interpretation of those statutes. It sort of leads to the conclusion that, you know, if you’re sitting down at the table with your family member who is undocumented and has a different status than you, do you need to check their papers before you pass them the bread? If you invite a neighbor over for a barbecue, you know, do you need to set up a checkpoint before you can share food or water with them?
AMY GOODMAN : Before we end, I wanted to ask Scott—you go on trial today. Amnesty has called for all charges to be dropped. The judge has refused to drop the charges. Your defense today?
SCOTT WARREN : Well, we’ll be really, over the coming week and a half, really outlining our case about the necessity and the need for humanitarian aid, and the clear—the clear right, morally, ethically, spiritually and legally, to give and receive humanitarian aid anywhere, and particularly in the borderland region. So, that’s what we’re putting forth—
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both, but we’re going to continue with Part 2 at democracynow.org. Scott Warren, on trial today, with No More Deaths, and Catherine Gaffney, activist and volunteer with No More Deaths, thank you so much for joining us from Tucson.

"ACLU Lawyer: ""Abortion Today Is Still Legal in All 50 States"" Despite Draconian Anti-Choice Bills",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/29/aclu_lawyer_abortion_today_is_still,"senior staff attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you: What kind of problems do you confront in being able—being a provider, even in Illinois, in terms of potential harassment? Or do you have any fears for yourself, in terms of your own safety, given some of the ongoing protests and even violence that have occurred against other abortion providers around the country?
DR. ERIN KING : So, I’ve been a gynecologist for 15 years, and I do a lot of different work as a gynecologist. I do work specifically doing abortion care. And I do feel harassment from protesters, from people who believe that abortion should be illegal. That has been a long-standing issue, and it does feel scary to provide care, that there are people that don’t agree with you and have in the past been violent against providers who provide that care.
I think this is a whole new level of concern, where we are actually scared of our own health department in Missouri. I am also a licensed physician in Missouri. And it really is intimidating to think that our own state health department could suddenly turn on you for providing legal, safe care that is well within the standards of medical practice. So I think this is a whole new level of concern.
And I’m concerned for our patients. I think patients are hearing in states across the country that their care could be criminalized. Our governor in Missouri, on Friday, signed a ban into law that would prevent abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy. And I think patients themselves are feeling now not just the harassment that the providers feel from the outside, but also from their own state.
AMY GOODMAN : You know, Friday, that date that the clinic can close, the last women’s health clinic that provides abortion in Missouri—it will be the first state not to have one at all—Friday is the 10th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. George Tiller, who was shot dead at the Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, May 31st, 2009. But I wanted to take up that issue of the governor’s signing of the ban, Missouri’s Republican Governor Mike Parson signing that ban on abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions in cases of rape or incest, the law triggering a total ban if Roe v. Wade is overturned. During a debate over the new anti-abortion bill, the Republican Missouri state legislator Barry Hovis said rape by a stranger should be distinguished by what he called, quote, “consensual rape.”
REP . BARRY HOVIS : Just say someone goes out and they have—or they’re raped or they’re sexually assaulted one night after a college party, because most of my rapes were not the gentleman jumping out of the bushes that nobody had ever met. That was one or two times out of a hundred. Most of them were date rapes or consensual rapes, which were all terrible. But I’d sat in court—sat in court—when juries would struggle with those type of situations where it was a “he said/she said,” and they would find the person not guilty.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Republican state legislator Barry Hovis saying rape by a stranger is different from rape by—by consensual rape.
Well, I also want to turn to the powerful words of Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow , and she’s now a New York Times columnist. She recently wrote about her own abortion in a column titled “My Rapist Apologized: I still needed an abortion.” She writes, “I wondered how a 'rape exception' to an abortion ban could possibly help women, like me, who did not want to report a rape to the police and who could not possibly prove that a rape occurred if the man denied it. Criminal cases take months, even years, to be resolved. Would abortions be allowed based on mere allegations of rape without any proof? If not, what would a woman have to prove in a matter of days or weeks to get an abortion in the first trimester? How could she overcome the inevitable denial? What man would admit to rape knowing that he’d face a likely prison sentence?” Those are the words of Michelle Alexander in her recent New York Times column.
I want to bring in Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Your response to both Hovis, this Missouri state legislator, and what Michelle Alexander said?
ALEXA KOLBI - MOLINAS : You know, I think that before this year, we wouldn’t have even seen abortion bans like this being proposed without a rape and incest exception. So what we’re seeing now is just an unprecedented rise in the extremism and in the radical nature of these bans. You know, before this year, politicians would have been afraid to even introduce a ban like that, and now they feel emboldened.
But nonetheless, I think, as Michelle Alexander’s column really aptly points out, at the end of the day, an abortion ban is an abortion ban, and these exceptions for rape and incest, for far too many people, just provide no help at all. So, really, an abortion ban with or without one of these exceptions is going to be just as damaging to people.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you—as you mentioned this onslaught now of legislation across the country, it seems almost a deliberate effort, just at this particular point, by the Republican majorities in different state legislatures to begin a whole new culture war here on the issue of—or to ramp up the culture wars just in the run-up to a new presidential election to mobilize their own base. It almost—it’s so opportunistic that at this particular moment, all of a sudden, all of these bills are being passed across the country, almost in a coordinated fashion.
ALEXA KOLBI - MOLINAS : Oh, you’re absolutely right. This is definitely a ramping up, and it is definitely a coordinated strategy. Since 2011, we have actually seen more than 400 restrictions on abortions passed in state legislatures. But what’s happening this year is definitely a national and concerted effort by politicians, who have really been emboldened by President Trump’s anti-abortion agenda, to really ratchet it up a notch and now go directly—take direct aim at Roe v. Wade with abortion bans. So that’s really what we’re seeing. It’s this campaign that has been developing over time, but is absolutely ramping up and reaching a new stage this year.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, of course, you took on the abortion ban in Alabama, which is also no exception for rape or incest. We’re now talking about Missouri, one of six states with just one abortion clinic left; the others: Kentucky, Mississippi, North and South Dakota and West Virginia. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court declined to take up—now, this is really hard to understand—declined to take up a provision of an Indiana law that bars abortions based on sex, race or disability of the fetus, the decision keeping in place a lower court injunction on the measure. But Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court justice, indicated in a 20-page opinion he supports the law, writing, “Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement.” Can you decipher what this is about and also what was upheld in the case of the Indiana law, that Mike Pence signed off on when he was governor, and what the Supreme Court refused to rule on?
ALEXA KOLBI - MOLINAS : Sure. So, in Indiana, like in so many other states, again, we have seen just an onslaught of restrictions, designed both at pushing abortion care out of reach but also stigmatizing and shaming the people who access abortion care. So what happened yesterday was that there were two laws in Indiana, one which has to do with disposal of fetal tissue, and the other, which was really an unprecedented, intrusive law, that tried to ban abortions based on the reason that the person was seeking the abortion. No such law has ever been upheld in any state.
And so, what we got from the Supreme Court was a mixed decision. The lower courts had struck down both of those provisions. The Supreme Court said, with respect to the ban on abortions based on a person’s reason, we’re going to let the decision of the lower court stand, meaning that law is never going to take effect. It was blocked, it was held unconstitutional, and that’s not going to change.
The other decision on the other law was—it’s important to, I think, understand about that law that it actually wasn’t brought under the Roe v. Wade line of cases, so it really wasn’t a direct challenge or not to the access to abortion. There was no evidence that that law was actually stopping—the fetal tissue disposal law was actually preventing anybody from getting an abortion or would prevent anybody. So, really, while it’s unfortunate because we know that the purpose of that law is really to shame and stigmatize people who seek abortion care, the Supreme Court’s decision in allowing that law to stand isn’t going to interfere with access to abortion.
And, of course, what we saw from Justice Thomas’s occurrence is really something that is just driving so many of these laws, which is just the utter distrust of people who choose to terminate their pregnancies, a belief that anybody who makes that personal and private decision, that it’s just not the right time for them and their family to have a child, could be doing something discriminatory, could be acting as a eugenicist. It just shows such a lack of [trust]. And it’s quite offensive to the one in four women in this country who choose to have abortions, for reasons that are entirely their own and really personal to their family and their circumstances.
AMY GOODMAN : So what happens? The injunction just stands, and this will not go into effect in Indiana?
ALEXA KOLBI - MOLINAS : Exactly, the injunction stands, and it will not.
AMY GOODMAN : But fetal burial does.
ALEXA KOLBI - MOLINAS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : And talk about what that means and the expense incurred and also what it means psychologically when you’re saying that the fetus must be buried or cremated. What about if you have a miscarriage?
ALEXA KOLBI - MOLINAS : I mean, this was one of the irrational elements of the law, which I think had been pointed out in the lawsuit and which is why the lower courts had enjoined it. You know, obviously, when a person has a miscarriage at home, none of these restrictions would apply. They are only targeted at abortion clinics. So, again, it really goes to show you what the motivation here was.
And, you know, this is—again, this is part of the just numerous restrictions. You heard from Dr. King talking about the numerous regulations and licensing requirements that abortion clinics have to comply with, that really go above and beyond anything else any other medical provider has to comply with. And so, really, this is just part and parcel of those burdens and, again, just going back to these attempts to shame and stigmatize abortion care, to really marginalize it from the rest of healthcare, which is exactly what it is.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, you’ve filed a challenge to the Alabama law. How do you see these various challenges of this raft of laws across the country proceeding over the next year or two? Is it likely that this is going to reach the Supreme Court and have a decision before the presidential election, or is it more likely that it would happen afterward?
ALEXA KOLBI - MOLINAS : It takes years—it can take years for cases to reach the Supreme Court, so I’m not sure that any of these cases are on the fast track to get up to the Supreme Court. And again, of course, as we saw on Tuesday, the Supreme Court doesn’t even take all the cases that come to it.
So, when it comes to these bans, like we’ve seen in Ohio, in Kentucky, in Alabama, in Missouri, in Georgia, I’m very confident that the lower courts are going to block these bans and are going to prevent them from taking effect. And I think it’s very important that people know that, that abortion today is still legal in all 50 states in the country. And, you know, as Dr. King mentioned and as the providers in Alabama have found, they are getting calls from people every day to the clinics, terrified, panicked that abortion is already illegal. So it’s definitely very important, I think, to get the message out there that these bans, they are going to be blocked, and abortion remains legal in all 50 states.
AMY GOODMAN : Final comment from Dr. Erin King, right there on the frontline, right over the border from St. Louis in Illinois, executive director of the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, Illinois. As this clinic is about to close—again, just repeating this—on May 31st, unless the court case that’s going to be heard today, something happens with that—again, on that 10th anniversary of Dr. George Tiller’s assassination, an abortion provider in Kansas—how you’re all protecting yourselves, Dr. King?
DR. ERIN KING : We are just trying to get the message out to patients that abortion is legal, that they still have access, and that we’re trying to let them know where they have access and how they can get the healthcare that they’re seeking. That is the best protection for our patients, is giving them accurate information and trying to reach out to them in a compassionate way that destigmatizes the care that they’re seeking, and tells them there are people that care about you, there are people that will take care of you, and you will get good, high-quality medical care, and we are here to take care of you.
AMY GOODMAN : Dr. King, we want to thank you so much for being with us.
DR. ERIN KING : Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN : And we want to thank Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project.

Malaysia will send up to 3,000 tons of plastic waste back to the countries it came from, in an attempt to halt wealthier countries from dumping their used plastic under the guise of recycling. Malaysia became the world’s main dumping ground for plastic refuse after China banned its importation last year. The plastic is smuggled to unlicensed recycling plants from countries including the U.S., the U.K., France, Canada and Australia, and is causing environmental problems for surrounding communities. This is Malaysian Minister of Energy Yeo Bee Yin.
Yeo Bee Yin : “So, what the citizens of the U.K. believe that they send for recycling is actually dumped in our country. … Malaysians, like any other developing countries, have a right to clean air, clean water, sustainable resources and clean environment to live in, just like citizens of developed nations.” Topics: House Republicans Block Disaster Relief Bill May 29, 2019
Back in the United States, a $19 billion disaster relief bill continues to stall in the House as Republican Congressmember Thomas Massie objected to its passage Tuesday by demanding an official roll call vote, following a similar move last week by fellow Republican lawmaker Chip Roy. The bill passed handily in the Senate last week, but the objecting congressmembers cited the lack of border wall funding, among other reasons, for their opposition. The bill would send relief funds to Western states hit by wildfires, Midwestern states dealing with flooding, and hurricane-ravaged areas in the Southeast and Puerto Rico, as well as to farmers affected by natural disasters. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Democrats will attempt to pass the bill on a voice vote Thursday or, failing that, would pass the bill after lawmakers return from their recess next week.

For the first time, a pharmaceutical company is on trial for its role in the opioid crisis in Oklahoma this week. Johnson & Johnson—the corporate giant better known for its baby products—produces a fentanyl patch and previously also manufactured an opioid pill. In opening statements Tuesday, lawyers made a sweeping case against the company, accusing it of driving demand for opioids while the drug ravaged Oklahoma. The state says Johnson & Johnson targeted children and veterans to sell opioids. In court filings, Attorney General Mike Hunter likened Johnson & Johnson to a “kingpin” that has been targeting an unsuspecting public since the 1990s. Purdue Pharma settled with Oklahoma in March for $270 million, and Teva Pharmaceuticals reached an $85 million settlement deal Sunday, just ahead of the landmark trial. This leaves Johnson & Johnson as the only defendant in the first civil trial of its kind. The trial is expected to last two months, and will set the stage for the nearly 1,900 federal and state lawsuits targeting drug makers and distributors pending around the country.

AMY GOODMAN : “Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)” from the Broadway musical Annie Get Your Gun . A lawyer representing the state of Oklahoma quoted this song in the landmark trial accusing Johnson & Johnson of fueling the opioid crisis. He said the company competed with Purdue Pharma using aggressive marketing. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, we turn now to Oklahoma, where for the first time a pharmaceutical company is on trial for its role in the opioid crisis. Johnson & Johnson, the corporate giant better known for its baby products, produces a fentanyl patch and previously also manufactured an opioid pill.
In opening statements Tuesday, lawyers made a sweeping case against the company, accusing it of driving demand for opioids while the drug ravaged the state of Oklahoma. The state says Johnson & Johnson targeted children and veterans to sell opioids. In court filings, Attorney General Mike Hunter likened Johnson & Johnson to a “kingpin” that’s been targeting an unsuspecting public since the 1990s. This is Hunter speaking at the trial Tuesday.
ATTORNEY GENERAL MIKE HUNTER : The pain, anguish and heartbreak that Oklahoma families, businesses, communities and individual Oklahomans is almost impossible to comprehend. How did this happen? At the end of the day, Your Honor, I have a short, one-word answer: greed.
Decades ago, the defendants and their corporate collaborators rushed to fill the need the medical community created to address the fifth vital sign. Our evidence will show, Your Honor, that in their zeal to provide a magic drug, they ignored centuries of experience, well-documented scientific histories of deadly addiction epidemics, and embarked on a cynical, deceitful, multimillion-dollar brainwashing campaign to establish opioid analgesics as the magic drug.
AMY GOODMAN : Purdue Pharma settled with Oklahoma in March for $270 million, and Teva Pharmaceuticals reached an $85 million settlement deal on Sunday, just ahead of the landmark trial. This leaves Johnson & Johnson as the only defendant in the first civil trial of its kind. The trial is expected to last two months, will set the stage for nearly 1,900 federal and state lawsuits targeting drug makers and distributors pending around the country.
Well, for more, we go to Jan Hoffman, a reporter for The New York Times covering the landmark opioid trial.
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Jan. Talk about the significance of this trial in Oklahoma and why specifically we’re talking not Purdue Pharma, but Johnson & Johnson.
JAN HOFFMAN : This is the first trial of many that are really on the nationwide runway. Everyone is watching to see what formerly sealed and redacted documents will now come into the public that will tell a much broader and deeper story than the one we’ve known about already. Everyone is watching to see how certain legal arguments will play and to see what the pushback from one of the biggest manufacturers in the world—not necessarily of opioids, by the way—Johnson & Johnson, will use as a defense. This will affect not only the forthcoming federal trial slated for October 21st in Cleveland, Ohio—ironically, this is taking place in Cleveland County, Oklahoma—but will also very much affect settlement discussions that are ongoing at the state level and the federal level. Everyone is going to be watching Oklahoma to see: How is this going to play out? Will this tip my hand at the table, or will it not?
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, you know, Teva Pharmaceuticals settled with Oklahoma, but the company actually said in a statement, quote, “The settlement does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company; Teva has not contributed to the abuse of opioids in Oklahoma in any way,” they said, Teva Pharmaceuticals. So, could you talk about that, the fact that both Purdue and Teva have settled with Oklahoma? How is it that only Johnson & Johnson has not?
JAN HOFFMAN : Those are two separate questions. Actually, they’re three. Why did Purdue—really. Why did Purdue settle? Why did Teva settle? And why is Johnson & Johnson still on trial?
Purdue settled—and some have criticized that settlement as chump change. Purdue settled because they had a terrific winning hand. They had the threat—and still do—of bankruptcy. Oklahoma had a very difficult decision to make. Could they take Purdue to trial, possibly get a big settlement, have it be attacked in the appellate courts, and then have a bankruptcy judge turn to Oklahoma and say, “I’m sorry. We are protecting Oklahoma—I mean, we are protecting Purdue right now from any claims,” and therefore Oklahoma would get nothing? Or they could say, “Let’s settle this now, take what we can get, and call it a day.” So, I think that was very much the thinking behind Oklahoma, and certainly behind Purdue, as they settled this case. One of the big challenges for Purdue is to let it be known that this case is singular. They don’t want it to be set as a precedent for what else they will be paying in other cases. That’s a very tricky position for Purdue.
Teva is different. Teva makes generics. The question is: Did Teva promote these generics? Did they promote them as opioids and make certain claims to them? Teva didn’t. It never promoted, as far as it says, the drugs. So, the case is—the state’s case against Teva was, frankly, weaker. Teva, which is also an enormous corporation, also got out for chump change. Remember, they paid less than half of what Purdue paid.
This leaves Johnson & Johnson, whose, I think, 2017 or '18 sales were $81.6 billion worldwide. So Johnson & Johnson has the deepest pockets of all the three defendants so far. Johnson & Johnson is known as being a company that likes to go to trial—I mean, well, nobody likes to go to trial. But when they're accused of something, they will fight, particularly if they feel they have a strong case. J&J is worried about setting precedent, worried about, you know, showing that they could lose at trial—frankly, they’re worried about losing at the appellate courts, because whether they’re going to prevail before a state court judge is—you figure that one out. So they basically said, “Let’s show them our hand. Let’s show them our defense. Let’s fight this case. Let’s bring it through the courts. We’ll lose, frankly, in terms of damage to our reputation, but in the long run we may win, further down the road.”
AMY GOODMAN : Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter says, over a three-year period, from 2015 to 2018, that there were 18 million prescriptions for opioids written in Oklahoma, which has a population of just under 4 million.
JAN HOFFMAN : Correct.
AMY GOODMAN : Eighteen million prescriptions for 4 million. Also, over 15 years, overdose deaths increased by 91%. These are extraordinary figures. And you have Johnson & Johnson lawyers saying, “Well, these drugs have FDA approval.” Can you respond to both?
JAN HOFFMAN : Sure. Really, this is why the J&J lawyer—and, believe me, I don’t want to be seen as carrying water for J&J, but the J&J lawyer said—and this will be the sort of crux of their defense—facts are stubborn things. When you start to drill down into that data, you see that you are not particularizing those overdose deaths from one drug to another. Are they from heroin? Are they from fentanyl? Are they from fentanyl from China? Are they from heroin from across the border? Are they from pill mills that were shut down because they were either illegal or criminal? We don’t know. That’s the problem in terms of establishing liability to J&J. There’s no question that the country has been staggered by the opioid crisis or the opioid emergency. But the real legal question is: How do you apportion blame fairly? And that is a very high legal hurdle.
AMY GOODMAN : You—
JAN HOFFMAN : Because in between—let me just say, briefly—and one of the things Oklahoma is missing, that other cases have, is other cases have charged not only the manufacturers, but they’ve charged the distributors, who had—who were the direct salespeople to the pharmacies and did have an obligation to report to the DEA how many pills they were delivering to these pharmacies, that were out of bounds. They had named pharmacy chains, like CVS . They have named some individual doctors. So there are a lot of bad—well, purportedly bad actors in this long chain of causality.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Jan, could you talk about the broader impact of this opioid crisis? I mean, Oklahoma is largely a rural state, and it’s been completely ravaged by this crisis. Is it the case that most of the states in the U.S. that are most affected are also principally rural? And talk about your own reporting, specifically, about the opioid epidemic amongst the Cherokee Nation.
JAN HOFFMAN : It’s true that—I’ll bifurcate that. It’s true that certainly rural areas have been terribly hard hit, but you go to the Bronx, and you will see how the opioid crisis has devastated the Bronx. It has gone from pills to heroin and fentanyl. So there’s a trajectory there that has really hit urban areas as powerfully as it has rural areas, although it certainly began in rural areas. I mean, I spent a fairly long time in the ER in a hospital in Paterson, New Jersey, which was just assaulted with opioid overdoses. And New Jersey has been pummeled by this crisis—thank you, Johnson & Johnson, which happens to be a New Jersey-based company. Again, I shouldn’t have said that. We don’t know yet to what degree Johnson & Johnson has liability for this.
I went separately to the Cherokee Nation because they, among all the tribes in the United States, chose to bring their own case against this cluster of manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies in tribal court. This was a novel and bold legal approach. And I wanted to see why they chose to take it to tribal court rather than join the state of Oklahoma or even join the federal litigation. And certainly, the Cherokee Nation is arguably even harder hit than Oklahoma as a state has been. They certainly had cause to want to bring justice to their people in their own courts. Ultimately, they didn’t prevail in keeping the case in tribal court.
AMY GOODMAN : Jan Hoffman, I want to thank you so much for being with us. Of course, we’re going to continue to cover this landmark trial. Jan Hoffman, a reporter for The New York Times covering the opioid trial underway in Oklahoma.

Today marks the 10th anniversary of the murder of Dr. George Tiller, a 67-year-old abortion provider who was shot point-blank in the forehead as he attended church services in Wichita, Kansas. He faced constant threats and incidents of violence and vandalism in the decades leading up to his death. The man who assassinated him, anti-choice extremist Scott Roeder, is serving a life sentence.

Donate Related Story Transcript We’re going to end, though, today’s show with a piece from StoryCorps about Dr. George Tiller, the abortion provider assassinated 10 years ago today while attending church in Wichita, Kansas. These are the voices of Rabbi David Young and cantor Natalie Young, who went to see Dr. Tiller in 2006.
NATALIE YOUNG : I loved being pregnant. It was an amazing feeling.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : The ultrasound where we found out that there was something wrong was supposed to be the last thing before going in and delivering a beautiful baby boy.
NATALIE YOUNG : Yeah.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : And the tech said, “Uh-oh.” I remember them saying that it would be impossible for him to survive outside the womb and that he would likely be brain-dead. It was two horrible choices: having a third-term abortion or have to wait through the last month of pregnancy knowing that we were going to have to give birth to a baby who could not live.
NATALIE YOUNG : Yeah.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : It would have been torture.
NATALIE YOUNG : Within a couple of days, we were on a plane to Wichita. I remember arriving at Dr. Tiller’s office and having all of these protesters outside. And I felt like this was the last place we wanted to be. I remember us meeting Dr. Tiller, who was so kind and so sorry that we were there.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : He kept reminding us that nobody wanted to be there.
NATALIE YOUNG : And that it wasn’t our fault.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : And that it wasn’t our fault.
NATALIE YOUNG : Which I kept needing to hear.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : He made sure that we knew he had kids of his own and grandkids of his own.
NATALIE YOUNG : And that he was a man of faith.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : Yeah.
NATALIE YOUNG : And so, to be able to connect in that way, that was really comforting.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : And I don’t even know if you know that every day when we got back to the hotel and you were sleeping, Dr. Tiller called me to check on you. While we both felt a sense of loss, I think we also felt a sense of gratitude that we could allow Elijah to rest in peace and not have to struggle.
NATALIE YOUNG : When I read about some person shooting Dr. Tiller, I totally freaked out.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : I think I was in my office, and you called me and told me. And I was stunned.
NATALIE YOUNG : I was so angry. And I thought about other couples who were probably there that week. What were they going to do? How did that change their lives?
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : There’s nothing about this experience that would fit on a picket sign or on a political campaign slogan. It’s way too complicated for that. And every single person has their own unique story, just like ours.
NATALIE YOUNG : Yeah.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : People he’s helped.
NATALIE YOUNG : I want him to be remembered as a compassionate and courageous man who was there to help people during the darkest times in their lives.
RABBI DAVID YOUNG : He was so deeply needed by so many people.
AMY GOODMAN : That was Rabbi David Young and his wife, cantor Natalie Young, speaking to StoryCorps, remembering Dr. George Tiller, an abortion provider in Wichita, Kansas, who was assassinated 10 years ago today at church. The piece produced by Aisha Turner.

The United Nations special rapporteur on torture is warning that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is suffering from the effects of “psychological torture” due to his ongoing detention and threats of possible extradition to the United States. The U.N. expert, Nils Melzer, also warned that Assange would likely face a “politicized show trial” if he were to be extradited to the United States. Melzer writes, “In 20 years of work with victims of war, violence and political persecution, I have never seen a group of democratic states ganging up to deliberately isolate, demonize and abuse a single individual for such a long time.” Julian Assange is currently serving a 50-week sentence for skipping bail in 2012 at London’s Belmarsh Prison, after he was forcibly removed from the Ecuadorean Embassy by British police last month. Last week, the U.S. Justice Department announced it was charging Assange with 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act for his role in publishing U.S. classified military and diplomatic documents exposing U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. Assange, who had already been charged on one count of hacking a government computer, now faces up to 170 additional years in prison under the new charges—10 years for each count of violating the Espionage Act.

The U.N. expert, Nils Melzer, also warned Assange would likely face a “politicized show trial” if he were to be extradited to the United States. Melzer writes, quote, “In 20 years of work with victims of war, violence and political persecution, I have never seen a group of democratic states ganging up to deliberately isolate, demonize and abuse a single individual for such a long time.” Melzer spoke to reporters this morning in Geneva, Switzerland.
NILS MELZER : And our finding was that Mr. Assange shows all the symptoms of a person who has been exposed to psychological torture for a prolonged period of time. So what we’re speaking about is severe stress and constant stress, a chronic anxiety, severe psychological trauma. The psychiatrists that accompanied my mission said that his state of health is critical, and if he did not get urgent relief, that we would have to expect a rapid deterioration of that state of health, and possibly with irreparable harm.
AMY GOODMAN : Julian Assange is currently serving a 50-week sentence for skipping bail in 2012 at London’s Belmarsh Prison, after he was forcibly removed from the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he lived for seven years, by British police last month.
Last week, the U.S. Justice Department announced it was charging Assange with 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act for his role in publishing U.S. classified military and diplomatic documents exposing U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. The documents were leaked by U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning. This is the first time a journalist or publisher has been charged under the World War I-era act. Assange, who had already been charged on one count of hacking a government computer, now faces up to 170 additional years in prison in the U.S. under the new charges—10 years for each count of violating the Espionage Act.
Julian Assange was due to appear by video link before a magistrates’ court on Thursday but failed to appear, reportedly due to health problems. Assange’s attorney Jennifer Robinson appeared on Democracy Now! last week and spoke about his deteriorating health.
JENNIFER ROBINSON : I am very concerned about the ongoing health issues that he has and whether he’s getting adequate medical treatment here within the British prison system. He’s finding it very difficult. He’s very isolated. And I think the prospect of a very long extradition fight and potential extradition to the United States is a real concern. But, of course, he is resolved to fight this, as he said at his first extradition hearing. He refused to consent to extradition to the United States, because he would not be extradited for doing journalism. And this case raises—as we’ve seen from the free speech groups that have come out overnight, this case raises fundamental questions of free speech, which is why he is resolved to absolutely fighting this extradition.
AMY GOODMAN : We go now to Geneva, Switzerland, where we’re joined by Nils Melzer, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture.
Welcome to Democracy Now! Why don’t you begin by telling us the results of your report and describing your visit to see Julian Assange at the Belmarsh Prison in London?
NILS MELZER : Thank you, Amy. Well, I did visit Mr. Assange in prison, Belmarsh Prison, on the 9th of May in the company of two medical experts. And my primary concerns really are that I’m extremely worried about his current state of health, which was alarming already when I visited him and which seems to have deteriorated rapidly since then, to the point where he’s no longer even able to stand trial and to participate in court hearings.
I must say that I’m appalled at the sustained and concerted abuse that this man has been exposed to at the hands of several democratic states over a period of almost a decade. And I’m gravely concerned about the prospects of a possible extradition to the United States. As I have indicated this morning in Geneva, I worry that he would be exposed to a politicized show trial in violation of his human rights.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about your role as U.N. special rapporteur on torture. What is the significance of the report you put out? Who pays attention to it? Is it legally binding in any way?
NILS MELZER : No, my role is that of a rapporteur. I have been mandated by the United Nations to report to all U.N. member states about their compliance with the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. So, I examined this case, and I reported my concerns to the involved governments, which is now primarily the U.K. government but also the Ecuadorean, the United States and the Swedish governments, which have each contributed, in my assessment, to the medical effects that we have observed now.
AMY GOODMAN : Christine Assange, Julian Assange’s mother, tweeted, “The UK Gov is unlawfully slowly killing my son! They made him very ill by refusing him ANY access to life sustaining fresh air, exercise, sun/VitD or proper medical care for 6 YEARS of illegal Embassy detention (@UN) Then against ALL medical advice threw him into a prison cell.” She tagged the U.N. in her post. Talk about your visit with him. Talk about the time he was in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. He was there for almost seven years, was not able to go outside because the British government said they would arrest him if he did.
NILS MELZER : Yes. Well, I think it’s very important to say that I went to the prison with two very experienced and specialized medical experts, so experts that are specialized in examining and identifying and documenting symptoms of torture—physical torture or psychological torture. And we ran medical protocols, called the Istanbul Protocol, which are recognized protocols to examine torture victims, to have an objective medical assessment.
So, Mr. Assange showed all the symptoms that are typical for persons that have been exposed to prolonged psychological torture. My assessment is that Mr. Assange has been exposed to various forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment that cumulatively have the same effect as psychological torture.
Now, because Mr. Assange has been confined to a very controlled environment for about seven years, with very little outside influence, it is possible to identify the causal relationship between the medical symptoms and the actual causes of the symptoms with a high degree of certainty. Now, our conclusions are that, first of all, it is the concerted effort of various states to hand him over to the United States which is a bit of the elephant in the room. That’s the one fear he has had since 2010, when he first published large amounts of compromising information about the United States. And soon after, he was then exposed to a relentless campaign of judicial persecution, I’d say, because it is an abuse of the judicial system in order to try to extradite him to the U.S. and get him to be prosecuted for a row of offenses, as we have now seen, under the Espionage Act. I believe that Mr. Assange has a credible case and a credible fear that he would not get a fair trial in the United States, that he would not be safe and protected from the types of detention and treatment that would violate the Convention Against Torture.
So, he has, in the same time—at the same time, from 2010, then increasingly been exposed to a public campaign of—or, a campaign of public mobbing, I would say, mobbing, vilification and intimidation, ranging from deliberate ridicule to insults and up to, actually, open calls for his assassination and murder, without the governments, the concerned governments, ever interfering and trying to protect him from this type of unacceptable threats.
Now, all of these elements have contributed, obviously, to a level of stress and anxiety that would be unbearable for anyone. But on top of this, when the new government was elected in Ecuador in 2017, the last government that had actually provided him with refuge and protection turned against him and started to deliberately harass him in order to get him to leave the embassy and/or to trigger a health crisis that would justify his expulsion to a British hospital, and therefore to British jurisdiction. So all these elements have resulted in a medical picture and symptoms that are tantamount to what psychological torture would produce over a prolonged period.
AMY GOODMAN : The British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt has responded to your report by saying, quote, “This is wrong. Assange chose to hide in the embassy and was always free to leave and face justice. The UN Special Rapporteur should allow British courts to make their judgments without his interference or inflammatory accusations.” Nils Melzer, your response?
NILS MELZER : Well, I—actually, I have responded to him. And I said that, “With all due respect, sir, but Mr. Assange was about as free to leave as someone who is sitting on a rubber boat in a shark pool.”
I believe it is important to see that the Swedish prosecution, the Ecuadorean authorities and also the U.K. judicial authorities so far have not shown the impartiality and objectivity that is required under the rule of law. He has been expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy without any due process of law, and we’re talking about the formal lifting of an asylum status and the suspension of his nationality citizenship, which normally would not be done, obviously, by a president on a unilateral decision, but this would be a court proceeding where the defendant or the concerned person would have a right to defend himself.
The way the Swedish prosecution has been conducted also shows that Mr. Assange was not given the opportunity to defend himself properly in public against allegations of sexual offense without at the same time having to expose himself to a possible extradition to the United States, which obviously is not related to the sexual offenses. But he was not given the opportunity to do so. So, for 10 years, his reputation and credibility and his human dignity have been gravely affected by these allegations, and the Swedish prosecution deliberately prevented him from actually taking an official position against that.
Now, in the U.K. courts, we have seen a similar type of bias. The same day he was dragged out of the embassy after more than six years, on the same day, he was pulled into a U.K. court. He was given, reportedly, less than 15 minutes with his defense lawyer to prepare a defense, and then, in a very short hearing, was convicted for bail violation. And the judge even insulted him as being a narcissist who cannot get beyond himself. Now, as a lawyer, having worked at court myself, I cannot imagine how a judge could come to such a conclusion, when the defendant didn’t say anything else in that hearing than “I plead not guilty.”
So, I believe we have to take a step back and look at all these proceedings, how they have been conducted, and come to our own conclusions whether these are fair. We also have to take a step back and look at this whole narrative of suspected rapist; narcissist; selfish, ungrateful person; hacker, and scratch the surface a little bit and see what’s below there. When I was first approached by his defense team to—seeking protection from my mandate in December last year, I was reluctant to do so, because, me, too, I had been affected by this prejudice that I had absorbed through all these public, you know, narratives spread in the media over the years. And only when I scratched the surface a little bit, I saw how little foundation there was to back this up and how much fabrication and manipulation there is in this case. So I encourage everybody to really look below the surface in this case.
AMY GOODMAN : And finally, Nils Melzer, what Julian Assange would face in this country, in the United States, if he were extradited here, a country that has the death penalty? Talk about the trial, what you see—you’ve talked about the elephant in the room.
NILS MELZER : Yes, I’m gravely, gravely concerned. I’m almost, you know, certain that he would not get a safe—a fair trial and a safe treatment in the United States. The public prejudice, including on the part of former and current officials in the United States, has been so predominant for several years now, and so that it would be almost impossible to have an impartial court hearing where he could actually be heard of his concerns. When we see the charges that have been added now, recently, under the Espionage Act, most of them really relate to activities that any investigative journalist is conducting every day. So, it’s really a reason for concern for press freedom around the world.
Then, we are also, with the United States, unfortunately, dealing with a country that in the last 20 years has not shown to be consistent in enforcing the prohibition of torture with its own officials. We can speak to the Senate committee report that has not led to a single prosecution, contrary to their obligations under the Convention Against Torture. Obviously, the “Collateral Murder” video has not led to any prosecutions, either. The only person that is being prosecuted here seems to be the one that actually exposed all of these crimes. And so, in this type of context, it is almost not conceivable that a person like Mr. Assange could ever be acquitted and ever get a fair court trial.
AMY GOODMAN : And any kind of guarantee that he would not receive the death penalty?
NILS MELZER : Well, I would expect the United States to respect its own assurances. But, you know, the death penalty is one concern. But, on the other hand, if someone gets sentenced to basically life without parole or 170 or 180 years in prison, which would be equivalent to that, for having conducted investigative journalism, then that really would amount, in itself, to a cruel and unusual punishment. I would say that would be in violation of international law, but also of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
AMY GOODMAN : And finally, what are you calling for, Nils Melzer?
NILS MELZER : Well, I think, first of all, the four countries that I appealed to, that I’ve written formal letters to, should recognize that the way they handled this affair violated the Convention Against Torture, that they have to stop in their tracks, they have to really investigate the circumstances that led to this situation, and then also, obviously, take measures for remedy.
If Mr. Assange really has committed a criminal offense, obviously he will have to respond for that. But then he has to be given the chance to develop a defense, have sufficient contact with his lawyers and receive the guarantees that his human rights are really protected. He cannot be tried in an environment that is severely prejudiced and shows only bias against him.
My personal recommendation would simply be to release him, because he has already suffered enough. But, as a lawyer, I can acknowledge that there may be a formal requirement to conduct certain proceedings. But it is extremely important that his human rights are now being respected, that there is an independent observation of how these trials are being conducted, and especially that his medical state of health be stabilized and he’s given sufficient time to recover, to regain strength, to be able to face whatever he has to face.
AMY GOODMAN : And again, those four countries, United States, Britain, Ecuador and Sweden, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer has accused them of “collective persecution.” Nils Melzer, I want to thank you very much for being with us, U.N. special rapporteur or torture, human rights chair of the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, professor of international law at University of Glasgow and author of several books on international law.

U.S. Under Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes said of the project, “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world.” He was joined by Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg, who said, “I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of U.S. freedom to be exported to the world.” Topics:"

Justice Clarence Thomas sparked harsh rebuke last week after claiming that abortion rights can be traced back to the 20th century eugenics movement. He made the comments in a 20-page opinion after the Supreme Court declined last week to take up a provision of an Indiana law that bars abortions based on the sex, race or disability of the fetus. The decision keeps in place a lower court injunction on the measure. But Justice Thomas indicated that he supports the law, writing in his opinion, “Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement.” To make his case, Justice Thomas cited a book by Adam Cohen titled “Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck.” We speak with Adam Cohen, who has since refuted the justice’s claims. In a piece for The Atlantic titled “Clarence Thomas Knows Nothing of My Work,” Cohen writes, “Thomas is absolutely right that we need to remember our eugenics past and make sure that we do not make the same mistakes again. He is absolutely wrong that individual women making independent decisions about their pregnancies are the eugenicists of our time.” This is viewer supported news.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we turn now to the ongoing assault on abortion rights across the country. Last week in Missouri, a judge granted a temporary restraining order to Planned Parenthood Friday, allowing the state’s only abortion clinic to remain open despite health department officials refusing to renew its license. The ruling came down just hours before the clinic’s license was scheduled to expire. It’s just one step in the fight to save Missouri’s Planned Parenthood. The next hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. Missouri legislators recently passed an eight-week abortion ban, and the state is one of dozens where abortion rights are under threat.
Also last week, Louisiana became the fifth state to ban abortions after six weeks, without exceptions for rape or incest. The ban will only go into effect if Mississippi’s six-week abortion ban is upheld. A federal judge temporarily blocked the law last week. Kentucky, Ohio and Georgia have also recently moved to outlaw abortions after six weeks. Alabama has passed a near-total ban on abortions.
As these states tighten anti-choice legislation, others are fighting to strengthen access to reproductive rights. The Vermont Legislature has approved a new bill that would prohibit the government from interfering with the right to get abortions. A dozen other states have their own legislation in the works to guarantee the right to abortion.
Both sides are preparing for a challenge to Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that recognizes the constitutional right to an abortion. All of this comes as the Supreme Court declined last week to take up a provision of an Indiana law that bars abortions based on the sex, race or disability of the fetus. The decision keeps in place a lower court injunction on the measure.
But Justice Clarence Thomas indicated, in a 20-page opinion, that he supports the law, writing, quote, “Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement,” unquote. To make his case, Justice Thomas cited a book by Adam Cohen titled Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck .
Justice Thomas’s opinion has been widely discredited, including by the author of the very book he cites in his opinion. In an article for The Atlantic headlined “Clarence Thomas Knows Nothing of My Work,” Adam Cohen writes, quote, “Thomas is absolutely right that we need to remember our eugenics past and make sure that we do not make the same mistakes again. He is absolutely wrong that individual women making independent decisions about their pregnancies are the eugenicists of our time.”
Adam Cohen joins us here in our New York studio.
Adam, welcome back to Democracy Now!
ADAM COHEN : Great to be here, Amy.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about reading Justice Thomas’s decision and realizing he’s quoting you.
ADAM COHEN : OK. On one level, you have to be a little flattered, right? The highest court in the land, when they want to write about a subject, cites your book, you know, a dozen more times. That’s nice. But when you read the substance of what Thomas was saying, very concerning, very disturbing, because his history is not right, and there’s a real ideological agenda behind how he’s using the history.
AMY GOODMAN : Explain.
ADAM COHEN : Sure, OK. So, we have not, generally, in the Supreme Court, talked about abortion in eugenics terms. There have been many other ways of discussing whether abortion should be constitutional or not. Clarence Thomas is making a bold foray here in saying, “Let’s start using this eugenic lens. And, in fact, let’s go back in history to the eugenics movement of the 20th century,” which was a very big deal, not so well known. But in the 1910s and 1920s, more than half of American states adopted eugenic sterilization laws that allowed the state to choose certain kinds of people that they deemed feebleminded or otherwise unfit to reproduce, and to forcibly sterilize them. So that was a very big deal.
Clarence Thomas is trying to connect that movement to abortion and say abortion is bad for the same reasons the eugenics movement was wrong. The only problem is, the eugenics movement of the 20th century was never about abortion. Abortion was always illegal. The leaders of the eugenics movement said, “We don’t support abortion.” They were supporting this other thing: forced sterilization.
So, his history is wrong. And he’s using it to try to come up, I think, with another argument against abortion. The anti-abortion forces have really failed to convince a majority of Americans that abortion is killing a person, so I think they want another argument and, you might even say, a more PC argument. “Let’s not think of it that way,” they’re saying. “Let’s think of it as being kind of like racism, kind of like eugenics, like a bad thing.” But the problem is, that’s not really what abortion is about.
AMY GOODMAN : So, explain where Clarence Thomas is coming from. You’re also writing a book on the Supreme Court. And did what he say surprise you?
ADAM COHEN : It did, because, as I say, it’s not really the way in which the debate has been framed. It’s really fresh and new and somewhat radical. And it’s also just wrong in thinking about abortion, because when you strip away the history, which you have to do because the history is all wrong, abortion is not an act of eugenics.
Eugenics is a very specific thing. It’s the government saying, “We’re not going to let certain people, who we deem to be unfit, reproduce, because we want to lift up the gene pool and make the gene pool of future generations more fit and better.”
That’s not what abortion is about. When a woman in Indiana decides—she’s pregnant, she takes a test, finds out there’s something about the fetus that is going to produce a very sick baby, maybe a baby that will die in its first year, after, you know, terrible pain and a bad life—if she decides not to bring that baby to term and to give birth, that’s not a eugenics decision. That’s a woman making a personal decision about what she wants to do with her life. The government is not telling her to do that. So, he’s really twisting everything here.
AMY GOODMAN : Do you think he understands the distinction?
ADAM COHEN : I think he does. But, you know, you can see why, from a propaganda purpose, this is good branding, right? If you can say about abortion, “Hey, abortion doesn’t just stop a beating heart,” as they—you know, the movement likes to say—”it’s also a way of trying to change our gene pool in a way that ordinary people might say, 'Well, that's not really the right thing to do,” I think it’s a good branding thing. It’s just not true.
AMY GOODMAN : The Supreme Court did allow to stand the fetal remains portion of the bill, the fetal remains burial portion of the bill.
ADAM COHEN : That’s correct. And this ruling was widely hailed as a compromise: “Oh, isn’t that nice that they—there’s one part of the Indiana law that’s not going to stand and another that is.” But it’s very strange that we’ve gotten to a point in the abortion movement that this is considered a compromise, because what the law requires is really that every fetus have a burial, kind of like a baby would have a burial, which, you know, many, many women may not want that to be done to the fetal remains. And also, they may be charged for it by the abortion provider. They might pay a thousand dollars or more for this thing. So, it’s hard to see that as a compromise. Really, we’re seeing abortion rights really eroding, and this is another example of that.
AMY GOODMAN : Have you written to the justice to say he misquoted you?
ADAM COHEN : No, I haven’t. But I’m hoping that he reads The Atlantic and that he’ll see it there.
AMY GOODMAN : So, Adam Cohen, you are writing a book on the Supreme Court. You also focus on precedent-setting cases. And I wanted to ask you about where you think the Supreme Court is headed when it comes to abortion. Last year, Judge Brett Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and he was asked about Roe v. Wade in his confirmation hearing.
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH : One of the important things to keep in mind about Roe v. Wade is that it has been reaffirmed many times over the past 45 years, as you know, and most prominently, most importantly, reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that was Brett Kavanaugh before he became a Supreme Court justice. Of course, he was approved. It is officially the Roberts Court; some call it now the Kavanaugh Court. What does it mean, what he said? And where do you see the Supreme Court going right now?
ADAM COHEN : Yeah. Well, first of all, I don’t think we can give a lot of credence to what people say at confirmation hearings. They tend to say what they think the Senate wants to hear, in order to get themselves confirmed. Chief Justice Roberts himself famously said at his confirmation hearing, “I see my role as a judge as being an umpire just calling balls and strikes.” And then, you know, look at the kind of decisions we’ve been getting in the last few years. So, I don’t think we can say from that that Kavanaugh wouldn’t vote to overturn Roe v. Wade .
And the thing is that for really a long time we’ve had one justice in the middle, a swing justice—it was O’Connor, and then it was Kennedy—who, although conservative, has not been willing to pull the trigger and overturn Roe v. Wade . The question is now: Do we have one of those swing justices, or, with the recent appointments of Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, do we now have five justices who would all actually overturn it? We just don’t know the answer.
AMY GOODMAN : And what about Roberts, Chief Justice Roberts, where you think he would stand? Many were surprised when Obamacare, when the Affordable Care Act, came before the Supreme Court, that he actually voted for it, even though he had expressed criticism of it.
ADAM COHEN : He did, and that made people think maybe he’s a potential swing. But that is a very different kind of issue, and that was one where maybe he was trying to act a little bit more like an umpire. But on abortion, it could be different. He’s very religious. When he went to Harvard as an undergraduate, he went to mass every Sunday. His wife has been active in anti-abortion causes. So, he may just feel, if this is a real sort of heart issue for him—we just don’t know if he’s been waiting all these years to overturn Roe v. Wade .
AMY GOODMAN : Before you go, I wanted to ask you about Angela Merkel. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was at Harvard University this past week giving a major graduation address and took an apparent swipe at President Trump and his policies during her keynote commencement address. Merkel, who received an honorary degree from Harvard, took aim at Trump’s protectionism, trade wars and his efforts to expand the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL : That’s why I want to leave this wish with you: Tear down walls of ignorance and narrow-mindedness, for nothing has to stay as it is.
AMY GOODMAN : The German chancellor did not mention Trump by name but compared his wall-building efforts to the Berlin Wall, that restricted her movements as she grew up in East Germany. You were at your Harvard commencement—your Harvard graduation reunion. You were there?
ADAM COHEN : I was there in the audience, yes. And she was very well received. It was a beautiful speech. And she did begin, as you said, by really this personal story of, as a young woman growing up on the other side of the Berlin Wall, how every day when she entered the workforce, she would go to the laboratory where she was working, and she could just see the wall, and she knew that on the other side of it was freedom. Every day she saw this personal barrier in her own life. So she used that to, as you say, then launch this other idea that walls, in general—the walls we have now, the walls we’re thinking about building—are dangerous. And it really was a plea for globalism and mutual understanding across borders. And it was very well received. She was really quite the star of the day.
AMY GOODMAN : She didn’t mention Trump by name?
ADAM COHEN : No, but there were moments, with this and with some other sort of veiled references, that people sort of knew she seemed to be talking about Trump. But, no, she did not.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, Adam Cohen, thank you so much for being with us, journalist, lawyer, co-editor of TheNationalBookReview.com , author of a number of books, most recently, Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck . We’ll link to his recent piece for The Atlantic headlined “Clarence Thomas Knows Nothing of My Work.” Adam Cohen is writing a book about the last 50 years of the Supreme Court.

DHS Watchdog Warns of “Dangerous Overcrowding” at El Paso Migrant Prison | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,Democracy Now,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/3/headlines/dhs_watchdog_warns_of_dangerous_overcrowding_at_el_paso_migrant_prison,"DHS Watchdog Warns of “Dangerous Overcrowding” at El Paso Migrant Prison Headline Jun 03, 2019
Homeland Security’s internal watchdog warned of “dangerous overcrowding” at migrant prisons on the U.S. southern border. In a report released Thursday, inspectors said they saw 900 people jammed into facilities in El Paso, Texas, intended for a maximum capacity of 125 people. Some of the imprisoned migrants were forced to stand for days due to lack of space, while some had to stand on toilets to get breathing space. The report advised Customs and Border Protection to take “immediate steps” to remedy the situation. President Trump has sought to place blame for the increase in migrants on the Mexican government. On Thursday, he threatened to impose a 5% tariff on Mexican goods starting next week, until Mexico cracks down on Central American migrants heading for the U.S. border. The tariff would increase 5% every month until it hits 25%. Mexican officials are set to hold talks with the Trump administration this week. Topics: "
Ari Berman: GOP Docs Prove Census Citizenship Question Is About Preserving White Political Power | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/3/ari_berman_gop_docs_prove_census,"senior writer at Mother Jones , reporting fellow at the Type Media Center and author of Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America .

AMY GOODMAN : Newly surfaced documents have revealed that a now-dead senior Republican strategist who specialized in gerrymandering was secretly behind the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The New York Times broke the story last week in a story that called Thomas Hofeller the “Michelangelo of gerrymandering.” When Hofeller died last August, he left behind a computer hard drive full of his notes and records. His estranged daughter found among the documents a 2015 study that said adding the citizenship question to the census would, quote, “be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites” and “would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats,” unquote.
Census officials estimate six-and-a-half million people will not respond to the census if the citizenship question is added. This undercount could affect everything from the redrawing of congressional maps to the allocation of federal funding.
In a court filing Thursday, plaintiffs challenging the citizenship question accused two Trump administration officials of falsely testifying under oath about the Justice Department’s motivations for altering the census. The Supreme Court is also set to rule within weeks on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had the authority to add the citizenship question to the census.
For more, we’re joined by Ari Berman, senior writer at Mother Jones , a reporting fellow at The Nation Institute, author of Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America . His new piece is headlined “Architect of GOP Gerrymandering Was Behind Trump’s Census Citizenship Question.”
Ari Berman, welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. So, lay out this exposé.
ARI BERMAN : Good to see you again, Amy.
So, this is really startling smoking-gun evidence in the census case that really undercuts why the Trump administration added this question. So, the Trump administration added the citizenship question, and they claimed it was needed to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. Well, these new documents from Tom Hofeller show that it was not needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and, in fact, the people that would be most harmed by the addition of the citizenship question—Latinos and other racial minorities—are the very groups the Voting Rights Act was designed to protect.
And it clearly shows that this question was added to benefit the Republican Party, particularly white Republicans, because Tom Hofeller says in this unpublished study, that is now key evidence in this case, this would be clearly a disadvantage to Democrats and an advantage to Republicans.
So there you have it. I mean, this is really black and white. You can’t get any more explicit than this. We now know for certain this is why the question was added to the census.
AMY GOODMAN : And talk about how we know this. Talk about Hofeller’s estranged daughter.
ARI BERMAN : Well, it’s a pretty wild story. So, there’s a separate case in North Carolina challenging the gerrymandering of state legislative districts. Tom Hofeller has been the go-to expert in the Republican Party for decades on redistricting. He has drawn some of the most extreme gerrymandered maps in places like North Carolina. And so, there’s a case challenging this map in North Carolina. And after Hofeller passed away, his daughter found hard drives with all of his work, and she gave it over to the plaintiffs challenging these gerrymandered—
AMY GOODMAN : Gave it to Common Cause, right?
ARI BERMAN : Gave it to Common Cause and other plaintiffs challenging the gerrymandering in North Carolina. Now some of this evidence has now become public. There is more here, too, by the way, Amy. We’re going to learn more about the role that Tom Hofeller has played in gerrymandering efforts in other cases. But this pertains directly to the census case.
AMY GOODMAN : So, The New York Times calls him the “Michelangelo of gerrymandering.” Talk about his whole history and also how this could have legal bearing, and even going to the issue of the Supreme Court making a decision about Wilbur Ross adding the question, the citizenship question in the census.
ARI BERMAN : So, Tom Hofeller is not a household name, but he’s been an extremely influential person in the Republican Party for decades. He has basically been the Republican Party’s go-to guy when it comes to redistricting. So he’s traveled, since the 1980s, state after state after state, drawn maps to boost Republican representation.
And a lot of these maps, particularly after the 2010 election, have been struck down in court. So, really gerrymandered maps he drew in places like North Carolina and Ohio have been invalidated by the courts. In fact, the North Carolina congressional map that Hofeller drew was invalidated by the Supreme Court in an opinion written by Clarence Thomas, who found that it was an unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. So even Clarence Thomas thought that the maps that Hofeller was drawing were too extreme.
And the fact that you had the architect of GOP gerrymandering drawing up the census citizenship question is so startling, Amy, because the census forms the basis for redistricting. So we have to have [a fair and accurate] census data to be able to draw fair districts. If we have skewed census data, that’s going to lead to skewed districts. So, even before they start the gerrymandering itself, they’re essentially gerrymandering the census to give themselves an advantage.
AMY GOODMAN : So, in the ’90s, Thomas Hofeller led the Republican effort to oppose using statistical sampling to gain a more accurate count of nonwhite populations that the Census Bureau tended to miss. At the time, Hofeller wrote, quote, “A census that uses sampling and statistical adjustment will be the biggest victory for big government liberalism since the enactment of the Great Society.” I want to go to Hofeller speaking in 2001 at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
THOMAS HOFELLER : Elisabeth Kübler-Ross wrote a book, On Death and Dying . Her five steps, I believe, can be applied to redistricting. And you can pick the people to whom they apply in the order in which they apply to those people. And those steps are—first is denial: “It couldn’t happen to me”; the next step is bargaining: “Maybe I can make a deal”; the next step is anger—none of us have ever experienced that in a redistricting process; next is depression; and, finally, acceptance. So, you might look at that, and maybe she’ll write a new book on redistricting grieving.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Thomas Hofeller comparing redistricting to death. Ari Berman?
ARI BERMAN : Well, I mean, it is funny, because, I mean, redistricting has led to political deaths, if you think about what they’re doing in places like North Carolina. They’re trying to maximize Republican advantage. And basically, Hofeller is saying his goal with the census is to draw districts—it’s a little technical, Amy, but his goal with the census is to draw districts basically only counting citizens. So, for now and for decades, the way districts have been drawn is you count everybody. Everyone is entitled to representation, whether they are a voter or not, a citizen or not. What he’s saying is, we only want to draw districts counting citizens.
What that means is that white Republicans will get a massive overadvantage. They’ll get a huge boost in representation. And minority areas, where there are a lot of immigrants, they will receive less representation. So, if this citizenship questions is on the census, it will lead to a huge transfer of power to whiter and more Republican areas. And Hofeller has stated that explicitly. And that’s why the citizenship question was added to the census.
AMY GOODMAN : Ari, you write, “[M]embers of Trump’s team may not have been fully forthcoming in their testimony under oath. Neither Trump transition team member Mark Neuman nor John Gore, the former assistant attorney general for civil rights who wrote the Justice Department letter, mentioned Hofeller’s involvement in the letter when they were deposed under oath as part of a lawsuit by New York and 17 other states challenging the citizenship question.”
ARI BERMAN : Yeah, so, the ACLU and other plaintiffs challenging the census citizenship question are trying to sanction these former Trump officials for lying under oath to conceal Tom Hofeller’s involvement in this case. There’s going to be a hearing in federal court in New York this week. And the big question is: Will this make its way to the Supreme Court? And will it matter? I mean, this case is going to be ruled on in a matter of weeks. The justices have likely already written their opinions. So, this is all very last-minute. And this evidence really, really undercuts the Trump administration’s claims of why they added this question. However, it still remains unclear whether this is going have any impact on the Supreme Court itself.

"Iraq Combat Veteran: Pardon of War Criminals Sends Disturbing Message to U.S. Military, World",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/3/iraq_combat_veteran_pardon_of_war,"combat veteran of Iraq and author of Marching into Darkness: The Wehrmacht and the Holocaust in Belarus . Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. We end today’s show looking at President Trump’s consideration of presidential pardons for American military members convicted of war crimes.
One of the requests for a pardon is reportedly for Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, facing charges of shooting unarmed civilians and killing a wounded captive teenager by stabbing him with a knife, then staging a re-enlistment ceremony over the dead teenager’s body. On Thursday, a military judge in San Diego ordered Gallagher freed from custody, citing prosecutorial misconduct in his murder trial for war crimes. The judge ruled prosecutors exceeded their authority when they tried to plant computer code in emails in order to find the source of leaks about the case. On Friday, the judge said prosecutors violated Gallagher’s right to a fair trial. The court has yet to rule on whether to remove prosecutors or to throw out the case entirely.
One of the attorneys for Gallagher also represents the Trump Organization. One of Gallagher’s most vocal supporters in Congress has been Republican Congressmember Duncan Hunter of California. This is Hunter speaking on the podcast Zero Blog Thirty in audio released last week, in which he admits to killing hundreds of innocent people while serving in the U.S. military during the Iraq War, during his deployment to Fallujah in 2004.
REP . DUNCAN HUNTER : Well, then, how do you judge me? So, I was an artillery officer, and we fired hundreds of rounds into Fallujah—
KATE MANNION : Right.
REP . DUNCAN HUNTER : —killed probably hundreds of civilians, if not scores, if not hundreds of civilians, probably killed women and children, if there were any left in the city when we invaded. So, do I get judged, too?
AMY GOODMAN : That’s California Republican Congressmember Duncan Hunter. This comes as Trump may also be considering a pardon request for Blackwater contractor Nicholas Slatten, who was found guilty twice of first-degree murder in the deadly 2007 Nisoor Square massacre in Baghdad, which killed 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians. He was sentenced to life in prison last December.
Well, for more, we’re joined from Charlottesville, Virginia, by Waitman Wade Beorn, a combat veteran of Iraq and a Holocaust and genocide studies historian. He’s a lecturer at the University of Virginia, author of Marching into Darkness: The Wehrmacht and the Holocaust in Belarus . He’s a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Beorn has just written an op-ed piece for The Washington Post which is headlined “I led a platoon in Iraq. Trump is wrong to pardon war criminals.” In it, he writes, quote, “When Trump champions war criminals as brave patriots who are simply victims of political correctness, he seems to push for a climate that condones unethical and criminal behavior. He appears to write off war crimes as the cost of doing business. If this is the example our military is given, we should not be surprised to see more … Gallaghers.”
Waitman Wade Beorn, welcome to Democracy Now!
WAITMAN WADE BEORN : Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about the people who President Trump is talking about pardoning. Let’s begin with Edward Gallagher and your concerns about the president of the United States pardoning him.
WAITMAN WADE BEORN : Yeah. I mean, I think there’s a lot of issues with Gallagher. And I first want to just start by mentioning one thing about what you mentioned at the beginning of the show regarding his—the judgment by the judge for prosecutorial misconduct. What we’re really talking about here is an amazing job by the defense team, but it’s read receipts on emails. And that’s what his defense team has spun into planting code. It’s a read receipt to let the prosecution team know that somebody has read an email. So, you know, that’s a really flimsy excuse for letting him out.
But to get back to your original question, you know, the president has chosen really the worst possible options of anyone to pardon, and Gallagher probably being one of the most egregious. Among the things that he is accused of are shooting a child; shooting an old man; murdering a 15-year-old noncombatant—who was a combatant but then, as a wounded prisoner of war, is now a noncombatant—with a knife, stabbing him to death, texting his friends about this stabbing, holding a re-enlistment ceremony over the body of this individual. Any one of these things is an egregious breach of the law of armed conflict and the law of war and just a complete moral and ethical failure. And I really don’t—I don’t see any reason why any pardon is justified.
And I should conclude those initial statements with the fact that this has not even gone to trial yet. So, in a sense, what we have is the president not only appearing to condone such activities or oppose prosecution based on his concept of patriotism, etc., but also demonstrating a clear lack of confidence in our military justice system, not even letting them have the opportunity to do their job, which is to investigate and prosecute people accused of war crimes. So, it’s disturbing on many, many levels, at least to me and a lot of other folks.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s go back to one of Eddie Gallagher’s most vocal supporters in Congress, Republican Congressmember Duncan Hunter of California, speaking on the podcast Zero Blog Thirty . He was asked specifically about Gallagher allegedly stabbing to death this teenager, a teenage ISIS fighter who was brought in for medical treatment. He was a POW , as you pointed out. Let’s go to Duncan Hunter’s response.
REP . DUNCAN HUNTER : I frankly don’t care if he was killed. I just don’t care. And that’s my personal point of view. And as a congressman, that’s my prerogative to help a guy out like that. If—even if everything that the prosecutors say is true in this case, then, you know, Eddie Gallagher should still be given a break, I think.
AMY GOODMAN : In February, Congressman Hunter spoke about Gallagher’s prosecution during an interview on KUSI in San Diego.
REP . DUNCAN HUNTER : You have lawyers, that don’t know what the word “combat” means, prosecuting guys for killing the enemy. So, even if everything that the prosecution said is true—so let’s say that Chief Gallagher killed a verified designated ISIS combatant—my answer is “So what? That’s his job, to close with and destroy the enemy through fire and close combat.” That’s what our military does. We would not have won World War I, we would not have won World War II, if we would have fought the way that we have to fight now.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that is the California Congressman Duncan Hunter, who, by the way, is headed for trial himself, not for what he says he did in Iraq, killing hundreds of civilians, but for corruption. He and his wife have been charged. Waitman Wade Beorn, you’re combat veteran of Iraq. Can you respond to what he said, and he thinking that this is a defense, for not only himself, but for Edward Gallagher?
WAITMAN WADE BEORN : Yeah. I mean, it’s incredibly shocking to hear him say something like that. It crosses a lot of boundaries for me, not least of which is just the complete lack of empathy that one shows when he says, “I don’t care whether this person was killed.” Even if the prosecution is correct, which means that it was a cold-blooded murder by knife, he still doesn’t care. That, to me, is galling. It’s offensive.
He’s flat-out wrong about how—historically wrong about how we fought World War I, World War II. We did not conduct ourselves in the manner in which he claims. He clearly doesn’t know what he’s talking about there. And also, this idea that he seems to be portraying, first when he was—when he admitted that he took selfies with a dead body, and this idea that, well, we all did that in Iraq, no, we did not all do that in Iraq. The overwhelming majority of us did not do that and recognized that as criminal and wrong.
And this idea of just, you know, once we enter into a war, our job is to go kill anything that moves, to win the war, is just—it’s blatantly false. And it demonstrates a real disturbing lack of understanding of how to deal with civilians and noncombatants on the battlefield. From someone who was in a position of authority, leading our soldiers—in this case, marines—overseas, it’s just—it’s deplorable.
AMY GOODMAN : What’s very interesting is that it was his fellow SEALs that turned him in. And can you talk about this and who took them seriously and who ignored them?
WAITMAN WADE BEORN : Yeah. So, in the case of Gallagher, it certainly was his own SEALs who turned him in, to the extent that, according to some of them, while they were in country, they manipulated his weapon so that it wouldn’t be as accurate, because they were just concerned that he continued to shoot at noncombatants. Gallagher’s defense team argues that these are disgruntled individuals who didn’t like Gallagher personally, didn’t think he should be promoted, didn’t think he should get an award.
And what we’re overlooking here is that these are some of our best-trained, most committed, most dedicated special operators. They are not the kind of people who have their feathers ruffled easily. And so, if they are disturbed about what someone is doing, to the extent that they are willing to repeatedly risk their careers, as they’re being told directly by both Gallagher and others to drop this and let it go, and they do not—I mean, in my sense, in my view, they’re heroes for what they’re doing—at the risk of their careers, I think we need to take that very seriously.
And, by the way, I should note that bringing up these charges because you think that Gallagher is incompetent, should not be training SEALs, should not be promoted, should not get an award, is not incompatible with the justification being that he has committed these war crimes that you have witnessed when you’ve been deployed with him.
AMY GOODMAN : Waitman Wade Beorn, you wrote in your Washington Post piece , “In my book 'Marching Into Darkness,' I wrote about the German army’s participation in the Holocaust at the small-unit level. One conclusion was that, even given the premeditated, racist and highly ideologized environment of the Wehrmacht, the culture of each unit and the institutional leadership most directly influenced whether war crimes were committed. Murderous leaders led murderous units.” Explain that further and then talk about President Trump talking about Edward Gallagher as a war hero.
WAITMAN WADE BEORN : Absolutely. And, I mean, as I pointed out in the article, and as you read there, you know, obviously, I’m not comparing our military or claiming that our military were Nazis, are Nazis. There’s many, many things that are different. However, there are certain truisms, I think, in all military units, probably from the Romans, in terms of individual dynamics within units and how people interact, how leaders interact.
And the point that I’m making there is that leaders set the standards for behavior. Subordinates—soldiers, sailors and marines—they know what the boss cares about. They know what his or her pet peeves happen to be. They know what his or her values happen to be. And they will usually adhere to those. And when, as is hopefully mostly the case, those are positive values, positive morals, then they will act accordingly. However, when we have guidance, from either the presidential level all the way down to the platoon leader level, that is counter to our morals or is dysfunctional, then they will often be encouraged to do the same thing.
We said in the Army that leaders make policy by everything that they do and everything that they allow to happen or fail to correct. So, moving it a little further to what the president appears to be doing, you know, by minimizing, by underwriting the crimes of people like Gallagher, people like Behenna, people like Hunter, in this case, as well, he is sending a message that these kinds of behaviors are acceptable, as you mentioned earlier in the show, that war is hell, some eggs are going to get broken, civilians are going to get killed, not a big deal, this is how we fight war—which is absolutely antithetical to how we do things.
AMY GOODMAN : And then you have Nick Slatten, who was convicted twice of first-degree murder for the Nisoor Square massacre, President Trump talking about pardoning him. He worked for Blackwater.
WAITMAN WADE BEORN : Yeah. I mean, and I’m not as familiar with the details of that case, except to say that, again, you know, we have a system to prosecute individuals who commit war crimes. And particularly in this case, given that we have a more complicated situation with a civilian working for the military but not under Uniform Code of Military Justice, the fact that that conviction has gone through the process that we have set up twice and has been upheld, you know, there doesn’t seem to be any compelling reason for a pardon. You know, usually a pardon, if done in the best of intentions, is to correct a wrong, whether it’s a racist conviction or something to that effect. And in this case, there isn’t a wrong to be corrected there.
AMY GOODMAN : Waitman, I wanted to ask you one question very quickly before we get to the end, and that is the Virginia Beach mass shooter. This is on pretty much a different issue. DeWayne Craddock was enlisted in the Virginia National Guard for years. Other mass shooters with a military or law enforcement background included David Long, marine, Afghanistan War vet; Nikolas Cruz, high school Army ROTC ; and a number of others who were involved with mass shootings. This relationship between serving in the military and mass killings, your thoughts?
WAITMAN WADE BEORN : Well, I think it’s, frankly, disingenuous to really associate those. You know, a lot of times the news will say something to the effect of—
AMY GOODMAN : I hate to end it here, but we’re going to have to. I want to thank you for being with us.

How Voter Suppression & Gerrymandering Cleared the Path for Unprecedented Abortion Bans,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/3/how_voter_suppression_gerrymandering_cleared_the,"How Voter Suppression & Gerrymandering Cleared the Path for Unprecedented Abortion Bans Story June 03, 2019 senior writer at Mother Jones , reporting fellow at the Type Media Center and author of Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America . Links Donate
As Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio and Georgia attempt to outlaw abortions after six weeks, Missouri legislators approve an eight-week ban and Alabama passes a near total ban on abortions, we speak to journalist Ari Berman about how the widespread attack on abortion rights across the country is tied directly to voter suppression. He writes in a recent piece for Mother Jones, “These states have something else in common: a systematic effort to distort the democratic process through voter suppression and gerrymandering. These tactics have greased the way for near-total bans on abortion and for other extreme right-wing policies.” This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. senior writer at Mother Jones , reporting fellow at the Type Media Center and author of Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America . Links This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : So, let’s talk about gerrymandering and abortion.
ARI BERMAN : So, these issues are all connected. And when we saw all of these abortion bans, one thing that I realized is that many of the states passing these abortion bans recently also are very heavily gerrymandered. So, you have, for example, in Ohio, which was one state that passed this abortion ban, Republican candidates in Ohio for the state House got 50% of votes in the last election but control 63% of legislative seats. You look at Missouri, Republican candidates in the Missouri House got 57% of the votes but control 71% of the seats.
So, what’s happening is that these Republican-controlled states, like Ohio and Missouri, they are more extreme because of gerrymandering, they are more red because of gerrymandering, and that leads to more extreme policies like these abortion bans. And it helps explain why Republican politicians are passing laws that even in their own states people don’t want. People don’t want blanket bans on abortion, even in places like Missouri and Ohio, but we’re seeing these laws pass because Republican politicians are insulating themselves from the will of the voters through gerrymandering.
AMY GOODMAN : I mean, this is a really important point. I mean, most Americans are pro-choice, and yet more than half the states have passed abortion restrictions. The state legislatures are anti-choice.
ARI BERMAN : Exactly.
AMY GOODMAN : So, explain further how gerrymandering leads to this.
ARI BERMAN : So, what happens is, politicians get elected, and they draw districts to maximize their impact and to try to give them as safe of seats as possible, and so they really feel like they are insulated from the will of the voters. They are in very safe districts. And so, what’s going on here is that they’re not really concerned about the views of the public writ large, because they feel like they only care about the voters in their districts. They’re chiefly worried about a primary challenge, so politics is getting pushed further and further and further to the right.
And so, public opinion really isn’t impacting the discussion of abortion in a lot of these cases. You also have, in many of these states, overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly male legislators, that are not affected by abortion in the same ways. And many of the constituencies that are most harmed by gerrymandering—constituencies like women, younger people, people of color—they are also going to be most affected by these abortion bans.
AMY GOODMAN : And talk about Georgia in particular, the state that Stacey Abrams lost, that Brian Kemp won—Brian Kemp who was the secretary of state, so he was in charge of his own election when he ran for governor against Abrams—and how that plays out overall in politics, and particularly around abortion.
ARI BERMAN : So, voter suppression also explains why we have these extreme gerrymandering—these extreme abortion bans, because you look at Georgia, for example, where Brian Kemp was both secretary of state and running for governor at the same time in 2018. He was essentially overseeing his own election. In that election, Georgia purged 2 million people from the voting rolls. They closed 214 polling places. Fifty-three thousand people had their registrations put on hold weeks before the election. All of this helped Brian Kemp and hurt Stacey Abrams and allowed Brian Kemp to eke out a very narrow victory over Stacey Abrams.
And then he signed this abortion ban, that Stacey Abrams was strongly opposed to, which was passed by a Legislature in Georgia that was heavily gerrymandered in favor of Republicans. So you have an extremely gerrymandered Republican Legislature, a governor who was elected in part of voter suppression, signing one of the most extreme abortion laws in the country. Had it not been for gerrymandering, had it not been for voter suppression, you might have had a very different Legislature and a different governor in Georgia, and this would have been blocked or not have been passed in the first place.
AMY GOODMAN : So, Hofeller’s hard drives, that his estranged daughter have now released, talk about other affects that you can see coming out of this.
ARI BERMAN : Well, it’s really important because the next election is going to determine redistricting for the next decade. And, in fact, it’s going to—the next census is going to form the basis for that redistricting in the next decade. And so, right now there’s a lawsuit in North Carolina challenging these gerrymandered state maps. The question is: Will the courts strike down these maps before 2020 so there will be a new North Carolina Legislature? If there’s a new North Carolina Legislature, there will be a different election in 2020, and that will lead to different outcomes. And so, we could be seeing Republican gerrymandering efforts unraveling in North Carolina, one of the most important swing states in the country.
But, more importantly, I think this just focuses attention on other issues. There’s been so much focus on Trump, Amy, and everything that Trump is doing, but really when it comes to state-level races, the gerrymandering at the local level and the census that forms the basis for redistricting, this has a huge outcome on politics for the next decade. And if Republicans are able to rig the census for the next decade, they will be able to rig so many important aspects of American politics, as well.
AMY GOODMAN : Finally, what is happening in Florida? This is a separate issue, but the whole issue of re-enfranchising what is called returning citizens, people who have served time in prison.
ARI BERMAN : Florida passed a really historic ballot initiative in 2018 to restore voting rights to 1.4 million people with previous felony convictions. It was the largest expansion of voting rights in that state since the Voting Rights Act. Now the Florida Legislature has passed the law dramatically scaling that back by saying that you have to pay all fines, fees and restitution before you’re eligible to vote. This is basically akin to a poll tax. People owe thousands, in some cases millions, of dollars. There’s one woman in Florida that owes $59 million for insurance fraud.
And so, if this law is signed by the governor of Florida, what it means is that people that thought they were in line to be able to vote, voters who thought they had passed this ballot initiative to re-enfranchise people, instead now you’re saying that people have to jump through serious financial hoops, even after they had paid their debt to society, to be able to vote. This could affect hundreds of thousands of people—disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of people in Florida before the 2020 election.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you very much, Ari Berman, for joining us, senior writer at Mother Jones , reporting fellow at the Type Media Center, author of Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America . We’ll link to your piece in Mother Jones headlined “Architect of GOP Gerrymandering Was Behind Trump’s Census Citizenship Question.”

The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday that over 300 of Boeing’s 737 aircraft could have faulty parts on their wings. The issue would affect both MAX and NG—or Next Generation—jets, the MAX’s predecessor, and is due to a possible manufacturing flaw in their “leading edge slat tracks,” which guide the panels used on the wing during takeoffs and landings to provide additional lift. Boeing 737 MAX airplanes have been grounded worldwide following the fatal crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet in March, less than five months after Indonesia’s Lion Air crash in October of last year. The two crashes killed everyone on board, a total of 346 people. Topics: CA Rep. Duncan Hunter Says His Unit Probably Killed “Hundreds of Civilians” in Iraq Jun 03, 2019
And California Congressmember Duncan Hunter is coming under fire after saying he and his unit probably killed “hundreds of civilians” while serving in Iraq in 2004. Hunter made the comments during an episode of the Barstool Sports podcast “Zero Blog Thirty” while defending Navy SEAL officer Edward Gallagher, who was released from custody Thursday as he awaits his trial for alleged war crimes.
Edward Gallagher is facing charges of shooting unarmed civilians and killing a wounded captive teenager by stabbing him with a knife, then staging a re-enlistment ceremony over the teenager’s dead body, which he then photographed and reportedly texted to a fellow Navy SEAL . During the interview, Hunter also acknowledged taking a photo with a dead combatant, and said “a lot of us have done the exact same thing.” This is Congressmember Hunter responding to a question about the killing of the captive teenager.
Rep. Duncan Hunter : “I frankly don’t care if he was killed. I just don’t care. And that’s my personal point of view. And as a congressman, that’s my prerogative to help a guy out like that. If—even if everything that the prosecutors say is true in this case, then, you know, Eddie Gallagher should still be given a break, I think.”
Edward Gallagher is due to stand trial on June 10 for his alleged war crimes. Separately, Duncan Hunter is facing charges related to the misuse of campaign funds and is set to face trial later this year. Topics:"

New details emerged over the weekend in the mass shooting in Virginia Beach in which a gunman opened fire on a municipal building, killing 12 people. Four people remained in critical condition Sunday. The gunman, 40-year-old DeWayne Craddock, who also died from gunshot wounds, had worked at the site of the massacre for 15 years as an engineer. He emailed his resignation earlier that day, although authorities say he was in good standing at work. From 1996 to 2002, he was a member of the Virginia National Guard. Authorities say the gunman used two legally bought .45 caliber pistols and that they found two more firearms at his home. No motive has yet been found for the mass murder. On CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday, Democratic Virginia Senator Mark Warner called for congressional action on gun control.
Sen. Mark Warner : “This just doesn’t happen in other civilized nations at this level of violence. … I have felt that we ought to take steps against assault weapons. The suppressors, I’d like to hear what the legitimate reason is in terms of either self-defense or hunting.”
Friday’s rampage was the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. so far this year.

A chilling national inquiry has determined that the frequent and widespread disappearance and murder of indigenous girls and women in Canada is a genocide that the government itself is responsible for. The findings were announced by the Canadian National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls at a ceremony on Monday with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the families of victims. Many in the audience held red flowers to commemorate the dead. The national inquiry was convened after the body of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine from the Sagkeeng First Nation was found in the Red River in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2014. The report follows decades of anguish and anger as indigenous communities have called for greater attention to the epidemic of dead and missing indigenous women, girls and two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual people. Some 1,500 family members of victims and survivors gave testimony to the commission, painting a picture of violence, state-sanctioned neglect, and “pervasive racist and sexist stereotypes” that led nearly 1,200 indigenous women and girls to die or go missing between 1980 and 2012. Indigenous activists say this number could be a massive undercount, as many deaths go unreported and unnoticed.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We begin today’s show in Canada, where a devastating national inquiry has determined that the frequent and widespread disappearance and murder of indigenous girls and women is a genocide that the Canadian government itself is responsible for. This chilling conclusion was reported by the Canadian National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls at a ceremony on Monday with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the families of victims. Many in the audience held red flowers to commemorate the dead. This is Marion Buller, the chief commissioner of the inquiry, speaking at the ceremony, which was held at the Canadian Museum of History.
MARION BULLER : The significant, persistent and deliberate pattern of systemic racial and gendered human and indigenous rights violations and abuses, perpetuated historically and maintained today by the Canadian state, designed to displace indigenous people from their lands, social structures and governments, and to eradicate their existence as nations, communities, families and individuals, is the cause of the disappearances, murders and violence experienced by indigenous women, girls, 2SLGBTQQIA people, and this is genocide.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: The inquiry issued 231 recommendations on how to address the deaths. At the same ceremony, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to conduct a thorough review of the report.
PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU : Time and again, we have heard of their disappearance, violence or even death being labeled low priority or ignored. We have heard of their human rights being consistently and systematically violated. It is shameful. It is absolutely unacceptable. And it must end. …
To the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls of Canada, to their families and to survivors, we have failed you. We will fail you no longer. In the days ahead, let us walk forward together as partners, hand in hand, as we right these wrongs and seek justice for the indigenous people of Canada.
AMY GOODMAN : The report follows decades of anguish and anger as indigenous communities have called for greater attention to the epidemic of dead and missing indigenous women, girls and two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual people. Fifteen hundred family members of victims and survivors gave testimony to the commission, painting a picture of violence, state-sanctioned neglect, and pervasive racist and sexist stereotypes that have led to nearly 1,200 indigenous women and girls to die or go missing between 1980 and 2012. That number could be a massive undercount: Indigenous activists say many deaths go unreported and unnoticed. The national inquiry was convened after the body of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine from the Sagkeeng First Nation was found in the Red River in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2014.
For more, we’re joined by two guests. In Ottawa, we’re joined by Marion Buller, the chief commissioner of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. She is Cree and a member of the Mistawasis First Nation in Saskatchewan. Marion Buller is a retired indigenous judge, was British Columbia’s first-ever female indigenous judge. And in Vancouver, we’re joined by Robyn Bourgeois, a mixed-race Cree academic and activist. She is an assistant professor in the Centre for Women’s and Gender Studies at Brock University, where her work focuses on indigenous feminism, violence against indigenous women and girls, and indigenous women’s political activism and leadership.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Chief Commissioner Marion Buller, if you can start off by laying out for the world, for our global audience, how this inquiry began, this National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and your chief findings? And how long did this take?
MARION BULLER : We started this national inquiry back in September of 2016. And over—oh, gee, how many years and months now, I’ve lost track—we’ve heard from families and survivors, from coast to coast to coast, about their experiences with the Canadian state—more often than not, the police. But we also heard a lot about shortcomings in the child welfare system, education, health, other areas of government services. Then we had to do our final report to government. We did do an interim report in 2017, but our final report is the one that was just released. It’s about 1,200 pages long.
Our chief findings are, amongst others, the finding of genocide, as you’ve recorded earlier. We have also found that there have been human rights and indigenous rights violations perpetuated over generations. We have also found that governments have deliberately underfunded or improperly delivered services to indigenous people.
All across Canada, we found, as well, that indigenous women and girls are targeted by perpetrators of violence, targeted all across Canada. And so, there have to be changes to our criminal justice system and our judicial system to right those wrongs, to denounce and deter the horrendous amount of violence against indigenous women and girls. We have been told by perpetrators of violence that they target indigenous women and girls because they can. They can get away with it. Even if it gets to court, the sentence will just be a slap on the hand.
We’ve also heard about children be removed from their families. And we’ve made findings of fact about the children welfare system, that children are removed from families not because the parents are incompetent or negligent. It’s because the parents are poor. And the parents are poor because the state delivery of services and because of the genocide that’s been going on in Canada for generations now.
So, policing, criminal justice, child welfare, indigenous rights breaches and abuses, human rights abuses and violations—all of them—I think that’s about the best summary I can give you in a short period of time.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Chief Commissioner Buller, could you talk about how the report was pulled together? It’s over a thousand pages long. How did you compile the information during the process of your investigation?
MARION BULLER : We have still probably one of the most amazing research teams, led by Dr. Karine Duhamel, who is indigenous herself. They did an incredible amount of work to marshal the evidence that we heard, to make sure that we were coming from a very sound and strong position legally and from a research point of view, a social science point of view, as well. We knew—by the time we had finished hearing from families and survivors, we knew what the issues were. We knew the problems that we had to address. But our research team provided a wonderful foundation for us to move forward.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And when you talk about genocide, most people associate genocide against a particular group with conscious, deliberate actions of a government to directly kill or murder people. Could you talk about the legal understanding that you put together to declare that Canada has been involved in genocide?
MARION BULLER : Well, you are correct. Most of us, myself included, before I started this work, thought that genocide was something like the Holocaust or the Rwanda massacres, massacres of people that have occurred elsewhere in very short periods of time, relatively speaking.
The genocide that has occurred in Canada has been over generations of people—generations of human rights and indigenous rights violations; deliberate underfunding of services and programs to indigenous people; forcibly removing children from their families, children being removed and never being seen again by their own families, by their own communities; forced sterilization of women and girls. The list goes on. But from our perspective and from the legal definition, genocide can be over a long period of time of deliberate state action, that looks different from what we commonly think of as genocide. But it’s genocide, legally, nonetheless.
AMY GOODMAN : The report says Canadian police and the criminal justice system have viewed indigenous women through a lens of pervasive racist and sexist stereotypes. The report says police, quote, “apathy often takes the form of stereotyping and victim-blaming, such as when police describe missing loved ones as 'drunks,''runaways out partying' or 'prostitutes unworthy of follow-up.'” Declaring this, and with the prime minister of Canada talking about this now as a genocide, as a result of your inquiry, accepting the results of your inquiry, how does this mean the police attitude toward indigenous people will change?
MARION BULLER : Well, first of all, the truth is out there now. It’s public knowledge now that this is how police services have been treating indigenous women and girls. I think that this has started a movement of police services to rethink their policies and practices. But most of all, I’m hoping that it will mean that police services will start to build new relationships with indigenous communities and indigenous people. You can’t unhear the truth now.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I’d like to bring in Robyn Bourgeois, an assistant professor in the Centre for Women’s and Gender Studies at Brock University. Welcome to Democracy Now! Your reaction to this report? Did you expect such a sweeping and damning condemnation of Canadian government policy?
ROBYN BOURGEOIS : Honestly, I didn’t. Having studied previous encounters like this, where indigenous women have gone to the government of Canada, one of the things I’ve been very critical of is that I found like there was a diminishment of the violence sometimes. And I’ve been waiting, you know, for most of my life to hear what has happened to me, because I am also a survivor of this violence—to hear that be described as genocide. I mean, it’s been 40 years. And I think it’s overwhelming, and it’s about time.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about what you were most surprised by in this report, Professor Bourgeois. Talk about what this means in your community and in indigenous communities across Canada.
ROBYN BOURGEOIS : Sure. I actually think that the most surprising part was genocide. I think we have had a tendency to sort of distance ourselves from that term in some ways. I think about, for example, the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission into Indian residential schools, where the term “cultural genocide” was used. And I’ve always been very critical of that, because that prefix of “cultural” implies that it was our indigenous cultures that were destroyed and eliminated, and not so much our nations and our people. And to say that this is genocide, to actually take this U.N. definition, the standard international understanding of what that means, and say, “No. You know what? What happened to indigenous people, indigenous women and girls and 2SLGBTQQIA folks, in this country is genocide,” is profound. This is a significant moment in Canadian history, where we are having the violence experienced here put on par with other genocidal atrocities that we tend to think of in the world, like the Holocaust or things that happened in Rwanda. And I think that’s really, really significant.
I think—I get a sense from at least the folks that I’ve spoken to in the last day or so, that are indigenous, that this is a really—you know, it’s about time that this has happened. And there’s a kind of a sigh of relief. And, you know, we’ve always known this, and we’ve always argued this. And to hear it reiterated and emphasized and amplified, I think, by the final report is such a remarkable thing. I feel like, in some ways, as a survivor, been carrying that burden and that truth with me, it’s been lifted off my shoulders now, because now there is this official document that backs it up.
And I think this will lead to some significant changes in our communities, because it moves this discussion to a whole 'nother level. There is no longer a place for government officials, for example, like former prime ministers of this country, who said, you know, “This isn't high on our radar,” or “This doesn’t matter,” where it’s, you know, the acts of single perpetrators and not a systemic problem. And now we have this report that says, no, this is absolutely genocidal, systematic violence perpetrated against indigenous peoples in this country.
AMY GOODMAN : Bourgeois, you’ve talked about your own experience. You referred to it. What is that experience?
ROBYN BOURGEOIS : Sure. When I was a teenager, in my late teens, in the late 1990s, I was sexually exploited through human trafficking. So, I was lured, in the very early days of the internet, by a man who claimed to want to love me and be my boyfriend, and then very carefully groomed me and then forced me to sell my body in the streets of Vancouver. So, it’s actually a little ironic that I’m having this conversation with you right now from Vancouver, where my story begins. And I was very fortunate, despite being drugged for most of that time and being violently raped and abused, that I was able to escape. And I just felt like I had a second chance, and I was going to do everything in my power to make sure this never happened to another woman.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I’d like to ask Chief Commissioner Buller, the comments by Prime Minister Trudeau at the press conference—were you able to have an extended conversation with him? And your sense of how—what your expectations are of the Canadian government moving forward on the conclusions of your report?
MARION BULLER : Well, first of all, Dr. Robyn, can I tell you that I send you my love and my support for your experiences? And you were a wonderful witness with us.
ROBYN BOURGEOIS : Thank you. Thank you.
MARION BULLER : So, I send you my love.
ROBYN BOURGEOIS : Thank you.
MARION BULLER : No, I didn’t have a chance to speak to the prime minister. It was a very busy day yesterday. Really, it’s over to him to make statements, to devise policies, to advance the report forward. In many respects, our work is done, and it’s in the political arena now. I would certainly make myself available should the prime minister want to talk to me and/or the other commissioners about our findings of fact. But when we gave it to—the report to him yesterday, we were, in many, many ways, handing it over to him.
AMY GOODMAN : And, Chief Commissioner, can you talk about the indigenous schools, the residential schools?
MARION BULLER : Yes. We had a slightly different system in Canada than you have in the United States, or had in the United States. In Canada, by law, indigenous kids, mostly what we call the southern part of Canada, but south of our territories, but including parts of our territories, as well, by law, had to go to Indian schools. They couldn’t go to schools where nonindigenous kids were. The purpose of these residential schools was, amongst other things, to take the Indian out of the child. It was to educate them, to teach them white ways, and to destroy the culture, the language and the beliefs that the children brought with them.
As a result of that terrible, terrible legacy, the survivors of residential school live with a variety of horrible, horrible issues—post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction issues, mental health issues. And this is passed on through generations. If the children didn’t go, the parents would be jailed. In many cases, children were hidden in the bush, in the forest, by their parents so that they wouldn’t have to go. And many children never came home.
AMY GOODMAN : Chief Buller, your commission itself has drawn criticism for staff turnover, allegations of lack of transparency and poor follow-up communication with participating family members and the victims. The panel also wasn’t given the authority to have police revisit cold cases. In 2017, family members of victims called the commission to reset, but those calls went unanswered?
MARION BULLER : Well, of course, there’s always criticism when you’re dealing with such a challenging and meaningful topic. But we moved past that very quickly. And I think it’s important to look at our final report and what we were able to do. And I think our final report is brilliant.
AMY GOODMAN : And your final demands of the Canadian government? I mean, you do have the prime minister accepting this report. What do you feel are the most critical recommendations and demands you have made?
MARION BULLER : Well, we don’t say “recommendations”; we say “calls for justice.” And I think—oh, you know, where to start? They’re so interconnected that it’s really hard to say which is the most important. But I think, for a lot of indigenous women and girls, the most important ones are—most important calls for justice will be to be able to drink the water that comes out of the taps in their homes; to have homes that are properly built for the conditions, the environmental conditions; to be able to have a decent life, free of violence; to be able to have their children and to raise their children in the ways that they see fit, that maybe aren’t Western ways, but they’re certainly indigenous ways that have been proven to work for generations. I think, for those women, as well, to be able to have access to proper health services, to be able to live in their own communities regardless of who they marry, to raise their children in their own communities—all of the calls of justice regarding those issues, I think, are going to be the most important to the women who are really suffering right now.
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both very much for being with us, Marion Buller, chief commissioner of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls of Canada, and Robyn Bourgeois, mixed-race Cree academic and activist, assistant professor in the Centre for Women’s and Gender Studies at Brock University.

On Monday, a Swedish court rejected a request to arrest and detain WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, halting for now an extradition attempt by Swedish prosecutors over a recently reopened rape investigation from 2010. Assange is now serving a 50-week sentence at Belmarsh Prison in London for skipping bail. His lawyers and the U.N. special rapporteur on torture have warned that Assange’s health and psychological well-being are deteriorating. Swedish prosecutors say they will proceed to question Assange while in British detention instead.
The decision could make possible extradition to the U.S. easier. Assange faces 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act for his role in publishing U.S. classified military and diplomatic documents, leaked by U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and exposing U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also faces one count of hacking a government computer. Topics:"
"""We're Left to Defend Ourselves on the Margins"": 8 Black Trans Women Have Been Murdered This Year",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/5/were_left_to_defend_ourselves_on,"media personality and civil rights activist. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, we continue our conversation about the violence faced by transgender women by looking at the spate of killings of black trans women in the United States. The body of 26-year-old Chynal Lindsey was recovered Saturday from a lake in Northeast Dallas. Police said they are investigating her death as a homicide. She is the third transgender black woman killed in Dallas since October, including the high-profile death of Muhlaysia Booker just two weeks ago. Another Dallas trans woman was stabbed multiple times in April but survived. The city’s police chief, U. Reneé Hall, addressed the spate of violence in a news conference Monday.
POLICE CHIEF U. RENEÉ HALL : The Dallas Police Department has reached out to the FBI , because, as we know, this is the second individual who is transgender who is deceased in our community, and we are concerned. We are actively and aggressively investigating this case, and we have reached out to our federal partners to assist us in these efforts.
AMY GOODMAN : The Dallas police chief. Trans rights activists say the violence in Dallas is indicative of the larger threat to black transgender women. At least eight black trans women have been murdered in the United States this year. According to the Human Rights Campaign, at least 26 transgender murders were recorded last year, although it’s likely the actual number is much higher. The majority of those were black transgender women.
For more, we’re joined by Ashlee Marie Preston, a media personality, civil rights activist. She made history as the first transgender editor-in-chief of a national publication— Wear Your Voice magazine—as well as the first openly trans person to run for state office in California.
Welcome to Democracy Now! Thank you for joining us from Los Angeles. Ashlee, can you talk about this latest death in Dallas? Can you talk about what happened to Chynal?
ASHLEE MARIE PRESTON : I think what we’re seeing is an ongoing trend of a lack of access for black trans women. I think there’s a larger conversation that should be had around our experiences at the intersections of race, gender and socioeconomic disparity. What often happens is that black trans women have difficult times attaining employment, housing, legal aid, healthcare, social support and anything that would set us up to thrive. And so, we’re left to defend ourselves on the margins of society. And from what it appears, in Dallas, she’s just another who had to deal with that disparity by herself.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I want to ask about Muhlaysia Booker, a 23-year-old black transgender woman who was fatally shot in Dallas last month. The month before she was killed, a cellphone video of a crowd physically attacking Booker as she lay on the ground made headlines. Police say men in the video were shouting homophobic slurs at Booker, who eventually got away with the help of a group of women. Authorities say there’s nothing connecting the perpetrator of last month’s attack, Edward Thomas, to her shooting as of now. I’m wondering your thoughts.
ASHLEE MARIE PRESTON : That is correct. I think, going back to it, this is a systemic issue. I think oftentimes law enforcement address it as if it is a isolated incident, but the issue, it really is a lack of support and safety for black trans women.
I can only speak from a first-person perspective. When I came from Kentucky at 19 years old, I got a job. I transitioned on the job. And I was fired because I was being harassed, and I ended up becoming homeless. I was on the streets of Hollywood. I had to engage in survival sex work, and I ended up using methamphetamine as a social lubricant to be able to navigate everything that I had to do in the name of survival.
What I noticed when I was on the streets of Hollywood is that whenever there would be deaths of a black trans women and we saw the uptick of violence, law enforcement, as a means of helping us, would actually target us, and we would be profiled. And we faced more violence while incarcerated, for those of us who that’s a part of their story. So, the issue is that our law enforcement are looking at black trans women as women who are breaking the law, instead of looking at the laws that are breaking black trans women.
And so, I think it’s an opportunity for our federal, state and local officials to be more intentional about implementing policies that are going to serve black trans women. When you’re looking at resources, if you’re trying to attain employment, that’s not going to help you if you have a hard time gaining access to housing. If you’re trying to gain access to housing, that does nothing for you if you’re experiencing intimate partner violence. And so, what we need are programs that are prepared to address dual disenfranchisement at the same time.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ashlee, you started a campaign called Thrive Over 35. Could you talk about what that is?
ASHLEE MARIE PRESTON : So, Thrive Over 35 is an opportunity for us to reimagine our lives as black trans women outside of a casket or a jail cell. I feel that what happens often when we’re talking about the deaths of black trans women, we’re caught up in this trauma porn around how we die and at whose hands we die at. But it’s an opportunity for us to take a look and examine the barriers that place us in front of the barrel of the gun.
So, in Thrive Over 35, I talk about the lack of access to employment, the lack of access to education, the lack of access to healthcare, the lack of access to legal aid. I talk about the fact that even in communities that have larger movements in play, like for women, when we’re not seen as women, we don’t have access to those movements. In the African-American community sometimes, LGBTQ issues are seen as secondary issues, so we don’t have the protection there oftentimes. When we’re looking at the LGBTQIA umbrella, there are individuals who use their sexuality as a shield to absolve them of the responsibility of dismantling sexist, racist and transphobic policies and systems.
And so, Thrive Over 35 is an opportunity for black trans women and brown trans women to show up for ourselves and to be a beacon and hope of light for one another. And it’s also an opportunity to engage our would-be allies to figure out how they can do the work to help liberate us.
AMY GOODMAN : Ashlee, last month, the Trump administration announced a change in HUD policy that would allow homeless shelters and other facilities that receive federal housing money to deny access to transgender people. The rule also lets programs house transgender individuals alongside others of their birth sex, refusing to let them share facilities with people of the same gender identity. If you can comment on this, and then what you feel is most important needs to happen to protect the trans community?
ASHLEE MARIE PRESTON : I think when we’re looking at human rights, we have to realize that trans people are seen as less than human. And that really broke my heart when I heard the story about HUD and the Trump administration, because that was what happened to me when I became homeless, as I mentioned, at 19 years old. Women’s shelters wouldn’t accept me because of my assigned gender at birth. And I was so desperate, I was willing to be housed with men. Like, I was that far down in the gutter. And men’s shelters turned me away because I obviously read female.
And so, I think what it really is going to require from our government and our state and local officials is an intentionality to show up for us. Don’t just give us the scraps that fall from the table of some of these other programs, but really be intentional about showing up for black trans women. There’s an opportunity for us to create a task force, actually. I know, in California, there’s a task force that addresses homelessness, and it looks at the different barriers to access that homeless people have. We need to do that on the federal level for black trans women.
And it’s one of the main reasons why I endorsed presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, is because she’s one of the few candidates who are actually breaking down all of those needs and tackling them head on. We don’t need more officials in office who are going to be intellectually lazy. We need officials who are going to do the work, lean more into the nuance instead of the noise, and are going to ask the community directly impacted what it is that we need to stay alive, to grow strong and to thrive.
AMY GOODMAN : Ashlee Marie Preston, we want to thank you very much for being with us, civil rights activist—
ASHLEE MARIE PRESTON : Thank you for having me.
AMY GOODMAN : —media personality, made history as the first transgender editor-in-chief of a national publication— Wear Your Voice magazine—as well as the first openly trans person to run for state office in California. Thanks so much for being with us.

Trans Activist: ICE Must Be Held Accountable for Trans Salvadoran Asylum Seeker's Death,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/5/trans_activist_ice_must_be_held,"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We turn now to look at the Trump administration’s deadly treatment of transgender asylum seekers in immigration prisons, after a transgender woman died after being released from ICE custody Saturday. Johana Medina, a 25-year-old transgender asylum seeker from El Salvador, died at an El Paso, Texas, hospital this weekend after spending seven weeks in immigration jail, according to several LGBT groups and advocates who knew her. Medina had sought medical treatment for nearly two months for complications related to HIV / AIDS before finally being transferred to the hospital last week. She died four days later.
AMY GOODMAN : Johana Medina is believed to be the second transgender migrant to die in or after being released from ICE custody since Trump became president. The other is Roxsana Hernández Rodriguez, a 33-year-old Honduran transgender woman who died while in ICE custody in May of last year. An autopsy revealed she was physically assaulted prior to her death.
For more, we’re going to Phoenix, Arizona, where we’re joined by Isa Noyola. She’s deputy director at Mijente, the former deputy director at the Transgender Law Center and a transgender and immigrant rights activist herself.
We welcome you to Democracy Now! , Isa. Can you describe what you understand were the circumstances of her death?
ISA NOYOLA : The circumstances of Johana are the same circumstances that so many trans women inside immigration detention centers are facing, which is cruel and inhumane treatment and human torture. And so, we understand that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has seen trans women, immigrant trans women, as disposable, you know, from—we see it through the ways that they’re placing trans women through administrative segregation and also denying them medical care and medical treatment.
And Johana is just another example, another extreme story of so much loss and of so much pain that someone has endured, even after the long and arduous journey of arriving to the border. And so, Johana left her hometown with so much hope, of El Salvador, her country, and she had so much hope for a better life, to live her life fully, authentically as a trans Latina immigrant woman, and only to be met with violence at the border and discrimination, and even more violence inside detention facility.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I’m wondering if you could talk of your experience with refugees who are coming, who are trying to get into the United States. The one group in Honduras, Cattrachas, which is a lesbian feminist organization, has estimated that between 2013 and 2017, they found 34 cases of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people who had been deported back to Honduras and then were later killed. And what the situation is for trans folks, especially in Honduras and Central America, right now?
ISA NOYOLA : The climate for trans people globally is alarming. The level of violence has always existed. It is now recently being studied, researched and documented by the media. But being in the trans community and doing this work for so many years, doing local immigrant rights work for trans people in San Francisco at El/La Para TransLatinas, we always understood that the violence surrounds our daily lives, violence surrounds the community, and that—one of the main push factors and reasons why trans people migrate, why trans people globally are seeking refuge, are seeking safety, are seeking a better place to live their lives and to have a chance, have a possibility of, you know, what everyone else has, what everyone else is living in terms of their dreams, in terms of their having access to healthcare, having access to housing, having access to education, having access to community, right? And so, detention and immigration have been—Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been hell-bent on denying basic human rights to our community.
And so, the phenomena of violence and murder is not a new thing. There’s no uptick. It has always existed. Now there’s an acknowledgement of it. But the realities that Central American trans people, queer, LGBT+ folks have faced in their countries are the same that are experiencing in Mexico, in Asia, in all over—all over the continent of Africa. And so, we understand that the violence is one of the main factors of why trans people are marginalized, why trans people are placed in vulnerable situations where they have very limited choices. And so, when you understand that there’s a systemic issue involved when you get to the border—right?—and then you’re returned back, you know, people are still going to find possibilities to exist and to live.
AMY GOODMAN : A report released last month by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that, since 2012, ICE has used solitary confinement as a routine punishment for thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers locked up in immigration jails across the country.
ISA NOYOLA : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : Immigration officers repeatedly used isolation cells to punish gay, transgender and disabled immigrants for their identities. This is a clip from an NBC interview with two trans women who were held in isolation while in ICE custody. In this clip, we hear from Dulce Rivera, a trans woman from Honduras who was kept in solitary for 11 months while in ICE custody and attempted suicide. But first, Joselin Mendez, a trans woman from Nicaragua who was put in solitary twice for a total of nine days.
JOSELIN MENDEZ : [translated] And, well, the truth is, what I went through in there is something I don’t even wish on my worst enemy. It’s horrible. I felt like I really didn’t know what was going to happen to me. I felt afraid. I felt that I couldn’t even breathe. And at the beginning, I began to scream and scream where they locked me up. I told them, “Release me. I can’t stand it. I am short of breath.”
DULCE RIVERA : [translated] I asked them for help. I told them, “I need to see a psychologist. I need to see a psychologist.” And what happened is that the guard’s response was “no.” So then I decided to tie a piece of blanket to the window above, and I completely covered the door outside so that no one was seeing what was happening inside the room. I made a lasso. I hung myself. So it’s something psychological, mental, that it affected me being in that place. So disgusting and horrible.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Dulce Rivera and, before that, Joselin Mendez, describing their experience in solitary. Isa, as we wrap up, I wanted to ask you about Johana’s death. She was held in an all-male detention facility? And if you could describe these facilities that you’ve entered and seen, and what you’re calling for?
ISA NOYOLA : I also—I want to clear something up also. I just want to be very, very clear that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is responsible for the death of not just Johana Medina and Roxsana Hernández, but also Victoria Arellano in 2007, who was handcuffed to her bed, pleading for her life, and was an HIV -positive trans woman. So, ICE , Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has to be held accountable for the deaths of these trans women and all the deaths that happen inside detention facilities, and customs/Border Patrol has to be held accountable for the deaths that are occurring at the border.
Johana, you know, her experience that she had at the Otero facility is one that exists—the experience that exists in all of the 200-plus facilities that exist around the country. And that is one of human rights violations and denial of access to medical treatment and to basic human dignity. The ways that trans women are classified by Immigration and Customs Enforcement is based on genitalia, is based on a classification that does not align with our community, that is dehumanizing us from the very beginning. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not make any excuses about that. They are very clear and adamant that trans people inside detention are not human beings. And they’ve demonstrated that time and time again. And Johana, her experience is one of many of trans people who have been placed in—whether it’s administrative segregation or whether it’s with other, in the male housing units—right?—where sexual assault is experienced, and one of the highest levels for trans people inside detention.
AMY GOODMAN : Isa Noyola, I want to thank you for being with us, deputy director at Mijente, the former deputy director at Transgender Law Center, transgender and immigrant rights activist, speaking to us from Phoenix, Arizona.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We turn now to a growing standoff on Capitol Hill as Senate Republicans appear poised to block President Trump’s proposed tariffs on all Mexican goods. Mexican officials are in Washington, D.C., this week for talks with the Trump administration over the president’s plan to impose a 5% tariff on all imported goods, which could increase to as much as 25%. Trump announced the tariffs over what he claims is Mexico’s failure to stem the flow of Central American migrants into the United States. Citing potentially devastating consequences to the U.S. economy, Senate Republicans defied the president Tuesday, announcing their opposition to the tariffs. This is Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaking at a news conference.
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL: There is not much support in my conference for tariffs, that’s for sure. But we appreciate the—we had an opportunity at lunch to talk to a number of representatives from the White House about this particular strategy. I think I can safely say most of us hope that this Mexican delegation that’s come up here, and discuss the challenges at the border and what the Mexicans might be able to do to help us more than they have, will be fruitful and that these tariffs will not kick in.
AMY GOODMAN : Speaking from London Tuesday, President Trump responded to the possibility of Republicans blocking the tariffs.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : No, I don’t think they will do that. I think if they do, it’s foolish. … I want to see security at our border. I’m going to see great trade. I’m going to see a lot of things happening, and that is happening. And as you know, Mexico called. They want to meet. They’re going to meet on Wednesday. Secretary Pompeo is going to be at the meeting, along with a few others that are very good at this. And we are going to see if we can do something. But I think it’s more likely that the tariffs go on. And we’ll probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on, and they’re going to be paid.
AMY GOODMAN : Mexican officials are meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo today in Washington.
For more, we’re going to Portland, Oregon, to see Laura Carlsen, the director of the Mexico City-based Americas Program of the Center for International Policy.
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Laura. Can you talk about what’s happening here, the threat of President Trump, what he is accusing Mexico of, and Mexico’s response?
LAURA CARLSEN : This threat of imposing tariffs of 5%, going up to 25% in October, is economic blackmail. Essentially what he’s saying is that Mexico should do more to alleviate—and these are his words—the “crisis of illegal immigration” at the border. In the letter that he—the statement that he put out regarding the tariffs, he says that these tariffs will be in place until Mexico has taken effective actions, that will be determined by our discretion and our judgment. So it’s not even clear exactly what Mexico is supposed to do and how they’re trying to negotiate what’s actually happening at the border.
We have to remember that this characterization of a border crisis is essentially false. These are not unprecedented numbers. And this is not an unmanageable situation. What it is is a manufactured crisis that Donald Trump is using for electoral purposes in order to create an image that immigration is the number one problem that the United States faces, and mobilize an essentially racist and white supremacist base.
This, as you can imagine, has not gone down well in Mexico. The first response of President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador was to write a very strong letter to Donald Trump, really the strongest letter that we’ve seen yet, because he’s been very careful about the U.S.-Mexico relationship, particularly for the trade and investment aspects involved. And he said, “I am not a coward. I am not timid. And our approach to immigration is different. It involves stemming immigration in the countries of origin where people are being forced to flee.”
This is the situation we have now, as they go into meetings. It’s a macho move on the part of Donald Trump to say that he’ll impose these tariffs. But he’s gone out on a limb, because, as we mentioned, he does not have the support of the Republican Party. And, in fact, he doesn’t have the support of especially the economists in his own Cabinet.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Laura, you mentioned the lack of support within the Republican Party. Senator Ted Cruz, for instance, who has always had a reputation as being extremely hard-line on immigration, came out in opposition, because, obviously, Texas, having the biggest part of the border with Mexico, also has the most benefit from trade with Mexico. And you’re seeing politicians throughout Texas in an uproar over this proposal. We even have talk of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce suing the Trump administration over these tariffs. I’m wondering: Has there been surprise in Mexico about this enormous response by even the most conservative members of the Republican Party?
LAURA CARLSEN : There hasn’t really, because Mexicans know what apparently everyone except Donald Trump knows, which is that tariffs mostly affect consumers and importers in the United States. That’s why the border states are so concerned about this, and the industrial and trade associations, from the Chamber of Commerce to the National Association of Manufacturers, and the others that you mentioned are immediately rushing to Washington to begin lobbying and saying, “You’ve got to be kidding. You know, this is—these are our livelihoods that you’re talking about.” Vertically integrated supply chains, especially in the automotive industry, that rely on Mexican parts, and their costs will automatically increase.
So, he’s shooting himself in the foot, essentially, in order to make this statement that it’s somehow Mexico’s fault that Central American migrants are fleeing conditions, that were largely created by U.S. policies, coming up through Mexico and arriving at the border, where—and this is, again, important—they are not entering, the majority, illegally. They are entering and requesting asylum, which is a procedure that’s sanctioned under international law for people who are fleeing persecution.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s go to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador speaking at a rally Friday.
PRESIDENT ANDRÉS MANUEL LÓPEZ OBRADOR : [translated] And we will always defend our fellow migrants, and not just Mexican migrants, all of those who look for a new life out of necessity and leave for other places. They go walking, because they don’t have opportunities or jobs, or because, in their places of origin, there is much violence. All migrants deserve our respect, our understanding and our fraternal hand. We are human beings.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s the Mexican president, AMLO . Laura Carlsen, can you talk about the criticism of the president in the treatment of migrants, the violent repression—that started before him, of course, but people are criticizing him for continuing, and especially with the Trump pressure?
LAURA CARLSEN : Here we have the contradiction. And that is that we’re getting this discourse particularly in response to this punitive, criminalizing model that Donald Trump is trying to impose on Mexico. We’re getting this discourse that we’re going to go to the root causes of immigration, with respect for human rights and a paradigm shift in terms of how migratory flows are handled in Mexico and in general, in which it would appear that Mexico would seek to be a leader in creating a new model, a more humane model, to handle what’s a phenomenon that’s obviously here to stay, which is immigration on a global level. However, especially since January, February, and the threat to close the border by Donald Trump, we have been seeing something very different on the ground.
Human rights groups that are reporting from the southern border are talking about increased raids. We’ve seen the deportation rate of Central Americans from Mexico double just since January, January to May. There is increased detention. And these are practices that were not common in Mexico before, although we’ve had a long history, particularly since the Southern Border Plan in 2014, again, with pressure from a U.S. government, of a crackdown.
So, we have, on the one hand, a discourse of a different approach, but, in practice, we are seeing a crackdown. And the hope, of course, is that in these negotiations we won’t have any kind, whether public or behind the scenes, caving in to this punitive model, and we will see this other model that they’ve discussed of more human rights, more job visas, more opportunities for asylum, insisting that the United States deal with processing legal asylum seekers in its own country—we will see this other model go forward. But it’s not happening so far. And organizations of civil society will be watching very closely to see what does happen on the ground.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And one of the issues that AMLO raised, shortly after his inauguration, of the need for some kind of major initiative for economic development in Central America to actually deal with the root causes of what is leading to so much—so many people fleeing the countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Any expectation that this will be part of the discussion, even though, obviously, the Trump administration is going in the opposite direction, cutting off aid to the Central American countries as punishment for their failure to keep their citizens from leaving?
LAURA CARLSEN : This will definitely be part of the negotiations. How far they’ll get, as you say, is another question. But this is the pillar of Mexico’s immigration policy. They just announced the Integral Development Plan for Central America, that was drawn up along with the U.N. Economic Commission, and it goes to the root causes, which is the major advantage that this plan has, and says what needs to be done so that forced migration can stop, that many of these people would prefer to remain in their own communities, with their own families, in their own country, if it weren’t for circumstances that were pushing them out of their countries. This is clearly a long-range plan to reduce immigration, but almost all experts agree that it’s the only plan that could possibly work.
Now, on the aid issue, we have to look very closely at any aid plan, especially that involves the United States government, in terms of where that aid is going. Donald Trump has threatened to cut off aid, and yet he’s been willing to put more aid and support and training into going to Central American countries and bolstering a crackdown on their own people, making it more difficult for them to leave their own country, which is characteristic of an authoritarian state, and trying to prevent, again, immigration through this punitive, criminalizing model. So, when we talk about aid, we have to be sure we’re talking about the kind of aid that goes to keeping people in communities, to recognizing their right to their own resources, to avoiding the kinds of megaprojects that actually displace people. And that would be a real change in the model of U.S. aid to date. So we need those kinds of programs that will go to the root causes of immigration, but they have to be carefully designed between the United States and Mexico in order to really give people the option to have healthy and dignified livelihoods in their own countries.
AMY GOODMAN : What do you understand is going on right now in Washington, Laura, Pompeo and Pence meeting with the Mexican delegation? And also, describe just returning from Tijuana and the report you’re coming out with.
LAURA CARLSEN : Well, right now there’s a very delicate set of negotiations going on, because so much has to do with Donald Trump’s ego, and that is not negotiated under the normal rules and procedures of international relations. There’s a strong possibility that the 5% tariff will go into place as a result of this, which won’t end up in cutting off orders to Mexico, but will end up in a bump in prices, for the most part, to U.S. consumers.
Mexicans are trying to get a commitment that there will be support for the development program in Central America and in southern Mexico, and they’re expecting a negotiation to come out of that. So what happens is—and the biggest point of concern is whether Mexicans will cave in terms of more punitive measures for asylum seekers when they’re in Mexico.
I was just in Tijuana. And the situation is reaching a humanitarian crisis there, because, essentially, there are 8,000 people that have been returned under what’s called the “Remain in Mexico” program, a program that the Mexican government should never have accepted from the United States, where people who have already requested asylum in the United States are returned to Mexico to await their hearings. That can take up to a year. So those numbers are growing. We’re having new migrants coming in, and we’re having people being deported at increasing rates, mostly Mexicans, back to Tijuana. So there are streams of immigrants coming into border towns across the Mexican border, on the Mexican side. There is no support—virtually no support from the governments. And although civil society, on both sides of the border, is doing a heroic job of taking care of these mostly desperate families from Central America, something’s got to give.
Increasing this punitive, criminalizing model, forcing Mexico to accept more asylum seekers from the United States will only make that situation worse. And then the humanitarian crisis that we’re seeing, the deaths of the children, which has happened on both sides of the border, the detention centers and inhumane conditions will increase.
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you very much, Laura Carlsen, for joining us, director of the Mexico City-based Americas Program of the Center for International Policy.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We begin today’s show in the United Kingdom, where President Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May on his second day of a state visit Tuesday to discuss Brexit and a future trade deal, while protests rocked London. In a wide-ranging press conference, President Trump laid out plans for a post-Brexit deal with the United Kingdom, saying the U.S. should have access to all sectors of the British economy, including the National Health Service.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Look, I think everything with a trade deal is on the table. When you—when you’re dealing in trade, everything is on the table. So, NHS or anything else, or a lot—a lot more than that.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Trump’s comments sparked outrage in the U.K., including from Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who tweeted, quote, “[M]y view is clear–Scotland’s NHS is not and must never be 'on the table' in a trade negotiation with President Trump, or anyone else for that matter.” Trump later walked back his comments in an interview with British media personality Piers Morgan.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I don’t see it being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today, and I say everything’s up for negotiation, because everything is. But I don’t see that being—that’s something that I would not consider part of trade. That’s not trade.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Trump also praised Theresa May’s handling of Brexit. May is scheduled to resign her post on Friday, after repeated failed attempts to strike a Brexit deal. This is Theresa May addressing reporters Tuesday.
PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY : I think the important thing is we deliver Brexit. And once we’re out of the European Union, we will be able to do what we’ve been talking about today, and develop not just that free trade agreement, but a broader economic partnership into the future.
AMY GOODMAN : Among those who may replace Prime Minister May after she leaves office Friday is far-right former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, whom Trump has repeatedly praised, telling The Sun newspaper before his visit that Johnson would be an “excellent” choice for the next prime minister. Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn responded to Trump’s comments, saying, quote, “President Trump’s attempt to decide who will be Britain’s next prime minister is an entirely unacceptable interference in our country’s democracy.” Trump said Tuesday he had turned down a request to meet with Corbyn during his state visit. Instead, Corbyn joined thousands of demonstrators in the streets to protest Trump’s state visit.
JEREMY CORBYN : So I say to our visitors that have arrived this week, think on, please, about a world that is one of peace and disarmament, is one of recognizing the values of all people, is a world that defeats racism, defeats misogyny, defeats the religious hatreds that are being fueled by the far right in politics in Britain, in Europe and the United States.
AMY GOODMAN : Trump called the protests against him “fake news.”
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I don’t see any protests. I did see a small protest today when I came—very small. So a lot of it is fake news.
AMY GOODMAN : In fact, the protests against the president greatly overwhelmed any well-wishers in London this week. Anti-Trump demonstrators have been flying a 20-foot-long giant baby Trump blimp to protest the president.
Trump joined Queen Elizabeth in Portsmouth, England, today for commemoration ceremony on the eve of the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Western Europe in 1944. Other dignitaries at the ceremony include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, among others.
For more, we’re going to Cambridge, England, where we’re joined by Priya Gopal, university lecturer in the Faculty of English at the University of Cambridge.
Welcome back to Democracy Now! , Professor Gopal.
PRIYA GOPAL : Thank you, Amy.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you start off by responding to President Trump saying the protests were very minor, they were in fact fake news, far outnumbered by the supporters who, apparently, he said, were gathered—apparently, thousands and thousands of them—to greet him?
PRIYA GOPAL : That’s an outright lie. It’s not something we’re very surprised, coming from President Trump. But as you said in the lead-up to this bit, 75,000 protesters were out in London alone, on the middle of the day, on a working day, Tuesday. It was a rainy day. And despite that, the BBC and all the other outlets here have accepted that there were several thousand protesters—and very, very few Trump supporters. So, what Trump has told his listeners in the United States is exactly the opposite of what was the case. And remember, there were also protests in other cities, on a much smaller scale, but London alone had 75,000 protesters. So, that is just simply an untruth.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Priya Gopal, I’d like to ask you about a comment. President Trump has said that Britain should refuse to pay the nearly $50 billion Brexit bill and just walk away, if they do not—if the country doesn’t get what it wants from the EU. But I’m wondering if you could talk—in the United States, there hasn’t been much attention paid to the national divisions within the United Kingdom over Brexit, with both England and Wales overwhelmingly supporting leaving Brexit, whereas Scotland and Northern Ireland are overwhelmingly opposed. What the danger to the actual existence of the United Kingdom might be as a result of this continuing division over what to do with Brexit?
PRIYA GOPAL : Well, one of the useful things about Trump’s visit is it has made these divisions very, very clear in this country once again. What we’ve seen is the horrific sight of the current government, senior ministers in the current government, groveling and scraping before Trump. And you have seen opposition leaders, including Nicola Sturgeon, making very clear that Trump’s views on post-Brexit Britain are unacceptable.
The discussion around the NHS is a very good example. We do know that if there is a trade deal with the United States post-Brexit, then, as Trump said, everything is up for negotiation, including the NHS . His backtracking is not to be taken seriously. What is to be taken seriously is that Brexit is precisely about breaking up and selling off parts of the United Kingdom, particularly its public services. Now, in Northern Ireland and in Scotland, and indeed in parts of England and Wales, there is going to be tremendous resistance to this. Across party lines, people value the National Health Service. And the idea that it can be broken up and sold off piecemeal to U.S. investors and privatizers, I think, genuinely does worry many people. And even Tory politicians who have gone out of their way to be welcoming and, I would say, frankly, sycophantic to Trump have had to pull back and say, “Well, regardless of what he says, the NHS is not up for sale.”
So, Brexit does pose a very great danger, both to the public services of the United Kingdom and to the existence of the United Kingdom. We know that there is talk now of an independence reference once again in Scotland. And Scotland is overwhelmingly “remain,” and there is no reason that they should be part of the English nationalist project that Brexit ultimately is. And Trump’s visit has absolutely made these divisions very, very stark once again.
AMY GOODMAN : President Trump has both expressed his support for Nigel Farage, as well as Boris Johnson. He also criticized Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who he called a “negative force.” He said, if Corbyn were to become prime minister, he may not share intelligence with him. Your response, Professor Gopal?
PRIYA GOPAL : I mean, this is clearly unacceptable. On the one hand, there is all this talk of a special relationship. And, in fact, we really need to be asking what exactly the special relationship means. But if the people who talk the talk of a special relationship are sincere—and Trump is one of the people who uses this phrase—then it seems extraordinary to say that you will not work with the elected prime minister of the United Kingdom because you don’t happen to agree with the choice that the British electorate made. So, that strikes me as extremely unprofessional and, in a sense, really out of line. You cannot refuse to work with an elected leader. Trump’s supporters, including the Tory—members of the Tory government, have been saying that it is wrong to protest Trump, because he’s an elected leader. So, by that same token, it is wrong for Trump to say that he won’t work with an elected leader.
I should make very clear here that people have not been protesting Trump’s visiting per se . People have been protesting the rolling out of a state visit to him and the rolling out of a red carpet, including a visit with the monarch. There is a difference between a working visit and a state visit. And what a lot of the protesters are saying, what a lot of people are saying, is that Trump does not represent the kind of relationship that British people want to have with the American people and that Trump is really, in many ways, the opposite of what a good relationship between the two countries ought to stand for.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to end—before Trump arrived in Britain, he insulted London’s first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, after Sadiq Khan called out Trump’s divisive, far-right policies, tweeting, “Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC , de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job–only half his height,” Trump tweeted. He also called Khan a “stone cold loser” after arriving in London. We’d like to end with the mayor of London himself, Sadiq Khan, speaking on Sky News Monday.
MAYOR SADIQ KHAN : I think it’s important for our allies to be here to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. We could have good relations with the U.S.A., but I don’t think we should be rolling out the red carpet. I don’t think this should be a state visit. And why do I say that? I think our closest ally is akin to a best friend. And the thing about a best friend is, of course, you stand shoulder to shoulder with them at times of adversity, but you’ve got to call them out when you think they’re wrong. And there are so many things about President Donald Trump’s policies that are the antithesis of our values in London, plus our values as a country.
AMY GOODMAN : That was Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Priya Gopal, we want to thank you very much for being with us, university lecturer in the Faculty of English at the University of Cambridge.
PRIYA GOPAL : Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN : When we come back, as Trump threatens a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports, to go up to 25% by October, Senate Republicans appear poised to block him. Stay with us.

In Oregon, a federal court heard arguments Tuesday in Juliana v. United States, a historic climate lawsuit against the U.S. government brought by 21 young people who accuse the government of failing to take necessary action to cut fossil fuel emissions and protect youth from the devastating effects of climate change. The suit was originally filed against the Obama administration in 2015. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will decide whether the youth plaintiffs can go to trial against the Trump administration. This is 11-year-old Levi D., who is the youngest plaintiff in the suit, addressing crowds gathered in support after Tuesday’s hearing.
Levi D. : “I’m still a kid. My constitutional rights are being violated even more than older people, who won’t be around to see the effects of climate change. And we only have a little time left to put a science-based climate recovery plan into place, a plan that will return CO2 levels to less than 350 parts per million and limit global warming to 1 degree Celsius, before it is too late.” Topics:"

New State Department rules that went into effect on Friday will require all U.S. visa applicants to submit their social media information for the past five years. The information would give authorities access to applicants’ photos, locations, among other personal data often shared on social media platforms. When the Trump administration first proposed the new rules last year, the ACLU warned that “It will infringe on the rights of immigrants and US citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association, particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official.” Topics:"

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to look at the Trump administration’s crackdown on American travel to Cuba, after the Treasury Department announced Tuesday that it’s ending the people-to-people program, the most popular way for Americans to visit the country, through organized group trips in spite of the embargo. Private cruises to the island will also be banned. On Wednesday, the cruise companies Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian all announced they will no longer travel to Cuba. The new regulations affect nearly 800,000 bookings.
In a statement, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed the ban is in retaliation for Cuba, quote, “providing a communist foothold in the region and propping up U.S. adversaries in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua.” Cuba supports the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, while the U.S. has backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó and calls to overthrow the Maduro government. On Tuesday, national security adviser John Bolton tweeted, quote, “The Administration has advanced the President’s Cuba policy by ending 'veiled tourism' to Cuba and imposing restrictions on vessels. … Cuba has continued to prop up the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela and will be held responsible for this ongoing man-made crisis. President Trump has made it clear that we stand with the Cuban and Venezuelan people as they fight for freedom,” Bolton tweeted.
AMY GOODMAN : The move is just the latest attempt by the Trump administration to squeeze the Cuban economy. In April, the administration moved to allow U.S. nationals to sue any company that does business in Cuba using private property seized during the Cuban revolution. The president of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel, responded to the news by saying, quote, “Cuba will not be frightened or distracted with new threats and restrictions. Work, creativity, efforts and resistance is our response. They haven’t been able to suffocate us. They won’t be able to stop us,” he said.
Many Cubans were also critical of the move. This is artisan Angel Millo.
ANGEL MILLO : [translated] I think Trump’s policy is wrong, because it’s just like what other United States presidents have done. And the reality is that it affects the Cuban population and not the government. The Cuban people are affected by these arbitrary measures, that not only affect us, but I imagine it also irritates Americans, because it’s limiting them from getting to know the culture in our country.
AMY GOODMAN : For more on the impact of the Trump administration’s policies, we go to Charlottesville, Virginia, to speak with Cuban political science professor Arturo Lopez-Levy. He teaches at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota. He’s co-author of the book Raúl Castro and the New Cuba: A Close-Up View of Change .
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Professor. Can you start off by talking about this latest crackdown on Cuba, what exactly it means for your country?
ARTURO LOPEZ - LEVY : Amy, this crackdown basically means banning educational and cultural group trips to Cuba. The purpose is, according to the administration, to stop what they call “veiled tourism.” But, in reality, what they are trying to do is to stop contacts between the peoples of Cuba and the people of the United States.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And what impact do you think this will have on people in Cuba, not just the ban on travel, but the other policies put in place by the Trump administration, including the sanctions, of course?
ARTURO LOPEZ - LEVY : Yeah. Well, the first is a very negative impact all over the board. First, it will reduce the contacts in a moment when the country is at a critical juncture. The country is currently going through an important process of reform. Recently, the country approved a constitutional reform. And there are very important issues, such as a transition to a mixed economy, with an important interaction between state government property and the nonstate sector, that it’s basically creating a new country, in the sense that private people cooperatives are having an impact in an economy that has been stalled because of the command structure that it used to have.
Second, it’s also—you know, it is a moment of a great debate of ideas, because the Castro era is ending. And although the successor or the new generation in the leadership has claimed that it’s basically about continuity, together with this continuity there is a lot of change. And in a more tangible way—in a more tangible way, a very important issue is that it’s reducing the hard currency that the country is receiving, particularly this emerging private sector.
AMY GOODMAN : In an interview with PBS NewsHour in April, national security adviser John Bolton was asked why he tweeted that the Monroe Doctrine was, quote, “alive and well.” This was his response.
JOHN BOLTON : Many U.S. allies in this region, in this hemisphere, those closest to us, welcome the U.S. leadership here, under President Trump, to keep foreign powers from extending their influence, particularly in Venezuela, which is what I was referring to when I said the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well. It’s intended to throw a shield around the hemisphere. It’s worked for a long time. And I think it’s an important doctrine to keep in mind as we work for the objective that President Trump seeks here, which is the first completely free hemisphere in human history. We’re not embarrassed by that.
AMY GOODMAN : And in November, Bolton said Cuba was part of a “troika of tyranny.”
JOHN BOLTON : The troika of tyranny in this hemisphere—Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua—has finally met its match. … This troika of tyranny, this triangle of terror stretching from Havana to Caracas to Managua, is the cause of immense human suffering, the impetus of enormous regional instability and the genesis of a sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s the national security adviser, John Bolton. Arturo Lopez-Levy, if you can respond to what he has said, as he talks about trying to stop communism, having a first free hemisphere in the world? Can you respond to all of this and this troika of tyranny that he is talking about, putting together Cuba with Nicaragua and Venezuela?
ARTURO LOPEZ - LEVY : Well, this reference to the Monroe Doctrine and this reference to a troika of tyranny is simply red meat to a crowd that was in Miami when he made those speeches. This is the use of American foreign policy for electoral purposes, 100%.
And obviously, the Monroe Doctrine is a reference in history to a lot of bad things that has happened in the relationship between the United States and the hemisphere. And it is part of a history that doesn’t exist anymore, because the United States is not anymore the only country that—or the country which almost all trade of Latin American countries is oriented. China is the first trade partner of Brazil, of Peru, of Chile. And in the case of Cuba, I think that there are 60 years that has demonstrated that the decisions in Cuba are taken in Havana, not in Washington.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported the U.S.-backed effort to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is just the first step in the Trump administration’s plan to reshape Latin America, with Cuba next on its radar. The report suggested the U.S. would announce new measures against Cuba, including new sanctions, and would also restore Cuba’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. According to The Wall Street Journal , the U.S. then plans to target Nicaragua. In November, national security adviser John Bolton dubbed the three nations the “troika of tyranny.” In January, Vice President Mike Pence said that President Trump is, quote, “not a fan” of U.S. interventions abroad, except for in “this hemisphere.” So, Arturo, could you respond to that, and what you see happening next?
ARTURO LOPEZ - LEVY : You know, I don’t think that it is reasonable to expect a reasonable behavior from the people that are running U.S. policy towards Latin America in this administration. This is an administration that is guided by, very particularly after the replacement of General McMaster, by national security adviser John Bolton. It is an administration that is very guided by a very ideological view of the relationship with the region.
John Bolton is a protégé of Jesse Helms. And he had been—it’s also that it’s fair to say that he has followed on the steps of his mentor. He has a vision about left and right, that it’s very, very much on the right—I would say, to the right of Genghis Khan—in the vision that he has about the political forces in Latin America. And, obviously, they have tried to push as much as possible for policies that are not clear to me that they are in line with international law or even with the purpose of—the national interests and the values of the United States.
There is now this tape of Mr. Pompeo talking to some leaders of Jewish organizations, in which he even admits that those ideas about using the Venezuelan opposition to put the Maduro government out of the game were excessively optimistic.
AMY GOODMAN : Arturo Lopez-Levy, we want to thank you for being with us, Cuban political science professor at Gustavus Adolphus College, co-author of the book Raúl Castro and the New Cuba: A Close-Up View of Change .

Nearly 100 animal rights activists were freed today, after being arrested by police in riot gear for carrying out a rescue mission and protest at the Reichardt Duck Farm in Petaluma, California, which they accuse of engaging in animal torture. More than 600 activists with Direct Action Everywhere stormed the slaughterhouse Monday, fanning out in teams to chain themselves together at the entrance, freeing dozens of ducks and in some cases locking themselves by the neck to the slaughter line. Several of the activists made it inside the slaughterhouse, where they began trying to rescue ducks that were hanging upside down by their feet. Inside the slaughterhouse, the activists began using U-locks on their own necks, locking themselves to the metal duck slaughtering production line. An employee of the slaughterhouse then turned on the belt, threatening the lives of the activists and nearly asphyxiating Thomas Chiang, who was dragged by the neck and wedged against a metal pole.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : We end today’s show in Northern California, where nearly a hundred animal rights activists are free today after being arrested for carrying out a rescue mission and protest at Reichardt Duck Farm in Petaluma, which they accuse of animal torture. More than 600 activists with Direct Action Everywhere stormed the slaughterhouse Monday, fanning out in teams to chain themselves together at the entrance, freeing dozens of ducks and in some cases locking themselves by the neck to the slaughter line. Several of the activists made it inside the slaughterhouse, where they began trying to rescue ducks that were hanging upside down by their feet.
DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE ACTIVIST : Stay in your teams. Bands are free to move out. Michael, stay in place to act as animal care receptacle. Over. You’re good to go. We’re splitting off. Red team’s with me. Folks able to hustle a little bit more, let’s do this. Over. Try to get them off here. We’ve got to figure out how to stop this [bleep] line.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Inside the slaughterhouse, the activists began using U-locks on their own necks, locking themselves to the metal duck slaughtering production line. In a shocking move, an employee of the slaughterhouse then turned on the belt, threatening the lives of the activists and nearly asphyxiating one man, who was dragged by his neck and wedged against a metal pole. You can hear panicked organizers frantically working to unlock him in this next video. A warning to our viewers: This footage is disturbing.
DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE ACTIVIST 1: Whoa! Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh my [bleep] god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Holy [bleep]! We need to stop this right now!
DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE ACTIVIST 2: Stop! Please!
DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE ACTIVIST 1: We need to stop this right now! Holy [bleep]!
DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE ACTIVIST 2: Stop!
DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE ACTIVIST 1: What the [bleep]! Oh my god! You’re OK. You’re OK.
THOMAS CHIANG : Do you have a key? Key. Get the key.
DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE ACTIVIST 1: OK. What number is this lock? What number is this lock?
THOMAS CHIANG : This is eight, not seven. It’s not seven.
DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE ACTIVIST 1: Eight. It’s eight.
AMY GOODMAN : The activist, Thomas Chiang, was taken away by ambulance and treated for nerve damage and severe pain. He’s since been released from the hospital.
Police, armed with riot gear, arrested 98 activists who participated in the action. Despite numerous complaints, authorities have yet to investigate the Petaluma factory and slaughterhouse. Activists, however, have been repeatedly arrested, with many facing multiple felony charges and, if convicted, decades in prison.
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and co-founder of The Intercept Glenn Greenwald praised Monday’s action, tweeting, “The real criminality is the systemic torture and slaughter of billions of animals in the cruelest, filthiest, most sadistic conditions. It breaks multiple laws. But the police protect the corporate criminals, & instead arrest those saving lives,” Greenwald tweeted.
Well, for more, we’re joined right now by two guests. Priya Sawhney is one of the co-founders and lead investigator of Direct Action Everywhere, known as DxE. She’s speaking to us from Las Vegas. Wayne Hsiung is co-founder and lead organizer for DxE, former law professor. He was arrested during Monday’s action and was released late Wednesday. He’s facing a total of 17 felony charges in jurisdictions around the country for his animal rescue actions. Priya is also facing felony charges.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Wayne and Priya, thank you for joining us. Wayne, you just got out of jail. Can you explain exactly what this Petaluma farm is, what the Reichardt Duck Farm does, why you went there, why you targeted it, and hope to accomplish?
WAYNE HSIUNG : Amy, Reichardt Duck Farm is one of the largest factory farms in the state of California. They slaughter 1 million animals every year. And there have been repeated reports of animal cruelty from undercover whistleblowers, from ordinary citizens, even from people walking down the street next to the farm, because the smell emanating from this facility is so awful that it’s hard to breathe when you’re standing outside. Yet, despite the fact that there have been so many complaints, including complaints supported by licensed veterinarians, former prosecutors, criminal law professors, indicating there’s criminal violations happening at this farm and other factory farms across the state of California, the government has failed to take any action at all. And what we’ve seen in the past years, ordinary citizens have started taking action, when the government has been asleep at the wheel.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Wayne, could you explain: What are the criminal violations that are taking place? I mean, what is legally—what is illegal that these companies are doing? Is animal cruelty of this kind illegal?
WAYNE HSIUNG : I’ll give you a concrete example. One of the whistleblower accounts we received showed a duck with a gaping hole in her side, collapsed on the ground of the factory farm, writhing in agony, rolling back and forth, unable to even stand. This animal, in all likelihood, starved and rotted to death over the course of weeks. And if you or I did this in our own home, if we had an individual puppy, kitten or duck, stabbed her in the side of her neck and left her to slowly bleed and rot to death in our home for weeks, it would clearly be animal cruelty. Yet there have been multiple whistleblower accounts across the state showing systematic violence on a scale 1,000 or 10,000 times worse than what you or I might have done to an individual duck, that clearly would be a criminal law violation if you or I did it in our own home. Yet, because these are powerful corporate interests that have deep ties to the government, donate millions of dollars to politicians across the nation, but especially in farm counties, there’s no accountability or transparency whatsoever.
AMY GOODMAN : Tell us the history of this Reichardt facility. And also, what happened to Thomas Chiang? What exactly went down in this duck facility?
WAYNE HSIUNG : Reichardt is a facility that was first investigated by Mercy for Animals in 2014. There was an employee who was a whistleblower, an undercover investigator, who found that baby birds were having their faces mutilated. There were birds whose necks were being ripped and broken kind of mercilessly and brutally, and thrown in a garbage bin, some of them probably still alive while they slowly rotted to death inside of a landfill or inside of a dumpster. And a criminal cruelty investigation was demanded by activists.
And at that point, the government did actually take some action. They brought some police officers out. They even brought a veterinarian with them. But even the veterinarian herself, who was on site with the police, said the investigation they did was completely perfunctory. They didn’t even actually walk into the barns or didn’t do a systematic investigation of the conditions inside the barns. And no cruelty charges were brought back in 2014.
Since that time, there have been multiple reports of additional cruelty happening at this facility. We’ve seen birds collapsed on the ground. We’ve seen birds with sickening diseases, that if they were able to get out and infect the human population, would endanger families in the area and families who eat the meat from this facility. And yet again, the government has not only denied us an opportunity to investigate or find out what’s happening inside this farm, they’ve now come after the animal rights activists who have been exposing it. But what we’ve seen is the response of the animal rights movement is not to shy away and dissipate in the face of these charges, but more and more people are acting up and fighting back, because we see this as a threat not just to the animals we love, but, frankly, to our own communities.
AMY GOODMAN : What are you all charged with? Almost a hundred of you were arrested.
WAYNE HSIUNG : Yeah, I mean, I’m still, honestly, shaken from the experience, because we saw some of our friends nearly decapitated. We saw teenage girls being assaulted by farmers, farmers threatening the lives of nonviolent activists. These are people who are holding flowers in their hands, grandmothers, in some cases, small children. And yet, the police did not arrest or investigate anything that was happening at the farm, whether to the animals or to the humans who were there to protest the facility’s cruelty to animals. And yet, a hundred activists now face felony charges and could face years in prison for merely protesting and trying to do something to stop the systematic cruelty happening inside factory farms.
AMY GOODMAN : And Thomas Chiang, what exactly happened?
WAYNE HSIUNG : Thomas was one of the activists who decided to lock himself to the slaughterhouse line. And while that might seem an extreme act, when you see just the systematic brutality, when you see animals being ripped to pieces alive, animals languishing and rotting on the grounds of factory farms and slaughterhouses, and you see the government doing nothing about it, and corporations making millions off of this, people are starting to use the tactics of other social movements. We’ve learned from Greenpeace, from Extinction Rebellion, the Climate Defense Project, how we can use direct action to seize attention and make sure the government realizes this is an issue.
So, what Thomas did was he was one of a number of activists who actually locked his own body and neck to the slaughter line to show solidarity with the animals and, frankly, the human beings that are being threatened by this industry. But the employees at the farm, in response to this, decided to turn on the assembly line and nearly ripped his head off. When we reported this to the authorities, they did nothing in response, and instead charged and arrested a hundred activists.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, in 2018, hundreds of people with the group Direct Action Everywhere marched to an industrial shed housing chickens in Petaluma, California, that’s owned by Sunrise Farms, which supplies cage-free eggs to Amazon and Whole Foods. What happened next unfolded on Facebook Live, narrated at first by you, Wayne Hsiung. This is an edited recap.
WAYNE HSIUNG : I want to show you a photo of what’s happening inside this farm. Our activists were in this farm as recently as a couple days ago, and you see animals with huge sores on their heads, going blind, animals collapsed on the ground in feces, rotting to death. And this is standard practice.
And people don’t realize this is a farm that supplies Whole Foods and Amazon. Amazon is the largest retailer in the world. They’re shipping animal cruelty to 300 million households across the world. It is one-click cruelty. And it’s time for this one-click cruelty to stop.
And the only way to make it stop, when you’ve gone to the government, you’ve gone to law enforcement, you’ve gone to the corporations and CEOs and politicians, time and time again—the only way to make this violence stop is for people to take direct action.
UNIDENTIFIED : Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
JULIANNE PERRY : I’m Julianne Perry. I’m here with Direct Action Everywhere.
WAYNE HSIUNG : Sir, sir, sir.
UNIDENTIFIED : Back, back, back.
WAYNE HSIUNG : Sir, sir, sir.
JULIANNE PERRY : Out of the way! Out of the way!
WAYNE HSIUNG : Sir, we do have the right. [inaudible]
UNIDENTIFIED : Guys, can we move you all off the concrete? Off the concrete. The authorities have been called.
WAYNE HSIUNG : We do have a right. Do you want me to show you the statute?
UNIDENTIFIED : It doesn’t matter. I’d like to have the authorities here when we discuss it.
WAYNE HSIUNG : We’re going to have [inaudible], OK?
UNIDENTIFIED : You can come and talk to me, but you can’t overwhelm me with [inaudible].
WAYNE HSIUNG : You don’t think this animal is suffering? Animals collapsed in [inaudible].
UNIDENTIFIED : I have no idea where you got this picture.
WAYNE HSIUNG : This was taken from this barn. There’s a GPS tag on the photo.
UNIDENTIFIED : OK, so, tell you what. Would a person allow you to come in and show me?
WAYNE HSIUNG : [inaudible] statute: “Any person who impounds or causes to be impounded in any pound, any domestic animal”—
UNIDENTIFIED : I mean no disrespect to you, but, guys—
WAYNE HSIUNG : —”shall supply during such confinement” [inaudible]—
JULIANNE PERRY : We have activists putting on biosecurity gear, activists behind them holding flowers. There are hundreds of activists here today demanding to know what happens inside of corporate farms, what happens to chickens who are held in these farms. When you buy cage-free organic eggs—
UNIDENTIFIED : Get outta here! Get outta here!
WAYNE HSIUNG : We have a right under this California…
UNIDENTIFIED : You don’t have a right of anything!
WAYNE HSIUNG : We do. Do you want to read the statute [inaudible]?
UNIDENTIFIED : You do not have a right.
WAYNE HSIUNG : Well, we took pictures that showed the animals…
UNIDENTIFIED : I don’t give a [bleep] what you took.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Activists say they removed 37 chickens and took them to get veterinary care. Police arrested 39 people for trespassing. So, Wayne, can you talk about what happened then, in 2018?
WAYNE HSIUNG : In 2018, there were two mass demonstrations outside of poultry facilities, including the largest organic suppliers of chickens and eggs to companies like Costco, Whole Foods and Amazon. And these activists were working under a legal authority called 597e. There’s a Good Samaritan statute in California that historically has been mostly applied to dogs and cats. It gives you the right to enter a facility where you have evidence that animals are being denied food and water, and just give them some care and aid. And activists set up a medical care tent. They had veterinarians inspect the footage we had to show that animals were in fact being denied access to food and water, and attempted to give these animals aid peacefully.
But, in response, we had farmworkers and authorities threatening to run us over with trucks, hurling homophobic slurs at us. It got so bad that, in one case, a young woman was endangered and felt like her life was being threatened. We had multiple activists in fear of their lives at these demonstrations. Yet, when the police were called, the police instead arrested the activists, instead of the folks who were threatening to kill them. And this is coming from the discovery in the cases. When these people—when the farmers were talking to police, they were saying to the police directly, “I’m going to kill these people.” Yet, instead of trying to do something about the violence against animals and, frankly, the violence against activists that’s happening in these demonstrations, the police, who receive and are working really in cahoots with the industry, are doing nothing about that, instead putting the activists in prison.
AMY GOODMAN : Priya Sawhney, we are watching you at that action. You were also at the one on Monday, though you weren’t arrested. But you were there confronting the authorities in 2018, as well, one of the co-founders of Direct Action Everywhere. Explain why these chickens mattered so much to you. You also then got arrested—is that right?—and face felony count, years in prison?
PRIYA SAWHNEY : Yes, I am facing—I’m facing up to a decade in prison and seven felony charges. I was one of the 58 activists who was arrested in September, in the same county, at the—for documenting criminal animal cruelty at the largest organic poultry producer in the nation.
And yeah, for me and for so many Americans and, frankly, citizens of the world, people love animals. And we know this to be true, because most people have dogs at home, and they’ll do—they treat their dogs like children. And when we show people what’s happening to these chickens inside of farms, to pigs inside of farms, people are mortified. And the reason for this is because people don’t want to see animals being hurt. And, you know, growing up as a child in India, I saw a lot of stray dogs, a lot of stray animals. And I always knew that these animals are helpless, and we need to help them and do whatever we can. So I’ve carried that into my work as an investigator for DxE.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Priya, could you explain—I mean, you face felony charges. This might be surprising to some, because it’s not clear at all what law they’re saying that you’ve broken by participating in these protests.
PRIYA SAWHNEY : Yeah. And when I was arrested in September for being at this facility, I was actually just documenting what’s happening. So I was behind the camera, watching and filming my friends and just making sure that someone is present and showing the world what’s happening. So, I was behind the camera, and I don’t know what I did wrong. And, you know, quite frankly, I don’t know what my friends did wrong, because they were just helping animals. And we were present with a letter from a legal professor stating that we had the legal right to be there, because we know from whistleblower footage that California law is being violated.
And I know Wayne mentioned this, but despite showing this to officials—and we showed these letters to officials back in September; we also did the same on Monday—we were repeatedly refused any conversations about this. And what we see is that instead of helping activists and helping the animals, the police turned their backs on both the animals who need help, both the activists who need help, and continue to arrest people for documenting animal cruelty and for helping animals.
AMY GOODMAN : In 2017, Direct Action Everywhere went to Smithfield’s Circle Four Farms in Utah, one of the worlds largest pig farms, to expose conditions at the facility. Investigators report finding piglets feeding on their own mother’s blood, pregnant pigs held in gestational crates too small for them to turn around in, and sick and feverish piglets left to die of starvation or be trampled. This is Wayne Hsiung at Smithfield’s Circle Farms.
WAYNE HSIUNG : So, we’ve got a little baby here who’s literally starving to death, because her mom’s nipples are so torn up, she can’t feed on milk. So, she’s about half the size of the piglets. And like the one-third of the piglets who are born into farms like this, she’s going to die. She’ll probably starve to death. Her face is covered in blood, and we’ve got to take her out. So that’s what we’re going to do.
AMY GOODMAN : Utah officials filed felony burglary and rioting charges against Wayne Hsiung and four other members of DxE, Direct Action Everywhere, accusing them of removing a pair of piglets, named Lucy and Ethel. The activists could face 60 years in prison. You go to trial for this in November, Wayne. We just have a minute to go, but if you can talk about the significance of Smithfield, who it’s owned by, and what you did with these piglets and why they mattered so much to you?
WAYNE HSIUNG : Smithfield Foods is the largest pork production company in the world. And in the single largest acquisition of a U.S. company in Chinese history, the Chinese government financed a deal to buy out the company. And this is a company that has systematically abused the rights of workers. They have caused environmental devastation in communities of color in North Carolina and Utah. They’ve even been caught up in human trafficking scandals in Utah. And obviously, they’re engaged in brutal abuse of millions of animals every year.
And what has happened over the past 10 years is, more and more exposure has occurred of the industry. More and more citizens and consumers are upset and furious about the violence against animals and human beings they’re seeing in factory farms. And so corporations are being forced to change.
But too often what happens, instead of real change, is they put up the appearance of change. So, Smithfield changed its motto to “Good food. Responsibly [raised].” They claimed they stopped using gestation crates. In 2017, we went into their single largest facility, Circle Four Farms in Utah, and found that they were continuing to use gestation crates, despite the fact that they had told the public they had stopped using that. But instead of trying to address the corporate fraud, the systematic cruelty at the farm, the Utah government brought prosecutions against six activists, including a retired woman named Diane Gandee Sorbi, who has no criminal record, spends most of her life and most of her time taking care of abused animals—
AMY GOODMAN : We have 10 seconds.
WAYNE HSIUNG : —in sanctuaries and shelters. And we’re seeing this happening across the country right now.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to do Part 2 of this discussion to find out more about these actions, with Wayne Hsiung and Priya Sawhney, co-founders of Direct Action Everywhere.

Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders confronted executives at Walmart Wednesday, blasting “starvation wages” and extreme wealth inequality, at the retail giant’s annual shareholder meeting in Arkansas. Speaking as a proxy for a Walmart employee who invited him to attend, Sanders introduced a resolution to raise wages and to put hourly workers on Walmart’s board of directors.
Sen. Bernie Sanders : “Walmart is the largest private employer in America and is owned by the Walton family, the wealthiest family in the United States, worth approximately $175 billion. And yet, despite the incredible wealth of its owner, Walmart pays many of its employees starvation wages, wages that are so low that many of these employees are forced to rely on government programs like food stamps, Medicaid and public housing in order to survive.”
The resolution was quickly dismissed by Rachel Brand, Walmart’s executive vice president of global governance. Topics: "

In southern Saudi Arabia, Houthi rebels from Yemen say they’ve crossed into Saudi territory in a surprise offensive that’s left them in control of nearly two dozen positions. There was no comment from Saudi officials on the claim, which would represent an escalation of Yemen’s four-year-old civil war. The fighting has left at least 7,300 children killed or seriously injured by U.S.-backed Saudi coalition airstrikes, and pushed half of Yemen’s 28 million people to the brink of starvation.

"""Massacre"" in Sudan: Protesters Continue Call for Civilian Rule After Military Kills 100+ at Sit-in",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/6/sudan_military_council_crackdown_on_sit,"Sudanese activist based in New York City.

NERMEEN SHAIKH : The death toll in Sudan has risen to more than a hundred following a deadly military raid on a nonviolent sit-in in Khartoum Monday morning. According to doctors who have been taking part in the ongoing anti-government uprising, at least 40 bodies were dredged up from the Nile River in the aftermath of the carnage. Meanwhile, the state news agency, SUNA , reported Thursday that the death toll was no more than 46.
On Wednesday, the Transitional Military Council said it had launched an investigation into the violence and offered to resume a dialogue on a transition to democracy, just a day after scrapping all agreements with an opposition alliance. This is Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.
LT. GEN . ABDEL FATTAH AL- BURHAN : [translated] Sit-in squares and spaces have witnessed important events, spurring human emotions and a lively social life, showing the true depths of Sudanese culture and Sudanese identity. History will record this. We in the Transitional Military Council open our hands to negotiation, with no purpose but the interest of the nation, through which we can complete the establishment of a legitimate authority that expresses the ambitions of the Sudanese revolution in all its varieties.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : But the opposition has rejected the military’s calls to negotiate, citing ongoing violence against civilians. This is a protester on the streets of Khartoum Wednesday.
PROTESTER : [translated] What about our children? We started from wanting to change the regime. Now the regime has fallen completely, so the Military Council must either respond to our demands or leave.
AMY GOODMAN : Demonstrators from a range of civil society groups are continuing to demand a civilian transitional government following the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir in April, after a months-long popular uprising, and the military’s subsequent government takeover.
For more, we’re joined here in New York City by Marine Alneel, a Sudanese activist just back from Khartoum. She was at the sit-in just days before it was raided.
Welcome back to Democracy Now! , Marine. Can you talk about the numbers of people who have been killed, why people are sitting in and who did the killing?
MARINE ALNEEL : The numbers saying that it’s more than a hundred is actually a gross underestimation, because still the sit-in is not a safe area. It is difficult to go and find the dead bodies of the protesters that may still be there. There are also news of people being still stuck in buildings within the sit-in area. They cannot leave because the streets are full of Rapid Support Forces. This is the forces that have attacked the sit-in and are still terrorizing Khartoum.
Khartoum is, for all intents and purposes, currently under military occupation by the Rapid Support Forces, previously known as the Janjaweed, under Hemedti’s leadership. And he is still calling for attacking the people who are barricading the streets around Khartoum. He is saying that they will pay the price. Many believe that when Hemedti says “paying the price,” he’s only talking about killing. And there is an indiscriminate—
AMY GOODMAN : And explain who he is.
MARINE ALNEEL : Hemedti is the leader of the Rapid Support Forces. He is currently the vice president of the Military Council. And he’s the person who’s leading all of the attacks that are happening, that have happened at the sit-in and are happening around Khartoum.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, can you explain also, Marine, what the Transitional Military Council is, that’s taken power in Sudan after President Bashir was ousted, and what role they’re playing now?
MARINE ALNEEL : Well, the Transitional Military Council, more accurately referred to as the Military Council—it’s not a transitional government. They are only the security council that was supporting Bashir. They have ousted Bashir, but they remain part of the previous regime. They have been negotiating with the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces. But it now seems that these negotiations have not been in good faith. They have never intended to give up power for a civilian government.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to Hemedti, the Military Council general who you’ve been talking about. On Wednesday, he talked about the gang members—he claimed the protesters are really gang members threatening and attacking people.
MOHAMED HAMDAN DAGALO : [translated] Throughout the past few days, we have had rising numbers of martyrs, the last of which were two yesterday, people going through their days, my brothers. The matter is now clear. They want Rapid Support Forces troops to be killed. They call themselves protesters. Those are not protesters. They are gangs, which we have warned against early on. The conspiring group will not get through to the Sudanese people. Now we are warning from here, warning all the Sudanese people, that there are false vehicles in neighborhoods, yesterday in Abbasiya and Mansura, in disguise as Rapid Support Forces, threatening and attacking people.
AMY GOODMAN : Military Council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. So, explain what they’re saying about elections and what the civilian uprising is demanding right now.
MARINE ALNEEL : Well, they’ve said that they want to conduct elections within nine months, and that those nine months have started already, from there, the ousting of Bashir. So, technically, within seven months, that would be 2020. That is going back to Bashir’s plan of holding elections in 2020. Definitely, the country is not ready for elections. It is not safe. The capital city is not safe, let alone the places that have been facing conflict for years are not safe. There’s no freedom of expression. There are no parties that are ready to offer the people programs that might be satisfying to the Sudanese people.
The opposition is calling for civil disobedience, starting Sunday. There are signs of it already. However, because of Eid holidays, it is difficult to evaluate the level of the civil disobedience. The Sudanese Professionals Association is an umbrella that holds unions, such as doctors’ unions, lawyers’ unions, but we’re also seeing people from outside from the Sudanese Professionals Association who have said that they will join the civil disobedience. So, for example, there’s a group called Diplomats for Change, and they said they will also be part of the civil disobedience, which means that even foreign embassies in Sudan will not be functioning, starting Sunday.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, can you explain, Marine, for people who aren’t clear, what the relationship is between the RSF and the Military Council? I mean, Hemedti, who you were talking about earlier, many reports suggest that he is in fact the most powerful person in Sudan, and the RSF has been accused of genocide in the Darfur war.
MARINE ALNEEL : The RSF , before it has become legitimized by the previous regime, or by Omar al-Bashir, was called the Janjaweed. They are the same forces that have conducted the genocide in Darfur. Later on, it became more powerful in numbers, and because of the legitimization by the government, they now hold more weapons. They’ve had funding coming in, funneled through the government, but mainly from the EU, to curb the migration of immigrants, because Sudan is sort of a portal to North Africa and, from there, crossing the Mediterranean to Europe. So they have been given that task of stopping the migrants at the borders of Sudan by any means. And their main mean is killing these immigrants.
AMY GOODMAN : And for people to understand what Sudan has been going through and the carnage that has been wreaked by Omar al-Bashir, explain where he is right now, the prison he’s in, and what’s happened in that prison over the years.
MARINE ALNEEL : Well, according to the Military Council, Omar al-Bashir is being held in Kobar prison. It’s an infamous that many political prisoners have been held in. However, there has been no confirmation of these reports. We have not even seen images of Omar al-Bashir since his ousting. We have not seen images of him being arrested when the ousting occurred. So it’s very difficult to confirm his whereabouts.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And before we conclude, Marine, I wanted to ask you about all the different countries that are involved in the conflict in Sudan. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have all been supporting the military in Sudan, helping to suppress the opposition, the protesters. And just last month, Hemedti met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. So, can you explain what interests do Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have in supporting this Military Council, and what the protesters are saying about that?
MARINE ALNEEL : For Egypt, it would be difficult if Sudan has a peaceful transition to a civilian government. That would be somewhat of a trigger for the Egyptian people saying that, “OK, this is possible. Then maybe we can have a different conclusion to our revolution instead of having a military government,” which is what happened in Egypt.
For UAE and Saudi Arabia, they are interested in Sudan’s unfortunate involvement in the Yemen war. Sudan has been providing them with soldiers, many of whom child soldiers, fighting on the ground. Actually, a lot of Saudi and Emirati people have said—have praised their governments for using our people instead of theirs to fight on the ground, so that they would save more of their people’s lives. So, if there is a transition to a civilian government, the civilian government, one of its first demands is to stop this outsourcing that is happening through Sudan of our people, especially human rights violations of using child soldiers, and to stop the conflicts within Sudan.
AMY GOODMAN : And as we wrap up, you’ve been back and forth to Sudan. You just came back. You were there just before they opened fire on the sit-in. You were jailed in January; you were detained. Describe what it’s like to be there and why you continue to go back and forth and hold out hope.
MARINE ALNEEL : Well, in my most recent visit, what I’ve seen was very different from January, and definitely from what is happening now. The sit-in was a place for people to get together. It was a place where a lot of the segregation you see around Khartoum—the ethnic, the socioeconomic, the gender segregation that you see in Khartoum—you did not see that at the sit-in. Young people can get together and speak about their hopes for the future of Sudan. People can organize, unionize. Professionals can unionize. And during the days that I was there, there were a lot of Eid preparations. It was a happy place where you have a lot of the homeless children of Khartoum finding a family for themselves, people who are willing to get them new clothes for Eid. And all of this has been ended tragically by the raid, that has cost us many lives, that we don’t even know the number of.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to thank you so much, Marine, for being with us. Marine Alneel, Sudanese activist based in New York City.

President Trump has brought the United States one step closer to a devastating trade war with Mexico, saying talks with Mexican officials at the White House Wednesday ended without a deal. Trump has threatened to impose 5% tariffs on all imports from Mexico beginning Monday unless it agrees to crack down further on Central American migrants bound for the U.S. Trump’s plans have drawn resistance even within his own party—with Republican leaders including Mitch McConnell threatening a congressional revolt. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, fresh off a meeting with Mexico’s foreign minister,denounced Trump’s tariff plans.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi : “I think that this is dangerous territory. This is not a way to treat a friend. It’s not a way to deal with immigration. It’s not a way to deal—meet the humanitarian needs at the border.” Trump Admin to Cut School, Legal Aid and Recreation for Migrant Children Jun 06, 2019
The Trump administration said Wednesday it will suspend legal aid programs, recreational activities and English classes for unaccompanied migrant children jailed in federally run immigration centers. The move drew condemnation from human rights groups, including Amnesty International USA , which wrote, “It’s bad enough that the Trump administration is trying to normalize the warehousing of children. It’s unconscionable that they would so blatantly try to strip them of their rights. Locking up children and then denying them legal aid, education, and even playtime is all part of this administration’s cruel efforts to dehumanize people who have come to the U.S. seeking safety.” Mexican Police Arrest Immigration Activists Cristóbal Sánchez and Irineo Mujica Jun 06, 2019
In Mexico, police arrested two prominent immigration rights activists Wednesday. Cristóbal Sánchez was arrested by six plainclothes police officers outside his home in Mexico City and driven away in an unmarked car. And in the border town of Sonoyta, Sonora, police detained Irineo Mujica, director of the organization Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders. In a statement, the group called both arrests illegal and said the activists were targeted by the Mexican government for their humanitarian aid work with asylum seekers. Mujica has worked closely with Scott Warren, a humanitarian aid volunteer with the group No More Deaths in Tucson, Arizona, who faces up to 20 years in prison for providing water, clean clothes and beds to two asylum seekers in the Sonoran Desert. On Wednesday, Scott Warren told a jury at his trial his actions were motivated by three intentions: relief of suffering, respect for human dignity, and the right to self-determination. Trump Visits Normandy, France, on 75th Anniversary of D-Day Invasion Jun 06, 2019 Image Credit: Bloomberg via Getty Images
In France, President Emmanuel Macron welcomed President Donald Trump to Normandy today for a commemoration marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Western Europe in 1944. The invasion was a major turning point in the U.S.-led campaign against Nazi Germany. Trump Compares Future Irish Border to U.S.-Mexico Border Wall Jun 06, 2019
Trump’s trip to France followed his state visit to the United Kingdom—and a short visit to Ireland Wednesday, where Trump met with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. During their brief encounter, Trump said he believed Brexit would be a boon to the Irish Republic—and compared Ireland’s soft border with Northern Ireland to his plans to expand the wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
President Donald Trump : “I think that will all work out. It will all work out very well. And also for you, with your wall, your border. I mean, we have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here.”
Public opposition runs deep against any new border controls in a post-Brexit Ireland. Irish Protesters Decry Trump’s Racism, Misogyny and Climate Denial Jun 06, 2019
As Trump arrived at Ireland’s Shannon Airport, hundreds of protesters set up a “peace camp” to call out Trump’s policies on climate change, immigration and war.
Liz Hough : “I’m here today because of Trump’s misogyny, basically. Also, he’s a homophobic, a racist, an out-and-out narcissist. And that’s why I’m here today. I can’t stand any of his policies.”
Martin Vernon : “I think he’s a menace to the planet. He denies climate change, which is rampant and threatening the whole planet. And he’s withdrawn from the Paris Agreement.” Pressed on Climate Change, Trump Says Weather “Changes Both Ways” Jun 06, 2019 Image Credit: Good Morning Britain
President Trump has again denied the existence of climate change, telling a British television show that weather “changes both ways.” Trump was speaking with the host of “Good Morning Britain,” Piers Morgan, a former contestant on Trump’s NBC reality show “The Apprentice.”
Piers Morgan : “Do you personally believe in climate change?”
President Donald Trump : “I believe that there is a change in weather. And I think it changes both ways.”
During the 30-minute interview, Trump deflected questions on gun control and defended his ban on transgender soldiers in the military, claiming it was too expensive to provide them medical care. Asked if the United States would take military action against Iran, Trump replied, “There’s always a chance.” Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Claim They’ve Seized Territory in Saudi Arabia Jun 06, 2019
In southern Saudi Arabia, Houthi rebels from Yemen say they’ve crossed into Saudi territory in a surprise offensive that’s left them in control of nearly two dozen positions. There was no comment from Saudi officials on the claim, which would represent an escalation of Yemen’s four-year-old civil war. The fighting has left at least 7,300 children killed or seriously injured by U.S.-backed Saudi coalition airstrikes, and pushed half of Yemen’s 28 million people to the brink of starvation. Topics:"

A new scientific paper warns the Earth’s oceans are even more contaminated with microplastic pollution than previously known. The study, whose findings appear in Thursday’s edition of Nature Scientific Reports, sampled vertical columns of water off California extending to the deep ocean floor. The findings revealed tiny pieces of plastic waste at every depth—with higher concentrations far below the surface. The study also found high levels of microplastic pollution in the bodies of crabs, fish and microscopic ocean animals. The findings counter the widespread belief that most plastic waste is found floating at the surface and near coastlines.

In more news on reproductive rights, former Vice President Joe Biden angered much of his own Democratic Party Wednesday when his campaign manager said Biden still supports the Hyde Amendment—a decades-old ban on federal funding for most abortions, which disproportionately impacts the poor and people of color. Biden’s position puts him at odds with the Democratic National Committee’s 2016 platform—as well as all of the women senators challenging him for the 2020 presidential nomination—Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. All four are co-sponsors of legislation to overturn the Hyde Amendment. Other 2020 presidential candidates also weighed in, as well, including Senator Bernie Sanders, who tweeted, “There is #NoMiddleGround on women’s rights. Abortion is a constitutional right. Under my Medicare for All plan, we will repeal the Hyde Amendment.” Topics: "
"""They Are Not the Central Park 5"": Ava DuVernay's Series Restores Humanity of Wrongly Convicted Boys",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/7/ava_duvernay_when_they_see_us,"creator, writer and director of When They See Us . Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : When They See Us . Today we spend the hour with Ava DuVernay, whose damning new four-part television series tells the devastating story of five teenagers from Harlem—four African-American and one Latino—who were wrongfully accused and convicted of raping and nearly killing Trisha Meili, a 28-year-old white investment banker who was out for a jog in New York City’s Central Park. The night that would come to define the boys’ lives was April 19th, 1989, more than 30 years ago.
In the sensational trial that followed, they became known as the Central Park Five. During the trial, the teens maintained their innocence. But in 1990, they were convicted. Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana served between six and seven years, and Korey Wise, the only teenager tried as an adult, served more than 13 years.
The four-part Netflix series, created, written and directed by Ava DuVernay, follows the five teenagers from that fateful night in the park into adulthood. This is the trailer for When They See Us .
KEVIN RICHARDSON : [played by Asante Blackk] Is my mom here?
DETECTIVE ARROYO : [played by Bobby Daniel Rodriguez] It’s just us. You and us.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : [played by Bruce MacVittie] Who were you in the park with?
KEVIN RICHARDSON : I don’t know names. I just got lost.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : Where did you see the lady?
KEVIN RICHARDSON : Who? What lady?
LINDA FAIRSTEIN : [played by Felicity Huffman] The female jogger was severely beaten and raped. Every black male who was in the park last night is a suspect. I need all of them.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: [played by John Leguizamo] What’s going on with my son?
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : Your son was involved in a rape in Central Park.
BOBBY McCRAY: [played by Michael Kenneth Williams] What? No.
LINDA McCRAY: [played by Marsha Stephanie Blake] Wait a minute.
BOBBY McCRAY: No, that’s not possible.
LINDA McCRAY: Wait a second. Wait a second.
DETECTIVE MICHAEL SHEEHAN : [played by William Sadler] They saw you rape the lady!
YUSEF SALAAM : [played by Ethan Herisse] I didn’t see a lady or hit anyone.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : I didn’t see any lady.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : Kevin.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : I didn’t see any lady!
SHARONNE SALAAM : [played by Aunjanue Ellis] I want to see my son right now. Right now!
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: [played by Marquis Rodriguez] Whatever they said I did, I didn’t.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: I know. I know.
ELIZABETH LEDERER : [played by Vera Farmiga] Nothing these boys state matches the central facts of the crime.
LINDA FAIRSTEIN : All we need is for one to tie this whole thing together.
MICKEY JOSEPH : [played by Joshua Jackson] These tapes are not as clean as the state would have you believe.
NOMSA BRATH : [played by Adepero Oduye] There is injustice happening here.
MICKEY JOSEPH : There is not one shred of evidence.
ELIZABETH LEDERER : Imagine the frenzy of these teenagers ripping off her clothes!
MICKEY JOSEPH : They are innocent of these crimes.
ELIZABETH LEDERER : They are guilty!
COURT CLERK : [played by Edward Carnevale] As to the count of assault… As to the count of riot… As to the count of attempted murder…
KEVIN RICHARDSON : Why are they doing us like this?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: What other way they ever do us?
ANTRON McCRAY: [played by Caleel Harris] I’ve been having these dreams. I keep hearing these footsteps, and they’re coming closer and closer.
LINDA McCRAY: That’s of me, coming to bring you home.
KOREY WISE : [played by Jharrel Jerome] They said if I went along with it, that I could go home. And that’s all I wanted.
BOBBY McCRAY: [played by Michael Kenneth Williams] The police will do anything. They will lie on us. They will lock us up. They will kill us.
ANTRON McCRAY: This is my life!
YUSEF SALAAM : I don’t think we should admit to something that we didn’t do.
ROBERT BURNS : [played by Blair Underwood] OK, we keep fighting.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s the trailer for the Netflix series When They See Us . In agonizing detail, the series exposes the inner workings of a broken criminal justice system, laying bare the decades of trauma triggered by the boys’ wrongful convictions.
It also looks unsparingly at those responsible for the miscarriage of justice, including Linda Fairstein, the head of the Sex Crimes Unit at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, who spearheaded the case against the five boys. She’s played by Felicity Huffman. Fairstein is now a best-selling author of crime novels. Since the series premiered on May 31st, Fairstein has been forced to resign from several boards, including Safe Horizon, the Joyful Heart Foundation and her alma mater , Vassar College, where she served on the board of trustees. Glamour magazine, which named Fairstein Woman of the Year in 1993, issued a statement saying, “Unequivocally, Glamour would not bestow this honor on her today.”
The five men, who came to be known as the Central Park Five, were all fully exonerated of the crime in 2002, after Matias Reyes, a man convicted of murder who was serving a minimum 33-year sentence, came forward to claim sole responsibility for the attack. His DNA matched the genetic material found at the scene. The five men, who came to be known as the Central Park Five, reached a settlement with New York City of $41 million in 2014.
Earlier this week, I spoke with the series’ creator, writer and director, Ava DuVernay. She was in Los Angeles. I began by asking her why she decided to focus on the Central Park Five.
AVA DUVERNAY : Well, we know the case—and I’m happy to be here. Thank you for having me. I always love to be with you. You know, we know this case is very famous, for those of us who track and follow the ins and outs, the ups and downs of the criminal justice system in this country. I was really interested in using the touchpoints that make it very contemporary, which is mainly kind of the Trump connection, which is really a small part of their overall story, but it is an entry point for people who are not paying attention otherwise. But then, also, I thought this case allowed for a beautiful jumping-off point to explore the system overall. So, in my mind, in creating it, I have this very famous case, that I know is of interest to people, but really this is about the criminal justice system. And each part of the series, or the four-part film, as I call it, is designed to take you deeper and deeper, to make you further acquainted with different aspects of the system as it stands today.
AMY GOODMAN : So, why don’t you start by telling us the story, for those who aren’t familiar with it? It’s hard to believe it took place so long ago. I mean, back in 1989 is when this story begins, in Central Park.
AVA DUVERNAY : Yeah, I’ll be brief. I mean, I think people who are watching should know this, or there’s a whole film I made where you can check it out. But, basically, in April 19—on April 19th, 1989, five boys—four black boys and a Latino boy—were arrested, over the course of a couple of days, for an incident that happened in the park, that turned out to be the rape and assault of a woman, just as you described, Trisha Meili. She was a—worked at Salomon Brothers, a white woman in her late twenties. And she was clinging to life. You know, very many people thought that she would die.
And so it became a huge story in New York City. It caught fire and became a huge national story and really a lightning rod for a lot of politicized rhetoric at the time, calling for the death, calling for the lynching—Pat Buchanan called for their public lynching—calling for the criminalization not just of these boys, but for all boys who were thought to be “wilding,” which we know is a manufactured word, thought to be “superpredators,” which we know is another manufactured word. And so this created this whole toxic environment that, you know, then had real-world effects in terms of the way that we see black and brown people in this country, particularly boys, and particularly around issues of criminality.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to the part in When They See Us that depicts how New York Police Department officers interrogated 14-year-old Kevin Richardson.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : [played by Bruce MacVittie] Sooner you tell us what you know, sooner you go home. You got it?
KEVIN RICHARDSON : [played by Asante Blackk] Yeah. Yes, Officer.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : Detective. I’m Detective Hartigan. Let’s start with you telling us who you were in the park with.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : I don’t know names. I just—I just got lost.
DETECTIVE ARROYO : [played by Bobby Daniel Rodriguez] Sit up. This isn’t a game.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : Is my—is my mom here?
DETECTIVE ARROYO : She left. She wasn’t feeling well. It’s just us. You and us.
AMY GOODMAN : “Just you and us,” as Kevin Richardson, 14 years old, says, “Is my mom here?” Here’s another scene from When They See Us . We see Central Park Five member Antron McCray as he’s confronted by his father, Bobby McCray. The NYPD detectives interrogating Antron have just told his father outside the room to put pressure on his son, on Antron, so that he’ll tell them what they want to hear. And he is threatened. They ask about his past. They say they know that he served time in prison. They say they know where he works. He’s scared. He goes into the room alone with his son.
ANTRON McCRAY: [played by Caleel Harris] Dad, I ain’t rape no lady.
BOBBY McCRAY: [played by Michael Kenneth Williams] Tron, I’m trying to tell you what you need to do to get your [bleep] up out of here. But you’re not listening to me.
ANTRON McCRAY: I ain’t do this.
BOBBY McCRAY: Doesn’t matter. You’ve got to listen to me.
ANTRON McCRAY: No.
BOBBY McCRAY: Tron, listen to me. Don’t [bleep] backtalk me.
ANTRON McCRAY: You’re not listening—
BOBBY McCRAY: Goddamn it! Why you not listening to me? Tron, these police will mess us up. They’re not playing. They’re not. Look, when the police want what they want, they will do anything. Do you hear me? Anything! They will lie on us. They will lock us up. They will kill us. I ain’t gonna let them kill my son.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Antron McCray with his father Bobby, as Bobby pressures him, thinking he will save his son. And this is a scene that shows another one of the kids of the Central Park Five, Raymond Santana, after hours—facing hours of interrogation by police detectives. His father has just returned after he had to leave to go to work, and he finds Raymond working on his confession.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: [played by John Leguizamo] What’s going on?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: [played by Marquis Rodriguez] We almost finished here, Pop.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: I mean, nobody told me nothing.
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: Pop, I got it.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: Almost finished with what? What are you—what’s going on here? What are you doing?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: Don’t worry about.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: Are you OK? ¿Qué hiciste?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: I got it.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : [played by Bruce MacVittie] OK, so, so Antron held her down while Kevin was raping her, right?
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: Wait, wait. What are you talking about?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: Right. Pop, stop.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: What are you talking about, Ray?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: Pop.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : Your son was witness to a rape in Central Park. So, Antron was raping her. Now, what were you doing?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: Nothing.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : Come on, Ray. I mean, no one’s going to believe a kid like you would just stand there. You’ve got to put yourself in there.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: No, no, no. Wait a minute. What do you mean, “put yourself in there”?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: Pop, stop. Stop.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : He was there.
RAYMOND SANTANA SR.: You didn’t hear what he just said?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: Pop, stop. I made a deal.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Ray Santana and his father, his father played by John Leguizamo. Ava DuVernay, one after another, these boys being pressured, and the police using their family members, their parents, their fathers, their mothers, to go after their kids, promising them they will be the one that’s freed if they just cooperate.
AVA DUVERNAY : Yes, a lot of manipulation in those rooms, a lot of preying on people who did not have a full knowledge, a full grasp, of their rights. And so, another reason why I feel this is so important. You know, you’d be surprised at how many people—we know it, and people who watch your show most likely know this case. You’ve reported on it before. You know, it’s around. But I’ve been shocked at how many people don’t know it. They’ve heard about it. They knew Trump tweeted about it. They kind of know something went wrong, but don’t really know the details. I’ve also been shocked by people who knew that they were convicted and incarcerated, but never knew that they were exonerated and freed.
And so, the goal is to really tell the full breadth of the story, but to firmly root it in the perspective of the boys. That’s why in these scenes, you know, they’re being constructed from stories that the men told me, for hours of research and working with the men, to really recreate, get them back to the place where they could tell me exactly what was happening to them in those rooms, with the goal of making sure that it doesn’t happen again.
AMY GOODMAN : In this clip of When They See Us , Yusef Salaam has been interrogated for hours by police detectives, before his mother arrives. Sharonne Salaam arrives at the police station, and the famous sex crimes prosecutor Linda Fairstein isn’t going to allow her to see her son. So Sharonne threatens to call The New York Times , and then she’s allowed to interrupt the detectives, and confronts them, after comforting her son Yusef.
SHARONNE SALAAM : [played by Aunjanue Ellis] I’m here. Look at me. Are you hurt? Are you?
YUSEF SALAAM : [played by Ethan Herisse] Uh-uh, no.
SHARONNE SALAAM : What is that?
DETECTIVE JOHN TAGLIONI : [played by Patrick Gallo] Miranda card. He waived his right to an attorney.
SHARONNE SALAAM : We’re not waiving any rights. You left a child, unaccompanied by a guardian or a lawyer, with these men, in this room, for hours! Shame on you.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Sharonne Salaam confronting the sex crimes prosecutor Linda Fairstein. And in this scene from When They See Us , the police interrogation of 14-year-old Kevin Richardson, who we saw before, after hours of questioning, Kevin alone, without a guardian or a lawyer, the detectives bring in Kevin’s sister Angie. By this time, they’ve written out Kevin’s confession for him and are trying to get Angie, his older sister, to sign it, too.
ANGIE RICHARDSON : [played by Kylie Bunbury] “Touched her boobs”? Kevin.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : [played by Asante Blackk] No. No, Angie. No. I didn’t do anything.
ANGIE RICHARDSON : Then why did you say that you did do it?
KEVIN RICHARDSON : I didn’t do—I didn’t do that, Angie.
ANGIE RICHARDSON : He’s telling you that he didn’t see nothing. So why are you making him sign this, when he’s telling you that he didn’t see nothing? You’ve got to put at the bottom: “I’m the one that didn’t do the rape.”
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : [played by Bruce MacVittie] OK, we’ll do that. You’ve got to sign right here. All right?
ANGIE RICHARDSON : I’m not signing this.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : Angie, please sign it.
DETECTIVE MICHAEL SHEEHAN : [played by William Sadler] Come on! You want to take your brother home or not?
ANGIE RICHARDSON : Yes.
DETECTIVE MICHAEL SHEEHAN : ’Cause we can keep him.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : No, no.
ANGIE RICHARDSON : I can’t sign this.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : Please, just sign it. Please.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : Angie, just because you waive an attorney right now, it doesn’t mean it’s forever. Right?
ANGIE RICHARDSON : I don’t even—
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : You get your brother home. You and your mother figure things out with a lawyer.
ANGIE RICHARDSON : I have to figure this out.
DETECTIVE JOHN HARTIGAN : We’ll clear this all up.
KEVIN RICHARDSON : I don’t want to stay! Angie, I don’t want to stay here anymore! I’m tired of being here! I don’t want to be here anymore! Please sign it!
AMY GOODMAN : I mean, the enormous pressure these children and these families are under, as each is thinking they can get out, talk about that. Not only you’re talking to the boys, but their families, because clearly there is enormous guilt here, as the parents were trying, often without lawyers, to figure out what to do, what to advise their children. At first, they were understanding that the kids are going to be charged with something like unlawful assembly. And soon it’s not only they’re witnesses to a rape, but they are the rapists themselves.
AVA DUVERNAY : Yes. I think it’s so important that people see the process, and that’s why I spent a whole part, a whole episode, the first episode, to really bring you into the rooms, because you’ll hear again and again from the side that opposes the truth of what actually happened: “Well, how could you sign something if you didn’t do it? Why would you say something if it wasn’t true?” I think what it’s really important to explore and to understand is the power dynamics that happen in a room, when you are, you know, poor, black, young, or brown, and you are in a room with a white authority figure who is a police officer, who’s telling you, “Do these things, and I will help you. Do these things, and it’ll be OK.” So, it’s really not, you know, difficult math to understand how one plus one equals, you know, these boys basically signing their lives away.
And so, you know, the time taken to explore what each boy went through, so that they’re not just a monolith, they’re not a big group called the Central Park Five, and you don’t know who they are, why they did what they did. Our goal was to bring you into the rooms to recapture these boys’ humanity and that of their families. We know that when you incarcerate one person, you incarcerate their family, you incarcerate their community. And very much so, we’re incarcerating whole generations of people. And so, that detail became really important for me and all the artists involved.
AMY GOODMAN : Ava DuVernay, creator, writer and director of When They See Us , the four-part Netflix series based on the infamous Central Park jogger case. We’ll be back with her in a minute.

AMY GOODMAN : “I Got It Made” by Special Ed, one of the songs featured in the series When They See Us . This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue with our interview with Ava DuVernay, the creator, co-writer, director of the new four-part Netflix series on the Central Park jogger case. I asked Ava why she chose the title When They See Us .
AVA DUVERNAY : It was very much around the idea of presenting the humanity of people. They are not the Central Park Five. I came to feel that that was a political moniker. It was something that was given to them by the press. It was something that was given to them by the prosecution. It was something that allowed them to be seen as a gang, as a wolf pack, and not as Yusef, Korey, Kevin, Antron and Raymond, you know, real people, real boys, with real families, memories, hopes, dreams, that were dashed the day that they were captured at a park in—
AMY GOODMAN : Who didn’t even all know each other.
AVA DUVERNAY : No, who didn’t—you see that, as well. It’s stunning. Most people—and the way that it was presented at time is this was a wilding pack of boys that went into the park to have fun and assault this woman, when in fact, you know, most of the boys—only two of the five boys even knew each other. The rest of them didn’t even know the names that they were saying. They didn’t know who they were implicating. And so, they’ve become brothers in this. They’ve become kind of crusaders for each other. But at the time, they didn’t know one from the other.
AMY GOODMAN : So, I want to go to the scene in When They See Us which takes place in a jail cell, when all of the boys, the five boys, are together for the first time since they were arrested and interrogated, except for Korey Wise.
ANTRON McCRAY: [played by Caleel Harris] I lied on you, too.
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: [played by Marquis Rodriguez] Yeah. Me, too. I’m sorry, man.
YUSEF SALAAM : [played by Ethan Herisse] They made us lie. Right?
KEVIN RICHARDSON : [played by Asante Blackk] Why are they doing us like this?
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: What other way they ever do us?
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s four of the five boys, talking to each other and saying, “I lied on you. I didn’t tell the truth,” as they were under all of this pressure, for hours, with these police detectives. And then there’s the family members of the boys, who are meeting ahead of the trial. And at this point the parents have now attorneys for the kids. In this scene, Peter Rivera, the attorney for Raymond Santana, delivers some important news.
PETER RIVERA : [played by Chris Jackson] This case was assigned to Part 59 of the New York State Supreme Court. That’s Galligan’s court.
ROBERT BURNS : [played by Blair Underwood] Why is that a big deal?
PETER RIVERA : One, they didn’t spin the wheel. And—wait, what—what type of law did you say practice?
ROBERT BURNS : I’m a divorce attorney. I handled Sharonne’s case.
PETER RIVERA : Judge assignments are supposed to happen by spinning the wheel, so it’s random. They didn’t do that with this case. They gave it to Galligan. Rikers Island, they call it Galligan’s Island. Ten times out of nine he sides with the state. They don’t plan to lose this case.
DELORIS WISE : [played by Niecy Nash] [bleep]
AMY GOODMAN : Galligan’s Island, they called it, Ava DuVernay.
AVA DUVERNAY : Yes, yes. You know, the chips were stacked against these kids through the process, through the systemic processing of the boys, because it certainly wasn’t based on evidence. There was no physical evidence. There was never any physical evidence connecting the five to Trisha Meili, to the site, not a piece of hair, not a drop of blood, not any any physical material. And so, there was no weapon. There were none of the things that cases are built upon when they’re properly processed. It was all the tapes.
AMY GOODMAN : But there was—
AVA DUVERNAY : It was all these coerced confessions.
AMY GOODMAN : There was semen. It just didn’t match theirs.
AVA DUVERNAY : It wasn’t theirs. That’s right. That’s right. I mean, there’s a point that you’ll see in the film where the defense is very excited that the semen is found, because they are 100% sure that their boys didn’t do it, and so it will show that there was someone else and that the case would turn. But when the chips are so stacked against, through propaganda, through political will, through things like, you know, the way that the judge assignment was done, through the spoiling of the jury pool by ads being taken out calling for the execution of these boys. This was two weeks after the crime. It’s before trial. So they did not have a proper jury. They didn’t have a proper judge. There were challenges with their defense in terms of the wherewithal to have a muscular defense. So, through this series, I try to show you all of the ways in which the system is slanted towards people who cannot defend themselves against the clutches of the state, when the state turns its attention your way.
AMY GOODMAN : As the Central Park Five case goes to trial, then-real estate developer Donald Trump paid $85,000 to publish a full-page ad in four New York newspapers, with the headline, all in capital letters, ” BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY . BRING BACK OUR POLICE !” Below the headline, the ad read, “I want to hate these murderers and I always will. I am not looking to psychoanalyze or understand them, I am looking to punish them. … I no longer want to understand their anger. I want them to understand our anger. I want them to be afraid.” Later that year, Trump told NBC News he wished he was black. This is a clip from that interview, which is also featured in the second episode of When They See Us .
DONALD TRUMP : A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market. And I think sometimes a black may think that they don’t really have the advantage or this or that, but, in actuality, today, currently, that it’s a—it’s a great—I’ve said, on occasion, even about myself, if I was starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I really believe they do have an actual advantage today.
AMY GOODMAN : That was New York developer Donald Trump. Ava DuVernay, if you can talk about the ads? It was also the time the “wolf pack” was coined, that term.
AVA DUVERNAY : Yes. I mean, there’s a world in which I make this piece, and there’s an actual actor playing Donald Trump when we’re going into his gold-gilded buildings, and we’re following his thought process and the rhetoric that he was spewing at the time, the opportunity that he saw. And being an opportunist, he took it. But we don’t. What you’ve seen is pretty much the extent of how I deal with him, because my focus in this is not him. My focus is the voice of these men and their families and their communities.
So, there was an atmosphere at the time, that he certainly contributed to. You know, you have someone like Pat Buchanan, who also called for their death. He called for Korey Wise to be publicly hung. And there was an acceptance of this kind of rhetoric at the time, that led to a very dangerous environment, not just for these boys, but for black and brown people generally at the time. There’s a few short steps from this time to the 1994 crime bill. It was all a time that was doing great emotional violence and physical harm to people of color, who were very much at risk by these words, these intentions. And Donald Trump was a big part of that.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to go back to When They See Us . This is attorney Mickey Joseph, who cross-examines an NYPD detective who’s testifying at a key point in their trial.
MICKEY JOSEPH : [played by Joshua Jackson] You testified that it was Linda McCray’s idea to remove herself from the interrogation room.
DETECTIVE HILDEBRANDT : [played by Jayce Bartok] That’s right.
MICKEY JOSEPH : But isn’t it the fact that that was your idea, yours and Detective Gonzalez?
DETECTIVE HILDEBRANDT : We all decided together.
MICKEY JOSEPH : Detective Gonzalez testified that Antron told him that he had penetrated the jogger. But you just told the DA that Antron was very clear with you that he did not penetrate her. So, which is it, Detective? Because both of you can’t be telling the truth.
ELIZABETH LEDERER : [played by Vera Farmiga] Objection. Argumentative.
COURTROOM OBSERVER : He ain’t did nothing!
LINDA McCRAY: [played by Marsha Stephanie Blake] Thank you.
JUDGE THOMAS GALLIGAN : [played by Richard Bekins] Order! Order! Sustained.
MICKEY JOSEPH : And because neither you nor Detective Gonzalez kept any notes of the interview, I guess we’ll just never know why a 14-year-old went from saying that he had never heard of a rape in the park to allegedly confessing to it.
AMY GOODMAN : And this is another clip from the series: Robert Burns, the attorney who represented Yusef Salaam, addressing the jury.
ROBERT BURNS : [played by Blair Underwood] There was a strong motivation to solve and close this case as soon as possible. So, in comes my client, OK? Fifteen years old at the time, never been in the precinct before under any circumstances. And they work him and work him, until his mother comes down and puts a stop to the interrogation. It was neither a voluntary statement nor a truthful one. And the evidence to support it, it isn’t there, which leaves us room for reasonable doubt.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Yusef Salaam’s attorney Robert Burns, who’s played by Blair Underwood. He was a divorce attorney. And can you talk about this, the lack of experience of the parents? You know, this is the first time their kids are encountering the criminal justice system, and how fast they had to work to figure out: How could they save their children? I mean, you have, for example, The New York Times , a few days after the kids are picked up—this is April 26, 1989—the headline—and this is an editorial, Ava—”The Jogger and the Wolf Pack.” They were convicted long before this trial.
AVA DUVERNAY : Yeah. Before they even got into the courtroom, the decision had already been made. Public opinion had already been shaped. And it happened through so many factors. Imagine yourself being a parent who has a kid who’s never been in trouble, doesn’t even know how to maneuver and make their way through the maze that is the criminal justice system. They didn’t have the money. They didn’t have the know-how. And they did the very best that they could.
And so, it was important for me to show, along with the actors who portrayed these families, the real care, the real guilt, the real effort that they all exerted to try to save their sons. And they all stood by their sons every step of the way. From the moment that you saw the clip where the boys acknowledged that they’ve lied on each other, those men never again said that they did it. They maintained their innocence for decades after and endured great hardship in prison and in detention because of it. And their families did, as well.
AMY GOODMAN : Ava DuVernay, creator, co-writer, director of When They See Us . Back with her in a minute.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : “World I Never Made” by Dr. John, the legendary New Orleans singer, who passed away Thursday at the age of 77. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we spend the hour with Ava DuVernay, creator, writer, director of When They See Us , the new Netflix four-part series based on the Central Park jogger case. She joined us in Los Angeles. I asked her what happened to the five teens of color—four African-American, one Latino—after their wrongful convictions, particularly Korey Wise, the only one of the teens tried as an adult.
AVA DUVERNAY : The story of Korey broke my heart. When I got to know Korey and spoke with him, I learned so much about him. But in the first 15 minutes of meeting Korey, back in 2015, which is when I started this process, he told me, “There’s no Central Park Five. There’s four plus one. There’s four plus one.” And that always haunted me, and I wanted to know: Why did he think that? And I soon learned, through conversations with him, through examination of his records, what he endured. And it is hard to speak of, hard to shoot, hard to write, but, you know, even harder to have endured. And he did. He survived it. But it’s—it’s terrifying.
AMY GOODMAN : I mean, brutality doesn’t even begin to express what happened to Korey in these adult persons. It doesn’t begin.
AVA DUVERNAY : Yes. And what you see in the film, I’d say, is about 70, 75% of what he really endured. You know, it’s—having been privy to what his real experience was, it’s horrific. Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : So, in 2002, the young men are now exonerated, after Matias Reyes, a convicted murderer who was serving a minimum of 33 years, came forward to claim sole responsibility for the attack. His DNA matched what was at the crime scene. I personally knew this case of Matias Reyes, because he raped a woman in my building, and that’s how eventually he was caught. But his MO at the time, as they were going after these young men, who lived at the top of Central Park—he had the MO of going after women, gouging out their eyes, raping them and attempting to kill them. He thought he had actually killed the Central Park jogger, I believe.
AVA DUVERNAY : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : And so, by focusing on these young men, they allowed him to continue his rampage. That shows the other side of the bigotry, of the racism. He continued to rape women, and then, ultimately, tells Korey Wise, bumps into him in prison, says, “No, I did it.”
AVA DUVERNAY : Yes. You’ve described it perfectly. I mean, you know, the idea that the focus on these five boys to kind of wipe hands clean and to get a victory quickly, while allowing the real rapist to continue on—I mean, they knew. They knew, very early on, that they did not have these boys. They had to have. They had no evidence. They knew that they were helping these boys contrive stories. And so, to do that and to allow whoever did this vicious assault to roam free is, I think, one of the tragedies of this that’s not talked about hardly enough. I mean, Matias Reyes had a—they didn’t know his name at the time, but they knew that there was a rapist out there who had a very specific MO. He worked alone. He had a very specific way that he went about his assaults. And this guy was on the loose. It matched exactly the way in which Trisha Meili was attacked and raped. And yet they turned a blind eye toward that, because they had these five boys, these vulnerable boys. They had gotten them to say what they wanted to say. And it was a story that, to be frank with you, the media really ate up. And it proved a win for the New York PD at the time that it really needed one.
AMY GOODMAN : And some of these detectives were the same ones dealing with the Matias Reyes case. It’s absolutely astounding. So—
AVA DUVERNAY : Yes. I mean, I think it’s important to name names. Michael Sheehan was the same detective on both. It also had the same judge, Judge Galligan, the same judge, whom—I mean, they’re looking at all of this evidence and are not able to parse out and kind of do the job to see where the real contrasts were, where the similarities were, because there was this ferocious—this fervor to put away the five.
AMY GOODMAN : So, the young men, after they get out of prison, they are exonerated. In 2016, Yusef Salaam joined us on Democracy Now! , and I asked him about how then-presidential candidate Donald Trump was continuing to say that Yusef and the other young men were guilty.
YUSEF SALAAM : You know, first, thanks for having me on your show.
Donald Trump has the absolute, ultimate ability to fact-check everything about this case. One of the things that’s really surprising is that you have one of the jurors saying, you know, he was going crazy, there was no evidence, no blood on the guys, but they confessed, and so that was that, you know. But when you look at the nature of the confessions, when you look at the nature of what happened to get the confessions, how these confessions didn’t match anything that the other guys were saying, you know, and then all of a sudden, 13 years later, the truth comes out, and here you have a guy who talks about what happened at the crime scene, talks about when he struck the woman over the head with a tree branch, talks about dragging her into the woods—and key evidence that no one else had mentioned is that she was tied up with here own jogging outfit—you know, Donald Trump has the ability to look at all of this stuff and to put the truth out there.
But I think that it’s more attractive to him to be divisive, to be negative. He’s calling it a positive thing that he did back in 1989. I mean, we’re talking about—this crime happened April 19, 1989. On May 1st, Donald Trump had already taken out the ads. It was being ran in New York City’s newspapers, calling for the death penalty to be reinstated. What was happening was that we were given a social death. We were being tried in the media, and they were getting ready to lynch us, in public and through the court system. You know, if I had a show, I would tell Donald Trump he was fired. All of the things that he’s exhibiting today is very, very disturbing. Nobody who is seeking presidency should even have any kind of shady, dark past like Donald Trump. He’s definitely not the man for these United States of America.
AMY GOODMAN : And this is Raymond Santana speaking on Democracy Now! in 2012, four years before Yusef.
RAYMOND SANTANA JR.: I served almost seven years. And so, what happened was that, you know, I tried to get my life back together and put one foot in front of the other, but I didn’t—you know, I didn’t realize the social death that we were given as a sentence. You know, this wasn’t a 5 to 15 or 5 to 10; this was a life sentence, a death sentence, in a sense, because, you know, when I came home, I couldn’t get employment. You know, I tried out—filled out numerous applications. And, you know, I had to register as a sex offender. You know, my whole neighborhood looked at me, you know, kind of strange. You know, you get the “Hi, how are you doing?” but, you know, you always have that bullseye on the back, you know, that says, someway, somehow, I’m Raymond Santana from the Central Park jogger case.
You know, my family shunned away from me, so I thought I was all alone. I had—you know, there was nowhere I can turn. There was no transitional programs for me to come back into society into, and so—and be productive. And so I crashed. And I didn’t know what to do. And I turned back to crime, and I started selling—you know, I started selling drugs. And I got charged—and I got arrested, and I was charged with criminal possession with the intent to distribute.
AMY GOODMAN : So, in 2014, the city settled with these five young men for $41 million. They were exonerated. And yet you hear Yusef Salaam dealing in 2016, during the presidential campaign—he said that Trump should be fired from the presidential campaign—dealing with Donald Trump continuing to campaign against them and saying he did not believe that they were innocent. Ava DuVernay?
AVA DUVERNAY : You know, $41 million doesn’t bring your youth back. We can all think back to when we were young, when we were free, when we were learning, when we were blossoming, when we were engaging with the world in new ways. These boys were behind bars. Korey Wise was in an adult prison, held in adult prisons during that time.
You know, $41 million, split between the five, does nothing to the fact that no one’s ever apologized for this. The city’s, part of their settlement was no apology. Linda Fairstein still maintains that they did it. Elizabeth Lederer, who prosecuted the case, still maintains that they did it. And so, you know, it’s—that’s a pain that they bear that is greater than a dollar amount can be put on. And my great hope is that this piece of art can tell their story loudly enough so that the rest of us can apologize for letting this happen. The public was complicit. The press was, as well.
And we need to be able to demand change when it comes to these cases. This is not an anomaly, this case. You know, it’s not hard to believe that there are five black and brown boys somewhere being interrogated or pulled off the street for something that they didn’t do, that there are people we know behind bars who are only there because they can’t pay to get out, that, you know, the majority of people who are behind bars right now in this country have never seen a trial. The system’s not broken; the system was built this way. It was built this way. And so it’s important for us to understand what it is, so that we can dismantle it and start again. It’s truly—I don’t think it’ll be in my lifetime or yours, but this work is important to continue to talk about what has happened here and to bear witness to it, with the goal of making sure that there’s a foundation of knowledge laid so that we can get to a place where it doesn’t continue to happen.
AMY GOODMAN : Ava DuVernay, we want to thank you so much for being with us, writer, the producer, the director of independent films, including the just-released four-part Netflix series based on the Central Park Five case. It’s called When They See Us . She’s the creator, the writer, the director. She’s the winner of the Emmy, BAFTA and Peabody Awards and an Academy Award nominee. She’s also the director of Selma , the criminal justice documentary 13th and Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time . Thank you so much for being with us, Ava.
AVA DUVERNAY : Thank you, Amy.
AMY GOODMAN : While Linda Fairstein, the head of the Sex Crimes Unit who spearheaded the case against the five boys—the real person who committed the rape, Matias Reyes, was still on the loose. He had beaten and attempted to rape a woman in Central Park on April 17, two days before the jogger was assaulted. That first victim gave the police a description of him, saying he had stitches on his chin. A local hospital then gave the police the name Matias Reyes and someone who fit that description. The police never followed up on that lead.
After the five boys were arrested, Reyes went on to beat and rape five women, murdering one of them, Lourdes Gonzalez, a pregnant mother of three. Matias Reyes was eventually captured when his last rape victim ran down her building’s stairs screaming as he fled and the doorman tackled him. Reyes confessed to several of his crimes, including murder.
Had Fairstein and the New York police investigated the crimes in which Reyes had repeated his MO again and again, rather than racially profiling and framing the five teenage boys, perhaps those rapes and the murder of that young mother might have been prevented.
Journalist Roland Martin tweeted, quote, “It is my sincerest desire that the @ava @WhenTheySeeUs @netflix series does for @LindaFairstein and #ElizabethLederer what the @lifetimetv doc #SurvivingRKelly did for @RKelly and his career.”
That does it for our broadcast. Pacifica station WBAI gave voice to the families of the five boys for years.

"Headlines for June 7, 2019",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/7/headlines,"Bowing to U.S. Pressure, Mexico to Deploy 6,000 Troops to Guatemala Border Jun 07, 2019
Mexico’s government says it will send 6,000 troops to its southern border with Guatemala in a crackdown on Central American migrants hoping to seek asylum in the U.S. Thursday’s announcement came as heavily armed Mexican soldiers and police blocked a caravan of about a thousand migrants as they walked a highway in the southern state of Chiapas. The crackdown came ahead of a threat by President Trump to impose 5% tariffs on all Mexican imports next Monday unless Mexico further tightens controls on immigration. Mexican officials are reportedly nearing a deal with the White House that would require asylum seekers to seek refuge in the countries they first cross into. Under the plan, Guatemalan migrants could only apply for asylum in Mexico; Hondurans and Salvadorans would be forced to apply as refugees in Guatemala. The emerging plan drew fire from civil liberties groups including the ACLU , which said such a change to the asylum system violates both U.S. and international laws and is unlikely to survive a legal challenge. House Judiciary Chair Pushes for Presidential Impeachment Inquiry Jun 07, 2019
Democratic House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler is preparing to subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller within the next two weeks. That’s according to Politico, which also reports Nadler is privately pushing Democratic leaders to open a formal impeachment inquiry against the president. During a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly pushed back, saying Trump should be “in prison”—but not impeached. House Ways and Means Chair Has No Plans to Acquire Trump’s New York Tax Records Jun 07, 2019
Meanwhile, the Democratic chair of the House Ways and Means Committee is coming under fire from his own party after he told Bloomberg News he has no plans to use a recently passed New York state law to acquire President Trump’s tax records. Congressmember Richard Neal says he’s worried the request would “bolster Trump administration arguments that Congress is on a political fishing expedition.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has defied congressional requests to turn over Trump’s tax records, and Trump remains the only president or major presidential candidate in modern U.S. history to refuse to make tax returns public. Russian President Says U.S. Is Shunning Negotiations on Nuclear Arms Treaty Jun 07, 2019
Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Thursday of a “global catastrophe” if the Trump administration abandons talks on extending the New START nuclear arms treaty. The agreement—negotiated by the Obama administration in 2010 and ratified by the Senate later that year—limits the total number of deployed nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers. It’s set to expire in 2021, and so far Putin says the U.S. has ignored his efforts to negotiate an extension.
President Vladimir Putin : “No one has spoken with us. No formal process of talks is taking place. And it will all end in 2022.”
In February, the Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from another landmark nuclear deal: the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF . The move prompted Russia to withdraw, as well, warning it was preparing a new generation of nuclear-capable missiles. African Union Suspends Sudan over Massacre of Sit-in Protesters Jun 07, 2019
The African Union has suspended Sudan’s membership, after soldiers with the ruling Transitional Military Council opened fire on sit-in protesters on Monday, killing at least 108 people and wounding more than 500 others. In a statement, the AU said Sudan would remain suspended until a civilian-led transitional authority is established. Sudan’s military took power in April after a month-long popular uprising led to the overthrow of longtime authoritarian President Omar al-Bashir. Study Finds Limiting Climate Change Would Save Thousands from Heat-Related Deaths Jun 07, 2019
A new study finds climate change could cause thousands of heat-related deaths across the United States each year if global greenhouse gas emissions aren’t rapidly curbed. The study in the journal Science Advances looked at deaths from recent heat waves in 15 major U.S. cities, extrapolating mortality rates from future temperature rise. In New York City alone, a global temperature rise of 3 degrees Celsius—or 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit—could mean another 5,800 deaths each year; with another 2,500 extra annual deaths in Los Angeles. Jay Inslee: Democratic National Committee Refusing to Hold Debate on Climate Jun 07, 2019
Washington governor and 2020 presidential hopeful Jay Inslee says the Democratic National Committee is refusing to schedule a candidate debate on the climate crisis. Inslee said Thursday he was told by the DNC that if he participates in any non- DNC -affiliated debate on the climate, he would be disinvited to future debates held by the committee. Inslee called the move a “deeply disappointing” attempt to blacklist candidates. He said in a statement, “The DNC is silencing the voices of Democratic activists, many of our progressive partner organizations, and nearly half of the Democratic presidential field, who want to debate the existential crisis of our time.” SEIU Becomes First Major Union to Endorse Green New Deal Jun 07, 2019
The Service Employees International Union has become the first U.S. labor union to support the Green New Deal. On Thursday, SEIU’s executive board voted to endorse the plan to radically shift the U.S. economy to renewable energy, ending U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. In a tweet, SEIU said, “This groundbreaking measure aims to address climate change while creating high-quality union jobs. We need to combat climate change while raising standards for all working people.” Report: Earth’s Oceans More Contaminated with Plastic Than Previously Known Jun 07, 2019
A new scientific paper warns the Earth’s oceans are even more contaminated with microplastic pollution than previously known. The study, whose findings appear in Thursday’s edition of Nature Scientific Reports, sampled vertical columns of water off California extending to the deep ocean floor. The findings revealed tiny pieces of plastic waste at every depth—with higher concentrations far below the surface. The study also found high levels of microplastic pollution in the bodies of crabs, fish and microscopic ocean animals. The findings counter the widespread belief that most plastic waste is found floating at the surface and near coastlines. Trump Administration Plans to Reclassify High-Level Radioactive Waste as Low-Risk Jun 07, 2019 Image Credit: ShinRyu Forgers
The Trump administration is planning to reclassify high-level radioactive waste as low-risk, in a bid to cut as much as $40 billion from cleanup costs at nuclear weapons production sites around the U.S. A top Energy Department official called the proposal a “responsible, results-driven solution” to the problem of nuclear waste disposal. The move was condemned by environmentalists and scientists who say the waste needs to be contained in facilities deep underground. In a statement, the Natural Resources Defense Council said, “The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic and radioactive waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of.” Biden Retracts Long-Standing Support of Federal Funding Ban on Abortions Jun 07, 2019
Former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday reversed his long-standing support for the Hyde Amendment, a decades-old ban on federal funding for abortions. Biden announced his policy shift at a fundraiser in Atlanta.
Joe Biden : “For many years as U.S. senator, I have supported the Hyde Amendment, like many, many others have, because there was sufficient moneys and circumstances where women were able to exercise that right—women of color, poor women, women who were not able to have access. And it was—it was not under attack as it was then—as it is now. But circumstances have changed.”
Biden’s reversal came during the same week that his campaign affirmed his support for the Hyde Amendment’s ban on federal funding for abortions. That set off a wave of criticism from grassroots Democrats, women’s rights groups and most of Biden’s rivals for the 2020 nomination. Ex- NYC Prosecutor Linda Fairstein Under Fire for Role in “Central Park 5” Case Jun 07, 2019 Image Credit: Flickr: cyvanceforda
Former New York City prosecutor Linda Fairstein has stepped down from Vassar College’s board of trustees and from the boards of a pair of nonprofits, amid growing outrage over her role in the case of the Central Park Five. In 1989, five teenagers of color from Harlem were wrongfully accused and convicted on charges of gang rape, based largely on Fairstein’s work as head of the Sex Crimes Unit for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. The five spent years in prison before the real perpetrator confessed in 2002. The case drew renewed attention after the recent premiere of the Netflix miniseries about the Central Park Five. After headlines, we’ll spend the rest of the hour with Ava Duvernay, director of “When They See Us.” Disciplinary Hearing Wraps Up for NYPD Officer Who Choked Eric Garner to Death Jun 07, 2019
A New York Police Department disciplinary hearing wrapped up Thursday for Daniel Pantaleo, a white police officer who killed unarmed African American Eric Garner in 2014 by putting him in a chokehold and refusing to let go even as Garner repeatedly gasped “I can’t breathe.” Pantaleo never faced criminal prosecution, after a grand jury decided not to indict him. He has remained on the police force but could lose his job and pension if found guilty of violating NYPD procedures. A presiding judge will send a recommendation about Pantaleo’s fate to Police Commissioner James O’Neill in the coming weeks. Eric Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, called Thursday for all the officers present at her son’s killing to be fired. 50 Years Later, NYPD Apologizes to LGBTQ Community for Stonewall Raids Jun 07, 2019
Meanwhile, the NYPD has apologized for the first time for its raid a half-century ago on the Stonewall Inn, a gay- and trans-friendly bar in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. In June of 1969, the inn was the site of a violent police raid that triggered an uprising and helped launch the modern-day LGBTQ rights movement. On Thursday, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill made the apology during a press briefing on public safety for Pride Month events.
Commissioner James O’Neill : “The actions taken by the NYPD were wrong—plain and simple. The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive. And for that, I apologize.” WA State Supreme Court Sides with Same-Sex Couple in Discrimination Case Jun 07, 2019
Washington state’s Supreme Court ruled Thursday against a florist who refused to provide floral arrangements for the wedding of a same-sex couple, ruling the business owner broke the state’s consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws. The ruling came almost exactly one year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Colorado baker Jack Phillips, who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, citing his religious opposition. Animal Rights Activist Confronts Amazon CEO over Cruelty at Chicken Farms Jun 07, 2019 Image Credit: Twitter: @verge
In Las Vegas, an animal rights activist rushed the stage at a space technology conference Thursday to confront Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos over conditions at chicken farms that supply meat to Whole Foods and other Amazon grocery brands. The activist, Priya Sawhney, was quickly forced off the stage as she told the world’s richest man to stand up for the rights of animals. Sawhney is co-founder of the group Direct Action Everywhere, whose members work to directly rescue animals from factory farms and slaughterhouses. She was arrested in September at a protest against animal cruelty at the largest organic poultry producer in the U.S. and faces up to a decade in prison.

And legendary New Orleans musician Dr. John died Thursday of a heart attack. He was 77 years old. Dr. John won six Grammy Awards in a decades-long career that saw him produce at least three dozen albums fusing blues, boogie, funk and jazz—a flamboyant sound that embodied New Orleans’s diverse music scene. After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, Dr. John headlined a series of benefit concerts. In 2010, he was active in the campaign to hold BP accountable for the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster off the Louisiana coast.

"Bowing to U.S. Pressure, Mexico to Deploy 6,000 Troops to Guatemala Border - Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/7/headlines/bowing_to_us_pressure_mexico_to_deploy_6_000_troops_to_guatemala_border,"Bowing to U.S. Pressure, Mexico to Deploy 6,000 Troops to Guatemala Border Headline Jun 07, 2019
Mexico’s government says it will send 6,000 troops to its southern border with Guatemala in a crackdown on Central American migrants hoping to seek asylum in the U.S. Thursday’s announcement came as heavily armed Mexican soldiers and police blocked a caravan of about a thousand migrants as they walked a highway in the southern state of Chiapas. The crackdown came ahead of a threat by President Trump to impose 5% tariffs on all Mexican imports next Monday unless Mexico further tightens controls on immigration. Mexican officials are reportedly nearing a deal with the White House that would require asylum seekers to seek refuge in the countries they first cross into. Under the plan, Guatemalan migrants could only apply for asylum in Mexico; Hondurans and Salvadorans would be forced to apply as refugees in Guatemala. The emerging plan drew fire from civil liberties groups including the ACLU , which said such a change to the asylum system violates both U.S. and international laws and is unlikely to survive a legal challenge.

By Amy Goodman & Denis Moynihan
“Every life is sacred, and every soul is a precious gift from heaven.” So said President Donald J. Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast last Feb. 7. Trump’s Christian posturing would be laughable if his policies weren’t so cruel and often deadly. Take, for example, asylum-seekers crossing our southern border. Hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing violence in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico. Increasingly militarized and violent enforcement of border security has driven desperate migrants further from official ports of entry, forcing many to embark on dangerous treks through the scorching deserts of the American Southwest. Scott Warren, a geographer and educator who volunteers with the humanitarian aid groups No More Deaths and Ajo Samaritans, is on trial now in federal court in Tucson, Arizona. If convicted, he could spend 20 years in prison for giving migrants in need, according to his indictment, “food, water, beds and clean clothes.”
Before heading to his first day in court Wednesday, Warren appeared on the Democracy Now! news hour: “Many have died while making the journey. For decades, activists in the region have left food and water in the desert to help lessen the death toll. Increasingly, Customs and Border Patrol ( CBP ) agents destroy water and food caches that they find in the desert.”
On the morning of Jan. 17, 2018, No More Deaths released a report and video detailing CBP interference in humanitarian aid delivery. The report stated, “In the desert of the Arizona-Mexico borderlands, where thousands of people die of dehydration and heat-related illness, Border Patrol agents are destroying gallons of water intended for border crossers. Border Patrol agents stab, stomp, kick, drain, and confiscate the bottles of water that humanitarian aid volunteers leave along known migrant routes in the Arizona desert. These actions condemn border crossers to suffering, death, and disappearance.”
The videos of border agents emptying gallons of water went viral. By 5:30 p.m., agents had pulled up to “the Barn,” a building near Ajo, Arizona — 40 miles from the border — where volunteers gather, and where migrants occasionally arrive, seeking aid. Two migrant men were detained there, and Scott Warren was arrested. “The report was released that morning, and then agents set up surveillance on the Barn that afternoon and then arrested me that evening,” Warren said.
Catherine Gaffney is also a volunteer with No More Deaths. More than 7,000 migrant deaths have been recorded in the border region in the past 20 years, but, she says, that is an undercount. “Not only is there this repression of the right of people to receive food, water and medical care,” she said on “Democracy Now!,” “but to provide food, water and medical care. It’s really striking that they’re going after humanitarian aid work in the Ajo area, because so many of the deaths that are being reported are being found by humanitarian aid volunteers … not only will people be left to die, but their deaths will go [undiscovered], and the true scope of this crisis will go unrecorded.”
No one at that February National Prayer Breakfast called out Trump for his decidedly un-Christian treatment of migrants. Pope Francis did have something to say about migrants, however, recently releasing a statement on the Vatican’s 105th annual World Day of Migrants and Refugees, to be held on Sept. 29. The pope wrote: “The signs of meanness we see around us heighten our fear of ‘the other’, the unknown, the marginalized, the foreigner. … But the problem is not that we have doubts and fears. The problem is when they condition our way of thinking and acting to the point of making us intolerant, closed and perhaps even — without realizing it — racist.” Migrants and refugees, he adds, “are often looked down upon and considered the source of all society’s ills.”
The pope assumes many might be racist “without realizing it.” Trump is another case entirely. He was an enthusiastic leader of the “birther” conspiracy that alleged Barack Obama was not born in the United States. When Trump announced his presidential bid in 2015, he said of Mexicans: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” He says that there were “very fine people” among the torchbearing Nazis and Ku Klux Klansmen in Charlottesville, Virginia. Aided by his hard-line, anti-immigrant adviser Stephen Miller, Trump tirelessly rails against migrants, Muslims, Mexicans, Haitians and those he says live in “huts” in “s***hole countries.”
The parable of the good Samaritan figured prominently at the National Prayer Breakfast. Scott Warren is a real-world Samaritan, walking the desert, among the bones and decomposing remains of migrants and extending a helping hand to desperate strangers in need. Rather than prosecuting him, the Trump administration should be honoring him, while ordering border agents to deliver, not destroy, water. What would Jesus do? This is viewer supported news.

Animal Rights Activists: Cops Punish Protesters While Letting Corporations Off for Animal Torture | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/7/animal_rights_activists_cops_punish_protesters,"co-founder and a lead investigator of Direct Action Everywhere. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh, with Part 2 of our discussion about animal rights actions, known as rescues, that have been taking place around the country.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Nearly a hundred animal rights activists are free today after being arrested for carrying out a rescue mission and protest at Reichardt Duck Farm in Petaluma, which they accuse of animal torture. More than 600 activists with Direct Action Everywhere, or DxE, stormed the slaughterhouse Monday, fanning out in teams to chain themselves together at the entrance, freeing dozens of ducks and in some cases locking themselves by the neck to the slaughter line.
AMY GOODMAN : This is just the latest in a series of direct actions by the group. In 2017, DxE went to Smithfield’s Circle Four Farms in Utah, one of the world’s largest pig farms, to expose conditions at the facility. Investigators report finding piglets feeding on their own mother’s blood, pregnant pigs held in gestational crates too small for them to turn around in, and sick and feverish piglets left to die of starvation or be trampled.
This is Wayne Hsiung at Smithfield’s Circle Farms.
WAYNE HSIUNG : So, we’ve got a little baby here who’s literally starving to death, because her mom’s nipples are so torn up, she can’t feed on milk. So, she’s about half the size of the piglets. And like the one-third of the piglets who are born into farms like this, she’s going to die. She’ll probably starve to death. Her face is covered in blood, and we’ve got to take her out. So that’s what we’re going to do.
AMY GOODMAN : Utah officials filed felony burglary and rioting charges against Wayne Hsiung and four other members of Direct Action Everywhere, accusing them of removing a pair of piglets, named Lucy and Ethel. The activists could face 60 years in prison.
We’re still with our guests, Priya Sawhney and Wayen Hsiung, co-founders of Direct Action Everywhere, both facing prison time for their activism.
Wayne, we just looked once again at the video at the Smithfield farms. And before we move on to talk about what happened to the piglets that you took from the Smithfield farms, I wanted to ask a question about Smithfield. In Part 1 of our discussion, you explained that it ultimately has been bought by the Chinese government. These are farms. And as President Trump imposes tariffs on China and says he will relieve farmers of the economic strain of these tariffs by paying out $16 billion, does that mean that Smithfield farms, which is owned by the Chinese government, gets also bailed out by President Trump?
WAYNE HSIUNG : It’s one of the perversities of our current political system, that the president, who claims to be fighting on behalf of the American farmers, fails to realize that American farmers pretty much have disappeared from the landscape. The vast majority of our farms are owned by huge agribusiness conglomerates, including agribusiness conglomerates that are run by the Chinese government.
And Smithfield Foods is the best example of this. They have systematically not only kind of denied animal rights, but human rights. They have damaged the environment. They have done all sorts of things that ordinary Americans, including most Trump supporters, would say are just unconscionable. And yet the Trump bailout of the pork industry largely went to companies like Smithfield and other agribusiness conglomerates.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Priya, can you talk about what the difference is—I mean, are there particular kinds of farming of animals—pigs and ducks and so on—that are particularly egregious, particularly guilty of animal cruelty? And also speak specifically about Sonoma County, where a lot of these protests have been taking place.
PRIYA SAWHNEY : So, Sonoma County has multiple farms, hundreds of farms. And the farms that we have been to have, like you said, egregious animal cruelty. And what we’ve seen is that all farms and all slaughterhouses have suffering animals, have animals who are subjected to, you know, criminal animal cruelty. And I’ve seen this with my own eyes at Sunrise Farms, at Petaluma Poultry, chickens who are collapsed, they can’t even stand, and chickens who can’t access food and water. And I’ve been to pig farms, as well, and I’ve seen the conditions that Wayne was talking about at Smithfield.
And, you know, these are standard industry practices that are present at farms across the world, frankly. And these are things that are not only things that you will see at Sonoma County, but in Utah and even farms across the world. Like, in Australia and other countries, we are now seeing activists who are going inside and documenting very similar conditions. And so you can see that these practices exist across the world. And the reason for that is because these animals are seen as property instead of as the individuals that you and I know that they are.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to read a quote from former Assistant U.S. Attorney Bonnie Klapper, who has reviewed Direct Action Everywhere’s undercover footage and veterinarian reports regarding the Reichardt Duck Farm facility in Sonoma County. In a Direct Action Everywhere press release, Klapper says, quote, “The conditions are not normal, accepted industry practice. There is evidence of severe neglect and lack of treatment rising to the level of animal cruelty.” Klapper goes on to say, “When law enforcement has become aware of the existence of animal cruelty, its response has not been to address [it]. To the contrary, the response has been to hunt down and arrest the rescuers and even attempt to return the injured, sick, dying animals to the agricultural facility.” The significance of who she is, Wayne Hsiung?
WAYNE HSIUNG : Yeah. I mean, one of the most shocking things over the past year, Sonoma County continues to escalate its fight and battle against animal rights activists, despite the fact that even former prosecutors, criminal law professors, very distinguished legal intellectuals and folks who really understand the laws of the state of California understand that the criminals here are the factory farms, not the nonviolent activists, who are just trying to get some aid to the animals.
And the reason is quite simple: It’s money in politics, that the supervisors of the board of Sonoma County, the prosecutors and the sheriff in Sonoma County receive donations from a lot of the big factory farms, and therefore they have political connections. They have political influence over the legal system, and ordinary citizen does not. Again, if you or I tortured an individual dog, we would clearly be subject to the criminal laws of the state of California. Yet, when a factory farm does this on massive scale, on a scale a million times larger than an individual person abusing a single animal, it’s seen as industry standard, and therefore completely immune from prosecution.
And worse yet, now, when citizens are exposing, filing complaints and trying to do something, pursuant to the Good Samaritan laws that exist in the state of California, to give the animals aid, they systematically have been rounding people up and using terms like “cut the head off the snake,”“collateral damage”—the terms of a militarized police force, that we’re seeing used not just against, you know, foreign peoples who are being attacked by kind of the American military, but now against our own people, who are engaged in dissenting activities within our own borders.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Wayne, can you talk about where some of these animals from these factory farms are sold? I mean, you, yourself, have been banned from Whole Foods, Whole Foods which was bought by Amazon in 2017. Explain why you were banned and what Whole Foods’ role is in this, what kinds of—which of these animals they’re buying, and the claims they make about the food that they sell, saying that it’s organic or the source is cage-free animals, whereas in fact what you found and exposed is that that’s not the case.
WAYNE HSIUNG : One of the most troubling things about the story that’s unfolding in Sonoma County is, Sonoma County is one of the world’s largest suppliers of organic poultry. Most consumers, when they go and buy a pound of chicken from a Whole Foods or Costco, and they see it marketed as organic or free-range or humane, they’re doing this because they’re compassionate, because they’re trying to do the right thing. And these corporations are twisting and exploiting people’s good and moral sentiments, their praiseworthy sentiments of trying to help animals and the environment, and using that money, using that good sentiment, to inflict even more cruelty to animals and to the environment.
And I think what’s happened is, over the past 10 years, more and more Americans are upset about what happens in factory farms. They understand the environmental damage, the abuse of the animals that’s happening in factory farms. They’re trying to change. They’re demanding change. But instead of actually changing, what factory farms and big food retailers are doing is putting up the appearance of change. And if the government doesn’t hold these corporations accountable, they will continue to do that.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Wayne Hsiung, explain why you were banned from Whole Foods, from all Whole Foods stores across the U.S., and whether other animal rights activists have also been similarly banned.
WAYNE HSIUNG : Whole Foods is one of these companies that has a surprisingly good reputation among environmentalists and folks on the left, yet when you look at kind of the practices of the corporation and the statements by their CEO , you could not be farther from a progressive company than what Whole Foods has done over the past 10 years. This is a company that has systematically deceived the public, greenwashed the meat industry. This is a company that’s systematically deceived consumers who believe they’re supporting animal welfare by buying their meat, their eggs and their milk. Yet, when we actually investigate and look behind closed doors about what’s actually happening to the animals, to the workers, to the planet, at the farms where Whole Foods is supplying its meat products, they’re using exactly the same factory farms as everyone else.
And I think what’s important here is that consumers need to have the right to know. Frankly, citizens need to have the right to know what’s actually happening. In a well-functioning democracy, we can’t actually make good decisions if we don’t have true and accurate information. And this is actually something I heard from Amy just a couple days ago. Democracy is something you have to fight for; it’s not just something you achieve. And for us to achieve democracy, for us to fight for democracy, we have to have good and accurate information. There has to be accountability not just for the little guy, but also for big corporations. And we’re not seeing that right now happening within the agricultural industry.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : But explain why Whole Foods has banned you from entering any of its stores across the U.S.
WAYNE HSIUNG : What we’ve done over the past 10 years is try to point out what we call the humane lie, that in so many occasions when you see a product that’s being marketed as free-range, humane, grass-fed, it’s actually from just a traditional factory farm. And what we’ve done is we tried to point out to the company—we’ve gone to the CEO , we’ve gone to upper management, we’ve gone to the stores—to try and point out to consumers and the company that there are systematic fraudulent practices happening in their marketing of meat products.
But instead of responding and starting a dialogue about our findings, which have been reported on in The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , The Washington Post , biggest newspapers in the world—law professors and investigators have looked at our documents and our evidence, and basically said this is legitimate stuff—but instead of responding and starting a dialogue, the company has tried to crush us. They’ve sued us. They’ve prosecuted us. They’ve basically done everything they can to destroy this movement, that is just trying to point out the company’s violations of its own standards and values. So, I’m hopeful that as we get more media coverage and as more people learn what’s actually happening in these suppliers, that the company will eventually sit down and talk to us. But sometimes corporate power is not that willing to respond to criticism. This might be one of those cases.
AMY GOODMAN : Priya Sawhney, can you talk about the workers in these plants? Whether we’re talking about Smithfield in Utah or the plants in Petaluma, in Sonoma, who is working in these plants? How are they treated?
PRIYA SAWHNEY : Yeah. So, the workers in these facilities we’ve seen are usually workers who are paid minimum wage. They have no other options of getting jobs anywhere else. And one of the reasons we go to these facilities, that we go to these farms and these slaughterhouses, is not only to expose violence against nonhuman animals, against these pigs and cows and chickens, but also to expose what these workers are subjected to. And, you know, on Monday’s action, we saw that one of our activists was basically trapped in the slaughterhouse machinery, but that’s not something that’s uncommon for workers to face on a daily basis. And there are stories of workers getting trapped and killed in machineries, getting severely injured.
And the reason that we protest these facilities, whether it’s duck farms or Smithfield farms or any of these slaughterhouses that exist on this planet, is because no one deserves to be killed inside of a slaughterhouse, but also these places don’t need to exist. No one should have to earn a living where they have to slit someone’s throat and be subjected to, you know, so much violence. And we know that these workers do, themselves, suffer severe trauma from having to work in these conditions, these facilities. And I personally have spoken to slaughterhouse workers. Wayne has talked to people who have worked in farms. And we know that if they—that most of these people, if they had a choice to do something else, that they would take it. And that’s why we target the entire industry of animal agriculture, as opposed to these workers, who we know don’t—in many cases, don’t have any other options but to be working a minimum-wage job inside of a slaughterhouse killing 2,000 animals every single day.
AMY GOODMAN : And, Wayne Hsiung, the issue of undocumented immigrants who are working in these plants and also whistleblowers within the plants?
WAYNE HSIUNG : Yeah, the irony is, some of the whistleblowers I’ve met, at companies like Petaluma Poultry and Reichardt Duck Farm, have actually been in jail with me. You know, so many of these folks are folks who have no privilege whatsoever, have had no educational or economic opportunities in their lives. They’re undocumented, so maybe they can’t get a job anywhere else. And when they try and unionize and fight back for themselves, frankly, not just for the animals, they’re viciously crushed, as well. Smithfield, Reichardt Duck Farm, Petaluma Poultry, all of them have faced class-action litigation regarding the abuse of workers and their efforts to try and prevent these workers from unionizing.
And there’s a clear connection between the abuse of the animals and the workers. In both these cases, they’re treating living creatures, living beings, as mere commodities. They don’t see these individuals, whether it’s the workers or animals, as living creatures who deserve respect and have some intrinsic value. And it’s just part of the industry. If you are systematically torturing and abusing billions of animals, if you’re systematically ignoring the cries of animals who are screaming out in agony as their bodies are being torn to pieces, when your workers complain, you’re probably not going to be too concerned, either.
AMY GOODMAN : Priya Sawhney, something I don’t think people understand around the United States are what are called ag-gag laws. Can you explain what they are and what that means?
PRIYA SAWHNEY : Ag-gag laws are laws that prevent ordinary people, and especially activists, from going and even documenting or taking a photograph in these farms, in these slaughterhouses. And the reason that these ag-gag laws exist is not to protect animals, not to protect anyone but the industry and their profits. And the reason that we at DxE challenge these industries and challenge the—go to these facilities is because we want to challenge these unconstitutional laws, which are preventing ordinary people, preventing the public, from knowing what’s happening inside of these facilities, which means that people don’t know how animals are being raised for the food that they’re consuming on a daily basis, and, more importantly, how animals are treated, so that companies like Whole Foods and these other—and Smithfield can lie about their practices. Meanwhile, consumers think that they’re consuming so-called humane products.
AMY GOODMAN : So, Wayne Hsiung, if you can specifically say, what do the laws say?
WAYNE HSIUNG : Well, the laws against cruelty very clearly indicate you cannot subject an animal to unnecessary suffering. Yet the ag-gag laws, when you point out that a factory farm is subjecting an animal to unnecessary suffering, can put you in prison for merely taking a photograph, for exposing the animal cruelty that’s happening inside these facilities. And in Utah and North Carolina, where I’m being prosecuted, animal rights cruelty investigations basically stopped when the ag-gag laws started being passed, because the animal rights movement is not a movement that has decades of sophistication and the ability to kind of withstand repression the way the civil rights movement and the antiwar movement developed a repertoire of contention and the ability to understand the political dynamics of powerful institutions trying to crush nonviolent movements.
But we’re seeing a newfound sophistication developing in the animal rights movement, where people are learning from the climate movement, they’re learning from the civil rights movement, about how dangerous it is to challenge power. And the ag-gag laws are a great example of this, where, a decade ago, when these laws first started getting passed, investigations basically stopped, but now, 10 years later, frankly, many activists are particularly excited to go the states and the counties where ag-gag laws have been passed, because we want to bring this fight into court.
AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Priya, in 2008, nearly two-thirds of California voters approved Proposition 2, known as the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, which expands the minimum size for confinement pens used by factory farms to hold calves raised for veal, egg-laying hens and pregnant pigs. Is this law going far enough?
PRIYA SAWHNEY : Well, we know that one of the things that Prop 2 has done is shown, you know, residents of California, but also people across the world, that everyone—that citizens really care about what’s happening to animals. But what it’s not doing is showing people that there’s so much more suffering happening inside of these farms. And even, you know, we’ve investigated farms that have committed to getting rid of gestation crates, getting rid of battery cages, and we’ve seen, time and time again, that the farms themselves don’t comply with these practices, which goes to show that they don’t really care about these animals, and they also don’t care about the laws, and they don’t care about what the citizens want, and which is very clear. People in California don’t want to see animals being hurt. And despite that fact, we still see that farms, some of these farms across the world—across the state, are still confining animals in crates, in battery cages.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to thank you both very much for being with us, Priya Sawhney and Wayne Hsiung, co-founders of Direct Action Everywhere, or DxE. They both face prison time, years in prison, for their animal rights activism.

WaPo: WH Barred Science-Based Climate Change Testimony,www.democracynow.org,,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/10/headlines/wapo_wh_barred_science_based_climate_change_testimony,"WaPo: WH Barred Science-Based Climate Change Testimony Headline Jun 10, 2019
The Washington Post is reporting that the White House barred a senior State Department intelligence analyst from issuing a testimony describing climate change as “possibly catastrophic” to the House Intelligence Committee. The White House objected to references to the science around man-made climate change. Rod Schoonover was permitted to appear before the House panel, but his written testimony was blocked from being entered into official record. His testimony read, “Absent extensive mitigating factors or events, we see few plausible future scenarios where significant—possibly catastrophic—harm does not arise from the compounded effects of climate change.”
One of those who objected was National Security Council official William Happer, an architect of the Trump administration’s climate policy and a known climate science denier who once compared the fight against climate change to the Holocaust. He reportedly said that the report includes “climate alarm propaganda” and that the phrase “tipping points” is “a propaganda slogan for the scientifically illiterate.” Topics: Congress The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We end today’s show in Australia, where press freedom groups are sounding the alarm over a pair of police raids on journalists. On Wednesday last week, Australian Federal Police swept into the headquarters of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Sydney, reviewing thousands of documents for information about a 2017 report that found Australian special forces may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan. ABC Executive Editor John Lyons spoke on his own network just minutes after police served a warrant naming a news director and the two reporters who broke the story.
JOHN LYONS : They have downloaded 9,214 documents. I counted them. And they are now going through them. They’ve set up a huge screen, and they’re going through, email by email. It’s quite extraordinary. And I feel—as a journalist, I feel it’s a real violation, because these are emails between this particular journalist and his boss, her boss, its drafts, its scripts of stories. I’ve never seen an assault on the media as savage as this one we’re seeing today at the ABC . … And the chilling message is not so much for the journalists, but it’s also for the public.
AMY GOODMAN : Wednesday’s raid on ABC—that’s, again, Australian Broadcasting Corporation—came one day after police in Melbourne, Australia, raided the home of Annika Smethurst, a reporter with the Herald Sun newspaper. Police served a warrant related to Smethurst’s reporting on a secret effort by an Australian intelligence service to expand its surveillance capabilities, including against Australian nationals. Australia’s acting Federal Police Commissioner Neil Gaughan defended the raids, saying journalists could face prison time for holding classified information.
COMMISSIONER NEIL GAUGHAN : No sector of the community should be immune for this type of activity or evidence collection, more broadly. This includes law enforcement itself, the media or, indeed, even politicians.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, for more, we’re joined by two guests in Australia. With us from Brisbane is Peter Greste. He is the UNESCO chair in journalism and communications at University of Queensland. He’s founding director of Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom. He was imprisoned for over a year, for 400 days, in 2013 to '14, while covering the political crisis in Egypt. And joining us from Perth, Australia, Joseph Fernandez is with us, a media law academic at Curtin University, Australia's correspondent for Reporters Without Borders.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Joseph Fernandez, let’s begin with you. Lay out exactly what happened and when it took place, all the details as you know them, both the raiding of ABC and the journalist’s home.
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : Thank you for having me on your show. The two raids happened within 48 hours of each other. It began with a raid on Annika Smethurst’s home. You have introduced her. At her home, the Australian Federal Police spent seven-and-a-half hours going through every nook and cranny of her belongings, including the rubbish bin outside the house. And they sought to access her email messages, phone messages and anything they could lay their hands on, including what she might have kept away in her undies drawer. Annika obviously was very traumatized by this, but she has held her head up high, in the knowledge that the story about which she was being investigated was really something very arguably and very strongly in the public interest or of legitimate public concern.
The second raid, the following day—
AMY GOODMAN : And that story was?
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : Sorry. Can you say that again, please?
AMY GOODMAN : And that story was, Joseph?
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : The story was that there was a discussion, a discussion about a plan to expand state surveillance, that would have possibly included surveillance of ordinary citizens. And this was quite an unprecedented idea. And the objective of such a plan was obviously going to be justified on the premise of protecting national security.
The second raid happened at the headquarters of the national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in Sydney. And police officers entered the premises armed with a warrant with an exhaustive inventory of things that they were looking for. And as you have noted, they scoured hundreds and thousands of documents and materials, and left with a small collection of materials in a sealed package, with the agreement not to use them until a possible challenge is considered in the days ahead.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Joseph Fernandez, these raids coming within a day of each other, was there any coordination, or were these related in any way?
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : That’s an interesting question. One of the first questions that sprung into people’s minds was whether they were related, whether this was instigated by the government. The prime minister quickly moved to distance himself and his government from the raids, claiming that the two agencies and the police were acting entirely of their own accord. And the police themselves are on record as saying that the two events are unrelated. And so, it’s left to be seen, you know, whether new light will be shed on the real circumstances that led to these raids. It’s quite hard to accept, without inquiry as to whether there was absolutely no notice given, whether informally or formally, to the bosses in government.
AMY GOODMAN : And for people to understand, I mean, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is the leading broadcaster throughout the entire country of Australia. I wanted to bring Peter Greste into this conversation. We had you here in our studio after you were imprisoned for well over for year by Egypt with your two Al Jazeera colleagues. You were working with Al Jazeera at the time. You certainly knew what it meant to be arrested, to not have rights, not to be even told at the beginning why the Egyptian authorities were holding you. Now you see the situation in Australia. And I was wondering if you can talk about the laws around press freedom, if you have them in Australia. Amazingly, in this warrant, the warrant gave the police wide-ranging authority to view, seize, edit and destroy virtually any document it saw fit.
PETER GRESTE : Yeah, that’s right. Look, there are a whole host of questions in there, Amy, but let me deal with the very beginning of it, and that’s the way I felt when I heard about the news, because it did—I mean, even now I can feel my skin pricking up, thinking about the raids and what that would have felt like, because I know exactly what it was like to have agents burst into your room looking for evidence, and all of the confusion that surrounds that, the outrage that surrounds that. But I never really honestly expected to see it take place here in Australia. And it seems to me that even though I’m not suggesting Australia is about to become an authoritarian state like Egypt anytime soon, I think that we are being pushed in the same direction by the same kind of imperatives around national security, the prioritizing of national security over the human rights and democratic rights of citizens, largely because it’s much easier to make the political case for national security legislation, particularly when you see attacks in the streets and the consequences of that, but much harder to make the more abstract case for human rights and citizens’ rights, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and so on, until you see what that means in practical terms. And that’s what we saw last week with these two raids. I think it’s very, very concerning to me, and I’m deeply worried.
Now, as you mentioned, we don’t have in Australia any explicit protection for press freedom written into the law, nothing about freedom of speech. Australia has no bill of rights. All we have is an implied right of political communications, that the High Court decided that was there as a function of our democracy. They said that we live in a representative democracy, and you can’t have an effective representative democracy without political communication, therefore, that right is somehow inferred in the Constitution.
But without anything like the First Amendment in the United States here in Australia, without any explicit protection for press freedom, what we’re seeing is a lot of scope for our legislators to draft laws that really intrude on press freedom in all sorts of deeply troubling ways that make it much harder for journalists to protect their sources, make it much harder even for journalists to contact sources within government. And so, what we’re seeing is a vast web of interconnected national security laws that, in all sorts of ways, make these kinds of raids that we saw last week possible.
I’m not so critical of the Federal Police for carrying out the raids. I accept that they were probably doing their jobs. And as we’ve been hearing, there may well have been some kind of political involvement in there. But let’s take what the Federal Police have been saying at face value, that there was nothing political. If there was nothing political, if they were simply fulfilling their duties under the law, then, clearly, the law needs to change. And that’s what we need to start talking about.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Peter Greste, we have about a minute left, but I wanted to ask you, in terms of—who determines the violations of state secrets? Is there one centralized agency, or can various federal agencies decide to conduct these kinds of raids in Australia?
PETER GRESTE : No. Look, it’s quite difficult to know quite how the laws come into effect or come into force. I mean, let’s take a look at the data retention laws, the metadata. In any number of more than 20 agencies, government agencies can look into any Australian’s metadata without a warrant. Now, they need to apply for a special journalist warrant if they want to investigate journalists’ metadata in a search for sources, but, otherwise, there is no—there is no warrant system. They can look anywhere, anywhere that they want.
And I think that’s the kind of scope that we’re talking about. That’s overreach. You talk to any lawyer, any civil rights activist, anyone who knows about the way the law operates, and they’ll acknowledge that that’s overreach. And we need to really start a vigorous conversation within this country about the limits of state power and the kind of ways that we need to encourage and support press freedom, and also the protection of whistleblowers, because, ultimately, these raids were in the hunt for the sources of these stories, for the journalists’ sources, for the whistleblowers that felt that these stories needed to be told.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we have to wrap up right now, but we want to continue the vigorous discussion, and we’re going to bring folks Part 2 at democracynow.org under web exclusives. Peter Greste, we want to thank you and ask you to stay for that Part 2 discussion, UNESCO chair in journalism and communications, University of Queensland, founding director of the Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom, imprisoned for more than 400 days. Also, Joseph Fernandez, a media law academic at Curtin University, Australia’s correspondent for Reporters Without Borders. Stay with us. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

AMY GOODMAN : Here on Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report , I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González. Jay Inslee is our guest, the governor of Washington, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. Juan?
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted ask you about refugees. We’re seeing many people coming up from Central America. Some people believe many of them are climate refugees, as well, but also fleeing gang violence and deep poverty there. You were one of the leaders among governors, obviously, in opposing President Trump’s efforts to not only have the Muslim ban, but also on immigration issues. Talk about what you’ve been doing in Washington.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Well, we’ve been standing up to Donald Trump. I’ve now sued him and defeated him 21 times in a row, with Bob Ferguson, our excellent attorney general, at the helm. We need to stand up for democracy, in all its measures and value system. Your logo has a Statue of Liberty on it. And I believe the light from that statue should continue to shine across the United States. It is an ancient thing, light, we should guard jealously. And I did that, and I’m proud I was the first governor to stand up against his Muslim ban. I was also the first person to say we should accept Syrian refugees, even before, I think, that that issue came up.
And the reason is, is that this is not only a matter of compassion of the United States. We are a compassionate nation, taking in the refugees and those, you know, fleeing, the huddled masses yearning to be free. This is something that’s deeply ingrained in our hearts in the United States. But it is also an economic development issue. Look, we’ve grown our economy because we have geniuses who have come from nowhere and now created businesses in my state. The DREAMers who are in my state are some of the most ambitious, creative, going to be productive businesspeople and doctors. That’s why I’m proud of being the first governor to make sure the DREAMers get access to college education. So, I believe that the current situation is unfortunate—
AMY GOODMAN : What about what Governor Newsom is doing? It looks like he’s about to sign this bill that will increase the access of undocumented immigrants between the ages of 19 and 25, something like that—around 90,000 of them will get healthcare.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : So, we are taking steps in that direction. We started with our youthful folks in that situation, and we make sure that we have ERs open to them. But first they have to have access to not be put in cells and have the children separated from parents, like Donald Trump is doing.
And as you indicated, what is so maddening about this is that the president refuses to go to the source of this problem, which many of these people are climate refugees today because they simply can’t be subsistence farmers. Because the climate has changed so much, you can’t grow crops, particularly at higher elevations in Central America. So they’re starving to death. And the president refuses to recognize the reality of climate change. He’s going to allow it to become worse, because he just doesn’t give a hang or is too scientifically illiterate. Each are fatal.
Now, secondarily, it makes sense for us to make investments there, so we don’t have to make them on the border, to try to improve the economies of those regions, so people can stay in the place of their homeland. And those are smart investments to make. But instead, he wants bumper stickers and confrontation. There’s a better way.
AMY GOODMAN : Would you call President Trump a racist for his Muslim ban, the one that you were the first governor to challenge?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : You know, it’s painful to think in those terms, but I don’t know what other conclusion you can make, and I made it a long time ago. You need to understand the depths of depravity of this individual. This is a person whose entire political existence he owes to a racial lie, when he said that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. That is the entire way he developed a base in the Republican Party. That lie is the only reason he has a political existence. So I don’t know what other word you can attach, because he has followed this up every day trying to divide the United States, continuing to pull out his dog whistle out of the Oval Office closet and blow it every single day. So, it’s painful to say that, but I just have to reach that conclusion.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: You mentioned former President Obama. I wanted to ask you a question on healthcare. Your campaign has said you’re the only person running for president who both voted for Obamacare and then implemented it in your state. Could you talk about what you did there—
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Yeah.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: —and the whole issue? Because, obviously, President Trump has never ceased wanting to dismantle Obamacare.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Right. Well, I think this points out to something that—I’ve been a member of the U.S. Congress for 15, 16 years. I was very active trying to get the healthcare bill passed. We were successful. But we’ve also implemented it. And governing means both passing bills and implementing them. And we’ve been very successful in our implementation of Obamacare since I’ve been governor. We have 800,000 people with insurance. And importantly, we’ve been able to keep a lid on costs in healthcare. And now I have passed the first public option in the United States. So I’m the only candidate who has actually passed a state-sanctioned plan for healthcare in their state. We’ve also passed the first long-term elder care program in the United States. And with our increasing retirements and the dementia crisis, this is extremely important.
So, the implementation that I have put forward, I think, has been very, very successful. And it’s one of the themes, frankly, of my candidacy, that the things I’ve done as a governor, I think, is a template for success in the United States—the highest minimum wage, the best paid family leave. We’re very radical in Washington. We think women should be paid the same as men, so we have the best gender pay equity in the country. I’ve got the biggest teacher compensation increase in the United States. We were the first—I was the first governor to pass a net neutrality bill. The point I’m making is that governing is important, in addition to just passing legislation; I think it would suit me well in the position in the White House.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: You also have some very big companies, obviously, in Washington—Amazon, Microsoft—
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Indeed.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: —Boeing. One of them I wanted to ask you about was Boeing, that, back in 2013, you and the Legislature passed a series of tax incentives for Boeing that were some of the—tax breaks that were some of the biggest of any state has ever given a company, about $8.7 billion. And yet Boeing continued to lay off workers rather than expand the workforce. Have you looked back on that and thought about those tax breaks and whether they were a judicious use of state power?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : No, I think we need federal legislation to protect states from what happened to my state, where a large corporation sort of held a gun to our ribs and said, “We’re going to move 20,000 jobs elsewhere, if we do not continue the tax treatment.” Now, essentially, this was just a continuation of the existing tax treatment they had. I don’t think states should be able to be leveraged in that manner. And we can’t allow these corporations to continue to play one state off against another to try to leverage those tax breaks. So, no, I’m not comfortable that that happened. We need protection against that. And I think there are some things we can do in the tax code to protect states from being subjected to that sort of being victimized, in my view. So I hope to get that done.
AMY GOODMAN : Are you sorry you did that? Would you do it again? I mean, you’ve come to New York, where people drove Amazon out—
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Right.
AMY GOODMAN : —of Long Island City—
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Right, right.
AMY GOODMAN : —just enraged at the tax breaks that they were giving this company.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Right. Well, I have to say that I am pleased that there’s about 20,000 people that would not be working in the state of Washington in the aerospace industry had we not done that. So, my job is to keep those people working, and we did it for those families. But as I’ve said, we should push back against this corporate behavior that does that.
Now, not all corporations do this. Look, Salesforce just acquired Tableau in Seattle. This is a corporation that cares for its people, gets paid compensation, worries about the homelessness. Not every corporation behaves this way. This one did.
AMY GOODMAN : Your thoughts on democratic socialism?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : I think that—well, I’m a proud progressive. My progressive record is unmatched. We’ve talked about the Muslim ban and gender pay equity. I’ve passed one of the best reproductive parity bills. By the way, this is important. It’s not just a matter of a woman having the right of choice academically; they have to be able have healthcare. And we’ve passed a Reproductive Parity Act to make sure women have access to healthcare through their insurance policies. So, I’ve been a very stalwart progressive, and I’m a Democrat. That’s how I label myself. And I think those are things that are going to win.
And we have to realize that we need to be vigorous in defending those values. Look, I heard the vice president today saying, well, he’s just going to sort of sit down with Mitch McConnell and iron these things out. Look, the party—the party that tried to destroy Obamacare and cripple the Obama administration and stole the Supreme Court decision is not going to be solved over a cup of tea. You know, you can’t expect the Toronto Raptors to root for the Warriors in the next game of the NBA Finals. And we have to have a hardheaded realization that we’ve got to stand up for these values. And I’m very capable of doing that. I’ve had some bipartisan successes. I got the biggest educational benefit, biggest transportation package, best family leave, while I had a Republican Senate. But you’ve got to be able to stand for your values, and I’ve been doing that for about 25 years.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I want to ask you about another issue on which you have evolved over the years: capital punishment. You were once in favor of it, but then you placed a moratorium on the use of capital punishment in 2014, and the death penalty has since been abolished in your state. Can you talk about the evolution of yourself on this issue?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Yeah. I think that what I’ve seen is an increasing awareness of the racial disparity in our criminal justice system. And that is one of the reasons I eliminated the death penalty, put a moratorium on the death penalty by executive order. And so, what I’ve seen is—and it’s one of the reasons I’ve offered pardons to thousands of people who had marijuana convictions. We have now legalized marijuana. But we’ve seen the racial disparity that has come from the drug war. And we need to root that out. It’s one of the reasons that we passed the best police accountability laws that hold police accountable when there’s undue violence. That’s one of the reasons why we now are doing something that I’m really proud of, which is diverting juveniles into the school system, out of the criminal justice system. We’ve got way too many black young men who are shunted into the criminal justice system at age of 14, 15, 16, that we want in the educational system, that might need some mental health issues, as well.
So, these are a host of things we’re doing to try to right the racial disparity that has been so prevalent in our society. We’ve also now just embraced affirmative action for the first time. And I was very vocal in favor of the restoration of affirmative action in our state, so that we can right the shadow that has inflicted this country of racial disparities in so many contexts. So, we’re moving forward, and I’m glad we’re doing so.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: So, how do you hope to break out of the pack here? We’ve got about two dozen candidates, and they’re being essentially divided into anyone who gets 2% or more in the polls versus everyone else. How do you hope to—
AMY GOODMAN : You’ve made it into the first debate.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Yeah, we’re in the first debate. We’ll be in the first—we’ll be in the first debate. Well, look, there’s two things I can offer to people. And the first one—look, I’ve got to tell you why I’m running for president. That might be relevant to this discussion. I really love being governor. I’ve been extremely successful. We’ve got the best economy. We’ve created the best economy in the United States. It’s going to be a good argument to defeat Donald Trump, when I tell him, “You know who’s got the best economy? You know who needs—knows how to build an economy? I’ve done it.”
But I just decided I wanted to be able to look at my grandkids on my final day and say I did everything I could to defeat climate change. So this is a personal obligation, in some part, and I want to do that for all the children and grandkids of the nation. So what I’m offering to people is a unique commitment to say that if I’m elected president, I will make defeating climate change the number one priority of the United States. And I profoundly believe that level of commitment is necessary to this job, because if it is not job one, it will not get done. The political capital that is necessary to totally mobilize the United States economy requires a president with that level of commitment. And I’m the only candidate who’s made that commitment, because I know it’s necessary.
And I have a plan to accomplish it. I have the experience, that is unmatched by anybody in the field. And secondly, I have an experience level of all the things I’ve got done, some of which we’ve talked about today, of accomplishment in the state of Washington. So, those are two things, and I hope people take a look at them.
AMY GOODMAN : The U.S. military is the largest consumer of oil in the world.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : How do you take on the military-industrial complex, or do you see that as something that you feel you should be doing? And your stance in foreign policy, in the wars, in the longest war the U.S. has ever engaged in, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : I was one of the most vocal critics of the Iraq War and the Bush administration, and I fought long and hard against that war. And I would continue the principled position that we need alliances rather than making continued mistakes of thinking we can revamp whole countries and cultures in our own image in a short period of time. So, I think I’ve gotten experience to show I’ve been able to stand up against when the war drums are beating.
And as far as the U.S. military in regard to climate change, I believe that they can be actually a very positive way to help drive new technologies that are not dependent on oil and gas and diesel and coal. We’ve started that in my state, where we use our procurement power to drive new technologies. I’m the first governor to make sure half the cars we buy in the state, for the state government, are fully electric. And that’s really working really well. We can do the same kind of thing with the United States military. We’ve started that a little bit with the Green Fleet, to use biofuels in some of the ships. We can do the same in aerospace, where we now are developing biofuels that can be really low-carbon to fly our jets. And we’ve already done that. So we need to make it a positive player, because it is an 800-pound gorilla throughout the supply change—chains. And I’m convinced we can make it positive.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, Governor Inslee, we want to thank you for being with us. Jay Inslee, governor of Washington, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.
When we come back, we go to Australia, to Brisbane and Perth, where press freedom groups are sounding the alarm after police raided the headquarters of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, after the network revealed Australian special forces may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan. Stay with us.

"""We Are Facing an Existential Crisis"": Gov. Inslee Slams DNC for Refusing to Hold Climate Debate",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/11/we_are_facing_an_existential_crisis,"governor of Washington and Democratic presidential candidate. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: The Democratic National Committee is facing criticism after the committee rejected calls for the party to host a debate solely focused on the climate crisis. The DNC is also threatening to blacklist any candidate who takes part in a non- DNC debate on the issue. DNC Chair Tom Perez recently told climate activists that it is not practical to hold debates on specific issues. Washington Governor Jay Inslee was the first Democratic presidential candidate to call for a climate-focused debate. Last week, he accused the DNC of attempting to silence the voices of those who want to debate what he described as the, quote, “existential crisis of our time.”
AMY GOODMAN : USA Today reports a number of other Democratic candidates have since backed the call, including former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke, former Obama Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand and Michael Bennet. Meanwhile, more than 50 voting members of the Democratic National Committee have submitted a resolution supporting a climate debate.
Well, we’re joined right now by the man who called for this debate: Democratic presidential candidate, Washington Governor Jay Inslee. He launched his presidential campaign in March with a pledge to make defeating climate change his number one priority. Governor Inslee has also vowed to allow in a record number of refugees and to end President Trump’s Muslim travel ban. In 2017, Washington became the first state to file a lawsuit to challenge Trump’s initial travel ban.
Governor Inslee, welcome to Democracy Now!
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Thank you. Thanks for bringing a little democracy.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, it’s great to have you with us. So, your response to the DNC not only saying they will not hold a climate debate, but they will ban any presidential candidate from official debates if you engage in a nonofficial debate on this?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Sounds a little unusual in a democracy, doesn’t it? And it is. Look, our party has to carry the torch of defeating climate change, and so far I’ve been carrying that torch amongst the candidates. And the reason is that this is our last chance to defeat climate change. It is an urgent matter. We will not have another chance after the next administration. We will either act now, or it will be cataclysm in our nation. And there is only one party that’s going to offer a solution to that, and our party needs to pick the right nominee who has the full vision and the full experience and the full plan to defeat climate change.
And the people need to see the candidates put forward their visions and plans. And if we don’t have a full debate on this, that’s going to be impossible. Look, you can’t say to a candidate, “How are you going to, you know, save the planet and totally mobilize the United States economy? And you have 60 seconds.” It’s just not adequate to the task. And that’s why people—I welcome people all over the country. Nine state chairs now are going to bring a resolution to require this debate. There’s about 50 members of the national committee, and thousands, literally tens of thousands, are bombarding the committee to have this debate.
Now, the additional outrage is to try to stifle and blacklist those who want to have the debate, to say you can’t have the debate in a different forum. That is not exactly democracy, with either a small or capital D, and that needs to change, as well. And so, I appreciate everyone telling the committee that we need to have this debate. It is the existential crisis. Now, I’ve got the experience and plan that will probably do pretty well on that debate stage, but it’s not about me. It’s about the people having access to make the right decision here.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, since you don’t have to speak only in soundbites here, we would like you to expound on why you think, first of all, that climate change is the central issue of our time and some of the specifics about what your plan would do.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Well, I think this is a particularly special moment. It’s a moment of tremendous urgency, but it is also a moment of tremendous promise economically to be able to build a clean energy economy. And the moment of urgency is something I’ve experienced, in some sense, firsthand.
I was in Davenport, Iowa, a couple weeks ago and met a woman who had built a nonprofit that took care of single mothers and victims of domestic violence. She served about 1,500 people a year, women a year. Then the flood comes over the dike, destroys her nonprofit. She loses everything. Her nonprofit is now out of business, and you have 1,500 women left high and dry, so to speak. And when you watch that person crying about the loss of her vision and dream, you know that we’ve got to do something about climate change.
It’s Marcia Moss [ phon. ], a woman I met in Seminole Springs, whose mobile home was just a pile of aluminum, melted aluminum. This is an absolute trail of destruction across our country right now. And so, when Donald Trump says this is a Chinese hoax, no, these are real tears, and we have to prevent them.
On the upside, though, this is a tremendous promise of economic growth. Look, clean energy jobs today are growing twice as fast as the United States economy. We simply need an ignition, a spark, for this clean energy revolution to mobilize the United States around this mission statement. And I’ve seen that. I saw that with Kennedy in my youth, what a spark of inspiration can do. And I believe if we have that from the White House, we can mobilize this nation and build a clean energy economy. And it’s going to work. You know, Donald Trump says wind turbines cause cancer. We know they cause jobs. And I was just in Iowa the other day at the Des Moines Area Community College, talked to a young man named Dave, who was—I asked him: Why is he taking this wind turbine technician class? He says, “Well, it’s not exactly rocket science. These are the jobs of the future.” We need a president who actually understands that.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But what are some of the key pillars of what your plan would do in terms of combating climate change?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Number one, we have to get off coal. And this is just a certainty. And that is something you just have to do in the next decade. So, my plan, which is unique amongst all the candidates, would essentially eliminate coal-based electricity beginning 10 years from now. And that is a hard cap. It is a legally enforceable cap. It’s not a suggestion to the utilities; it is a requirement.
Second, we need to go to a fossil-free electrical grid by the middle of the next decade. And that’s necessary according to the science. And again, this would be a legally binding requirement on the utilities. And that’s necessary according to the science. You know, and one of the issues here is, you know, you can negotiate with Republicans, sometimes you can negotiate with your spouse; you cannot negotiate with physics or chemistry. We have to accomplish these goals.
Then, I would also—in the transportation sector, we have to have cars and buses that run on something other than gas and diesel in the next decade. That needs to be a requirement, as well. So, those are sort of three pillars, together with an investment strategy of about $300 billion a year, that’s going to create 8 million jobs. And these are good union jobs, by the way. We want to increase wages at the same time.
AMY GOODMAN : I’m wondering if part of the reason that the Democratic National Committee came down so hard against your call for a climate debate is the kinds of issues it might raise. You were one of the first Democratic presidential candidates to sign a pledge to refuse any financial contributions from the fossil fuel interests. And this became a major issue with the Green New Deal, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said any congressmember who sat on a committee dealing with that should refuse fossil fuel money.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
AMY GOODMAN : Do you think they just don’t want that exposed and are concerned that their candidate may accept money from the fossil fuel industry?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : I don’t know the answer, but I do know that I’m refusing to accept that money and was the first to sign that pledge. I know that when they say it’s not practical to have a debate, I’ll tell you what’s not practical. What’s not practical is having your home underwater repeatedly because of the floods that are happening now repeatedly. I met people who have been flooded three times this year in the Midwest. It’s not practical to see a town of 25,000 burn down. And this is something that demands that we demand the candidates to all step forward and put their cards on the table, show what their plans are, show what their experience is. And I think that America and our party deserves that.
AMY GOODMAN : How does Green New Deal differ from your plan, called the Evergreen Economy Plan?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : They largely have the same goals. And I’m so appreciative of AOC and Ed Markey and the others who have now raised climate change in the profile. They’ve brought communities of color and poverty into the tent, and I think it’s been a really beneficial thing.
What I’ve done is I’ve added policy to assist that goal. And I kind of liken it—if you think of the Green New Deal as sort of Kennedy said we’re going to the moon, well, my plan designs the rocket ship. And it’s about 80 or 90 pages of policies that actually make this thing sing. And I think if people look at it, they’ll be quite impressed, as was Greenpeace, that ranked mine as the best, and AOC called it the gold standard, and Climate Advisers said it was the most robust plan.
So, by all accounts, I’m very proud of what we’ve proposed, because it’s got meat on the bone, and it’s got teeth. Look, you can’t go into this—you can’t solve climate change with a bumper sticker. You’ve got to have teeth to force these corporations to do the right thing. And that’s one of the reasons why we’re going to take away the $27 billion of subsidies that are now going to the oil and gas industry, that need to go into clean energy.
AMY GOODMAN : Explain what that is. Most people are not aware of these subsidies.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Well, the oil and gas and coal industry have gigantic—this is $27 billion a year in tax subsidies, with dozens of little loopholes that they can walk through that no other industry has. They get below-market rates, royalties, if you will, when they take—when they mine fossil fuels off of our public lands. And the whole tax code is sort of set up as a giveaway, a slot machine for the fossil fuel industry. We need to reel those back and put investments into clean energy. There’s absolutely no reason to continue to subsidize really a mature industry in this regard.
Now, in this transition, we’ve got to take care of people and families who have been in these industries, as well. People who work in the coal mines are dedicated, hard-working people. They’ve built this country. And that’s why we need to embrace—what I’ve done is a transition plan to have a just transition for their families and their communities, as well as the communities of poverty who have been so often the first victims, the frontline communities of the climate change beast.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Governor, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your own record as governor on the issue of emissions. Between 2012 and 2015, Washington’s own emissions reportedly increased by about 6%. And you took office as governor in 2013. Why were you not able to, as governor in the state, lower emissions in your own state during that period?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Well, I’ve only been able to implement a very small part of my agenda in the first four years. I had a Republican Senate. And unfortunately, my Republican Senate was in the same climate denial mode as the president. So I was unable to pass legislation for the first four years.
But we have now passed the best—probably the best suite of laws in the United States. I’ve passed the best 100% law, that requires 100% of our electricity to come from clean sources, non-fossil fuel sources. It is also the best because it embraces environmental justice in that plan, so that everyone can move forward, and we increase incomes, and we help people in poverty at the same time. It is also the best plan because, for the first time, it requires retrofitting of commercial buildings so we can reduce waste. It is the best because we have a good incentive package to help people get access to electric cars. It’s the best because we’ve joined other states in banning super pollutants.
So what we’ve done is we now—in the last three months, I’ve signed a suite of bills that’s going to get us about 80% to where we need to go of the goals we really need to get to. It’s amazing what democracy can do, as it did in the last election, which gave me one more senator so I can actually pass these laws. But we will not be done after this. We have to do more in my state. We have to do more around the world. We have to be more challenging of all of us.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And when you speak of non-fossil fuels, do you also see a need to expand nuclear power as a means of dealing with climate change or not?
GOV . JAY INSLEE : That remains to be seen, because I believe we have to look at every low- and zero-carbon emissions technologies to see if they’re possible. Nuclear, in order to become part of the portfolio, would have to solve four things it has not solved yet. It would have to become much more cost-effective. It’s just way too expensive right now. It would have to have a passively safe system. It would have to solve the waste stream issue. And it would have to build public acceptance. Those do not exist right now. But I do believe it makes sense for us to do the research and development to find out if some of these new approaches might be safe, cost-effective, and have public acceptance and no waste. That is worth doing, given the emergent nature of this problem, in my view.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about your evolution around climate, coming to think of it as the critical issue of our day? You supported, until last month, the construction of two natural gas projects in western Washington, opposed by many climate activists, but then you reversed your position on that. Talk about why and what these projects involved.
GOV . JAY INSLEE : Well, I’ve been working on this for a long time. I actually ran for Congress in 1992 saying we had to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. I co-authored a book about this in 2007. I joined Jerry Brown and Governor Cuomo in establishing the U.S. Climate Alliance in 2016. And we did that—we now have 24 states in this—because we wanted to show the rest of the world there’s intelligent life in the United States. And it’s been very successful in that regard. I sponsored and fought for legislation on many occasions in the U.S. Congress. So this has been a long journey, as you indicated.
The situation is, we were probably all hopeful that natural gas could be a bridge fuel to bridge the current situation and the development of non-fossil fuel systems. And we were hopeful that could be a bridge through the decades. Turns out the science does not allow that, because in the last couple of years the science has now shown we don’t have as much time as we thought. We do not have 'til late in the century to make that transition. We have to make it in the next decade and a half to really get going. And so, what we've learned is we have to eliminate fossil fuels by the middle of the next decade. That is scientifically certain. And there’s no—as I indicated, there’s no debating with scientists. You know, I’ve got 10,000 scientists who agree with me on this. And so, we just have to follow the science, and the scientists indicated we just can’t wait.
AMY GOODMAN : And what do you say to President Trump, a proud climate change denier? His Energy Department just announced they’re not going to refer to methane as methane anymore, but they’re going to call it “freedom gas.” And as one energy official said in the department, “We are spreading molecules of freedom around the world.”
GOV . JAY INSLEE : What I would like—what I would say and like to say and, I believe, will say to President Trump is “goodbye.” And that is the only solution to this problem. Look, the things that I read about climate change coming out if this administration, sometimes I think they come out of The Onion . So, when you’re calling “freedom gas,” something that essentially that can, over time, destroy life as we know it, that can only be described as humor coming out of Dr. Strangelove. And I think somebody needs to make the equivalent of Dr. Strangelove about this administration and this subject.

A damning new report by The Intercept reveals that the judge overseeing the case that put former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva behind bars likely aided federal prosecutors in their corruption cases against Lula and other high-profile figures. Leaked cellphone messages among Brazilian law enforcement officials and other data obtained by The Intercept point to an ongoing collaboration between Judge Sérgio Moro and the prosecutors, whom he advised on strategy throughout what is known as “Operation Car Wash,” which resulted in the jailing of hundreds of executives, politicians and other parties. Lula was considered a favorite in the lead-up to the 2018 presidential election until he was put in jail and forced out of the race on what many say were trumped-up corruption charges. The jailing of Lula helped pave the way for the election of the far-right Jair Bolsonaro, who then named Judge Sérgio Moro to be his justice minister. In light of the report, Brazil’s Supreme Court said Monday it would re-consider an appeal by Lula. Topics: DOJ Agrees to Hand Over Some Mueller Docs to House Dems Jun 11, 2019
The House Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department have reached an agreement for the handover of some of the underlying evidence in the Mueller report, related to potential obstruction of justice by President Trump.

Large rainbow flags have been draped across U.S. missions in Seoul, Korea, and Chennai, India, while the New Delhi Embassy is lit with rainbow-colored lights. Requests to hoist the rainbow flag have been routinely approved over recent years, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo changed the rules last year, requiring embassies to obtain top-level approval—which the State Department has been rejecting.

"Overcrowding, Rotten Food & Nooses: DHS Watchdog Confirms Horrific Conditions at Immigrant Jails",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/12/overcrowding_rotten_food_nooses_dhs_watchdog,"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We end today’s show looking at horrific conditions for some 52,000 immigrants held in for-profit jails around the country. At least 24 immigrants have died in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the Trump administration. At least four more died shortly after being released. Now Homeland Security’s own inspector general has revealed how detained immigrants are subjected to rotten food, severe overcrowding, inadequate medical care, and broken and overflowing toilets. In two facilities, in particular—Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California and Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey—the inspectors found, quote, “immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards … including nooses in detainee cells.”
AMY GOODMAN : The inspectors showed up at these four detention jails unannounced between May and November 2018 in response to several concerns raised by immigration rights groups and complaints made by prisoners. The LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado were also inspected. Three of the facilities are operated by the private prison company GEO Group. This comes as a separate inspector general report recently documented dangerous overcrowding at a Border Patrol processing facility in El Paso, Texas.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has announced it plans to hold some 1,400 immigrant children at a site on Fort Sill Army Base in Oklahoma that was once used as an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II. The agency is already holding a record number of children in some 168 facilities and programs in 23 states.
For more, we go to Houston, Texas, where we’re joined by Aura Bogado, immigration reporter for Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting. She’s been speaking with migrants held in a number of these jails.
Aura, welcome back to Democracy Now! There was not a lot of mainstream media attention on this inspector general report—again, the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security. Talk about what it revealed.
AURA BOGADO : Good morning, Amy. It’s great to be back.
The inspector general’s report indicates what immigrants have said for years about conditions in various detention facilities. As you mentioned, the inspector general’s report did surprise visits to four sites. Three of them are run by the private prison company GEO , and the other one is local to Essex County, New Jersey.
And it’s hard to know where to begin, but, you know, some of what stands out are the photos, for example, from the bathroom facilities, where there is unusable toilets, mildew and mold on the showers. The inspector general said that this poses health risks to the people who—to the detainees who are being held there: little to no access to recreation, horrible food conditions—moldy bread; raw, leaking chicken blood; unmarked, unlabeled food—again, things that we’ve heard about for years. And as you mentioned, this is DHS inspector general, and they found that there were multiple violations of ICE’s own detention standards.
And ICE concurred with the one recommendation, which was to have increased oversight. In some cases, they tried to make fixes right away, such as replacing the kitchen manager at one of the facilities during the inspection. But with some other recommendations, they sort of indicated that they’d think about it. For example, the Aurora facility in Colorado has a space for in-contact visits, which we know improves the morale of people who are being held in any kind of detention or prison environment. And although it has those facilities, it doesn’t allow contact visits. And the inspector general’s report cited that, and ICE’s response was, “You know, we’ll think about it, but the standard isn’t to have contact visits.” So, it’s an interesting way to sort of skirt that particular issue which was addressed in the report.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Aura, could you talk some about the GEO Group, for those viewers and listeners who may not be familiar with it?
AURA BOGADO : Sure. So, the GEO Group is a private prison contractor. And for ICE , it runs several detention facilities around the country. And it does, you know, what it sounds like. It holds people for civil immigration custody. Something that I think people don’t always understand is that people who are in immigration, in ICE custody, they’re in civil custody, not criminal custody. So it doesn’t have to do with any kind of criminality. It’s people who are going through some kind of immigration process, one of the many immigration processes that exist in the United States. And ICE contracts with a few contractors, but particularly with GEO . And they’re a large firm that holds a lot of people around the country for this agency.
AMY GOODMAN : So, can you talk about the significance of this report, and specifically, also, the number of migrants who have died during the Trump administration? It’s both children, a record number—I mean, I think the number was six from back to last year, and there hadn’t been a death, a child death, in immigration detention in 10 years. And now you have this latest figure of—what was the number?—24 migrants—these are adults—who died in detention, with another four dying right after they’re released.
AURA BOGADO : Right. So, something to keep in mind is that there are various agencies that hold immigrants, asylum seekers, migrants. So, we have just been talking about ICE immigration detention. The Customs and Border Patrol also holds people at Border Patrol stations, which are often referred to as hieleras , or “iceboxes,” by people who are held in them. They always describe them as being incredibly cold. I spent time with a couple of girls who I first reported on back in 2013, and they described, in great detail, especially one of them, what the icebox was like. And, you know, here we are, years later. They have green cards now. They’re looking forward to becoming citizens. And when we went back to talk about the conditions in these Border Patrol stations, it was like it could have happened yesterday. I mean, they just described how freezing they were, how the one little piece of Mylar didn’t feel like enough for either of them, and the older sister felt so bad for the younger one, that she took it and tried to create a second layer for her sister. And she was scared of sleeping through getting her name called, because they say that they were told that if they didn’t hear their name, they would stay in there forever. So, you know, again, this is stuff that we’ve heard about for a long time.
Unaccompanied minors then who leave the Border Patrol stations are then taken to shelters around the country, which are run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. These are all contracted facilities throughout the country, and that’s a different department altogether. That’s not DHS , but the Department of Health and Human Services. Some of what we found is tremendous abuse, both accusations and proven allegations, as well as, you know, in some of these places, there is the use of restraints, forced drugging. My reporting partner and I, Patrick Michels and I, we’ve been investigating secret shelters, in which the Office of Refugee Resettlement, without any judicial oversight, sends children to psychiatric facilities or residential treatment centers, and they’re sort of off the map of the shelters that we do know about. They’re not contracted facilities.
And, yes, people die. There are really horrible conditions in a lot of these places. And as you mentioned, there have been two dozen deaths during the Trump administration. That accounts for the 200 or so deaths since we’ve been keeping track, which is since 2003, I believe. And then there have been four deaths immediately after custody. So those are also tricky to track. We think that it’s four people who died immediately after being released. They may have been in custody when there were taken to a hospital, and then paroled, essentially taken out of custody immediately thereafter. But these are pretty high numbers. And again, they come from places in which people have been detailing the horrid conditions for quite a long time.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Aura, the inspector general’s report, from your own reporting, do you get the sense that they’re actually talking to the detainees, or are they just basically inspecting the delivery of basic services and dealing with the personnel in these facilities?
AURA BOGADO : You know, there’s mention in the report where they cite that detainees said such-and-such things. Detainees noted that not having contact visits was difficult for them, for example. But their actual perspective isn’t included. There are no quotes from the detainees themselves in the report. And again, it’s interesting, and I think it validates what people have been saying for a long time, but, again, you know, for immigration reporters, whose sources are the people who experience these policies, this isn’t necessarily anything new. I think the photos do illustrate, however, exactly what has been described to me and many other reporters for quite a long time.
AMY GOODMAN : And now the inspector general report author, John Kelly—not the General John Kelly, who’s gone on to the board of another for-profit detention facility—is resigning, after this report has come out. But, finally, the Trump administration saying it’s going to suspend legal aid programs, recreational activities, even English classes—all education for unaccompanied migrant children jailed in federally run immigration centers, the move drawing condemnation from groups like Amnesty International USA , which wrote, “It’s bad enough that the Trump administration is trying to normalize the warehousing of children, It’s unconscionable that they would so blatantly try to strip them of their rights. Locking up children and then denying them legal aid, education, and even playtime is all part of this administration’s cruel efforts to dehumanize people who have come to the U.S. seeking safety.” Those are the words of Amnesty International USA . And yet you have President Trump taking $8 billion to build a wall, and saying he doesn’t have money for kids having classes.
AURA BOGADO : Yeah. Again, my reporting partner, Patrick Michels, actually broke that story on Twitter recently. And it was surprising to see that memo, that email, which internally stated we’re not providing English classes right now. We’re not providing fútbol , or soccer, recreation services. And as you note, there is quite an irony in saying that there isn’t funding available for something really basic. Like, you know, how much does a soccer ball cost? I’m not sure.

A political crisis is growing in Brazil after The Intercept revealed that the judge who helped jail former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva likely aided federal prosecutors in their corruption case in an attempt to prevent Lula’s Workers’ Party from winning the presidency. Leaked cellphone messages among Brazilian law enforcement officials and other data obtained by The Intercept point to an ongoing collaboration between Judge Sérgio Moro and the prosecutors investigating a sweeping corruption scandal known as Operation Car Wash. Lula was considered a favorite in the lead-up to the 2018 presidential election until he was put in jail and forced out of the race on what many say were trumped-up corruption charges.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: A political crisis is growing in Brazil after The Intercept revealed that the judge who helped jail former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva likely aided federal prosecutors in their corruption case in an attempt to prevent Lula’s Workers’ Party from winning the presidency. Leaked cellphone messages among Brazilian law enforcement officials and other data obtained by The Intercept point to an ongoing collaboration between Judge Sérgio Moro and the prosecutors investigating a sweeping corruption scandal known around the world as Operation Car Wash.
Lula was considered a favorite in the lead-up to the 2018 presidential election until he was put in jail and forced out of the race on what many say were trumped-up corruption charges. The leaked documents also reveal that prosecutors had serious doubts about Lula’s guilt. The jailing of Lula helped pave the way for the election of the far-right former military office Jair Bolsonaro, who then named Judge Sérgio Moro to be his justice minister.
AMY GOODMAN : The Intercept 's reporting is based on a trove of internal files and private conversations from the prosecutorial team behind Operation Car Wash. The Intercept has dubbed the files “The Secret Brazil Archive.” As a result of The Intercept 's reporting, Brazil’s Supreme Court has announced it will reconsider an appeal by Lula to be released from prison. Calls are also growing for Sérgio Moro to resign as justice minister. The Brazilian Bar Association has called for Moro to be suspended and for all prosecutors involved in the Car Wash scandal probe to be disbanded.
Moro has denied any wrongdoing, claims the messages have been taken out of context. Moro wrote in a statement, quote, “I lament the lack of indication of the source of the person responsible for the criminal invasion of the prosecutors’ cell phones. As well as the position of the site that did not contact me before the publication, contrary to basic rule of journalism. As for the content of the messages they mention, there is no sign of any abnormality or providing directions as a magistrate, despite being taken out of context and the sensationalism of the articles,” he said.
Vermont senator, 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told The Intercept , “Today, it is clearer than ever that Lula da Silva was imprisoned in a politicized prosecution that denied him a fair trial and due process. During his presidency, Lula oversaw huge reductions in poverty and remains Brazil’s most popular politician. I stand with political and social leaders across the globe who are calling on Brazil’s judiciary to release Lula and annul his conviction,” Senator Sanders said.
We go now to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to speak with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept , who broke the story.
So, Glenn, lay out what you exposed in this three-part series . Looks like Glenn is having a little trouble hearing us, so we’re going to go to break, and we’ll come back to Glenn Greenwald in Rio de Janeiro. Stay with us.

AMY GOODMAN : Damon Locks and Black Monument Ensemble performing “Sounds Like Now.” This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González. Our guest is Glenn Greenwald, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, founding editors of The Intercept , just published “The Secret Brazil Archive,” a three-part exposé revealing that the judge overseeing the case that put former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva behind bars likely aided the federal prosecutors in their case against Lula and other high-profile figures.
Lay out you found in this three-part report, Glenn, and how it’s rocking Brazil right now.
GLENN GREENWALD : Sure. So, as your audience likely knows, because I have discussed it with you many times and you’ve covered it with other guests, Brazil is a country that has been swamped by multiple political crises—the impeachment of former Workers’ Party President Dilma Rousseff, who succeeded Lula, the ascension of this far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, economic crises and the like.
But by far the biggest event in Brazil was the imprisonment last year of former President Lula da Silva, not just because he was such a giant on the world stage democratically, which he is, because he was elected overwhelmingly twice, in 2002 and 2006, and his presidency was so successful in lifting millions of people out of poverty, in transforming Brazil, that he left Brazil and—left office, I mean, with an 87% approval rating, which is unheard of. So, to put somebody like that in prison is an earth-shattering story in and of itself, but it was made all the more consequential by the fact that all polls showed that Lula, who was running again for president last year—he was term-limited out of office the first time—was the overwhelming favorite, was the massive front-runner, was ahead by 20 to 30 points in every poll, including ahead of Jair Bolsonaro. And so, to imprison Lula meant that he was rendered ineligible under the law to run, and that’s what paved the way ultimately for Jair Bolsonaro’s ascension to control over Brazil, which is the fifth most populous country in the world, with massive oil reserves and the most important environmental resource on the planet, which is the Amazon, all of which is now in the hands of Jair Bolsonaro.
This was done by a task force prosecutors and a judge, Sérgio Moro, who have basically been turned into superheroes, into deities, by the Brazilian press and by the world press. Sérgio Moro was heralded around the world as some great figure. He was named to the Time 100 list in 2016 and went to the gala in New York. He had a huge profile on him on 60 Minutes that was a puff piece, basically turning him into this noble anti-corruption figure. And there’s been almost no questioning of anything that they’ve done, even though they’ve been using highly questionable practices.
Here in Brazil, there has been a longtime suspicion that they in fact were abusing their powers for political ends, that what they really were, were right-wing ideologues and operatives who were abusing the law to destroy the Workers’ Party—one of the only left-wing parties in the entire democratic world that has dominated politics in a major country and has succeeded in anti-poverty programs—in order to usher in the pro-right faction into power, that they were abusing the law to basically put the leaders in prison to destroy the party. They’ve always vehemently denied this. They’ve said, “We have no ideology. We have no party preference. We don’t care who wins elections. We’re only neutral judges and prosecutors applying the law.”
The archive that was provided to us by our source, this massive trove of secret documents, about their internal communications, about their internal actions, their chats, their audios, their videos, an archive that, as I’ve said, is bigger in size than the Snowden archive was, which until that point was the largest leak in the history of U.S. journalism, bigger than that, finally enables us to see the truth about what they really did.
And the three stories that we published on Sunday, the reason they’ve shaken Brazil to the core is because Sérgio Moro, after Bolsonaro won, thanks to Justice Moro putting Lula in prison, became the second most powerful person in Brazil, because Bolsonaro created what he called a “super justice ministry,” that Sérgio Moro now runs. He’s the justice minister of the country. It’s like being an attorney general but on steroids, controlling all law enforcement, surveillance, police actions.
And what this material shows are three key things. Number one, it shows that inside the prosecutor task force, they were talking openly about how they wanted to make sure that the Workers’ Party lost the election. And we can talk about the specifics, but, in particular, there was a judge who authorized Lula to give an interview from prison 12 days before the election. And they panicked, and they said, “We need to stop this, because if Lula is allowed to be heard from, he will—there’s a good chance he will make PT win the election, and we need to put a stop to this.” They said they were praying every day that PT doesn’t return to power—PT being the Workers’ Party. So, this five-year claim that they had—”we don’t have any preferences for parties, we don’t care who wins elections”—was an absolute lie. They were talking openly and explicitly about how their top priority was making sure PT didn’t win the election—exactly what people have been accusing them of.
Secondly, just like in the U.S., a judge is required to be neutral. A judge can’t favor one side or the other. And there’s long been a suspicion that Judge Moro, when he was ruling on these cases, like finding Lula guilty, finding other left-wing leaders guilty and people from other parties guilty, that he was in fact collaborating in secret with the prosecutors to design the case. They vehemently and angrily denied this accusation. The head of the prosecutorial task force, who’s a national hero in Brazil, Deltan Dallagnol, wrote a book in which he said, “These accusations are outrageous. They’re disgusting.” We have video of Judge Moro being asked about this, and he was so angry about it that he actually scoffed at it with a smile, saying, “People talk about this as being—as though it’s Judge Moro’s prosecution or Judge Moro’s strategy.” He said, “People don’t understand. Judges in Brazil have no role in prosecuting people. Our value is one of passivity. We simply listen to both sides, listen to the evidence and make decisions.” What the conversations that we published show, between Judge Moro and head of the prosecutorial task force, is that Judge Moro in fact was constantly directing, constructing, designing the entire prosecution, screaming at them when they were doing things that he thought were wrong, telling them how to better fortify the case, not just against Lula, but against other people. He was basically the commander of the prosecutorial team and then walking into court as though he were sitting judging Lula’s case and others as a neutral arbiter. So, everything that they vehemently denied to the public they were doing, in fact, they were doing for years, as these documents show.
And the third key revelation, as you said, is that the specific case for which they prosecuted Lula, namely the charge that he had received a—what they call a triplex apartment, in order to make it sound very glamorous, when in fact it’s kind of rundown and shoddy, and Lula had the capability to buy it 100,000 times over if he wanted—but the charge was he received this triplex apartment and renovations to it in exchange for helping this construction company get contracts, that they knew themselves, three days before they indicted him, that they didn’t have the evidence sufficient to show his guilt or even to justify why this case belonged with them. But they just decided they were going to go forward anyway, because they knew they had a judge, in Judge Moro, now Minister Moro, single-mindedly devoted to the goal of imprisoning Lula, and not just imprisoning him, but doing so in time to make him ineligible to run for 2018’s election, out of fear that PT would win the election.
So, the consequences of this revelation have been enormous, because Moro, as I said, is the second most powerful person in Brazil, after Bolsonaro, but he’s by far the most respected person, or at least was the most respected person. And even his most ardent and loyal defenders, in light of these revelations, have said there’s no way to defend this conduct. One of the biggest right-wing newspapers in Brazil, Estado de São Paulo , that has spent four years praising and heralding an cheerleading for Sérgio Moro, came out and said he needs to resign, and the head of the task force needs to be fired, just based on the first three stories that we published. And that’s indicative and reflective of widespread sentiment. And that’s why it’s shaking Brazil to the core, because Sérgio Moro is crucial to the legitimacy of the Bolsonaro government.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Glenn—
GLENN GREENWALD : Getting him to go join the government was a crucial part.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Glenn, I wanted to ask you, because these are, obviously, very explosive conclusions that you’ve reached on your reporting. Could you talk a little bit about the archive sources that you have? In other words, I could understand the cellphone texts, let’s say, between different parties involved in this being leaked, but you were even talking about audio. How was the audio compiled? Were these people taping their own conversations? Could you discuss a little bit the nature of the documents that you have?
GLENN GREENWALD : Sure. So, when I say audio, generally what I mean is—and we haven’t published any of the audios yet, so I’m reluctant to say much about them. But when I say audios, typically what I mean is not that they were taping their own conversations, but that they often communicated with one another using apps on telephones that enable you to either type out messages to people, so you text messages to people, or you can leave voicemail messages for people, essentially. So, instead of typing some long message, you just click microphone on your telephone, you speak as a monologue, and you leave a message that way on somebody else’s phone, which is a very common thing to do for people who use WhatsApp or Telegram or Signal. Those are the kinds of audios that I’m talking about. But because oftentimes, especially for complicated matters, you don’t want to type huge paragraphs, you just want to speak, much of their communications—although it’s not really technically taped, you end up getting a huge part of their conversation, because they’re speaking to one another in one-, two-, three-minute monologues back and forth to one another. Those are the kinds of audios we have.
AMY GOODMAN : So, I wanted to turn to a video you tweeted Monday of Sérgio Moro speaking in 2016. He was a federal judge at the time.
JUDGE SÉRGIO MORO : [translated] Let’s make something very clear. You hear a lot about Judge Moro’s investigative strategy. I often say the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Federal Police and the subsidiary bodies are the ones responsible for that. I don’t have any investigative strategy at all. The people who investigate or who decide what to do and such is the public prosecutor and the Federal Police. The judge is reactive. We say that a judge should normally cultivate these passive virtues. And I even get irritated at times. I see somewhat unfounded criticism of my work, saying that I am a judge investigator. I say go ahead and identify them. In my judicial decisions, a decision where I determine the production of legal proof without provocation, at most, I put together some documents for the eventual testimony of a witness. In this large haul of criminal cases, that’s practically nothing.
AMY GOODMAN : And now I want to turn to former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in his own words, appearing on Democracy Now! in March 2018, just before he was jailed.
LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA : [translated] Now, if my innocence is proven, then Judge Moro should be removed from his position, because you can’t have a judge who is lying in the judgment and pronouncing as guilty someone who he knows is innocent. He knows that it’s not my apartment. He knows that I didn’t buy it. He knows that I didn’t pay anything. He knows that I never went there. He knows that I don’t have money from Petrobras. The thing is that because he subordinated himself to the media, I said, in the first hearing with him, “You are not in a position to acquit me, because the lies have gone too far.” And the disgrace is that the one who does the first lie continues lying and lying and lying to justify the first lie. And I am going to prove that he has been lying.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that is now-jailed former President Lula da Silva. The Brazilian Bar Association has called for Moro to be suspended and for all prosecutors involved in the scandal to be disbanded. Yet, as you’ve pointed out, Bolsonaro made him a kind of super justice minister, bringing together the functions of law enforcement, surveillance and investigation, which were distributed to several ministries, all under Moro’s super justice minister position, making him, as you pointed out, Glenn Greenwald, the second most powerful person in Brazil now. So what happens?
GLENN GREENWALD : So, it’s so fascinating, Amy, because the story reminds me so much of the Snowden story in so many ways. One way, remember, that the Snowden story essentially began when Snowden heard James Clapper go before the Senate and just look at them and just lie to their faces, when he was asked, “Are you collecting data about millions of Americans?” and he said, “No, sir, we’re not doing that. We have no such program.” And it was shocking to Snowden to watch somebody in that high of a position so sociopathically lie, and that’s the thing that finally drove Snowden to decide, with finality, “I need to show the truth.” That’s the same reaction I have when I listen to Judge Moro look in the cameras and say, “I get irritated at the notion that I have any involvement in a prosecution,” when I’ve now read all of the years’ worth of documents and conversations that we’ve—a lot of which we’ve published, and will continue to publish, showing that he did exactly what he looked in the camera, and with this smirk, and just so smugly denied. It’s just amazing, even though I guess it shouldn’t be, the willingness of people in these high positions of authority to so sociopathically lie about what it is that they do.
And then the second issue is, you know, just like in the Snowden story, where people for years suspected that the NSA was spying, but were called conspiracy theorists or paranoid people, and then the evidence proved them right, everybody—or, a lot of people in Brazil have long said what Lula said—namely, that Moro got into a position where he was forced to convict Lula, where he was single-mindedly obsessed with it. The Brazilian elites were demanding that of him, and therefore he was willing to do anything, including breaking rules, breaking laws, in order to make that happen. They were called conspiracy theorists. They were called paranoid. They were called left-wing liars and ideologues who were only saying that to protect their leader. And as it turns out, what Lula said in that interview is absolutely right.
And, of course, the conviction that Sérgio Moro issued, notwithstanding the fact that it was very quickly, very strangely quickly, affirmed by an appellate court, in time to make him ineligible to run, is now called into doubt, because we know, because we’ve all seen the evidence, that the process that led to his conviction was deeply and inherently corrupted in the most basic way, because the person who found him guilty was doing exactly that which judges are prohibited from doing. And the Supreme Court will now decide whether that conviction can be maintained in light of what we’ve shown.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Glenn, I wanted to ask you, in a broader sense, this whole issue of corruption in government, and prosecutors removing or being able to jail or remove elected officials or key political leaders—clearly, in a democracy, in an industrial or Western democracy, there’s two ways to remove a leader: You vote them out of office, or you get them indicted and jailed and removed that way. To what extent is this a signal to people around the world, in other countries, about the kind of skepticism that you should have about investigations coming at the top leaders? And, of course, I’m sure there are people in the—Trump supporters here in this country, who would point to the FBI agent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the FBI counsel, as they were attempting to help remove Trump from office. But to what degree do you—is this a warning for people in other countries to be wary and skeptical, even in the face of what seems initially to be damning evidence against a political leader?
GLENN GREENWALD : Yeah, I mean, look, Juan, you know, as you know, as you guys know, I’ve been one of the people, along with Noam Chomsky and Matt Taibbi and a few lonely others on the left, who have been skeptical of the Russiagate story, in part because we know that these agencies have a long history of lying. And the FBI and the CIA and the NSA in the U.S. were vehemently opposed to Donald Trump and wanted Hillary Clinton, because they trusted her much more. And so there was a concern always, on my part, that they were abusing their prosecutorial powers to interfere in our domestic election in the United States in order to help the candidate they wanted to win and hurt the candidate that they wanted to lose. There were other factions in the FBI , by the way, who wanted Donald Trump to win desperately, and did their own abuse of power to hurt Hillary Clinton’s chances and help Donald Trump win. So there were two different factions inside these law enforcement agencies interfering in the U.S. election by abusing their power to help the two candidates they preferred, which is an incredible—that was the real meddling that was dangerous in the 2016 election.
And, of course, the parallel is very clear, which is that in Brazil, since 2002, the center-right, the oligarchical class, which, by the way, got kind of comfortable with Lula and PT, but nonetheless still wanted the center-right to be in power—and I asked Lula about that: “Why would the elite be so opposed to you, when the elite thrived under your presidency? Even though you lifted millions of people out of poverty, you weren’t a socialist. You weren’t Castro. You weren’t Chávez.” The markets in Brazil, the rich in Brazil prospered under Lula. And he said it was cultural. They hated the fact that somebody who came from poverty was in the presidency, who doesn’t speak perfect Portuguese, who didn’t read until he was 10. They hated seeing in airports people who used to be invisible in the favelas now able to fly to visit their family, to be able to buy apartments. They hated it culturally. They felt like their Brazil was being taken away from them. And so, they couldn’t beat Lula, they couldn’t beat the Workers’ Party democratically, and so they abused the force of law in order to destroy the party that they couldn’t beat politically. And this is a serious warning and a serious danger about why anytime people in power exercise power in secret, we need to be skeptical of them—all human beings.
And I believe that these prosecutors began with good intentions. Brazil really is a country that has been plagued by corruption, on the left and the right, for a long time. They’re young people. They’re in their thirties. I believe they began with good intentions. But they became so drunk on their own power. Nobody was questioning them. The large media here in Brazil, with the exception of Folha , one newspaper, stopped questioning what they were doing, just applauded for them, served as their tool. When you have that kind of faith being put into you, that kind of unquestioned power, as I’m not hardly the first person to observe, that kind of power corrupts people. And they got corrupted. They became politicized. And they became drunk on their own belief in their own goodness, that they thought they were above the law and could break the rules, because their ends justified the means. And it is an important lesson to learn about power in general.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, they ousted, impeached Dilma Rousseff, before they imprisoned Lula. Finally, Glenn, very quickly, you’ve got this three-part series . It’s rocking Brazil right now—calls for Moro to go down, the super justice minister; calls for Lula to be released. What do you think is the chance of this? And finally, you’re saying this is larger than a Snowden cache of information. You have much more information that you haven’t released. What are you doing with it?
GLENN GREENWALD : We are working feverishly to publish it as quickly as we can. Obviously, you know, there is a lot of desire to see more of it, but we have a responsibility, just like we did with the Snowden case, to make sure that what we’re publishing is done well and professionally and accurately, because if we make a single mistake, they’ll use that forever against us to undermine the credibility of the reporting. But definitely more is coming, very soon.
So, when you ask what’s going to happen with Moro, what’s going to happen with Lula, a lot of it depends on how good of the reporting we do and how much more we show, which we have a lot more to show. But I believe, even with just what we’ve shown—I’m not saying Sérgio Moro is about to be put out of office, because he still has the support of Bolsonaro. He’s still crucial to the government. But certainly he’s severely damaged and weakened, and will continue to be more damaged and weakened as we reveal more. I’m not sure he can survive that. But I do think there’s a good chance that the Supreme Court will say that the conviction of Lula da Silva was a byproduct of so much impropriety that we cannot let it stand, that at the very least he needs a new trial and needs to be let out of prison while this new trial proceeds.
AMY GOODMAN : Glenn Greenwald, we want to thank you for being with us, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, one of the founding editors of The Intercept , has just published “The Secret Brazil Archive.” We’ll link to it at democracynow.org.

"Facing Affordable Housing Crisis & Record Homelessness, New York Passes Landmark Rent Protection Law",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/12/facing_affordable_housing_crisis_record_homelessness,"Facing Affordable Housing Crisis & Record Homelessness, New York Passes Landmark Rent Protection Law Story June 12, 2019 Donate
In New York, housing rights advocates are celebrating after state lawmakers announced an agreement that would provide the strongest tenant protections in over a quarter of a century. The deal came just days ahead of the expiration of the current rent laws at the end of this week. Democracy Now! co-host Juan González explains how lawmakers agreed to abolish laws allowing landlords to deregulate rents on apartments after they exceed a certain limit, and to curb provisions allowing landlords to raise the rent of rent-controlled apartments after renovations. The law is one of several similar efforts nationwide and is expected to give municipalities around the state more authority to regulate rents and ensure greater access to affordable housing.

AMY GOODMAN : Juan, before we move on with our first story, Albany reaching deal to toughen rent protection, talk about the significance of this.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: This is—yeah, this is a huge victory, Amy. It was back in the mid-1990s when George Pataki, the Republican governor of New York, was in office, and there was an extreme conservative Republican Senate and an Assembly in New York that was Democratic but really controlled by the landlord lobby. And they really initiated this vacancy decontrol that resulted in about 200,000 rent-regulated units in New York City being decontrolled. “Decontrolled” means the landlords can charge whatever they want.
And so, what happened, finally, this year, and just in Albany, is this extension, a sweeping extension, of the rent regulations, that will now eliminate vacancy decontrol, that will also prevent landlords—it used to be that an apartment, when it became vacant, the landlord could automatically increase the rent by 20%. That is no longer going to be allowed, and that they cannot jack up major capital improvement prices and then charge the tenants for those improvements. So, a lot of that has been eliminated.
And most importantly, rent regulations were only in New York City and Yonkers, a few suburban cities. Now any city and county in the state will be able to adopt rent regulations. This means that millions of people in New York state will now have greater protections from their rent rising above their ability to be able to pay.
AMY GOODMAN : And what do you think this will mean for the country, for places like San Francisco?
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, it’s already happening in Newark and in several other places in California. Increasingly, rent—because housing for renters has become so exorbitant, more and more local governments are saying, “We’ve got to regulate rent.” So this is just another huge push in the movement to protect tenants across the country.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, we’ll continue to follow this.

In Alabama, Republican Governor Kay Ivey signed into law a bill mandating child sex offenders undergo chemical castration as a condition of their parole. The law would apply to anyone found convicted of committing a sexual offense with a child under the age of 13. Six other states have similar laws for certain sex offenders.
Medical experts and human rights groups have raised concerns about the practice. The Alabama American Civil Liberties Union says that chemical castration is unconstitutional as it violates due process and privacy laws. The executive director of the Alabama ACLU said of the new law, “They really misunderstand what sexual assault is about. Sexual assault isn’t about sexual gratification. It’s about power. It’s about control.” Topics: Vermont and Maine Expand Abortion Rights Jun 12, 2019
In reproductive rights news, Vermont Governor Phil Scott signed a bill Monday affirming abortion as a “fundamental right.” The law prohibits the government from interfering with the decision to get an abortion, and protects access to contraception, sterilization and family planning. A spokesperson for Governor Scott previously said he would not sign the bill passed by Democratic state lawmakers last month—though Vermont law would still have allowed the legislation to go into effect.
Meanwhile in Maine, Democratic Governor Janet Mills signed a bill allowing physician assistants and some registered nurses to perform abortions—instead of just doctors—which she says will increase abortion access for Mainers in rural areas. Topics:"

Canada will ban many common single-use plastic items by 2021. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the plan Monday, which follows similar moves by the European Union and the U.K. in recent months. Plastic straws, cotton swabs, cutlery and some plastic bags are on the list of soon-to-be-banned single-use products. Under Canada’s plan, companies that manufacture or sell plastic products or products packaged in plastic will be responsible for the collection and recycling of their plastic waste. Only around 9% of plastic is recycled, and the U.N. estimates there are 100 million tons of plastic waste in the world’s oceans.

The Guardian is reporting a real estate company partly owned by presidential son-in-law and Trump’s senior adviser Jared Kushner has received $90 million in investments from unknown foreign sources since Kushner entered the White House in 2017. The company, Cadre, received money through an offshore vehicle in the Cayman Islands run by Goldman Sachs. Kushner maintained a stake in Cadre after he joined his father-in-law’s White House team. His stake is now worth an estimated $50 million. Kushner did not disclose this information in his initial ethics disclosure form. Unnamed sources told The Guardian that funds received by Cadre came in large part from other offshore tax havens, as well as from Saudi Arabia. Kushner was denied a security clearance when he joined the Trump administration, reportedly over concerns about outside business interests and “foreign influence.” Topics: "

In Alabama, Republican Governor Kay Ivey signed into law a bill mandating child sex offenders undergo chemical castration as a condition of their parole. The law would apply to anyone found convicted of committing a sexual offense with a child under the age of 13. Six other states have similar laws for certain sex offenders.
Medical experts and human rights groups have raised concerns about the practice. The Alabama American Civil Liberties Union says that chemical castration is unconstitutional as it violates due process and privacy laws. The executive director of the Alabama ACLU said of the new law, “They really misunderstand what sexual assault is about. Sexual assault isn’t about sexual gratification. It’s about power. It’s about control.” Topics: Alabama The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

In Arizona, a case against a humanitarian aid volunteer who provided food, water and shelter to undocumented migrants ended in a mistrial Tuesday after a deadlocked jury was unable to deliver a verdict. Scott Warren, from the groups No More Deaths and Ajo Samaritans, faced up to 20 years in prison after being charged with two counts of felony harboring and one count of felony conspiracy. Eight jurors found Scott Warren not guilty; four said he was guilty. Prosecutors have declined to comment on whether they would seek a retrial against Warren. This is Scott Warren speaking to supporters and the press after yesterday’s mistrial.

At an emotional congressional hearing Tuesday, Jon Stewart blasted lawmakers for their inaction ahead of a vote on renewing healthcare funding for 9/11 responders who became sick as a result of their work following the terror attack. The comedian and former host of “The Daily Show” has been a longtime advocate for the 9/11 responders and has repeatedly called out proposed cuts to the fund, which is set to expire in 2020. New York Democratic Congressmember Carolyn Maloney introduced legislation earlier this year to fund the program permanently. This is Stewart addressing a subcommittee of the House Judiciary panel.
Jon Stewart : “Behind me, a filled room of 9/11 first responders. And in front of me, a nearly empty Congress. Sick and dying, they brought themselves down here to speak to no one. Shameful. It’s an embarrassment to the country, and it is a stain on this institution. And you should be ashamed of yourselves, for those that aren’t here.

In Moscow, local reports say Russian police have detained nearly 100 people, including opposition politician Alexei Navalny, at a protest condemning police corruption over the recent arrest of independent journalist Ivan Golunov.
Golunov was released Tuesday following widespread public outcry. Golunov, who reported on corruption and press censorship, was arrested last week and accused of drug dealing, in what his lawyers and press freedom advocates say were fabricated charges after police planted fake evidence. He has since been cleared of the charges, and the arresting officers in the case have been suspended pending the results of an internal inquiry.
Golunov’s reporting included an investigation into the finances of Moscow’s deputy mayor’s family, the funding of public works in Moscow, and efforts to suppress press freedom. Russian press also rallied around Golunov, with three major business newspapers publishing matching front pages Monday to call out his arrest. Russia ranks number 149 in Reporters Without Borders’s 2019 World Press Freedom Index, which describes the country as having a “stifling atmosphere for independent journalists”. Topics: "

Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : We wanted to end with transgender actor and model Indya Moore, star of the FX show Pose , speaking at the New York protest Monday to demand justice for Layleen Polanco.
INDYA MOORE : I just first want to start by noting the recorded trans women and people who have been murdered, most of which there have been no arrests. You know, there are no—there are no leads. And as we all know, our cases are at the bottom of the pile always.
Jesusa Fidel Ventura Reyes, 25-year-old Mexican trans woman of color, better known as Chucha, she went missing on the night of May 17. The authorities later found her head severed in a cooler outside of town hall in Fortín de las Flores. Her decapitated body was later found in the streets of Mexico.
Camila Díaz Córdova, 25 [ sic ], she was a 29-year-old trans woman who was killed in El Salvador after being deported from the United States.
Dana Martin, 31, a trans woman of color, was found shot to death in her vehicle in a roadside ditch about 11 p.m. Sunday, 6 January, in Montgomery, Alabama.
Ashanti Carmon, 27, a trans woman of color, slain by gun violence in Maryland.
Claire Legato, 21, a trans woman of color, shot in the head on April 15th after an argument broke out between her mother and a suspect in Cleveland, Ohio. She was defending her mother from someone that stole from her.
Muhlaysia Booker, 23, a trans woman of color, was found shot and killed after 6:40 a.m. Saturday, 18th, in Dallas, Texas. The shooting comes after a little more than a month since a viral video, that we all saw, of her being beaten and dragged across the street in her own community by her own brothers, after speaking at a—I don’t know if it was a rally or a media correspondent thing, but after speaking—she spoke publicly, saying, “This time I can stand before you, whereas in other scenarios we’re at a memorial.” And now that’s where her family—that’s now where her family saw her, a few weeks after she said those words. That’s where she was last seen by her family.
Michelle “Tamika” Washington, 40 years old, a trans woman of color and longtime transgender rights advocate, was shot—again, by gun violence.
Paris Cameron, 20, was shot in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday, 25 in May, on Memorial weekend, by gun violence.
Chynal Lindsey, 26, a trans woman of color, was found in White Rock Lake, Dallas, Texas, at 5:45 on Saturday, 1st June. She was the second trans murder in Dallas, following Muhlaysia, just two weeks apart. Lindsey’s body was discovered only a mile away from where Booker’s body was discovered.
Chanel Scurlock, 23, a trans woman of color, was shot and killed in Lumberton, North Carolina. Her body was found in a field.
Jazzaline Ware, a black trans woman, was found dead in her Memphis apartment in March.
Layleen Polanco, the most recently slain trans woman of color, a black trans woman. I looked up to her. Just wanted to say, you know, when you’re a young trans person, you have the trans women and people around you to look to, when you imagine where you want to see yourself in your life. Layleen was one of those girls for me.
Cis-hetero people are deciding whether or not we deserve human rights, and that must end. We cannot lean on the understanding or empathy of cis-hetero people to protect and fight for our basic human rights. Our freedom to exist and access employment, shelter, education, safety, healthcare or anything else that we need to thrive should not be at the mercy to people who do not share our experiences or, let alone, believe we don’t deserve to live or thrive. We need our government to listen to us in regards to our needs, not listen to cis people in regards to our needs.
We are all worthy of safety and protection everywhere, including in our own homes with their own families and shelters in our own neighborhoods and churches and schools and jobs and hospitals and clinics and communities and cities and country and world. We are worthy of legal aid, liberty, justice, resources. And we are worthy of life. We are worthy of love.
If the sight of us using our bodies, our voices and our defiance to protest this oppressive administration and the people who endorse it, and the religions that are fighting for the right to dispose us as a spiritual practice, and police, prison and the political system that is giving the world permission to dispose of us, disturbs and frightens you more than our mysteriously dead bodies in the custody of Rikers Island and ICE , and the sight of us being beaten and dragged up, down, up and down the gravel of the streets, of our streets in Dallas and beyond, shot up and decapitated on the stairs of City Hall in Mexico, we will not back down and rest in peace no more.
AMY GOODMAN : The trans actor Indya Moore, speaking at a protest on Monday— Time magazine recently named her one of the world’s 100 most influential people of 2019; she also recently became the first trans woman on the cover of Elle magazine—as she spoke honoring Layleen Polanco. Your final comment Raquel Willis?
RAQUEL WILLIS : Absolutely. We have to invest in black and brown trans leadership, so all of the initiatives that are led by us and fighting for us need to be supported, whether that’s donating, volunteering or just elevating the work that we’re doing.

Justice for Layleen Polanco: Community Demands Answers After Trans Black Latinx Woman Died at Rikers,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/13/justice_for_layleen_polanco_community_demands,"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Outrage is mounting over the death of Layleen Polanco, a transgender Afro-Latinx woman who was found dead in a cell at Rikers Island on Friday. Polanco was arrested on misdemeanor charges and jailed on Rikers in April when she was unable to post $500 bail. Nearly two months later, she was dead. Her family, friends and transgender rights activists are now demanding answers for the conditions that led to the 27-year-old’s death. The city says the cause of death has not yet been determined. Polanco was held in a unit for transgender women while jailed at Rikers, but a week before her death she was transferred to so-called restrictive housing, an arrangement Polanco’s lawyer says amounts to solitary confinement.
AMY GOODMAN : Layleen’s death came at the beginning of Pride Month and just one day after the New York Police Department apologized for the first time for its raid a half-century ago on the Stonewall Inn, a gay- and trans-friendly bar in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. In June of ’69, the inn was the site of a violent police raid that triggered an uprising and helped launch the modern-day LGBTQ rights movement.
Hundreds gathered in New York City Monday to demand justice for Layleen Polanco and demand Rikers be shut down immediately. Democracy Now! was there in the streets. This video begins with transgender rights activist Cecilia Gentili speaking at Foley Square.
CECILIA GENTILI : Layleen loved New York, that you couldn’t get her out of here. She loved the buildings. She loved the vibe. She loved the people of New York City. And ultimately it has been this city that led to these circumstances, and we need to ask for answers. And we need to change the criminal law. It is crazy that people like her and people like me and people like most of us can end up in that [bleep] hole of Rikers Island for petty [bleep] that we did.
KIMBERLEY McKENZIE: Black and brown trans women of color are not protected federally through this current administration. And in this month of June, there is no pride in knowing that the injustices of transgender women of color and the state-sanctioned violence continues to be perpetuated, and the deaths of transgender women, black transgender women, continues to be a leading epidemic in our community.
T.S. CANDII : Trans rights are human rights. Trans people are people. We only want to live, be free and be safe.
RAQUEL WILLIS : We are in a war. Don’t get it twisted. We have been in a war. Black and brown trans people have been in a war since we were born, in a world that continuously tells us we shouldn’t exist, until they actually make it so that we don’t exist. And so, if you are invoking the names of Marsha or invoking the names of Sylvia or Miss Major or Stormé or any of these architects of our movement, Amanda Milan and so many others, [bleep] you, if you are not centering black and brown trans folks.
TABYTHA GONZALEZ : As a formerly incarcerated, a former sex worker, I know what—I can almost imagine what she went through in those corridors. I, myself, remember being made fun of, being treated subhuman, just to got get my medication from the medication window. Or how about picking up my commissary? Or how about going to visit my loved ones on the floor and have my family and myself subjected to those vicious things that the police did to us? I can almost imagine how she felt subhuman being chained going to seek personal help for herself. How many grievances were probably overlooked? How many times the boys have bullied her, and the police turned a deaf eye or a deaf ear? I appreciate everyone showing up in this space in her death, but where are we when we are living and breathing? I need that same anger. I need that same wrath. I need you to pack the courtrooms. How the hell does a misdemeanor result in a death sentence?
AMY GOODMAN : That was Tabytha Gonzalez with the Transgender Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
For more, we’re joined now in studio by two guests. Raquel Willis is a transgender activist and writer, executive editor of Out magazine. And Joel Wertheimer is an attorney representing the family of Layleen Polanco.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Joel, let’s begin with you. What happened to Layleen? Why was she in Rikers?
JOEL WERTHEIMER : So, there’s still a lot we’re figuring out about what happened. She was arrested in April on misdemeanor charges. We believe that did not have bail set. There was another warrant outstanding from—
AMY GOODMAN : You mean she would have been just released?
JOEL WERTHEIMER : Yeah, they set $1 bail, which is a technical thing. But she would have been released if this other warrant hadn’t been issued, that was from a human trafficking intervention court. And that was only $500. And she wouldn’t be in jail under the new bail law, which is supposed to go in effect in New York state in 2020. But prosecutors are still seeking bail.
AMY GOODMAN : So, how long had she spent in jail just because she couldn’t raise the $500?
JOEL WERTHEIMER : From mid-April until the day she died.
AMY GOODMAN : Over two months.
JOEL WERTHEIMER : Just under, yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : Just under.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Raquel, can you talk about the impact of Layleen’s death? I mean, she’s one just in a series, numerous deaths of black trans women killed either by civilians or by the state? So, could you talk about the impact of this on the transgender community?
RAQUEL WILLIS : Absolutely. I mean, it’s been a particularly heavy year. There have been 10 trans women reported murdered this year. We know that there are always probably more that go unreported.
And it is just really heavy because it is the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, right? This is our Pride Month. And so, while there is so much celebration and excitement around the strides that we have made as a community, these are sobering reminders of how much further we have to go.
And so, I think about Layleen’s case and how, even in the discussion of the murders and violence that happens to black and brown trans bodies, there’s such an erasure of people who are incarcerated or people who are detained, and in respecting their humanity and why they should still be here. So, on the very first day of Pride Month, even before what happened to Layleen, there was Johana Medina, a trans Latinx person seeking asylum, who died in ICE custody on June 1st. And so, all of this is happening while, in the background, there’s these celebrations ignoring these realities.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, this is Pride Month. Back to Layleen at Rikers Island, why was she in solitary confinement? I mean, this so much reminds me of Sandra Bland—right?—who couldn’t raise the $500 she needed to get out.
JOEL WERTHEIMER : We still don’t know exactly why she was placed in restrictive housing in a punitive segregation unit. The Department of Correction has been stony with us, to say the least. So—
AMY GOODMAN : She was in a transgender unit at Rikers?
JOEL WERTHEIMER : She was, to begin with. That was—Rikers is one of the few jails that actually has a transgender unit. But then she was transferred to the punitive segregation unit, which is solitary or minimal freedom while you’re incarcerated.
AMY GOODMAN : And how did she die?
JOEL WERTHEIMER : Again, that’s still being determined. We have suspicions, but I don’t to speculate too much. She did have epilepsy; she had a seizure condition. And we don’t know how frequently that she was being checked on. So, but we’re still waiting for the medical examiner to determine the cause of death.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I want to turn to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who’s now, of course, running for president, speaking about Layleen Polanco’s death on NY1. He was asked why she was in custody for nearly two months for two misdemeanor charges.
MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO : Well, that’s unusual. And I don’t know—I need to get you an answer on why that would be. Obviously, we’ve been moving consistently to have alternatives to incarceration. And our jail population is down over 30% in the last five years, and it’s about to go down a whole lot more, because, thankfully, Albany acted and did some important reforms on bail. But there’s more work to be done on that front on several levels. So, I need to get the facts about this case. But, you know, most importantly, she’s no longer with us, and we have to find out why.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : In May, Mayor de Blasio promised to protect transgender New Yorkers, dedicating a monument to legendary transgender activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. So, Raquel, your response to what the mayor said and what the mayor has promised?
RAQUEL WILLIS : Yes. I mean, I think that it’s great that we are honoring these figures, right? But we forget the facts of their lives. Marsha and Sylvia were women who were fighting for people who are incarcerated, for people who have had very difficult experiences and interactions with law enforcement and in the state. And so, while it’s great we have these monuments, we have to continue this fight.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, Sylvia Rivera, back 50 years ago at the Stonewall Inn.

No More Deaths: Mistrial Declared After Jury Refuses to Convict Scott Warren for Aiding Migrants,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/13/no_more_deaths_mistrial_declared_after,"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : In Tucson, Arizona, a jury has refused to convict humanitarian activist Scott Warren, who faced up to 20 years in prison for providing water, food, clean clothes and beds to two undocumented migrants crossing the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona. Warren’s trial ended Tuesday in a mistrial after a deadlocked jury was unable to deliver a verdict. Eight jurors thought Warren was not guilty; four thought he was guilty. A status hearing is scheduled for July 2nd. Prosecutors have declined to comment on whether they would seek a retrial against Warren. Warren briefly spoke to supporters outside Tucson’s federal courthouse, where the hung jury was declared.
SCOTT WARREN : Since my arrest in January of 2018, at least 88 bodies were recovered from the Ajo corridor of the Arizona desert. We know that’s a minimum number and that many more are out there and have not been found. The government’s plan in the midst of this humanitarian crisis? Policies to target undocumented people, refugees and their families; prosecutions to criminalize humanitarian aid, kindness and solidarity; and now, where I live, the revelation that they will build an enormous and expensive wall across a vast stretch of southwestern Arizona’s unbroken Sonoran Desert.
Today it remains as necessary as ever for local residents and humanitarian aid volunteers to stand in solidarity with migrants and refugees. And we must also stand for our families, friends and neighbors, and the very land itself, most threatened by the militarization of our borderland communities.
I have received enormous support from family, friends, lawyers and my community. Thank you to everyone, and I want to say that I love you all very, very much.
SUPPORTER : We love you, Scott!
SCOTT WARREN : If you can, though, take a moment now and get some rest. But the other men arrested with me that day, José Sacaria-Goday and Kristian Perez-Villanueva, have not received the attention and outpouring of support that I have. I do not know how they are doing now, but I desperately hope that they are safe.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Scott Warren is an activist with Ajo Samaritans and No More Deaths, which for years has left water and food in the harsh Sonoran Desert, where the temperature often reaches three digits during summer, to help refugees and migrants survive the deadly journey across the U.S. border. When Warren testified last week, he told jurors his actions were motivated by three intentions: relief of suffering, respect for human dignity and the right to self-determination. While presenting the case against Warren, U.S. Attorney Anna Wright said, quote, “He gave them food. He gave them water. … He did a bad thing. … This is not a case about deaths in the desert.”
AMY GOODMAN : Scott Warren was arrested January 17, 2018, just hours after No More Deaths released a report detailing how U.S. Border Patrol agents had intentionally destroyed more than 3,000 gallons of water left out for migrants crossing the border. The group also published a video showing border agents dumping out jugs of water in the desert. Hours after the report was published, authorities raided the Barn, a No More Deaths aid camp in Ajo, where they found two migrants who had sought temporary refuge.
We’re joined right now by Ryan Devereaux, staff reporter at The Intercept , who has closely covered Scott Warren’s trial and the criminalization of humanitarian aid volunteers for more than a year.
It’s great to have you back, Ryan. You’ve just flown back from Arizona, covering this trial that took about two weeks. Talk about the significance of the verdict. It’s a hung jury—eight for Scott Warren, four against.
RYAN DEVEREAUX : Correct. It was an outcome that I personally wasn’t expecting. I expected this was going to go one way or the other, guilty or not guilty. The hung jury, which came after three days of deliberation, was not something I think anybody was really expecting here. It was quite a turn to a case that’s already taken a lot of turns.
The story is not over for Scott Warren and his defense team. This is not necessarily a defeat, but it’s not a victory, either. We don’t yet know if the government is going to retry this case. As you mentioned at the top of the show, there’s a status hearing coming in July. So, a lot of the questions surrounding this case, its significance, the potential precedent it could set, are still alive. And that precedent includes the possibility of a broadened crackdown on humanitarian aid work in the desert, potential targeting of folks who have undocumented people in their lives, potential targeting of mixed-status families in the United States. There’s a whole lot on the line with respect to this case, and those questions are still very much alive.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And you’ve said, Ryan, that the crucial question for the jury was about Scott Warren’s intention. Explain what that means and the significance of that for the fact that there was a mistrial.
RYAN DEVEREAUX : Yeah, so, 19 months after this arrest, we’ve seen a lot of evidence in this case, hundreds of filings. The government brought many witnesses, as did Scott’s defense team. But what it all really boiled down to was intent. Did Scott Warren intend to shield these men from law enforcement, knowing that he was in violation of the law? If so, the government argued, then he was guilty. Scott Warren’s attorneys said that, yeah, intent is critical to this, and Scott Warren’s intent in this case was to provide humanitarian aid, and that’s been his intent all along in working in the borderlands for the last four years.
So, jurors heard about how Scott behaved and what he did in the hours and days after these two young men arrived at the Barn, this humanitarian aid station in Ajo, Arizona. Scott Warren tended to the migrants’ feet. They had blisters on their feet. One was reporting sore ribs. He took down notes about their medical conditions. He called a doctor who the organization No More Deaths works with, has worked with for years, an award-winning physician. He reported the conditions that these young men were in. He was advised that they should stay off their feet and that they should rehydrate and that volunteers should keep an eye on them for the next few days.
The government, in its arguments in court over the last week, said that the notes that Scott Warren took during this period were part of a cover-up. They took these notes—No More Deaths, Scott—in order to be able to say that they were providing medical aid, when in fact they were just trying to help these men enter the country. They argued that Scott’s real intent is to thwart the Border Patrol at every turn.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s go to Scott in his own words, talking about finding the remains of migrants who have died while crossing into the United States. This is a clip from The Intercept ’s mini documentary titled Let Them Have Water .
SCOTT WARREN : We went from finding human remains every other month to like finding five sets of human remains on a single trip hiking through the Growler Valley and then going back a week later and finding two more sets of remains, and then, on a single day of searching, finding like eight sets of remains and bodies of people who had died in adjacent areas of the bombing range and on Cabeza Prieta. So just this like scale of this crisis, of the humanitarian crisis and the missing persons crisis, just blew wide open.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Scott Warren. The government says this isn’t about deaths. But since 2001, at least 3,000 migrants have been found dead in the southern Arizona desert. Thousands of others have disappeared. Activists say the numbers are probably much higher. Talk about the government saying it’s not about deaths, and, of course, Scott Warren’s argument and the name of his organization, No More Deaths.
RYAN DEVEREAUX : Yeah, the government began this trial by arguing that this is not a case about humanitarian aid and deaths in the desert; this is a case about Scott Warren and Scott Warren’s actions. But what happened in the days that followed is the government put on many, many arguments about humanitarian aid and said that what No More Deaths and groups like it are doing is a political project, it’s not a humanitarian project. That’s false. Their entire goal is humanitarian aid. The government alleged that, in fact, these groups are political actors with political goals.
It’s important to keep in mind when we’re talking about all of this that the deaths in the desert are the result of a policy that began some 25 years ago under the Clinton administration. It’s called prevention through deterrence. And under this strategy, migrant populations are funneled into the deadliest parts of the desert. And increasingly in the last several years, that’s been the Ajo corridor, where Scott lives and works.
And beginning in 2014, Scott brought together a sort of network of humanitarian aid groups in the area to really start focusing on this region. And what they uncovered was just a pattern of death and disappearance that really rivaled anything else in the Sonoran Desert. So they started going out, dropping water and looking, often, for people who were reported missing or bodies that were reported. And they contributed to a historic increase in the number of remains and bodies found in that region during that particular time period. As that happened, the government escalated its crackdown on their work.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I just want to turn to Amnesty International America’s director, who has called for Warren’s charges to be dropped in light of the mistrial. She said, in a statement, quote, “The mistrial in the case of Dr. Scott Warren sends a clear message that there are people in the U.S.A. who refuse to acquiesce to the government’s attempts to criminalize compassion and humanitarian aid. As long as the U.S.A. and Mexico fail to protect the lives of migrants and asylum seekers between the two countries, human rights defenders like Scott Warren must be allowed to continue their necessary and life-saving work, unhampered by politically motivated harassment and prosecution.” So, Ryan, what do you think happens now?
RYAN DEVEREAUX : Well, now we wait. We see if the government is going to retry this case or not. But we should note that Scott Warren’s prosecution takes place against a backdrop of targeting of humanitarian aid workers, immigrant rights advocates across the border. Just this year, earlier this year, we saw lawyers, activists, journalists in the Tijuana-San Diego area, who had worked with members of the migrant caravan, targeted by a sweeping intelligence-gathering operation carried out by CBP , ICE and law enforcement in that area. So this is not confined just to Scott’s case. It’s part of the broader crackdown on immigrants that we’ve seen under the Trump administration.
AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Devereaux, we want to thank you so much for being with us, staff reporter at The Intercept , where he covers immigration enforcement, the drug war and national security. His most recent article , which we will link to at democracynow.org, “Felony Trial of No More Deaths Volunteer Scott Warren Ends in Mistrial.” In May, he published “Bodies in the Borderlands,” an extensive investigation into Scott Warren’s case.

NERMEEN SHAIKH : We begin today’s show in Hong Kong, where authorities have shut down government offices and postponed debate in the Legislative Council, one day after riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray at tens of thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets to protest a bill that would allow the extradition of Hong Kong residents to mainland China. On Wednesday, demonstrators attempted to storm the Legislative Council Building, where lawmakers are debating the extradition bill. Human Rights Watch criticized Hong Kong authorities for using what it described as “excessive force” to suppress peaceful demonstrations. Protesters described the police using indiscriminate force.
KATY LAM : The Hong Kong police actually fired tear gas towards the crowd, while no people are showing any symptoms of attacking. So, they’re just doing it. We think that they are trying to oppress our rights of expressing our opinion, and actually oppressing the freedom.
AMY GOODMAN : This came days after as many as a million protesters marched in Hong Kong against the extradition bill Sunday. The protests are some of the largest Hong Kong has seen since before Britain’s handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Since then, Hong Kong has operated under a different legal and political system as mainland China, a setup known as “one country, two systems.” Critics of the extradition bill say it would infringe on Hong Kong’s independence and the legal and human rights of Hong Kong residents, as well as the people visiting Hong Kong.
We go now to Hong Kong, where we’re joined by Mary Hui. She’s a Hong-Kong based writer, reporter for the news outlet Quartz. She has reported on the extradition bill and has been covering the mass protests.
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Mary. Can you start off by talking about the significance of this bill that was passed? Just explain it.
MARY HUI : Sure, and thank you for having me, Amy.
The significance of this bill, really, is that it will threaten Hong Kong’s prized judicial and legal independence. It is as Chris Patten, the former governor, has said: There needs to be a firewall between Hong Kong’s legal system and China’s. And with this bill, should it be passed, that firewall will be done away with. And it means that it is—it will mean the death of “one country, two systems,” because there will no longer be this firewall, and people will be—there is the possibility that people will be able to be extradited to China to face charges, where they face an uncertain fate as to whether they will face a fair trial or even have their human rights protected.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Mary Hui, could you outline what the key features of this proposed amendment is—are?
MARY HUI : Sure. So, as the law currently stands, Hong Kong has signed extradition treaties with 20 other jurisdictions, the U.S. being one of them. And what this law is trying to do is to work around that. And under the current law, the People’s Republic of China is actually explicitly ruled out as a place that people can be extradited to, and so there is no extradition at all to China under the current law.
And last year, there was a murder case. A young Hong Kong couple traveled to Taiwan. The boyfriend was accused of murdering the girlfriend and fled back to Hong Kong. And because China sees Taiwan as part of the People’s Republic of China, there is no extradition between Hong Kong and Taiwan. And so, the Hong Kong government has then come around and said, well, there is this major loophole in that this suspected murderer is not able to face any charges and won’t face justice.
And so they took this opportunity to say, “We have to reform and amend this bill to make sure that this person can—this suspected murderer can face charges and be brought to justice. And how do we do this? We plug this loophole”—in the language of the government—”by doing away with the restriction of the People’s Republic of China and saying that there can be one-off extradition agreements between Hong Kong and China.”
AMY GOODMAN : I want to read a recent tweet from the exiled Chinese writer Ma Jian, wrote, on Twitter, said, “At the Hong Kong literary festival in November, a friend accompanied me at all times, for fear I’d be secretly kidnapped and smuggled to China. If the extradition law passes, any critic of Xi’s regime could be legally, openly abducted. It would be the end of freedom in Hong Kong,” Ma Jian said. Your response, Mary Hui?
MARY HUI : I think that is a very, very reasonable fear. And people are afraid of that, not just writers of Chinese descent, but also foreigners. Hong Kong is a financial hub, an international media hub. There are lots of human rights advocacy groups here. And for them, if it means doing—if doing their work means angering China, then they will very likely be accused of committing a certain crime, and China will be able to find a way to have them extradited to face charges in China, in mainland China. And so, what this means is that China will be able to use this bill as retaliation against opponents, whether it’s Hong Kong Chinese or foreigners who are traveling to or based in Hong Kong.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Mary, could you explain who’s behind this proposed amendment? And why is it being proposed now?
MARY HUI : Yes. So, really, who’s behind it is the Hong Kong government, but who’s behind the Hong Kong government is the Beijing government. The Hong Kong government has insisted that this is their own initiative. Chief Executive Carrie Lam has repeatedly said that, that this is her making, the Hong Kong government’s making, there is no instruction from the Chinese government, though the top official based in Hong Kong, the top Chinese official, has made the unusual move of trying to persuade Hong Kong politicians to back the extradition bill. So, as to whether China really isn’t behind this bill is uncertain, and I’m doubtful of that.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Could you describe, Mary, the kinds of the protests that are taking place and the violent crackdown by the police in Hong Kong against the protesters?
MARY HUI : Mm-hmm. So, the protesters started gathering outside the central government offices on Tuesday night, local time here. And overnight, their numbers grew. And so, by the time I arrived at the protest scene, at about 9 a.m. during rush-hour traffic, tens of thousands of people had gathered and taken over just vast swaths of this highway outside of the central government offices.
And so, from the looks of it, it was calm, quiet for much of the morning. I was there until about 2 p.m. And really all I saw were protesters being very well organized. They had set up supply stations. They were collecting umbrellas to repel against pepper spray and tear gas that they were expecting to be fired at them. They were collecting water and medical supplies. They were erecting barriers around the protest site. They were handing out masks to passersby. People were insisting that I take their masks, as a journalist, because they expected tear gas to be fired. And so, people were—there was this sense of camaraderie. There wasn’t too much really going on at that point. At points, there was a sense of tension as police and the protesters just stood 10 meters away from each other, the frontline of the protesters, police in riot gear. But really not much happened.
And it was not until around 3:30, local time here, that clashes broke out. I should say that by that time I had actually left the protest site. I had gone back to the newsroom for the rest of the day, so I did not personally see the clashes. But from what I’ve seen online, from videos that I’ve been watching, it really does not seem like protesters were the ones starting any kind of confrontation with the police. The police were trying to disperse them and ended up aggravating the crowd.
AMY GOODMAN : According to The New York Times , it’s estimated one in seven Hong Kong residents took part in Sunday’s protests. And in The New York Times on Monday, Hong Kong’s commissioner to the United States, Eddie Mak, outlined his government’s position, writing, “The Hong Kong government’s proposed amendments to extradition ilaws seek to enable us to effectively combat serious crimes by sealing the legal vacuum in our existing mechanism for surrendering fugitive offenders. They do not pinpoint any particular jurisdiction, nor do they target common citizens or affect the legal rights and freedoms of individuals.” If you could respond to that and the fact that the—what the Chinese authorities have done in the past, for example, the abducting of Hong Kong residents, five Hong Kong booksellers in 2015?
MARY HUI : Yes. There really is no trust of the Chinese government. With the protesters I’ve spoken to, that’s the one thing, really, that they have all mentioned, when I asked them, “What about the Hong Kong government’s amendments and assurances that your freedoms won’t be trampled upon?” And time and time again, the protesters tell me, “We don’t trust the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government. It’s all a bunch of lies.” And so, any assurance that the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly, as they exist in Hong Kong now, will not be trampled upon, I don’t think those assurances hold any water.
AMY GOODMAN : And those booksellers?
MARY HUI : And the booksellers, of course, there is that precedent of Chinese government coming in and essentially launching this global campaign, not just in Hong Kong, but elsewhere, of state-sponsored kidnapping. And so, with the booksellers, I think people have looked at that and seen how the Chinese government will behave without an extradition bill legalizing and legitimizing their behavior. And so, with the bill, I think what we’ll see is just this legitimizing of state-sponsored kidnapping, as some people have called it.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Mary, before we conclude, what do you expect to happen next? Will this amendment pass? And do you expect the protests to continue?
MARY HUI : Mm-hmm. So, the debate over the bill in the Legislature has been postponed until next week. It’s unsure whether protesters will come out again, though my gut feeling is that if the debate is to continue and a vote is taken—and if a vote is taken, it will very likely pass, given that the Legislature is stacked with pro-Beijing, pro-China parties and politicians. Should it pass, I’m sure the anger will boil over, the popular anger will boil over, and protesters will be out again to stand for their freedoms.
AMY GOODMAN : Mary Hui, I want to thank you for being with us, Hong-Kong based writer and reporter for the news outlet Quartz, reported on the extradition bill, has been covering the protests. We’ll continue, of course, to cover all.

Donald Trump Jr. was called before the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday to testify in a closed-door session about an email he received in the spring of 2016 from someone he believed to be a Russian government attorney promising “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. accepted the invitation and scheduled a meeting at Trump Tower with the official in June of 2016. Trump Says He’d Accept Dirt on Campaign Rivals from Foreigners Jun 13, 2019 Image Credit: ABC News
Meanwhile, President Trump said Wednesday he would accept damaging information on campaign rivals from foreign actors—and might not even alert the FBI about efforts by a foreign adversary to intervene in the U.S. election. Speaking with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in the Oval Office, Trump said his son was right not to inform the FBI about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting.
President Donald Trump : “I’ve seen a lot of things over my life. I don’t think in my whole life I’ve ever called the FBI . In my whole life. I don’t—you don’t call the FBI . You throw somebody out of your office. You do whatever you do.”
George Stephanopoulos : “Al Gore got a stolen briefing book. He called the FBI .”
President Donald Trump : “Well, that’s different, a stolen briefing book. This isn’t a stolen—this is somebody that said, 'We have information on your opponent.' Oh, let me call the FBI . Give me a break. Life doesn’t work that way.”
George Stephanopoulos : “The FBI director says that’s what should happen.”
President Donald Trump : “The FBI director is wrong.”
President Trump’s hand-picked FBI director, Christopher Wray, told Congress just last month that the bureau would want to know if a public official or a campaign was contacted by a foreign government seeking to interfere in an election. President Trump dismissed the notion, saying he would consider accepting “opposition research” if a foreign figure approached him. Topics:"

In Mexico, crime reporter Norma Sarabia was shot and killed in the southern state of Tabasco late Tuesday, becoming the sixth journalist to be assassinated in Mexico this year. Police say two masked men on a motorbike shot Sarabia repeatedly outside her home before fleeing the scene. In the neighboring state of Veracruz, armed men raided the home of journalist Marcos Miranda Cogco and kidnapped him. On Wednesday, Cogco’s wife pleaded for his return, noting he has received death threats for years over his critical reporting on local government officials. Reporters Without Borders has called Mexico the world’s deadliest country for media workers outside of an active war zone. Topics: "

In South Dakota, members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe on Monday turned around a truck believed to be carrying construction equipment for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. In a statement, Tribal Chair Harold Frazier said, “Any vehicles or personnel working on the Keystone XL pipeline are not welcome on this reservation. … This is Sioux Territory, we will not stand for more encroachments and defilement of our land.” The Keystone XL pipeline has long been opposed by environmentalists, farmers and Native Americans. If completed, the pipeline would carry oil from Canada’s tar sands region in Alberta to refineries as far away as the Gulf of Mexico. Topics: "
