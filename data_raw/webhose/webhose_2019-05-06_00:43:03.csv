Chastened by the long-awaited Mueller report – or at least what we’ve learned about the two-year probe into “Russiagate” from Attorney General William Barr – the U.S. corporate media have been forced to partially abandon their ludicrous claim of “collusion” between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Or maybe the hysteria-makers were finally exhausted by their marathon of lies. But the civil war within the U.S. ruling class will continue to simmer, because it is rooted in real contradictions – primarily, a fear that Trump cannot be depended on to keep up the momentum of President Obama’s global military offensive and thus disrupt the rise of China and its strategic ally, Russia.
The Lords of Capital are painfully aware that U.S. imperialism has been drained of whatever “soft” power it once had in the world and left with only two cards to play: multi-theater, unremitting military aggression and full-spectrum weaponization of the dollar. “Regime change” is the localized manifestation of Washington’s desperate bid to upend and disrupt the emerging new global order, as China returns to its historical place at the center of the world – the position it held when Columbus embarked on his pillages. Therefore, although Donald Trump has gotten a respite from Mueller, the orchestrated demonization of Russia, China, Venezuela, Syria and “socialism” will remain the daily fare of the U.S. propaganda machine that masquerades as journalism. In other words, a step back to “normal.” “U.S. imperialism has been drained of whatever ‘soft’ power it once had in the world.”
The New York Times can thus continue to personalize its New Cold War hysteria with Putin-bashing – while leaving Trump out of it. For example, in an article this week titled “ Russia’s Military Mission Creep Advances to a New Front: Africa ,” the Times claims that “expanding Moscow’s military sway on the continent reflects Mr. Putin’s broader vision of returning Russia to its former glory.” The piece is sheer polemics disguised as journalism, citing recent Russian military “cooperation with Guinea, Burkina Faso, Burundi and Madagascar” and Russian “major oil and gas interests in Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Libya, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda and Nigeria” as grave threats to stability in Africa. Yet, i n a 1,500 word article, the Times fails to even mention AFRICOM {see their website , and Wikipedia ), the U.S. military command that has virtually occupied the entire continent since its inception in 2008, climaxing with President Obama’s 2011 assault on Libya that plunged the whole northern tier of the region into flames.
By 2017, according to journalist Nick Turse , AFRICOM was “conducting 3,500 exercises, programs, and engagements per year, an average of nearly 10 missions per day, on the African continent…” a “signal of America’s deepening and complicated ties” in Africa. “In a 1,500 word article, the Times fails to even mention AFRICOM, the U.S. military command that has virtually occupied the entire continent.”
Nothing Russia has done in Africa comes close to Washington’s deep penetration of the continent, yet the Times writes that “the United States military has a relatively light footprint across Africa.” The U.S. and Europe fund and oversee every African “peace-keeping” mission, including the conflict in Somalia, where the CIA directs a full-scale drone war that has been dramatically escalated under President Trump .
In the eight years that Barack Obama was president, “AFRICOM went from three military bases to 84 bases” on the continent, said Paul Pumphrey , co-founder of Friends of Congo . Six million Congolese have died as a result of interventions by neighboring, U.S.-backed regimes in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, with the full complicity of Washington. Under U.S. and Israeli tutelage, Africa’s largest nation, Sudan, was split in two in 2011, only to see South Sudan erupt in a civil war two years later that has killed nearly 400,00 people . The United States and France overcame their imperial rivalry in Africa and have partnered to occupy Mali and Niger, where four U.S. Special Forces troops were killed in 2017 and the U.S. is building a huge drone base , to be staffed by at least 800 American personnel. “Six million Congolese have died as a result of interventions by neighboring, U.S.-backed regimes in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.”
The U.S. military footprint is heavier and wider, by far, than any other nation, but Times reporter Eric Schmitt apparently feels confident in stating, as fact, that the U.S. has a “light footprint” in Africa because that’s what AFRICOM’s top brass has been saying since 2012 . Therefore, it must be true despite the numbers that say differently. Nick Turse, whose reporting got him black-balled by AFRICOM’s high command, wrote in 2018 that the U.S. maintained “ 34 sites scattered across the continent, with high concentrations in the north and west as well as the Horn of Africa.” The biggest military facility is located in Djibouti, a desperately poor country that has been turned into a foreign base farm for the U.S., France, Italy, Saudi Arabia Japan and China – Beijing and Tokyo’s only bases in Africa, purportedly to patrol against piracy on the Somali coast.
Russia has no bases in Africa , but is said to be exploring establishing one in the Central African Republic, the former French colony where the U.S. briefly imprisoned Haitian president Jean Bertrand Aristide after overthrowing his elected government in 2004 . The talks between Moscow and Bangui have caused consternation in Washington and Paris, anxieties that have been relayed to the New York Times with full confidence that the paper’s private sector propagandists are better liars than any military press spokesperson. The Times dutifully writes that France’s minister of armed forces is unhappy. “We feel very much concerned by the growing Russian influence in a country that we know well, the Central African Republic,” Florence Parly told reporters during a recent visit to Washington.
France knows the country well because it oppressed and exploited the Central African people for generations – an expertise that white Americans tend to respect. “Djibouti, a desperately poor country that has been turned into a foreign base farm.”
So, Africa is swarming with U.S. troops stationed at bases throughout the continent, second only to the French presence in the region, but the Times can say with a straight face that the U.S. Africa Command has a “light footprint,” while the baseless Vladimir Putin dreams of “of returning Russia to its former glory” through “a more militaristic approach in Africa,” in the words of an American general. There should be little doubt that Russia, the second biggest arms merchant in the world, behind the U.S., is actively seeking African markets for its weapons. What scares the U.S. is that African nations like Guinea, Burkina Faso, Burundi and Madagascar want to do arms and training deals with Russia, to diversity their defense suppliers and create a “multi-polar” environmentin Africa.
U.S. imperialism tolerates only one pole – its own – and instructs its media mouthpieces to vilify all competitors. But the U.S. cannot compete economically with Russia’s partner, China, whose trade with Africa surpassed the United States in 2009. African states are eager to become part of China’s New Silk Road , or Belt and Road Initiative, the world’s greatest public works, transportation and trade project, which offers Africa unprecedented “connectivity” to the planet’s economic center in the East. The U.S. has nothing to offer Africa but guns, drones and an extended half-life for the neocolonial order – and Russia can cut a better deal on the guns. “Amid the imperial rot, the oligarchs turns on each other, as they did in 2016 in a fit of panic called Russiagate.”
The New York Times and the rest of the corporate media tell tales that only Americans believe, in service of a crumbling imperial, racist order. The U.S. media bubble is a scary place, populated by demons and villains that are determined to steal or destroy an “American way of life” that most Americans – especially Black folks – have never lived.
Having nothing to offer the people but endless war and austerity, the Lords of Capital invent enemies, complete with full-blown fictitious pathologies, conjured histories and fabricated motives. Amid the imperial rot, the oligarchs turns on each other, as they did in 2016 in a fit of panic called Russiagate. A Deep State referee named Mueller has called for a pause in the fratricide among the corporate brethren, but that can only signal an intensification of the lies that corporate media tell against external “enemies” and actual dissidents on home front.
In decline, the Lords of Capital have no good stories to tell. To the extent that they control the domestic narrative, everything becomes slander. – About the author

"Annually after #MeToo scandal, Authorities are faced by Wynn Resorts",www.dailypolitical.com,Stacy Sanders,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/07/annually-after-metoo-scandal-authorities-are-faced-by-wynn-resorts.html,"FY2021 EPS Estimates for ADMA Biologics Inc (ADMA) Lowered by Analyst Annually after #MeToo scandal, Authorities are faced by Wynn Resorts April 7th, 2019 - Comments Off on Annually after #MeToo scandal, Authorities are faced by Wynn Resorts - Filed Under - by Stacy Sanders Tweet
Wynn Resorts has taken laudable measures to change a culture that enabled sexual misconduct complaints from its creator to remain concealed for decades, business experts and women’s rights advocates say.
And following casino mogul Steve Wynn became the first CEO to resign over allegations of misconduct from the #MeToo era while the business is making progress more, experts say the company may do more to make a office environment that is new. Get alerts:
The specialists praised for more women to leadership posts, Wynn Resorts . They applauded the company for ousting each executive who knew about allegations but failed to report them, and developing an independent committee to review sexual harassment claims directed by a former Boston police commissioner. “That sends a message that you are not likely to endure enablers.
The organization’s new controls are summarized in an document Wynn Resorts filed to Massachusetts casino authorities before a crucial series of public hearings this past week.
Wynn Resorts no more prohibits confidentiality in sexual harassment claims, meaning current and former employees are now able to go public with their claims.
Chang explained that’s a movement in the right direction, however noted Google, Facebook, both Microsoft along with other notable companies now give workers the decision to resolve their case publicly in court instead of through the private arbitration process typical at many companies, including at Wynn.
Since the provider will get the upper hand, private arbitration is problematic, she explained.
“There are not many rules in mediation, and studies have shown that the company wins the vast majority of the moment,” Chang explained. “Payouts are also generally lower compared to awards in courtso the victim won’t get as much in damages probably.”
Wynn Resorts spokesman Michael Weaver acknowledged the organization’s approach differs from these other firms but thinks it will be”equally effective.”
“Our goal of not protecting sexual harassers is the very same,” he explained.
The experts stated Wynn Resorts must also spell out how it make the findings public — and will be assessing and measuring its new policies.
Gambling regulators may even need other and Wynn casino companies record reports, proposed corporate governance specialist at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, Jason Schloetzer.
Weaver explained the firm has enlisted Great Places To operate, a firm that conducts workplace research and surveys, to evaluate its progress in improving the workplace environment and worker satisfaction.
In addition, he said the company has received 22 substantiated cases involving guests or employees, that have been solved through some form of disciplinary action or elimination since sexual harassment trainings were conducted by it in June.
To be sure, the experts said Wynn Resorts should be praised for new efforts meant to promote greater female leaders in the company, like starting an internal”women’s management council” and commissioning studies to analyze pay differences between female and male employees.
But it also should take other steps, like ensuring girls have access to crucial”stepping stone tasks” which can cause leadership functions, said Jennifer Chatman, a management professor in the University of California-Berkeley company school.
“The hospitality business doesn’t have some of the gender pipeline inequities of different domains like high tech and investment banking,” she said. “This should be a place where girls should happen to be excelling for a while.”
Weaver noted a third of the business’s executives are women, compared to the 25 percent average for other businesses.
And as it makes internal reforms, Wynn Resorts must make certain it is not addressing sexual misconduct in isolation, but handling other common workplace issues, such as racial discrimination, stated Maya Raghu, of the National Women’s Law Center, that helped create a legal fund to assist women litigate sexual misconduct complaints in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement.
“These items are all connected,” she explained. “They are symptoms of a larger workplace culture problem.”
Weaver stated Wynn Resorts recently caused an outside expert to conduct distinct trainings “unconscious prejudice,” or discrimination based on a person’s race, sex and sexual orientation or faith.
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission is holding hearings into how the company managed the misconduct allegations, which Steve Wynn has strongly denied discuss and to launch findings from the months-long investigation.
The hearings have implications for the company’s nation casino license and the $2.6 billion luxury resort just outside Boston it’s slated to open in June.
Wynn Resorts recently went through an identical process where it had been passed a 20 million fine but allowed to retain its license.
Only time will tell just how much the firm has changed, Irrespective of what happens in Massachusetts, ” said advocate Gina Scaramella.
One of the prominent musicians calling to remove the title of Steve Wynn from the Massachusetts casino, she had been as director of the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center. The company did, re-christening that the Everett growth Encore Boston Harbor.
Since the scandal broke, the organization of Scaramella helped review harassment policies and has sponsored harassment trainings. She said what she has seen up to now encouraged her.
“I have the sense that they need to do this right,” Scaramella stated. We are going to be seeing”

By the time they’re in the 8th grade, they’re 46th or 47th, and then upon 11th grade testing they’re near last."" — Mitch Carmichael on Thursday, February 14th, 2019 in an interview with WV MetroNews Have West Virginia test scores tended to drop after 4th grade? By Al Bernardi on Wednesday, April 3rd, 2019 at 6:49 p.m. Students Toni Campbell, left, and Rashawn Brooks discuss a student mentoring program at Mount View High School in Welch, W.Va., in 2015. (AP)
The president of the West Virginia state Senate, Mitch Carmichael, recently said that students in the state consistently rank well below students elsewhere when comparing test scores.
Carmichael made the comments in an interview with Hoppy Kercheval of WV MetroNews Talkline on Feb. 14, 2019. He was discussing the then-current Senate Bill 451 and what the bill could offer both teachers and students. At one point he called improving the state’s education system a moral imperative.
In West Virginia, he said, ""our students enter in at fourth grade the first time they’re tested, 37th or 38th in the nation—which is not good, but it’s not horrible. By the time they’re in the 8th grade, they’re 46th or 47th, and then upon 11th grade testing they’re near last."" . @SenCarmichaelWV joins @HoppyKercheval to explain his thoughts on the @wvhouse ’s version of the omnibus education bill. WATCH: https://t.co/wkudfIAoe1 pic.twitter.com/90qJg2JDZY — MetroNews (@WVMetroNews) February 14, 2019
Is that correct? We took a closer look. (We reached out to Carmichael, but he did not respond.)
We turned to the Nation’s Report Card , an archive of National Assessment of Educational Progress test scores. NAEP was first administered in 1969 and is the largest continuing, nationally representative assessment of student achievement in such subjects as math, reading, science, and writing
The Nation’s Report Card allows users to compare specific states to the nation as a whole in a variety of subjects. This is the main interactive page for West Virginia’s state comparisons .
The Nation’s Report Card looks at math and reading scores and organizes states into three categories: ""higher"" than the target state, ""not significantly different"" than the target state, and ""lower"" than the target state. Here’s a chart showing West Virginia’s ranking for fourth graders. The figure shown is the number of states ranked ""higher"" than West Virginia in the year noted.
By this data, Carmichael is generally in the right ballpark, though scores in recent years have had a wider range than he suggested -- from 30 to 41, rather than 37 or 38.
Here’s the chart for eighth graders:
For eighth grade, the rankings aren’t quite as low as Carmichael had indicated, but he does have the general trend line correct: In most cases, West Virginia’s ranking dropped in math and reading between fourth and eighth grade.
What about testing near the end of high school? The data that’s available makes it difficult to say.
There are only two years for which data is available at all -- and for those years, not every state took part.
So while it looks like West Virginia improved dramatically by the end of high school, there were actually so few states participating that each of these rankings represents a last-place slot for that year.
Superficially, this supports Carmichael’s assertion -- that by the end of high school West Virginia students are ""near last."" But since about two-thirds of the states didn’t participate, we really don’t know for sure how well or poorly West Virginia ranked among all 50 states. Our ruling
Carmichael said that in West Virginia, ""our students enter in at fourth grade the first time they’re tested, 37th or 38th in the nation—which is not good, but it’s not horrible. By the time they’re in the 8th grade, they’re 46th or 47th, and then upon 11th grade testing they’re near last.""
Judging by the past six years of NAEP rankings, Carmichael’s specific figures are slightly off for fourth and eighth grades, but the trend he points out -- a decline for West Virginia between fourth and eighth grades -- is accurate and consistent.
As for the end of high school, however, while West Virginia does drop to last among participating states, that finding is undercut by the reality that most states did not take part in the testing. That makes it difficult to know how well West Virginia fared nationally.

Ricky Gervais has gone back to his tried and tested formula in After Life . Saw all 6 episodes of the first series last night. He is one of the few comedians that can transcend humour into real life. His dead pan performance was so life like. It is utterly believable. Typically British too.

Israel’s 2019 Eurovision contestant, Kobi Marimi, gave the live debut performance of his song “Home” in Amsterdam on Saturday evening.Marimi joined 27 other Eurovision competitors – as well as Israel’s 1998 winner, Dana International – at the “Eurovision in Concert” event in Amsterdam. “I cannot believe it’s just happened,” Marimi wrote on Instagram after taking the stage. “I performed in front of five thousand beautiful, supportive Eurovision fans... Thank you Amsterdam, it was a great pleasure. See u [sic] all soon in my #HOME.”Marimi was the first performer to take the stage Saturday evening, and started with a slight technical problem. The singer could not hear the track in his earpiece, and he stopped singing until it could be fixed. But once he returned to the song, his powerful vocals impressed the crowd, who awarded him with loud applause.“Thank you so much,” he told the crowd, wiping away a tear. “I’ll see you all in my home: in Israel, in Tel Aviv, in May.”While “Home” hasn’t received much acclaim in Israel, global Eurovision fans are much more appreciative of the song, and enjoyed hearing it live.“He dares to dream. He dares to sing,” tweeted the popular Eurovision site wiwibloggs. “And tonight @KobiMarimi did both at #Eurovision in Concert in Amsterdam. YES!”And YouTuber The Lethargic Sloth gave the live performance a similarly rave review.“It just sounded phenomenal, the highs were where they needed to be, the lows were where they needed to be, he had that projection,” he said. “I think that’s going to help him immensely raise up in the standings... I’ve been saying for a long time that hearing him live is going to change his fate.”

Let us leave the political issue & go to the financial.
The damn leftist fools at the financial top are cutting their own throats & destroying their own assets.
They are lost in their crazy New World Order dream,....A dream which is just a David Rockefeller fantasy,Rockefeller is dead & buried & the NWO will soon follow him into the ground!
The economy,as it now exists, is dependent upon Consumerism (70%of the total economy) & the average middle class American is the main retail consumer.
If they killed off the Middle Class they will have killed off most of the customers for their giant businesses.
These same businesses will go bankrupt for lack of paying customers & these billionaires will go broke as their assets disappear.
The American consumer is the Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs & if the financiers & Tech giants kill the Goose they will get no more Golden Eggs,...They will lose their shirts."

This is true. To make matters worse, many have not even completed primary school. For example, here's a statistic from Honduras that I found when I was researching the contribution of population growth in Central America to illegal immigration. (I've read that 70% of illegal immigrants in the current wave are from there.);
""As of 2001, only one-third of all women aged 20–24 (and only one-seventh of those in rural areas) had completed primary school.""
https://www.guttmacher.org/report/early-childbearing-honduras-continuing-challenge
BTW, population growth clearly plays a role, but you have to dig into the academic literature to find it, as it seems to be a taboo topic in the MSM. Central American population growth and lifespans started to take off in the 50's due to increased access to Western medical care, mostly via Western aid. They did not drop their birth rates enough to compensate. Now it only takes 22-24 years for their populations to double, depending on the country. In contrast, it takes 116 years for the U.S. population to double, because we have lower birth rates.

The ""elites"" being that small group of super-wealthy, extremely powerful people - like Warren Buffett - who either own or run virtually everything of note in our society.
If memory serves, in that same interview/conversation, Buffett bragged about paying less in taxes than his secretary (executive assistant)"

I've no use for burkas other than as grease rags in the shop, but I can and DO patronise the taquería in the barrio, thus it benefits me. I have also driven the truck that brings the whole corn to the tortillería (which was grown in Iowa), and when the mercado grows big enough they start putting their tortillas in the bigger store where I also buy.... and they shop for a lot of their ingredients for their burritos, tingas, moles, etc, at the same place I do, gringo owned. And some of them when their language skills improve enough, actually end up working at the big store where I shop for most of my own food.
In my area over the past thirty years I've seen a Dad and his two sons, maybe 14 and 16, drive around in an old Ford beater station wagon doing people's lawns. They hit the ground runing, do up the whole place in fifteen minutes, collect their $40 and drive down the street to the next one, same gig. After a couple years they have a much newer station wagon, then a small trailer, Next thing, they've got TWO statioin wagons, and a younger brother added. Another few years they've got half a dozen trucks, nice clean ones, and are THE yard maintanence outfit in the area. They are well spoken, dress nice, do top quality work for the best price in town, and often will do little add ons at no extra charge. The yards they care for are always neat, orderly healthy. I've watched a family from Oaxaca Mexico come in, start a small taquería the kids tending tables, cooking, Mamacita at the counter, after a few yars they sold the whole operation to the big guys in town who serve gringo food style ""mexican"", then went and started another new place. Best Mexican food in the area, and I KNOW Mexican food. I've seen then start small one man show businesses, and grow them to multilocationi outfits that prosper and do good work.
Those that WANT to come and jin in the American Dream are assets to all of us. Its the freeloaders, welfare queens, lazybums tht need filtered out.

That became the cry from those wanting to take the country away from the Americans. This is what the NWO was doing to those of us that opposed their agenda,the ones in the D group took up that stance and began calling for all the illegals to come on in and they would be protected. It seems that the Mexicans forgot that they stole this land from the Indians already here,we weren't the first to clash with the Indians. The Spaniards and the French came too and wanted the land for themselves so they were warring even before our time. Then when those people that came for religious freedom were here all were fighting each other. This land has been in everyone's hands and the land was divided up by wars being fought and then boundaries were given so the winner would know that what he fought for was his,the losers got the other land so his boundaries were set too. God saw war in times of the Bible that were fought for the same reasons but it was He that helped the winners so he could have His will done. God was with the new Americans in all that they fought against and when the borders were set He gave the command for others not to move ancient bou decries. So we as Americans own this part of this land and He gave the other part to the Mexicans."

In less than 20 years, if we do not stop the invasion, ILLEGAL aliens and their offspring will be the dominant population in the United States.

Instead of five cashiers taking your order and money--there's one; perhaps two people taking your money. Soon, the computer kiosk will also take your money and you'll pick your food order off the conveyer belt.
