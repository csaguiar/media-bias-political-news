Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell were verbally denied access into the Homestead temporary shelter for unaccompanied migrant children last Monday by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Miami Herald reports . The big picture: The congresswomen say HHS is in violation of a law passed last year that says members of Congress can’t be prevented from entering ""any U.S. facility used for maintaining custody of or otherwise housing unaccompanied alien children"" for oversight purposes. HHS said they require a two-week visit notification from visitors. The for-profit Homestead facility, owned by Comprehensive Health Services, is the largest shelter for migrant children in the country, as reported by NPR . "

I hate white supremacists as much as I have any of the other tribal supremacists. However, since WW2, the white tribalists have been censored the most. The other tribes' supremacists have been elevated.
When you inflate the importance of every other type but one, and delegitimize the one; you have counter-intuitively hyper-legitimized the one you were targeting. Unless you wipe them out first. And genocide doesn't work! Thankfully!
However, for the past several decades, we have only stigmatized the one. None of the others. They could say and do anything they wanted. While silencing the one group at will. It never works out well!
White people have not had the ""right"" to collectively bargain. To literally unionize! They are about to do so in quick fashion!"

The Myth of Meritocracy,www.opednews.com,Robert B. Reich,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Myth-of-Meritocracy-by-Robert-B-Reich-Children_College_Education_Inequality-190407-361.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
Most Americans still cling to the meritocratic notion that people are rewarded according to their efforts and abilities. But meritocracy is becoming a cruel joke.
The Justice Department recently announced indictments of dozens of wealthy parents for using bribery and fraud to get their children into prestigious colleges.
But the real scandal isn't how far a few wealthy parents will go to get their kids admitted (apparently $1.2 million in illegal payoffs), but how commonplace it has become for them to go almost as far without breaking any laws shelling out big bucks for essay tutors, testing tutors, admissions counselors, and ""enrichment"" courses (not to mention sky-high tuition at private schools feeding into the Ivy League). - Advertisement -
Inequality is lurking behind all this, and not just because the wealthy can afford it. Researchers Daniel Schneider, Orestes Hastings, and Joe LaBriola found that in states with the biggest gaps between rich and poor, well-to-do parents spend the most trying to get their children into elite colleges.
America's unprecedented concentration of wealth combined with seemingly bottomless poverty have increased parental anxiety raising the stakes, and the competition, for admission.
While some entrepreneurs in America's billionaire class lack a prestigious degree, it's become harder to become a run-of-the-mill multimillionaire in America without one. - Advertisement -
Most CEOs of big corporations, Wall Street mavens, and high-priced lawyers got where they are because they knew the right people. A prestigious college packed with the children of wealthy and well-connected parents is now the launching pad into the stratosphere of big money.
Elite colleges are doing their parts to accelerate the trend.
At a time when the courts have all but ended affirmative action for black children seeking college admission, high-end universities provide preferential admission to the children of wealthy alumni ""legacies,"" as they're delicately called.
Some prestigious colleges have even been known to make quiet deals with wealthy non-alums admission for their kids with the expectation of a large donation to follow.
Jared Kushner's father reportedly pledged $2.5 million to Harvard just as young Jared was applying. The young man gained admission, despite rather mediocre grades.
About four in 10 students from the richest one-tenth of one percent of American families now attend an Ivy League or other elite university, according to a recent study based on millions of anonymous tax filings and tuition records. - Advertisement -
At some upscale campuses including Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, Penn, and Brown more students now come from the top 1 percent than from the entire bottom 60 percent put together.
By contrast, less than one-half of 1 percent of children from the bottom fifth of American families attend an elite college. Fewer than half attend any college at all."

He's a murderer.
""Even if he's a one-term president, Trump will have caused, directly or indirectly, the premature deaths of a large number of Americans, writes Paul Krugman of The New York Times.
Some of those deaths will come at the hands of right-wing, white nationalist extremists, who are a rapidly growing threat , partly because they feel empowered by a president who calls them "" very fine people ."" - Advertisement -
Some will come from failures of governance, like the inadequate response to Hurricane Maria, which surely contributed to the high death toll in Puerto Rico. (Reminder: Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.)
Some will come from the administration's continuing efforts to sabotage Obamacare, which have failed to kill health reform but have stalled the decline in the number of uninsured, meaning that many people still aren't getting the health care they need. Of course, if Trump gets his way and eliminates Obamacare altogether, things on this front will get much, much worse.
In America, all but seven states have laws that consider anyone who is involved in actions that result in needless death can be charged with murder.
Trump's actions result in unnecessary and needless deaths throughout America. Thousands of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico died because Trump intentionally delayed needed rescue efforts during disasters.
Thousands have been slaughtered by the heinous white supremacists Trump emboldened by his unwillingness to condemn their actions and called them, as Krugman noted, ""very fine people.""
Elsewhere in the world, Trump's unflinching support for a murderous leader like Russia's Vladimir Putin put a U.S. Seal of Approval on the deaths of thousands of Russian dissidents. - Advertisement -
The same can be said of Trump's support of North Korea's homicidal ""Supreme Leader"" Kim Jong-un, or his nasty habit of looking the other way at the dismemberment and murder of Jamal Khashoggi, an American citizen, by a Saudi Prince who helped the Trump family make millions on building projects.
Trump's sleazy cutback on federal regulations on the meat industry has increased deaths from food-borne illness and the hundred of deaths from just two recent crashes of Boeing 737 Max 8 jetliners are tracing back to cutbacks by FAA regulation of the airline industry. Trump put a former Boeing senior officer in charge of the FAA."
