The “Build a Wall” shtick was a great presidential campaign applause line, particularly since Mexico was going to pay for it. But post-election wall talk was more infrequent, being no longer needed for crowd yuks. Successive budgets came and went with Congress refusing to fund a joke line, and Trump just shrugged his shoulders with indifference. In late 2018, he announced agreement to a budget reconciliation bill with all his customary bombast. But what followed was an afternoon/evening of flaming anger by toxic Right infotainment types like Coulter, Ingraham, and Limbaugh.
That was enough. Within 24hrs he reversed his “position” a full 180 degrees and refused to support the budget bill he just praised. Then came the longest shutdown in history – over a wall ignored the first half of his presidency. Congress refused to fund the wall to bring the shutdown to a close, and refused to fund the wall in the negotiations which followed. This resulted in the phony emergency declaration.
So Trump trashes the constitutional principle of congressional appropriations authority and all his lickspittles applaud. But this institutional damage isn’t over an emergency, or even an imaginary emergency. It’s because Trump feared the docile sheep comprising his political base were restless, and he wildly panicked.
And we have to make critical constitutional law from that, a weak-willed man’s blind panic….."

Wade.
The Due Process Clause lacks “prenatal application.” But if it nonetheless applies full-force in the abortion context to everyone born who might merely be affected by an abortion, they could sue and have their cases tied up in the courts indefinitely, or at least until the pregnancy comes to term and the case is moot.
It seems to me that a service provider who merely publishes comments without editorial control has diminished First Amendment rights, as the person to be sued, the one who is responsible, is supposed to be the poster, not the service provider. So if the poster has no First Amendment rights, I think the plaintiff may have a good claim.
You could reach a similar result alternatively by making it a matter of statutory interpretation, saying that the substance of the Copyright statute is narrowed by the First Amendment, but that same statute applies equally narrowly everywhere.
But this sort of you-can-get-around-the-limit-on-applicability-by-saying-It-applies-if-anyone-applicable-is-affected merely provides a recipe for overturning Roe v. Wade by getting around the limit on the Due Process Clause’s applicability to a fetus. If Roe is good law, this can’t be the right decision. And vice versa."

John McCain Recited Names Of Dictators During Trump Inaugural, Senator Says

If I had been old enough to vote in 2008, I would have voted for Obama over McCain. I would not, however, have called McCain racist, or compared him to Hitler. Because he was one of the last decent, patriotic Republicans — before most of the party embraced white nationalism and sold out to Russia.

I supported what Obama wanted to do in Libya–I just opposed it on the grounds that he was violating the Constitution. It is unnecessary to pretend that what the president is doing is constitutional just because you support it. I’m also a qualified open borders guy. Just because I don’t like the president deporting dreamers doesn’t mean I have to pretend the the president exempting people from the rules of naturalization is perfectly constitutional.
Things are true or false regardless of whether we like the implications.
Meanwhile, we lose support for our arguments when we bury them in bullshit, and pretending that the president granting a two year exemption to the rules of naturalization as set by Congress isn’t the president messing with the rules of naturalization is burying your argument in bullshit."

“NEW YORK (AP) — Did you get a 7% raise last year? Congratulations, yours was in line with what CEOs at the biggest companies got. But for chief executives, that 7% was roughly $800,000.
Pay for CEOs at S&P 500 companies rose to a median of $12 million last year, including salary, stock and other compensation, according to data analyzed by Equilar for The Associated Press.”

Note ‘the workers’ were not shorted, and in fact, got the same rate of increase, but since the CEO started at a higher amount, that’s ‘unfair’!
Also note that AP payed someone to provide provenance for this bullshit."

The opinion is actually worse than that. This judge does not understand the fourth factor of the fair use doctrine. (She properly found the first three factors weigh in favor of fair use.) The fourth factor is “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.” IOW, if the use takes away from the market for the copyrighted work, that weighs against fair use.
But, and this is critical, case law (IIRC the Supreme Court already has said this), this only means effects based on substitution of the copied work for the copyright owner’s work . It does not mean detracting from the market value based on criticism.
Two examples illustrate this. If I post a movie on Youtube and then the studio loses revenue because people watch it there free, that weighs against fair use. That is a substitution loss.
But if I write a negative review about a movie, and take snippets of it as part of my review, and then the revenues go down because people say, hey, that critic says the movie stinks, so I am going to watch something else, that is NOT a negative effect that counts for fair use.
This is a classic case of fair use, and a classic case of abuse of copyright to silence criticism. Shame on the judge for blowing this.
I read the opinion. Nothing there indicates that the JW’s are going to lose anything because of substitution. The copyrighted work is an advertisement (they don’t sell it for money like a movie). And the harm of traffic to their website is from criticism, not substitution."

Taking away someone’s guns or prohibiting them from owning or using them is just one of many things that will be justified using arbitrary mental health criteria.

Yes, they did. By only allowing around 400K deportations, they granted amnesty to all the illegals who weren’t in the 400K selected for deportation. They ALSO didn’t specify how to select which 400K illegals get a deportation hearing, and which don’t, leaving that as an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Mr. Obama inherited a system that prioritized deportation hearings for three classes: Illegals convicted of crimes, recent arrivals, and repeat deportees. Anybody in one of those classes goes to the front of the line for a deportation hearing, anyone not in one of those classes goes to the end.
Remember when there was a surge of unaccompanied minors at the border? President Obama went to Congress and asked for authority to hold more deportation hearings to deal with the increase. The Republican-led Congress chose to ignore the request, not even holding a hearing on the matter."
