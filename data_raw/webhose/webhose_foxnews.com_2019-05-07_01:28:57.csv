Tara Aven, 46, left, and Briar Aven, 24, right, were arrested Tuesday for allegedly killing the family's grandmother and cashing her monthly checks, police said. (Yavapai County Sheriff's Office) An Arizona mother and daughter were arrested Tuesday for allegedly killing the family’s 77-year-old grandmother two years ago and continuing to cash monthly checks in her name, authorities said. Tara Aven, 46, and Briar Aven, 24, were taken into custody after officers conducted a welfare check at Sandra Aven’s home in Prescott, police said. A concerned neighbor told police he hadn’t seen the 77-year-old in a long time and was worried about her.

When police questioned Briar Aven, who lived next door to the elderly women with her mother, who is Sandra’s daughter, she said her grandmother was ""out of town and unavailable,"" police said.
Investigators found several inconsistencies in both women’s stories and entered the home, where they found the body of a deceased person believed to be Sandra Aven, the Arizona Republic reported. The body has yet to be positively identified and there was no information on a cause of death.
While being interviewed by police, the mother and daughter allegedly confessed to killing Sandra Aven in late 2017 and cashing numerous monthly payment checks in her name since then, KNXV-TV of Phoenix reported.

Gypsy Rose Lee’s son recalls moment he discovered Hollywood filmmaker Otto Preminger was his real father,www.foxnews.com,Stephanie Nolasco,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gypsy-rose-lees-son-recalls-moment-he-discovered-hollywood-filmmaker-otto-preminger-was-his-real-father,"“Like almost any 17-year-old I suppose, I wanted a car,” the now-74-year-old recalled to Fox News. “But… my mother wouldn’t get it for me. So I went to the man whose name was on my birth certificate, who I understood was my father, although I already heard some rumors. I asked him for money to buy a car. I was seeing a therapist at the time ... and the next time I saw my therapist he said Mr. Kirkland wanted me to know that he was not my father and he couldn’t give me a car. So that got the ball rolling.” Preminger’s life from the beginning was far from ordinary. His mother was world-famous striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee , whose life inspired the Broadway musical “Gypsy” and the 1962 film carrying the same title starring Natalie Wood . Decades later, in 1984, he would publish the memoir “Gypsy and Me” about growing up with the star (the book was republished in 2004 with the title “My G-String Mother” ).
On Wednesday, April 10th, Preminger is presenting “At Home and on the Road with Gypsy Rose Lee” at the Hollywood Heritage Museum , which highlights his personal home movies featuring his late mother. Burlesque star Dita Von Teese , who has named Lee as one of her inspirations, will be in attendance to participate in an interview with Preminger. The event will also kick off the 2019 Turner Classic Movies (TCM) Film Festival, which opens in Hollywood the following day.
While Lee wasn’t afraid to bare nearly all on stage, she initially refused to reveal the identity of Preminger’s father.

“When I finally confronted my mother with this and asked her who my father was, she said she wasn’t going to tell me,” chuckled Preminger. “‘None of your business’ is the way she put it.”

“When I was 6 months old, my mother put me next to her on the front seat of the car and drove to Cleveland where she was playing an engagement,” said Preminger. “I was with her constantly until I was 13. And then whenever she worked in the summers until I was 17, I was by her side.”
“When did I realize she was different? Probably around five, but it wasn’t the kind of realization you would expect,” continued Preminger. “Whatever kids do on a daily basis, that’s normal. If that means being backstage and helping your mom change from one scene to the next, well, that’s normal too!”
Preminger described Lee as a doting mother who always took him on tour. And while he was exposed to the racy world of nightclubs before turning double digits, he also witnessed what made his mother a sought-after stage star.

“What made her different really from the beginning of her career in burlesque was that she had these comedic routines that she would recite as she was taking off her clothes,” said Preminger. “... So at the end of the act, she still had on her outer dress and her blouse, which covered her breasts... So you never really saw her. There would be a brief flash at the end where she pulled the dress away and go behind the curtain. But that was the finale.”
“I never try to stir up the animal in them,” Lee once said about her fans, as reported by The New York Times . “Did you ever, hold a piece of candy or a toy in front of a baby — just out of his reach. Notice how he laughs. That’s your strip audience… Bare flesh bores men.”

Preminger said that as a teen, he was determined to learn who his real father was. And after Lee extracted a promise from her son that he would never contact him, Preminger learned that his father was Hollywood filmmaker Otto Preminger .
“I was raised in nightclubs,” said Preminger. “I hardly went to the movies…. I had never seen one of my father’s pictures. I barely knew the name.”

According to Preminger, Otto knew Lee had given birth to his child in 1944. By 1948, Lee was married to her third husband, Julio De Diego, a Spanish artist who “banished” Otto from the household.
“He didn’t like Otto coming around,” said Preminger. “And although Otto had offered to help support me, my mother refused. She really wanted to be the one who raised me. She wasn’t one for dividing authority… And as for why she kept [the paternity] a secret, given her profession, given the era, it would have been a horrible scandal.”
“… After a couple of minutes, she suggested we take a walk — we being Otto and me. Otto loved to walk. We’re getting ready to go out and she says, ‘You need your coat.’ I said, ‘I don’t need my coat.’ Because I was embarrassed by it. Otto says, ‘If my son doesn’t need a coat, I don’t need a coat.’ I cannot say that without getting emotional…. We spent the next three hours walking around Paris at night with the lights, the beauty — just everything — talking about the past and future. It really was like a fairytale.”

As for Lee, Preminger remained close with his mother, a figure who happily tantalized her audience, but also possessed a more private side few saw.
“My mother lived a very proper life,” he said. “She never had boyfriends around. I don’t think she had a relationship aside from her third husband during my entire life. It wasn’t the way she operated. She was kind of prudish. When my girlfriend moved in with me, she was terribly upset.”
In the ‘30s Lee attempted a career in Hollywood using her less glamorous real name Louise Hovick. However, Preminger insisted his mother truly shined when she was on stage.

“She was not an actress,” he explained. “She was a personality. She had this energy and vitality — it entranced people… She talked to the audience like they were all her best friends and they loved her back.”
Lee retired from burlesque at age 42, way before her death in 1970 at age 59 from cancer. People magazine reported that Preminger shared “she decided that she was too old to take her clothes off in front of strangers anymore."" Still, Lee kept busy throughout the rest of her life, spending her final years in California, where she hosted a talk show from 1965 until 1967. She also went to Vietnam to entertain the troops and was celebrated as a writer.
People magazine added that in 1970, Otto legally adopted his son. For four years, Preminger worked for his father and learned that his infamous reputation of “Otto the Terrible” was the real deal.

“My father was an extraordinarily warm, generous, loving father,” he said. “[But] he was possibly the worst, bossiest, bullying, demanding person you can imagine. Two sides of the same coin. … He just didn’t have any patience. Whenever anybody made a mistake, grab on because you were going to hit a hurricane.”
Otto passed away in 1986 at age 80. Preminger said that toward the end of his life, his father had dementia and eventually “drifted away.”

Today, Preminger is in the process of writing about the relationship he shared with his father. And when it comes to his own life, he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I am the luckiest person I know,” he said. “I’ve had a life that’s been blessed from birth. It’s still blessed… I just feel so lucky at every stage. Not that there weren’t some difficult moments looking back. God knows they were…. But if I would have been born into any other family, I certainly wouldn’t have had the life I lived.”

Crenshaw calls out Omar for describing 9/11 attacks as 'some people did something',www.foxnews.com,Lukas Mikelionis,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ilhan-omar-under-fire-after-describing-9-11-terror-attacks-as-some-people-did-something,"Crenshaw calls out Omar for describing 9/11 attacks as 'some people did something' Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar is facing backlash after her speech at a Muslim rights group’s event where she described the September 11, 2001 terror attacks as 'some people did something.' Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar is facing backlash after her speech at a Muslim rights group’s event in which she described the September 11, 2001 terror attacks as “some people did something.” Omar spoke at a Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) fundraiser last month, where she called upon other Muslim Americans to “make people uncomfortable” with their activism and presence in the society and criticized the Jewish state.
REP. ILHAN OMAR PROBED FOR ALLEGEDLY SPENDING $6,000 OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS ON DIVORCE ATTORNEY, PERSONAL TRAVEL
But another part of the speech surfaced on social media earlier this week, in which Omar described the terror attacks perpetrated by al Qaeda.
“CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,” Omar said at the event.
The comments from the Minnesota freshman Democrat, still reeling from a number of anti-Semitic controversies, prompted Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw to slam Omar for her description of the terror attacks.
“First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something,'” Crenshaw wrote in a tweet. “Unbelievable.”
NETANYAHU, ILHAN OMAR SPAR OVER ROLE OF AIPAC'S POLITICAL MONEY: 'IT’S NOT ABOUT THE BENJAMINS'
Others have also jumped on to criticize Omar's language, urging Democrats to condemn her remarks about the largest terror attack on U.S. soil that left nearly 3,000 people dead.
""9/11 terrorists & the terror attacks they conducted are described as simply 'some people did something'? Every Democrat should be asked by the media if they disavow @IlhanMN’s statements. Every one of them,"" tweeted Andrew Pollack, father of a Parkland high school shooting victim.
""Ilhan Omar isn’t just anti-Semitic – she’s anti-American. Nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives to Islamic terrorists on 9/11, yet Omar diminishes it as: 'Some people did something.' Democrat leaders need to condemn her brazen display of disrespect,"" said GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
CAIR has been infamously listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in funding of Hamas, stemming from the case against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development which led to millions of charitable dollars getting funneled to the Palestinian terrorist organization.
Omar’s speech at CAIR in Southern California drew hundreds of protesters waving Israeli flags and denouncing the congresswoman’s comments about Israel that were perceived as anti-Semitic.
She first came under fire for tweeting in 2012 that “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”
She then drew bipartisan uproar in February after she suggested politicians in the U.S. were bought by AIPAC, a non-partisan organization that seeks to foster the relationship between the U.S. and Israel.
Omar then reignited the controversy, saying groups supportive of Israel were pushing members of Congress to have “allegiance to a foreign country,” echoing the anti-Semitic trope of dual loyalty.

New Hanover County District Attorney Ben David told news outlets Tuesday that 53-year-old Michael Hinson is no longer charged with animal cruelty and abandonment. He says fish aren't protected under related statues that define ""animal"" as amphibians, reptiles, bird and mammals, excluding humans.
Officials say Hinson was evicted from his Wilmington home last month and left behind an unhealthy Oscar fish in a dirty tank. He was arrested last week after officials found the 6-inch fish, which is being nursed back to health at an aquarium store.

New Zealand Parliament votes to ban semi-automatic weapons,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealand-parliament-votes-to-ban-semi-automatic-weapons,"A bill outlawing most automatic and semi-automatic weapons and banning components that modify existing weapons was passed by a vote of 119 to 1 in the House of Representatives after an accelerated process of debate and public submission. The bill needs only the approval of New Zealand&apos;s governor general, a formality, before becoming law on Friday.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke emotionally during the bill&apos;s final reading of the traumatic injuries suffered by victims of the March 15 attacks, whom she visited in Christchurch Hospital after the shootings.
""I struggle to recall any single gunshot wounds,"" Ardern said. ""In every case they spoke of multiple injuries, multiple debilitating injuries that deemed it impossible for them to recover in days, let alone weeks. They will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that&apos;s before you consider the psychological impact. We are here for them.""
""I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could be obtained legally in this country,"" she said.
A 28-year-old Australian man, Brenton Tarrant, has been charged in the attacks.
Ardern, who has won international praise for her compassion and leadership since the shootings, was able to win rare bi-partisan support for a bill that makes it illegal to own a military-style semi-automatic rifle. The only dissenting voice was from the libertarian ACT Party, which has one lawmaker in Parliament.
The law includes a buy-back scheme under which owners of outlawed weapons can surrender them to police in return for compensation based on the weapon&apos;s age and condition.
Anyone who retains such a weapon after the law formally passes on Friday faces a penalty of up to five years in prison. Some exemptions have been allowed for heirloom weapons held by collectors or for professional pest control.
Ardern said lawmakers had a responsibility to act on behalf of victims of the shootings.
""We are ultimately here because 50 people died and they do not have a voice,"" she said. ""We in this house are their voice. Today we can use that voice wisely.""
""We are here just 26 days after the most devastating terrorist attacks created the darkest of days in New Zealand&apos;s history,"" she said. ""We are here as an almost entirely united Parliament. There have been very few occasions when I have seen Parliament come together in this way and I cannot imagine circumstances where that is more necessary than it is now.""
Ardern said that there was some opposition from firearms owners, but that the response to the proposed legislation was overwhelmingly positive.
""My question here is simple,"" she said. ""You either believe that here in New Zealand these weapons have a place or you do not. If you believe, like us, that they do not, you should be able to believe we can move swiftly. ""An argument about process is an argument to do nothing.""

UK's Theresa May to request Brexit delay as deadline looms,www.foxnews.com,Jill Lawless,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/what-next-uks-may-seeks-brexit-delay-but-eu-wants-answers,"With Brexit once again engulfed in uncertainty, a look at what could happen next: DELAY EXIT DAY
For two years, Britain was scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. But after Parliament three times rejected the divorce deal agreed between the U.K. government and the bloc, May admitted defeat and asked for more time.
Last month, the EU gave Britain until April 12 — this Friday — to pass a deal, come up with a new plan and seek a further extension, or leave without an agreement or a transition period to smooth the way.
Now May wants a bit more time. She has asked the EU to delay Brexit until June 30, in hope that&apos;ll be enough time to secure, approve and implement a deal.
The 27 other leaders of the bloc will consider the request at an emergency Brexit summit in Brussels Wednesday evening. Few favor the June 30 date. Some want a longer extension, to avoid repeated crises every few weeks.
If they fail, May says she will let Parliament vote on a variety of options, including the government&apos;s proposed deal, in hope something can command a majority.
If Britain&apos;s politicians reach agreement around a so-called ""soft Brexit,"" it could quite likely get through Parliament, and would be welcomed by the EU, allowing Britain an orderly departure in the coming months.
But it could also blast open rifts within both Conservatives and Labour. Pro-Brexit government ministers could resign, and pressure would grow on May to quit. The prime minister has already said she will resign if her Brexit deal is passed and Britain leaves the EU, and rivals are already circling, eager to succeed her.
Corbyn, meanwhile, would face rebellion from a large number of Labour lawmakers who want a new referendum on Britain&apos;s EU exit.
That instability increases the chance of an early British election, which could rearrange Parliament and break the deadlock — or result in still more stalemate.
NO BREXIT
Among pro-EU Britons, there is rising hope that Brexit can be stopped.
With one Brexit day gone and another likely to follow, the government has lost control of the timetable.
This week the government started preparing to take part in elections for the European Parliament in late May — acknowledgement that Britain likely won&apos;t have left the bloc by then, and may not leave anytime soon.
Support is growing for the idea that any Brexit deal agreed by Parliament should be put to public vote in a ""confirmatory referendum,"" with the other option being to stay in the EU. The proposal is backed by Labour and other opposition parties, plus some of May&apos;s Conservatives.
The government has ruled out holding another referendum, saying voters in 2016 made their decision to leave. But with divisions in both Parliament and in May&apos;s Cabinet, handing the decision back to the people in a new plebiscite could be seen as the only way forward.

SUNA reported Wednesday that the National Congress Party is planning a rally for Thursday in the capital, Khartoum. The planned rally could trigger clashes with rival protesters who have been holding a large sit-in outside the military&apos;s headquarters in the capital since the weekend.
Attempts by security forces to break up the sit-in have killed at least 22, including five soldiers who protest organizers said were defending the sit-in.
The protests initially erupted last December with demonstrations against a spiraling economy, but quickly escalated into calls for an end to al-Bashir&apos;s 30-year rule."

Sean Hannity: Barr will hold the Deep State actors accountable and criminal indictments are coming,www.foxnews.com,Sean Hannity,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sean-hannity-barr-will-hold-the-deep-state-actors-accountable-and-criminal-indictments-are-coming,"Hannity: Day of reckoning is coming for the deep state An avalanche is coming. It will destroy any credibility - if there's any remaining - of the tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists and the rage media mob in this country, along with their allies in the Democratic hate-Trump left. And to those who have abused power inside and outside of government, you are about to face the justice that many of you deserve. What will be made public in the coming days and weeks, beyond the Mueller report, will prove correct the reporting and investigation that have gone on on ""Hannity"" for over two years. It will confirm all the investigative reporting on the show from our ensemble team. It will prove that we have been accurate and correct all along while the media mob and the Democratic mob have lied to you repeatedly for two and a half years.
This is just a short list of what will soon be made public. Criminal referrals this week by Devin Nunes. Attorney General William Barr pledging an investigation of the FBI's Russia investigation of President Trump -- this has been long overdue. Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report on FISA abuse, the report on the issue of leaking classified information, and of course, the release of more closed-door testimony, thanks to Congressman Doug Collins.
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEAN HANNITY.
Also, FISA applications, Gang of Eight materials -- they are all coming out. And also, the Ukraine deal, which is surfacing, that has so much evidence that goes right to the doorstep of Joe Biden. This will all come cascading down on all these bad actors and drown all of those people that have abused their power.
Let's start with Capitol Hill. Barr On Tuesday testified before the House Appropriations Committee , and he was there to talk about the DOJ's budget. But the conversation soon turned to the Mueller report. We're faced with the undeniable fact that Trump-Russia collusion was a giant hoax. We have the FBI's nine-month investigation, the House Intel investigation, bipartisan Senate investigation, and the Mueller investigation. Every single one of these investigations says there was no Russia collusion whatsoever. None. The words are clear.
And everyone in the media mob got it wrong. So now, they are shifting to new conspiracy theories. We want Donald Trump's taxes. Oh, maybe the attorney general is covering up major, phantom crimes hidden deep within the special counsel's full report. The president obstructed justice, even though the attorney general and deputy attorney general said, no, it did not happen.
CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.
And, by the way, Rachel Maddow, the leader of this tinfoil hat conspiracy brigade, and others are once again lying to their viewers and hyping a pack of twisted lies. The Washington Post and The New York Times are not much different, once again pushing articles based on hearsay from anonymous sources. The left is demanding that the full report be released immediately.
But the attorney general testified that the full report will be released within a week. No request for executive privilege by the president has been made, the only reactions were applied based on strict, legal guidelines. They don't want to give away sources and methods. They are not allowed to leak or give out grand jury information -- that's against the law.

President Trump has nothing to hide. The same can't be said for the high-ranking FBI and DOJ officials, just the upper echelon, responsible for the witch hunt against the Trump campaign. The major news came Tuesday when Attorney General Barr vowed to hold them accountable. This is key in what the Hill's John Solomon called, ""the single sentence Russia bombshell"" that Barr delivered to Congress that very few in the media picked up on. Video
Barr said the following: ""The Office of the Inspector General has a pending investigation of the FISA process in the Russian investigation. And I expect that that will be complete in -- probably, in May or June, I am told. More generally, I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all of the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016.""
Reportedly, Barr will form a team to review the FBI's actions during the so-called phony collusion probe. The pendulum is swinging. The boomerang is now headed right back to the top, the Deep State actors. They will all be held accountable. Mark my words: Criminal indictments are coming.

The report says the crash took place around noon on Wednesday in West Azerbaijan province, in the mountainous area of Dalamper, near the city of Urmia which is close to the border with Turkey.
It quotes the province's deputy governor, Ali Mostafavi, as saying that along with one killed, eight people were injured in the crash.
The chief of the Iranian police helicopter division, Gen. Hesseinali Mostajeran, said the crash was due to a technical glitch.

Biker beats 'The Wire' star Idris Elba's 'flying mile' speed record with 182.4 mph run,www.foxnews.com,Tom Bevan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/biker-idris-elba-motorcycle-land-speed-record,"Speed racer Zef Eisenberg maintained an average speed of 182.4 mph to set a new benchmark for the &apos;flying mile&apos; record . A flying mile takes the average speed over two mile-long runs, with a mile build up.
The record was first set on Pendine Sands in 1927 when Sir Malcolm Campbell reached 174.8mph in his iconic Blue Bird - a marker that stood for nearly 90 years.
Eisenberg set the British Flying Mile record for wheel-driven vehicles at Pendine Sands.
But Zef has now taken the record from the Luther star who achieved 180.361 mph in a 650 hp Bentley Continental Super Sport twin-turbo W12 - also on Pendine Sands - in 2015.
Zef used the same stretch of beach in Wales on board his specially-made 400 hp supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa, built by the Madmax Race Team, and needed only a single run in both directions.
(SWNS)
This was despite a rear tire that was found to be falling apart after the first run and he even survived a scare at 195 mph when his helmet was sprayed with black engine oil.
He said: ""The bike had been spinning the rear wheel for two miles at 240 mph.
""We were using a GP racing tire, too – the best you can get, but I assume it’s not used to that much power or wheel spin.
(SWNS)
""That’s why these records are so hard to achieve. You’re pushing human and engineering boundaries.""
The MADMAX team fitted a new tire during the permitted one-hour turn-around time, enabling Eisenberg to complete his return run and establish the new record.
For the third run, a harder compound of tire was used, but the extreme demands of running at maximum rpm for nearly three miles – and constant wheelspin at such high revs – took its toll on the motorcycle’s highly stressed engine.
Zef, a businessman based in Jersey, added: ""I was doing 195 mph approaching the end of the mile and my helmet visor and leathers were sprayed with black engine oil, obscuring my vision.
""I lost sight of the finish flags, but I couldn’t just slam on the brakes due to the sand. Fortunately, I managed to keep it straight and bring it to a stop.
“Then I noticed engine oil spraying onto the hot exhaust, but unless I jumped off and dropped the bike, I couldn’t get off because I couldn’t put the kick-stand down on the sand. Luckily, the oil never caught fire on the hot exhaust, as the bike would have burst into flames.”
With critical engine damage, he was not able to continue racing and attempt to increase his speeds as he had been hoping to reach a speed of 200 mph over the weekend.
Mr. Eisenberg still holds the fastest wheel-powered vehicle (bike or car) at Pendine, at 201.5 mph, which is also the fastest motorbike on sand world record.
Speaking ahead of the attempt he said he was inspired by someone asking what was next after his successful motorbike attempt last year.
He added: ""That&apos;s not good to say to someone like me and I thought let&apos;s get the outright sand record for a car and a bike.
""When you try something that no-one has done before, there is some trepidation and fear.
""The car has a roll cage and I wear all the protection you can buy, but if the wheel sticks in the sand and the car flips 360 degrees, it could be game over.""
As time ran out on Saturday, The Madmax 1200 hp Porsche Sand Racer will come back to Pendine on Speed Week 18 and 19 May for an attempt on the all-out flying mile record and speed.

Laura Ingraham: Voters must choose between Trump's mindful persistence and Dems' mindless resistance,www.foxnews.com,Laura Ingraham,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/laura-ingraham-voters-must-choose-between-trumps-mindful-persistence-and-dems-mindless-resistance,"Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York badgered Barr on his synopsis on the Mueller report. She said the following: ""Your conclusion is something we&apos;ve seen before. In June 2018, you wrote a memo as a private citizen and a former attorney general to the Department of Justice, laying out the president&apos;s case against obstruction of justice. Your audition clearly went well."" ""Your audition clearly went well."" Wouldn&apos;t you just love to read Barr&apos;s subliminal thoughts about this entire charade scrolling at the bottom of the screen? I&apos;d pay big money for that.
. The attorney general didn&apos;t need this. He already was attorney general almost 30 years ago when he was a lot younger and probably had a lot more patience.
But, like so many others in this administration -- I&apos;m thinking Bob Lighthizer at USTR, Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Alex Azar at HHS, Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, Betsy DeVos at Education -- they all left their very comfortable lives and moved to Washington to help solve problems and make a difference That&apos;s what civil service is supposed to be all about, isn&apos;t it?
But, instead they deal with nasty exchanges with lawmakers who have the power to fix things, like the immigration system - and yet they fail to do so.
Congress has the power to fix the immigration laws, don&apos;t they? And if child detention or separations are so offensive, hey, why don&apos;t you change the laws? Better yet, seal up the border and the endless travesty altogether.
Now, of course, Congress does have legitimate important constitutional obligations to do proper oversight of the executive branch. I&apos;m all for it. But, what the Democrats have been doing since Trump took the oath of office isn&apos;t oversight. It&apos;s character assassination, either of the president himself -- that he was secretly working with the Russians -- or of anyone who works for him.
The truth is Nancy Pelosi wants to throw sand in Trump's gears every chance she gets. If Obama had negotiated the same [NAFTA] deal, she'd have been all for it. But she'd rather deny Trump a victory than do the right thing by the American people.
Look at what the jackals did at Secretary Mnuchin&apos;s hearing on Tuesday . We have a crisis on our southern border and all ""Impeach 45"" Mad Maxine Waters cares about is Trump&apos;s old tax returns -- and of course, Russia and whether Trump or anyone associated with his campaign met with Russian oligarchs.
Maxine Waters is just a complete and utter embarrassment, along with Pelosi, the co-ruling queen of the Resistance. How is any of this helping their constituents? The answer is, it&apos;s not.
Now, the Republicans, remember they&apos;re also called the GOP, as in the Grand Old Party. I&apos;m thinking Democrats should be called just ""UP,"" as in the Unserious Party. Why Because for more than a year, the Trump team undertook the painstaking process of doing things like renegotiating NAFTA, the trade deal that had given an unfair advantage to companies that move their plants to Mexico.
Canada and Mexico both signed off on it. So, why has Nancy Pelosi called it up for a vote? Because she&apos;s unserious. She&apos;s parroting bogus concerns of her buddies over there at the AFL-CIO about labor laws in Mexico.
Video I haven&apos;t heard Nancy demand the same from China lately, have you? They don&apos;t do anything with labor law problems. The truth is Pelosi wants to throw sand in Trump&apos;s gears every chance she gets. If Obama had negotiated the same deal, she&apos;d have been all for it. But she&apos;d rather deny Trump a victory than do the right thing by the American people.
Same scenario, by the way. is at play with the ongoing invasion across our southern border . Congress could fix this in a weekend. Now, estimates are that this month alone, we could see 150,000 migrants overwhelming our border and our Border Patrol. So instead of closing loopholes, ending this crisis, Democrats just use every opportunity to grandstand for the cameras.
We all should be thanking Bill Barr and the entire Trump team. Now, despite a constant stream of defamatory attacks and scurrilous charges from the Democrats, the Trump administration has still managed to accomplish an enormous amount for our country, with the economy, the courts, on trade, et cetera. Mindful persistence versus mindless resistance -- Americans will have a clear choice in 2020.

I realize I’m biased, but my son Matthew is one of the kindest, most considerate human beings I know. He and his brother have something I believe you can’t learn. They have the gift of empathy. When we watch movies or read books whose main character struggles with something that makes them different from the rest, I can tell Matthew and Theodore take these particular stories to heart. They will ask questions about why people are sometimes treated differently because of the way they look. I tell them you never know what someone might be going through, so it’s just good to be kind to everyone. Sometimes there are kids in real life who have big challenges, and they’re the bravest people you’ll ever meet.
So when I asked Matthew why he wanted to take part in the event, he said it was because he felt so bad for the kids who lost their hair because of the medicine they had to take. It wasn’t their fault they looked different. He told me he learned about the St. Baldrick&apos;s Foundation in class, the group that promotes the event, and he raised his hand right away to take part.
We started reading up on the charity and found out this year marks St. Baldrick’s 20th anniversary. What started out as a challenge between successful businessmen who wanted to give back in 1999 turned into an incredible fundraiser with events all over the world.
Firefighters, police officers and military troops have been a big part of St. Baldrick’s from the very beginning. Thousands have added head-shaving to their public service, with events in police and fire stations across the U.S., and even military bases in Iraq and Germany.
And because of the research supported by St. Baldrick’s, the FDA has approved a new drug that drastically increases the cure rate for high-risk neuroblastoma patients. It’s only the third drug approved in 20 years made specifically for kids with cancer.
These kids are real life superheroes. They deserve prayers, love and our help to find a cure as soon as possible.
Even though there have been big strides and millions of dollars raised, the statistics are still heartbreaking. More children are lost to cancer in the U.S. than any other disease — more than many other childhood diseases combined.
Worldwide, a child is diagnosed with cancer every two minutes. That’s about the time it takes to shave a head, so my boy Matthew will be honoring those who have lost their hair by losing his too, for the team he named ""MattsMajors.""
On Saturday there will be a big parade and celebration before the razors begin buzzing. My younger son Theodore said he wouldn’t do it this time (he’s a little afraid of the electric razors), but if it went OK for Matthew this year, he would join him next year.
If you’d like to learn more about St. Baldrick&apos;s and the amazing work they do for childhood cancer, you can visit their website .
These kids are real-life superheroes. They deserve prayers, love and our help to find a cure as soon as possible.
Oh, and I’ll be the one cheering loudly in the crowd, smiling through the tears when I see my bald boy helping others. I&apos;m the proud mom of a son whose empathy for others makes the world a better place.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and declared Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization . President Trump also welcomed Netanyahu to the White House in late March.
Matthews accused the president of breaking tradition with his predecessors by staying out of Israeli politics, but as Newsbusters pointed out, he overlooked the Obama State Department ’s financial contribution of taxpayer money to OneVoice, an Israeli political group and opponent of Netanyahu.

In a tight race for re-election, Israel’s prime minister has gotten a welcome lift from his friend in the White House. In the run-up to the April 9 vote, Netanyahu has hosted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, visited Trump in the White House and received American recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war. (AP)
“American presidents from both of our parties have abstained from getting involved in Israeli politics, opting instead of playing two roles; friend of Israel but also a regional honest broker. But not this time,” Matthews told his audience. “President Trump broke with his predecessors, taking a number of steps to help insure that his friend Bibi Netanyahu was victorious today.”

This President has ignored his global role, ignored the role — forfeited that of peacemaker or honest broker and just played political sidekick of Bibi.”

The cause and extent of Wednesday&apos;s fire at Bangkok&apos;s Central World complex, which includes a hotel and an office tower, was not immediately known.
The report of casualties came from the city&apos;s Erawan Emergency Radio network.
Images posted by social media users showed thick black smoke pouring from the complex, with hundreds of evacuated shoppers filling a large open square next to the mall.
The fire broke out during the congested city&apos;s evening rush hour. Sirens from emergency vehicles wailed as they tried to make their way through gridlocked traffic.
Central World sits at a major intersection surrounded by shopping complexes, shrines and high-rise hotels popular with foreign tourists. It is near the main junction for Bangkok&apos;s elevated train lines, as well as the Erawan Shrine, which was the site of a deadly bombing in 2015.
The mall typically would have been busy with shoppers as well as diners headed to the many restaurants inside.

The state’s Cobb County Tax Commissioner’s Office, which refrained from issuing a decision during the election due to appeals, confirmed last month that McBath didn’t meet the requirements to call her Cobb County home her primary residence for the three tax years leading up to the election, meaning she was a Tennessee resident when she was elected to Congress.

Cobb County permits some residents to decrease their property tax liability through a homestead exemption to residents, an exemption McBath’s husband used since 2000.

"Scarlett Johansson slams the paparazzi, warns of another Princess Diana tragedy following scare",www.foxnews.com,Katherine Lam,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/scarlett-johansson-paparazzi-scare-princess-diana-tragedy,"Johansson said in a statement Tuesday that laws must be changed “to protect targets from the lawless paparazzi.” ""The paparazzi consistently go to increasingly dangerous lengths to stalk and harass the people they are photographing. Even after Princess Diana’s tragic death, the laws were never changed to protect targets from the lawless paparazzi,” Johansson wrote in a statement to Entertainment Tonight. “Many paparazzi have criminal pasts and will perform criminal acts to get their shot.”
The 34-year-old actress said men in five cars with blacked out windows chased her after she left the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” studio on Hollywood Boulevard on Monday night. She was at the show promoting her upcoming film, “Avengers: Endgame,” with co-stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Paul Rudd.
""After leaving the ‘Jimmy Kimmel’ Show, I was followed by 5 cars full of men with blacked out windows who were running red lights and putting other drivers and pedestrians at risk so they could follow me to find out where I was staying and subsequently stalk me and my young daughter for the duration of my stay,"" the actress said, referring to her 5-year-old daughter, Rose Dorothy Dauriac.
""The paparazzi put people&apos;s [lives] at risk, so they can wait for days in quiet neighborhoods in blacked out cars, and try to follow me to the playground and photograph my child and other people’s children in a safe place that should be off limits, but isn’t,"" Johansson added. ""All of this is perfectly legal.”
Johansson was taken to the Los Angeles Police Department’s Hollywood station for security reasons Monday night. Police said the actress was “a little spooked” by the incident, but was eventually able to leave the station. No police report was filed, Entertainment Tonight reported.
Johansson said Tuesday that she felt it was her “duty as a concerned citizen” who was being stalked to seek help from local police and urged others who are being “pursued dangerously” to do the same.
""Women across the US are stalked, harassed and frightened and a universal law to address stalking must be at the forefront of law enforcement conversations. Until paparazzi are considered by the law for the criminal stalkers they are, it’s just a waiting game before another person gets seriously injured or killed, like Princess Diana,"" she said.
Video The Princess of Wales, 36, died in August 1997 when the vehicle she was in crashed in a tunnel in Paris while they were being chased by the paparazzi. Diana’s boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, also died from their injuries.

Mummified mice and falcons on display at the newly discovered burial site, the Tomb of Tutu, at al-Dayabat, Sohag, Egypt April 5, 2019. REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany A recently unearthed tomb from Ancient Egypt contained several mummified animals, including birds, mice and dogs, researchers said. The tomb, built for a man known as Tutu and his wife, Ta-Shirit-Iziz, was recently excavated by archaeologists, according to a statement by the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities.
""The location of this tomb and its entrance was found [in October 2018] during the arrest of a gang while attempting to dig in the area outside the archaeological hill of the Aldi area,"" the ministry said according to a translated version of the post.
60 ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MUMMIES ENTOMBED TOGETHER DIED 'BLOODY, FEARSOME DEATHS'
""Immediately after the ... investigation, the ministry of Antiquities received the site and the archaeological and scientific excavations began through an Egyptian Archaeological Mission headed by Dr. Mostafa Minister of the Secretary-General of the high council of Antiquities. The works of the [group] have found ... human remains and a group of birds and animals.""
The ministry added that the tomb, which contains two rooms, is in ""good condition"" and contains a number of inscriptions and ""bright colors where photos on the side of its entrance are a scene of the god Anubis."" There are also pictures of the god Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife.
In total, there are approximately 50 mummified animals, Live Science reported .
The tomb itself is located near the Nile in Akhmim, Egypt, approximately 280 miles south of Cairo. It dates to the early Ptolemaic period, Reuters reported .
“It shows images of the owner of the burial room, Tutu, giving and receiving gifts before different gods and goddesses,"" Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, said in comments obtained by the news outlet.
In addition to the mummified animals, researchers found two clay jars that contained the remains of a woman between the age of 35 and 50 and a young boy, between the ages of 12 and 14, Reuters added.

Ancient Egypt continues to be a source of fascination for researchers, as more artifacts are uncovered. On Sunday, archaeologists uncovered the 2,500-year-old remains of a powerful ancient Egyptian high priest, broadcast live on the Discovery Channel.
Last month, experts announced the discovery of dozens of mummies in ancient desert burial chambers. Archaeologists also recently explained the strange brown spots on some of the paintings in King Tutankhamun’s tomb.
In January, archaeologists announced the discovery of ancient tombs in the Nile Delta north of Cairo. In a separate project, two ancient tombs dating back to the Roman period were uncovered in Egypt’s Western Desert.

""My advice would be, take a deep breath and if you need a consultant, I’m your girl,” Miller told “Inside Edition” on Tuesday.
Huffman announced Monday she was pleading guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for her involvement in the bribery scheme. The actress said she accepts “full responsibility” for her actions.
Huffman now faces four to 10 months in prison, Us Weekly reported.

“Be respectful of everyone, keep a low profile, be kind to people. Tell your story, but listen,” Miller advised.

DOJ watchdog reportedly scrutinizing role of FBI informant in Russia probe,www.foxnews.com,Brooke Singman,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-fbi-informant-in-russia-probe,"Last Update 7 hours ago Barr testifies 'spying did occur' on Trump campaign, amid reported review of informant's role Attorney General Barr to review FBI conduct during Russia probe Reaction and analysis from 'The Russia Hoax' author Gregg Jarrett and Fox News contributor Sara Carter on 'Hannity.' Attorney General Bill Barr testified Wednesday that he believes ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign in 2016, as he vowed to review the conduct of the FBI's original Russia probe -- and the focus of a related internal review shifted to the role of a key FBI informant. ""I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. … I think it’s my obligation. Congress is usually very concerned with intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane,"" he testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, while noting that ""spying on a political campaign is a big deal.""
BARR VOWS MUELLER REPORT RELEASE 'WITHIN A WEEK,' AS DEMS RIP 'UNACCEPTABLE' HANDLING AT HEATED HEARING
The comments follow a new report that the Justice Department’s internal watchdog also is scrutinizing the role of an FBI informant who contacted members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, as part of a broader review of the early stages of the Russia investigation. The New York Times reported that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is looking into informant Stefan Halper’s work during the Russia probe, as well as his work with the FBI prior to the start of that probe.
BARR REVEALS HE IS REVIEWING 'CONDUCT' OF FBI'S ORIGINAL RUSSIA PROBE
Halper, an American professor who reportedly is deeply connected with British and American intelligence agencies, has been widely reported as a confidential source for the FBI during the bureau’s original investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That official counterintelligence operation was opened by then-senior agent Peter Strzok, who has since been fired from the bureau.
During the 2016 campaign, Halper contacted several members of the Trump campaign, including former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and former aide Carter Page. Page also was the subject of several Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants during the campaign -- which is an issue at the heart of the IG's investigation. Republicans, including President Trump, have alleged misconduct in the bureau and Justice Department’s handling of those FISA warrants.
""It was an illegal investigation. ... Everything about it was crooked,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday, describing it as an attempted ""coup"" and reiterating his interest in digging into the probe's origins. ""There is a hunger for that to happen.""
Professor Stefan Halper (Voice of America, File)
The Times, in its report, noted that Halper also contacted former Trump campaign aide Sam Clovis. It is unclear whether Halper had the FBI’s permission to contact Clovis, according to the report.
Horowitz, more broadly, is probing alleged wrongdoing related to the issuance of FISA warrants to surveil Page during the election. During a prior hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Barr testified that Horowitz’s investigation is expected to be complete by May or June.
While vowing to release Special Counsel Robert Mueller's now-completed Russia report in a matter of days, Barr also announced Tuesday that he was reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation at the FBI and the Justice Department, amid mounting calls for scrutiny of the probe's beginnings from Trump and prominent congressional Republicans.
“More generally, I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all of the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted in the summer of 2016,” Barr told the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday.
BARR ASSEMBLES 'TEAM' TO LOOK INTO COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION ON TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN 2016, OFFICIAL SAYS
Also on Tuesday, Fox News reported that a source said Barr had assembled a “team” to investigate the origins of the bureau’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.
On Wednesday, Barr testified that he hasn't technically ""set up a team"" but has colleagues helping him as he reviews the case.
""This is not launching an investigation of the FBI,"" he stressed. ""Frankly, to the extent there were issues at the FBI, I do not view it as a problem of the FBI. I think it was probably a failure of the group of leaders—the upper echelons of the FBI. I think the FBI is an outstanding organization and I am very pleased Director Chris Wray is there.""
He added, ""If it becomes necessary to look over former officials, I expect to rely on Chris and work with him. I have an obligation to make sure government power is not abused and I think that’s one of the principal roles of the attorney general.""
The FBI’s 2016 counterintelligence investigation, formally opened by Strzok, began with a “paucity” of evidence, according to former FBI counsel Lisa Page, with whom Strzok was romantically involved. During a closed-door congressional interview, Page admitted that the FBI “knew so little” about whether allegations against the Trump campaign were “true or not true” at the time they opened the probe, adding that they had just “a paucity of evidence because we [were] just starting down the path” of vetting allegations. Video
Page also said in her interview that it was “entirely common” that the FBI would begin an investigation with just a “small amount of evidence.”
Barr’s team will also review the FISA warrants issued against Carter Page. The issuance of the FISA warrants relied, in part, on the unverified anti-Trump dossier authored by ex-British Intelligence Agent Christopher Steele, who worked on behalf of Fusion GPS—a firm paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through law firm Perkins Coie to do opposition research against the Trump campaign. In the dossier, Steele accused Page of conspiring with Russians. Page was not charged with any wrongdoing in either the FBI’s Russia probe or Mueller’s.
Fox News exclusively obtained internal FBI text messages last month showing that just nine days before the FBI applied for the Page FISA warrant, bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had ""continued concerns"" about the ""possible bias"" of a source pivotal to the application.
Barr’s review could also dovetail with the work U.S. Attorney John Huber has been doing. In 2017, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed Huber to review not only alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and the FBI but also the handling of the probe into the Clinton Foundation and other matters.
The day following Barr’s release of his summary of the Mueller report, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said his panel also would investigate alleged FISA abuses at the start of the Russia investigation and called on Barr to appoint a new special counsel to investigate “the other side of the story.” Graham has been calling for a second special counsel since 2017 to investigate “whether or not a counterintelligence investigation was opened as a back door to spy on the Trump campaign.”
Also, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said over the weekend he was preparing to send eight criminal referrals to the Justice Department this week regarding alleged misconduct by DOJ and FBI officials during the Trump-Russia investigation. It is unclear whom Nunes will refer for investigation, and what the process at the Justice Department might be.
When asked Tuesday about Nunes’ referrals, Barr said he hasn’t seen them yet, but, “Obviously, if there is a predicate for investigation, it will be conducted.”

Chelsea Handler blames 'white privilege' for acting like a 'spoiled brat' about Trump's election,www.foxnews.com,Tyler McCarthy,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/chelsea-handler-blames-white-privilege-for-acting-like-a-spoiled-brat-about-trumps-election,"Chelsea Handler says she has ‘feelings’ for Robert Mueller Comedian Chelsea Handler says she is ‘not embarrassed’ by her sexual attraction to Robert Mueller. Chelsea Handler explained that her ""white privilege"" is responsible for her acting like a ""spoiled brat"" following the election of Donald Trump as president. Since 2016, the 44-year-old comedian has spent much of her time in the spotlight lambasting Trump and his administration. She has previously noted that the election of President Trump prompted her to start seeing a therapist and got her hooked on marijuana. She has posted a flurry of politically charged tweets and even voiced a jocular attraction to Robert Mueller .
CHELSEA HANDLER 'NOT EMBARRASSED' BY SEXUAL ATTRACTION TO ROBERT MUELLER
On Tuesday’s episode of “ The View ,” Handler was asked about her latest politically inspired project, which is a documentary about white privilege on Netflix.
“White people certainly don’t want to talk about it,” she said of tackling race relations in the U.S. “So I figured, start with myself so, you know, I can hang myself out to dry at my own privilege, at my own reaction to the presidency. Like a spoiled brat, you know, the way so many people were crying and screaming. It was like, 'well, nothing in your life has ever gone that wrong before?' I really had to take a look and go, ‘no.’ Yes, my brother died, that was traumatic and awful. But I’ve never been hungry, I’ve never been starving, I’ve never been discriminated against that I knew about.”
Handler continued: “I think it’s important to have uncomfortable conversations about race because we have a big situation that’s happening. And I thought, like an idiot, Barack Obama being elected was the end of racial tension in this country, and that’s not the case.”
CHELSEA HANDLER'S MOST INFLAMMATORY TWEETS AND CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS
In the interview, Handler noted that she came close to having a mental breakdown after Trump won the presidency in a tight race against Hillary Clinton . However, she said therapy helped her understand why Trump’s rise to power affected her so deeply and made her want to take action.
“I realized what he signified was actually what happened during my childhood when it became undone. When my whole world fell apart. I lost the two most important men in my life,” she said.
The star described finding out that her father had another child while engaged to her mother. She said that his secretive and morally ambiguous behavior reminds her a lot of the president.
“But he was a lot less powerful, thankfully,” she concluded. On Our Radar "

So, you know. I really don’t know yet. It’s easy, I’m not lying right now!” Some of that work involves Lopez, 49, going on tour. She revealed that her kids will be with her for the jaunt and that she and A-Rod are working hard to make their busy schedules match up while she&apos;s on the road and he&apos;s busy covering baseball season.
“The kids will probably be with me the whole time,” she said . “Alex has &apos; Sunday Night Baseball ,&apos; so he’ll be in and out. He told me, ‘I’m definitely at opening night, I’m definitely at closing night, in between we’ll figure it out.’”
Rodriguez popped the question to Lopez last month during a beach vacation after two years of dating, and Lopez previously admitted she was ""weary"" of potentially tying the knot for a fourth time. Still, A-Rod has been so supportive, she says, that it&apos;s almost a no-brainer.
The triple-threat has been filming ""Hustlers,"" in which she plays a stripper . She says the 43-year-old former New York Yankee is proud of her work on the film.

Fossilized remains of 430 million-year-old 'sea monster' found,www.foxnews.com,Chris Ciaccia,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/science/fossilized-remains-sea-monster-found,"Last Update 5 hours ago Fossilized remains of 430 million-year-old 'sea monster' found Fossilized remains of 430 million-year-old ‘sea monster’ discovered The fossilized remains of a 430 million-year-old ‘sea monster’ has been discovered near Herefordshire, Britain. The fossilized remains of a 430 million-year-old sea creature that had tentacles longer than its body have been found in Herefordshire, Britain. Given the name Sollasina cthulhu , due to its resemblance to the fictional Cthulhu sea beast thought of by American author H.P. Lovecraft, the creature was significantly smaller than the fictional monster, but perhaps just as scary to other sea creatures alive at the time.
""Although the fossil is just 3 [centimers] wide, its many long tentacles would have made it appear quite monstrous to other small sea creatures alive at the time,"" a press release describing the find reads. ""It is thought that these tentacles, or 'tube feet', were used to capture food and crawl over the seafloor.""
FOUR-LEGGED WHALE THAT LIVED 40 MILLION YEARS AGO FOUND OFF COAST IN PERU
Sollasina cthulhu was a type of sea cucumber and its 45 tentacles likely helped it walk along the seafloor, researchers noted. They were also able to look at it in 3-D, which gave researchers a deeper look into the creature's soft tissue.
""Using physical–optical tomography and computer reconstruction, we visualize the internal anatomy of S. cthulhu in three dimensions, revealing inner soft tissues that we interpret as the ring canal, a key part of the water vascular system that was previously unknown in fossil echinozoans,"" researchers wrote in the study's abstract.
The study's co-author, Dr. Jeffrey Thompson, was surprised it was a sea cucumber, originally thinking it might be a closer relative to sea urchins.
""We carried out a number of analyses to work out whether Sollasina was more closely related to sea cucumbers or sea urchins,"" Dr. Thompson said in the release. ""To our surprise, the results suggest it was an ancient sea cucumber. This helps us understand the changes that occurred during the early evolution of the group, which ultimately gave rise to the slug-like forms we see today.""
The research was published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B . Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia Trending in Science "

Let’s go. The time is now and you know I have some “Final Thoughts.”
Yes, over the weekend we lost DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to a resignation.
Now the left is pretty excited. Every time President Trump changes up the team, they take it, and market it to low-information anti-Trump viewers, as a sign of weakness and instability.
Well sorry to burst your illegal immigrant coddling bubbles, but that’s NOT the case here.
Our president, heck our whole country, needs someone who is ready to go to battle.
Yeah, it’s sad we have to battle OUR OWN citizens -- the Democrats and RINOs -- to enforce our immigration laws but here we are.
Our border is being invaded, and the enemy within is sadly about as excited as the enemy without.
We are facing a crisis that even Obama-era lackeys can recognize. Heck, even Bernie Sanders sees it:
“I’m afraid you may be getting your information wrong. That’s not my view, what we need is comprehensive immigration reform. If you open the borders, my God, there&apos;s a lot of poverty in this world, and you&apos;re going to have people from all over the world. And I don&apos;t think that&apos;s something that we can do at this point. Can&apos;t do it. So that is not my position.""
When Sanders becomes the unlikely voice of reason -- yes we are in a crisis.
Four thousand apprehensions a DAY? One hundred thousand in a month? We already have 11-22 million illegals in this country.
How many more can we take?
Better question, why are we allowing LEGAL immigrants to be disrespected and cut in line like this? It&apos;s disgraceful.
Do it the RIGHT way, it takes several years and thousands of dollars.
Do it the ILLEGAL way and it&apos;s come on in and we will roll out the red carpet for you.
What we are seeing at our border is an invasion, so why are we treating it like an open house?
We need someone in charge of DHS that’s ready to fight the cartel, but also the PC police.
Kirstjen did a pretty good job and dealt with a lot of crap. Like being forced out of a Mexican restaurant for doing her job and enforcing immigration law.
Now that she has resigned, look at what these rags are saying about her. So wrong. Maybe she couldn’t take it. Maybe she didn’t want to. Either way, let’s move on.
Now I really like the acting DHS Secretary U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. I’ve met him and think he’s a fearless warrior for the cause. I also think CBP still needs his leadership.
So who do I want? Well, I think the PERFECT pick is former ICE Director and personal friend of mine, Tom Homan.
I sat down with Tom just a few months ago to talk about this illegal immigration crisis.
He knows political correctness is intellectual dishonesty and he is not afraid of the liberal media mob. Not even for a second.
He’s faced cartel, murderers, rapists and repeat felons. Think he’s scared of CNN or Washington Post? Think again.
We need a leader like Tom Homan who will do what is right, not what is popular.
President Trump, I think he is your guy but those are just my ""Final Thoughts."" From LA, God bless and take care.

Illegally downloaded 'Game of Thrones' episodes expose you to viruses that hijack your computer,www.foxnews.com,Harry Pettit,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/illegally-downloaded-game-of-thrones-episodes-expose-you-to-viruses-that-hijack-your-computer,"Hackers are disguising viruses as illegal downloads ahead of the show&apos;s hotly anticipated final season, which airs this week. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to pirate the episodes so they don&apos;t have to shell out for pricey TV packages.
And it seems cybercriminals are jumping on the chance to scam viewers as they scour the web for downloads.
Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab say cybercriminals often use popular TV shows to spread viruses – and ""Game of Thrones"" is their weapon of choice.
A whopping 17% of all infected pirated content in 2018 was disguised as Game of Thrones downloads, with nearly 21,000 users attacked.
This number is especially impressive when you consider the show did not release any new episodes last year.
More than 126,000 users downloaded malware instead of TV shows in 2018, researchers found.
Victims could have their computer taken over by hackers, who may use this access to nick passwords and banking details.
""Game of Thrones&apos;"" first episode, Winter is Coming, is most widely used to trick people into downloading viruses or ""malware"" – software designed to damage or gain access to your computer.
Behind ""Game of Thrones,"" zombie drama ""The Walking Dead"" and superhero thriller ""Arrow"" are hugely popular shows for the spread of malware.
Users downloading these series made up 15 percent and 10 percent of all malware attacks disguised as TV shows in 2018.
While the figures are staggering, the number of users affected by fake downloads was down a third from 2017.
This may be because hackers are moving away from torrent and other download websites, experts said.
""As the world tightens up policies regarding pirated content and treats intellectual property more like physical property, malware distributors seem to be leaving file-hosting and torrent websites,” commented the report’s authors.
""But this might be due to increased popularity of streaming websites that do not require files to be downloaded, yet might be a source of different threats.""
Illegal downloads for TV shows have been posted online for decades.
The practice is against the law, and as such carries inherent risks – including malware attacks.
We&apos;d recommend you get hold of your shows legally to avoid attacks.
The latest series of ""Games of Thrones"" will be available on Sky Atlantic and NowTV.

Kentucky police fatally shoot man who wounded another man,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/kentucky-police-fatally-shoot-man-who-wounded-another-man,"Email LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Police in Kentucky say officers have fatally shot a man who wounded another man in the parking lot of a Louisville apartment complex.

Pediatricians urge recall of Fisher-Price 'Rock 'n Play' after infant deaths,www.foxnews.com,Alexandria Hein,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/pediatricians-urge-recall-of-fisher-price-rock-n-play-after-infant-deaths,"But the AAP said the warning, which also said 10 babies have died while using the product since 2015, is not enough and cited Consumer Reports’ analysis that recorded 32 infant deaths involving the product between 2011 and 2018. The AAP said Consumer Reports recorded deaths involving infants younger than three months, “which is alarming.”
“AAP urges parents to stop using the product immediately,” the group said in a statement posted to its website on Tuesday . “Stores should remove the Rock ‘N Play Sleeper from their shelves. A warning issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price on April 5 did not go far enough to ensure safety and protect infants.”
The group’s president called the product “deadly.”
“When parents purchase a product for their baby or child, many assume that if it’s being sold in a store, it must be safe to use,” Kyle Yasuda, MD, FAAP, and AAP president, said in a statement. “Tragically, that is not the case. There is convincing evidence that the Rock ‘N Play inclined sleeper puts infants’ lives at risk, and CPSC must step up and take immediate action to remove it from stores and prevent further tragedies.”
The AAP does not recommend any sleeping products for infants or any products that require restraining a baby. It also advises against using car seats, strollers or other devices for sleeping due to risk of roll over leading to possible suffocation or strangulation.
In Fisher-Price’s warning last week, the company noted that the 10 deaths they cited in their statement involved children older than 3 months who were unrestrained in the product, and had managed to roll on their stomach or sides.
The product is advertised as a place for infants to nap or sleep, and includes a vibration setting for comfort. In its initial statement, Fisher-Price said the product “meets all applicable safety standards, including those of the international standards organization, known as ASTM International, and is certified by the Juvenile Products Manufacturing Association (JPMA).”
But AAP’s chair of the Task Force on SIDS said the product fails to meet the group’s recommendations for a “safe sleep environment.”
“Infants should always sleep on their back, on a separate, flat and firm sleep surface without any bumpers or bedding,” Rachel Moon, MD, FAAP, and chair of the AAP Task Force on SIDS, said in a statement.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Kirstjen Nielsen ‘oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in history’,www.foxnews.com,Kathleen Joyce,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-kirstjen-nielsen-human-rights,"Ocasio-Cortez responded to a tweet regarding a New York Times’ op-ed titled “Cancel Kirstjen Nielsen.” The opinion piece addressed a report from the paper that said Nielsen stayed in her position because “she was aware how awful life would/will be for her on the outside given her role in defending Donald Trump’s policies.”
Video “Her role in terrorizing children should make her a permanent pariah,” the piece stated .
“In stealing 1000s of children, deporting their parents, & refusing to provide info for reunification, Sec. Nielsen oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “Awarding her a lucrative deal or prestigious post is to legitimize+celebrate that abuse.”
The freshman congresswoman was addressing the Trump administration’s practice of separating migrant children from their families at the southern border which was carried out by Nielsen.
Last summer, the administration separated more than 2,500 children from their families before international outrage forced Trump to halt the practice and a judge ordered them reunited. The government recently said in court filings that it would take up to two years to reunify all the children already separated from their families.
On Sunday, President Trump announced that Nielsen “will be leaving her position” after 16 months on the job. He announced that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan will replace Nielsen as acting secretary, tweeting: ""I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!""

Another Dem Capitol staffer implicated in Senate data theft 'doxxing' scheme,www.foxnews.com,Lukas Mikelionis,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-aide-maggie-hassan-jackson-cosko-doxxing,"Cosko, who formerly worked for Hassan before his firing, pleaded guilty on Friday to five federal offenses for “doxxing” personal information of five Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, during the hearings for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. He also confessed to stealing gigabytes-worth of data, including dozens of user names and passwords, Social Security numbers, and credit card information belonging to Senate employees,
Prosecutors said Cosko concocted an “extraordinarily extensive data-theft scheme, copying entire network drives, sorting and organizing sensitive data, and exploring ways to use that data to his benefit.”
Video But prosecutors now say that a second aide to Hassan has been involved in the data-stealing scheme, alleging that she helped Cosko to conduct the operation.
Samantha G. DeForest-Davis, whose LinkedIn states she’s a staff assistant to the senator, though Senate records indicate that she’s no longer working there, is being implicated in the crime, with a case being opened that names her, according to the Daily Caller .
DeForest-Davis hasn’t yet been charged with anything, though she allegedly provided a key that Cosko used to enter the senate office at night in an effort to set up the scheme to steal the data. Prosecutors said in courts records that she was aware of Cosko’s intentions.
The now-former staffer also reportedly filed an affidavit that could be used to determine whether she’s eligible for a public defender, the outlet reported.
Cosko worked for Hassan as a computer systems administrator until May 2018 when he was fired for failing to follow office procedures. This prompted him to enter the office and steal the information.
He went on to become an intern for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. He was fired again amid his arrest for doxxing GOP senators after getting angry about their support Kavanaugh in the midst of allegations of impropriety. He intended to intimidate the senators and their families, according to court records.

File photo: Water from the melting glacier runs down through a hole in the Aletsch Glacier on the Jungfraufirn Glacier, Switzerland, August 28, 2015. One of Europe's biggest glaciers, the Great Aletsch coils 23 km (14 miles) through the Swiss Alps - and yet this mighty river of ice could almost vanish in the lifetimes of people born today because of climate change. The glacier, 900 metres (2,950 feet) thick at one point, has retreated about 3 km (1.9 miles) since 1870 and that pace is quickening. (REUTERS/Denis Balibouse) Emissions rising at their current rates will result in almost all of the glaciers in the Alps melting by the end of the century. A recent study has found that half of the ice in the 4,000 Alpine mountain glaciers will have disappeared by 2050 due to a combination of rising temperatures and past pollution.
Even if carbon emissions dropped all the way to zero by 2050, researchers still think it would be too late to save the glaciers and estimate that two-thirds of the ice will still have melted by 2100.
Losing the glaciers would negatively impact nature, farming, hydroelectricity and tourism in the area.
Glaciologist Daniel Farinotti was part of the team who conducted the research.
He said: ""Glaciers in the European Alps and their recent evolution are some of the clearest indicators of the ongoing changes in climate.
ETH Zurich in Switzerland senior researcher Matthias Huss said: ""In the pessimistic case, the Alps will be mostly ice-free by 2100, with only isolated ice patches remaining at high elevation, representing 5% or less of the present-day ice volume.""
The glacier research was published in the journal The Cryospher and details how computer models were combined with real-world data to predict the fate of the glaciers.
Glaciers across the World are thought to be losing 369 billion tons of snow and ice each year.
All this melting ice is contributing to rising sea levels.
Cutting back on fossil-fuel burning, deforestation and other polluting activities could help to minimize the melting and its subsequent devastating impact.

Chick-fil-A met with opposition at San Jose airport,www.foxnews.com,Caleb Parke,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chick-fil-a-opposition-san-jose-airport,"Activists protested the opening of the chain at the airport on Tuesday, even though it had been approved last year as part of a package deal with other vendors. The City Council blasted the company and ended up rejecting a contract extension with Chick-fil-A because of what they called an ""anti-LGBTQ stance."" They also voted to put LGBTQ flags around the store, making it the ""gayest Chick-fil-A in the country,"" according to one city councilmember. Chick-fil-A was recently banned from airports in San Antonio and Buffalo. The city of San Jose, where two Chick-fil-A&apos;s are already in operation just miles from the airport, criticized the Christian company but stopped short of removing it from the airport. The chain is expected to open at the San Jose airport next month.
“My heart just sank when I saw the construction wall (at the airport),” former County Supervisor and the first openly gay lawmaker in the county Ken Yeager, told the San Jose Spotlight . “I’ve been doing LGBTQ rights activities for 35 years. I remember when this city was not welcoming and we’ve come a long way. I feel like this is a throwback to those times.”
The chain has a six-year deal to operate at the airport. City council members rejected a contract extension on the grounds that Chick-fil-A doesn&apos;t open on Sundays, one of the airport&apos;s busiest travel days. By nixing the extension, the restaurant will only be allowed to operate through 2026. The Christian-owned fast food joint closes on Sundays to allow employees to spend the day resting and in worship.
Councilmember Raul Peralez said putting LGBTQ pride flags at the restaurant&apos;s San Jose airport location would make it the ""gayest Chick-fil-A in the country.""
Keisha Russell, associate counsel to First Liberty Institute, argued that the city council&apos;s attempt to ban Chick-fil-A is not only bigoted, it&apos;s illegal.
""The city council cannot operate in a way that brazenly violates the Constitution and federal law, but if it chooses to, then the federal government should pull its grant,"" Russel wrote in a Fox News op-ed .
To avoid the risk of violating the First Amendment, City Attorney Rick Doyle reportedly cautioned the council not to reject the contract extension on religious or political grounds.
Not everyone agreed though. Some argue customers, not the government, should decide.
“They do not discriminate against LGBTQ in serving their customers,” Shane Patrick Connolly, chief of staff for Councilmember Johnny Khamis, tweeted . “If we disapprove of owners’ views, we may vote with our dollars: eat elsewhere.”
San Jose councilmembers admitted they overlooked the issue when they approved the restaurant in March 2018.
“There are some people who are very political, there are people who have social, conscientious issues,” Joe Good from Oregon told FOX 2 . “I just like a good sandwich.”

Royal Caribbean 'temporarily' closes trampoline attraction at the center of $10 million injury lawsuit,www.foxnews.com,Janine Puhak,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/royal-caribbean-temporarily-closes-trampoline-attraction-at-center-of-10-million-injury-lawsuit,"Royal Caribbean officials are currently reviewing the feature following a $10 million injury lawsuit filed in March by a Mariner of the Seas passenger, who broke his pelvis in a 20-foot fall from the Sky Pad , reportedly suffering permanent injuries.
Holladay is said to have suffered ""a disability and permanent injuries"" as consequence of the event, as per reports. (Royal Caribbean)
In recent days, reps for the cruise line have responded to various inquiries from Twitter users and confirmed that the attraction, indeed, will be temporarily closed, the Miami Herald reported.
“We&apos;re currently conducting a review as the safety as part of our commitment to safety for all of our guests. I&apos;m very sorry for any disappointment this has caused,” one official wrote online.
It remains unclear at this time just how long the Sky Pad will be closed.
When contacted for comment, Owen Torres, Royal Caribbean International&apos;s corporate communications director, told Fox News that the Sky Pad has been taken out of service to “conduct further inspection” as a safety measure.
As noted by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , there is also a Sky Pad trampoline on the Spectrum of the Seas ship, but Royal Caribbean has not yet addressed whether or not the attraction remains open on that vessel.
The 25-year-old man had looked forward the ""awesome experience"" of trying the Sky Pad attraction (pictured) during the cruise, which he took with his girlfriend, but never could have predicted that he would suffer such devastating injuries. (Royal Caribbean)
Brett Rivkind, Holladay’s attorney, confirmed to Fox News on April 10 that his client is suing the cruise line company for $10 million, and gave the following statement on the news of the Sky Pad’s provisional closure:
“It is obvious they have finally recognized the sky pad is unsafe and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line must do the proper safety analysis and risk assessment that should [have] been performed before launching this activity on their ships,” Rivkind said, via email. “Casey is angry and sad he had to be one of the motivating factors for this to happen.”
“It comes too late for him, but hopefully it will save others from serious injury and possibly even death.” the maritime lawyer continued. “I have said many times the cruise ship companies rush to put more and more shipboard activities on their ships that are dangerous and do so without the proper risk assessments and qualifications to assure they are safe for passengers.”
“No one is inspecting and certifying these attractions on cruise ships. This is a major safety concern,” Rivkind alleged.
On March 12, Holladay filed suit against the Miami-based Royal Caribbean for negligence in relation to the incident, which occurred during a cruise in early February. According to NBC 6, the 25-year-old Washington man had looked forward the ""awesome experience"" of trying the Sky Pad attraction during the tropical cruise, which he took with his girlfriend.
Billed as an ""out-of-this-world bungee trampoline experience,"" Sky Pad adventurers strap into a harness that features bungee cords on each side to jump and bounce, according to its official web page. Soon after Holladay strapped into the attraction and soared upwards, his harness unexpectedly “snapped 20 feet above the ground,” plummeting him to hit the hard surface of the ground next to the trampoline, Business Insider reported.
""I just felt the momentum release from my body that I wasn’t being held by anything anymore. When I hit all I really remember is the hit and the noise and the fear,” Holladay told NBC . ""It&apos;s kind of one of those cliché moments when your life changes in the blink of an eye.”
The cruise line shortened the trip to bring the man back to Miami, where he spent nine days in the hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries for his broken pelvis and receiving treatment for his dislocated shoulder.
Holladay is said to have suffered ""a disability and permanent injuries"" as a consequence of the event. He is now in physical therapy and seeing a psychologist for depression in relation to the accident, The Sun-Sentinel reports.

U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock says Venezuela's humanitarian problem has worsened and ""the scale of need is significant and growing""— with 7 million people representing 25 percent of the population needing humanitarian aid.
Lowcock told a Security Council meeting called by the United States on Wednesday that the U.N. is working to expand humanitarian aid, but that much more is needed.
He said there's ""a need to separate political and humanitarian objectives"" and urged the council's support ""to safeguard the neutral and impartial nature of humanitarian action.""
Lowcock also urged the council to press for sustained and regular access to people in need, and to fund the expansion of humanitarian programs.
He said Venezuela's ""severe and continuing economic contraction"" means the availability and affordability of food has fallen and malnutrition has increased, especially in areas with the highest poverty rates.

Pete Davidson returns to Instagram months after sharing cryptic post,www.foxnews.com,Madeline Farber,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-instagram,"KATE BECKINSALE SCRUBS INSTAGRAM PROFILE FOLLOWING PETE DAVIDSON RELATIONSHIP BACKLASH Davidson, 25, shared three images — two of which were blank, and one of a brief animation that appears to show Davidson as a child. The caption on the last post listed three dates and locations of where he will perform alongside fellow comedian John Mulaney for their comedy tour.
That said, the account doesn&apos;t appear to be run by Davidson himself. Rather, photographer and filmmaker Marcus Russell Price, who works with Davidson, per Us Weekly , is managing it.
Davidson’s return comes after he shared a dark message on Instagram in December.
“I really don’t want to be on this earth anymore,” he wrote in a now-deleted post . “I’m doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don’t know how much longer I can last. all I’ve ever tried to do was help people. just remember I told you so.”
Additionally, in a post shortly before, the 25-year-old also commended rapper Kanye West for his “bravery” for openly discussing mental health issues. The comment came after West and pop star Ariana Grande, whom Davidson was once briefly engaged to, feuded on Twitter.
Davidson, who is now dating actress Kate Beckinsale, 45, has been open about his own mental health struggles, too. The comedian suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which he was diagnosed in 2017, according to TIME . Davidson, before deleting his Instagram, once shared a lengthy post addressing both his BPD and suicide.
""I’ve spoken about BPD and being suicidal publicly only in the hopes that it will help bring awareness and help kids like myself who don’t want to be on this earth. I just want you guys to know. No matter how hard the internet or anyone tries to make me kill myself. I won’t. I’m upset I even have to say this. To all those holding me down and seeing this for what it is – I see you and I love you,"" he wrote, in part, at the time, according to the magazine.
“This whole year has been an f---ing nightmare. This has been the worst year of my life, getting diagnosed with this and trying to figure out how to learn with this and live with this,” Davidson separately told Marc Maron on the WTF podcast in September 2017.

Passengers can also be heard laughing from inside the departures area, prior to Lee’s flight to Alicante, Spain.
EasyJet, however, seems to think this is no laughing matter. In a statement obtained by Fox News, the airline said it was discussing the incident with its contracted ground-handling service, which employs the handler.
“We are aware of the video and have raised it to our ground handling services supplier at Manchester Airport.”
It is unclear if the handler was violating any rules with the fitness routine.

Kellyanne Conway: Congress needs to 'stop denying' border crisis and act,www.foxnews.com,Chris Irvine,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-congress-border-crisis,"Citing figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Tuesday , Conway said that migrants were facing a “perilous journey and a humanitarian crisis at the border.” “In the fiscal year so far, we’ve had 104 of these so-called caravans with at least 100 people,” she said. “Two years ago, fiscal year 2017, we had exactly 2. We’ve gone from 2 to 104. Stop denying what you see in front of you. We’ve got people still searching for the elusive collusion and will deny what’s right in front of them.
“There was over 100,000 migrants presented at the border just last month alone, that was a 35 percent jump from February from the month before… For years, a decade really, most of them were single men from Mexico and you can return them very easily to their home country. Now you have 8,000 or so unaccompanied minors last month, you have the family units from the northern triangle countries, it is a perilous journey and a humanitarian crisis at the border.
Video CPB said that more than 103,000 migrants were turned away from or apprehended at the border last month, an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year.
In all, CBP said it apprehended 92,607 people, including 53,077 family units (a 45.3 percent increase over February) and 8,975 unaccompanied minors (a 31 percent increase over February). Another 10,885 migrants were deemed ""inadmissible"" by immigration authorities.
The total number of 103,492 apprehensions or rejections is the highest of any month over at least the past six years.
Conway continued: “Anybody who can look at me with a straight face and tell me that they know what happens to those young children once they’re released into the United States is lying. It’s wishful thinking that they’re ‘oh they’re reunited with family members and sponsors and they’re gainfully employed and life is wonderful, roses and lollipops after that.’
""You don’t know where they are. You don’t know who’s human-trafficked, who’s murdered, who’s with a gang. I’ve got girls 14, 11 and 9, all three of them within the range of the girls being pumped with birth control and pregnancy tests because we know this journey is perilous. Stop lying and start doing.”
When asked about potential solutions, Conway suggested fixing the TVPRA [Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000], calling it a “magnet for recycling children.”
She also called on a fix for the Flores Settlement, which limits the time immigration services detain unaccompanied minors to 20 days.
The CBP’s numbers were announced two days after the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a shakeup orchestrated by President Trump, who has been frustrated by his administration&apos;s inability to stem the tide of migrants from Central America and other parts of the world.

"Robert Bianchi: Don't expect a ""Smollet"" resolution in the college cheating scandal",www.foxnews.com,Robert Bianchi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-bianchi-dont-expect-a-smollet-resolution-in-the-college-cheating-scandal,"Lori Loughlin, husband hit with new charges in college admissions scandal The actress and her husband are among 16 parents hit with money laundering conspiracy charges. The college cheating scandal comes on the heels of the disgraceful dismissal of actor Jussie Smollett’s case. But with this case, don’t expect actresses Felicity Huffman or Lori Loughlin to be treated so “kindly” as Smollett . Of course, this is a tale of two entirely different cases, but it is also a tale of two different kinds of prosecutors and two different kinds of defendants.
The cheating scam illustrates the height of arrogance, privilege, and entitlement by the “haves” at the expense of the “have nots.” These actresses allegedly made illegal payoffs to cheat the college admission system so that their well-connected children could obtain even bigger head starts in life.
LORI LOUGHLIN INDICTED ON NEW MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL
Some people think, “Hold on. This is not a violent crime. What’s the big deal?” But what is missing from that perspective is that this is NOT a victimless crime. Think about the hard-working students and their parents who should have earned those spots -- the ones who played by the rules and didn’t bribe college officials for admission. Educational institutions and we as a society have been harmed by this scandal. The callous and insensitive actions of these parents are corrosive to our laws and societal values and have lessened our sense of fairness and respect for the college admissions process. When fairness is wrongly taken away from us, justice steps in -- at least most of the time, the Smollett-kind-of-cases notwithstanding.
Now, Smollett got the break of a lifetime and demonstrated that justice can be wrongly manipulated by those who administer it. He skates as unaccountable and arrogant, as he was when he scammed the world with his tale of being attacked.
But Huffman and Loughlin will not escape as Smollett did, and the U.S. attorney is clearly telegraphing that.
The fact is prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges have to make careful considerations about defendants every day.
Felicity Huffman has accepted responsibility by pleading guilty quickly. She has given a gut-wrenching statement of remorse to the court and the public, and she is willing to accept her punishment. This is what we in the law call atonement.
As a former prosecutor, this would have factored into how I decide to resolve her case. Yes, deterrence and punishment need to be considered. But her seemingly genuine remorse and willingness to plead guilty also achieve other important criminal justice goals, such as unburdening the court with otherwise lengthy legal proceedings and assisting prosecutors in building cases against other defendants. So it is fair for a lower sentence to be offered in exchange.
Huffman is now facing months in prison, not years, and it is possible that the lawyers may be able to convince a judge to give her no jail time at all. Either way, her “landing”, while not as cushy as Smollett’s, is still far better than the years in prison she faced had she toughed it out and later been convicted. By comparison, Loughlin is not getting the message. The U.S. attorney was seemingly unimpressed by her failure to plea and accept responsibility, and as a result, she secured a second, more draconian indictment that will likely add more jail time to her sentence. There will be no adoring fans seeing her as innocent Aunt Becky from Full House, and no handlers, agents or red carpets to placate her in that austere courtroom. In this case, the prosecutors have the great equalizer of wrongdoers who are powerful and famous: the grand jury.
My great grandfather once stated that “a small pebble can overturn a large carriage.” Metaphorically, I believe that Ms. Loughlin is about to run head-on into a prosecutorial boulder.
The physics of federal prosecution is that plea offers are escalating. This means they get harsher as the case goes on. Importantly, prosecutors are mandated under the attorney general guidelines to require defendants to plead guilty to the highest, most readily provable offense. So as charges are increased, more jail time is tacked on.

I am not saying that these parents should never see the light of day again, but typically when the reality hits defendants that they have harmed themselves further by having more serious charges filed against them, it is a decision often regretted -- from within a place where there is plenty of time to do little other than ponder their decisions.
Who knows … perhaps Ms. Loughlin has a valid defense to the charges. Or, perhaps she naively believes she will get a Smollett deal.
My feeling is that she is ensuring she will be going to federal prison at some juncture and that this moment of pride will be followed by her fall. Robert A.

Google’s Wing kicks off first drone delivery service in Australia,www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/googles-wing-drone-delivery-service-australia,"Wing partnered with local businesses to deliver small household items via drone to eligible homes in Canberra, located southwest of Sydney. Products are lowered from the drone by a string to the front yard of paying customers who live in the capital’s northern suburbs of Crace, Palmerston and Franklin. “Our service allows customers to order a range of items such as fresh food, hot coffee or over-the-counter chemist items on our mobile app, and have them delivered directly to their homes by drone in minutes,” Wing Medium wrote in a press release Monday, announcing plans to expand the service to surrounding areas in the coming months.
The Australian aviation authority granted Wing permission to operate a commercial drone delivery service after evaluating the company’s safety record and operational plans, BBC News reported. Despite complaints from residents over noise from drone flights, the agency has allowed Wing to test the service since 2014, concluding that the drones pose no risk to residents or other aircraft.
Wing will host community information stalls and delivery demonstrations in areas where the service is offered to ensure residents adjust to the drone deliveries, according to the press release. The country’s aviation authority requires Wing drones to steer clear of main roads and people and only to conduct deliveries during daytime hours as part of a policy to protect locals from disturbances, Observer reported.
Over the past 18 months, Wing’s drones have flown products to the doors of residents in Fernleigh Park, Royalla and Bonython communities more than 3,000 times before the commercial service was launched. During the service’s trial period, residents outside Canberra launched the Bonython Against Drones campaign, complaining loud drones disrupted the peace in local neighborhoods, BBC News reported.
""When they do a delivery drop they hover over the site and it sounds like an extremely loud, squealing vacuum cleaner,"" the group said on its website. The Australian aviation authority ordered Wing to develop quieter drones for its deliveries. As part of the agency’s new policy, drone deliveries will only be conducted on weekdays between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m.
“The feedback we have received during the trials has been valuable, helping us to refine our operations to better meet the needs and expectations of the communities in which we operate,” the company stated.
The company has partnered with local businesses, including Kickstart Expresso, Capital Chemist, Pure Gelato, Jasper + Myrtle, Bakers Delight, Guzman Y Gomez, and Drummond Golf. Wing is looking to partner with more companies in the future who are looking to “reach more customers faster, safer and more sustainably.”
Wing estimated that its drone delivery service could add as much as $28.5 million to Australia’s annual revenue at its full capacity, The Guardian reported .

George magazine co-founder, Michael J. Berman, said he was shocked Kennedy suggested Madonna – who famously portrayed his late father’s reported mistress Marilyn Monroe in the 1985 music video “Material Girl” – to pose as the former first lady.
“There were always things that we’d think he was going to be weirded out about but he wasn’t,” explained Berman. “He wanted to do a cover about his mother. Something about telling the truth, it was his idea. He wanted somebody dressed like his mother sitting on a pile of every book that’s ever been written about her. And I was like, ‘It sounds great, but we don’t need the books.’”
“He called Madonna and asked her to do it,” continued Berman. “We were like, ‘Holy s---, you’re going to see Jackie Kennedy on the cover with the sunglasses and the hair and then you’re going to look again and it’s Madonna.”
Madonna, who allegedly had a fling with Kennedy in 1988, refused.

“He faxed Madonna a note,” said executive assistant Rosemarie Terenzio . “And she called, I remember she left a voicemail. ‘Hi, it’s Madonna calling for John. I don’t know if this is the right number, but this is the number that he gave me’ — clearly annoyed that she was in voicemail.”
“So he told her the idea, and she faxed a note back. It said, ‘Dear Johnny Boy’ – because she loved to f--- with him – ‘Thanks for asking me to be your mother, but I’m afraid I could never do her justice. My eyebrows aren’t thick enough, for one.&apos;”
According to Terenzio, Madonna suggested she might be a better fit to pose as Adolf Hitler’s wife.
“When you want me to portray Eva Braun , I might say yes,” Madonna quipped.
And the pop star wasn’t the only icon to turn down Kennedy. Terenzio revealed the former first son was also turned down by Princess Diana.

“We wanted to put Princess Diana on the cover,” she explained. “There were all these calls back-and-forth; she was in town and staying at the Carlyle [in New York City]. I can’t remember who hatched this scheme that he should go in disguise. We were laughing and carrying on, ‘Oh, go in as this’ or ‘go in as that.’ And finally, he was like, ‘I’m not going anywhere in disguise, that’s the stupidest thing ever.” It just wasn’t him.”
“He had tea with her,” Terenzio continued. “When he came out, I said, ‘Well, how was she?’ And he’s like, ‘She’s tall, taller than I thought. She’s very nice, shy, a little coy. But she’s not going to do it.’ At the end of the day, all he cared about was getting a yes to the cover of George. Everything else was kind of, whatever.”
Executive editor Elizabeth Mitchell added that Diana’s death in 1997 at age 36 greatly impacted Kennedy.
“When Diana died, I remember calling him at home and saying, ‘We’re going to have to do something.’ And he said, ‘Yeah, OK, we’ll talk about it.’ So I called a meeting to discuss it. He just didn’t come — he wasn’t showing up on time, which he normally would never do. We kept delaying, and finally, he came in and said, ‘I can’t do it right now, I need to clean my office.’

“It was obvious he was having an emotional response to the tragedy and finding it difficult. He kept saying, ‘I don’t see why this needs to be a story.’ In the end, we did this incredible photo essay of the mourning going on in London.”
This July will mark 20 years since Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette died in 1999 after the aircraft he was piloting crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. The trio was on their way to Rory Kennedy’s wedding. He was 38.

Instead, she was hoping to take a break. Terenzio said she convinced Carolyn to attend to avoid questions being raised on any reported marital woes the tabloids were clinging onto. Carolyn would go on that fatal flight, which haunted Terenzio for years.
“It was very difficult,” Terenzio admitted. “It took time for me to get back up and figure out what I wanted to do next… there was a lot of trial and error.”
Terenzio chronicled her memories with Kennedy in the 2012 memoir “Fairy Tale Interrupted,” which helped her cope. Today she is the founder of a publicity firm. And while Terenzio’s career continues to flourish, she still thinks of her friends and what could have been.
“I don’t think he felt any pressure or felt any burden [to pursue politics] because of his name,” she said at the time. “I think he saw it as a wealth of opportunity. And that he was very lucky. He thought about it. He certainly talked about running for office, but his priority was to make George a success.”

Mohammad al-Issa: My advice to Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar News,www.foxnews.com,Mohammad Al-Issa,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mohammad-issa-tlaib-omar,"It is a challenging question. I may be the secretary-general of the Muslim World League, but it’s not my place to counsel lawmakers — Muslim or not — elected and entrusted to represent their communities. My refrain is often along the lines of: “They should faithfully advocate for their constituents, and faithfully serve as custodians of the Constitution.” It is perhaps an unexpected response. But it is one that reflects my view of inclusive national integration, and how best to promote tolerance toward people of all faiths and backgrounds.
As I tell my American friends in and out of government when they ask about the integration of Muslims, the majority in any country has vital obligations. For one, they must create a framework of identity independent of religious or ethnic affiliation. The binding element should be love of country. The universal ambition should be to enable meaningful contributions to society.
I have dwelled upon this matter deeply in the weeks since a crazed extremist gunned down 50 Muslims in their houses of worship and injured 50 others in New Zealand. This is not because the attack relates to the two congresswomen, but because the question goes to the heart of how we construe successful integration. My answer remains the same.
In fact, I believe the message is even more poignant today. To build tolerance and promote full national integration, majority and minority bear a responsibility that is, at its core, similar. It starts with embracing diversity and putting the interests of the entire nation first.
Respecting the law is a two-way street. When I sat down with French politician Marine Le Pen, people questioned what I was trying to do. I hope I showed them otherwise when we found some common ground, particularly concerning integration. We agreed that the nation must guarantee full rights and freedom to all people under her flag and that all citizens must respect the laws of their government.
We can teach our children religion without isolating them from their communities, or erecting psychological walls between them and the majority.
No nation, no community, and no majority or minority are immune to mistakes that hinder inclusive citizenship. We must all explore our own actions and prejudices to determine how well we are contributing to harmony, coexistence and national cooperation. We should examine our civil society institutions to see if they effectively advocate the interests of a national body representative of everyone.
My organization represents the interests of all of the world’s Muslims, but I see my mandate as broader. I am determined to combat intolerance and hatred toward anyone based on race, religion, ethnicity or personal beliefs. Bigotry and racism against one is a crime against all.
As a Muslim right now, it might seem appealing to play the victim card to gain political advantage. This trap benefits no country and no minority group, however great its grief. We as Muslims must confront the problem from within, and see how our attitudes or behavior contributes to misunderstanding. This is not to say Muslims are culpable, but that we share a responsibility to make things better.
I tell Muslims everywhere I travel to embrace the nations they live in and to positively integrate. The process must start early. It makes no sense to separate Muslim children and youth from the rest of society or to cloister them away in Islamic private schools. We can teach our children religion without isolating them from their communities or erecting psychological walls between them and the majority.
Dialogue is critical. Unless we talk to one another, even with those whose opinions we most virulently reject, how are we to define an inclusive national interest? If we differ on tactics and approaches, we can start by harmonizing our goals, which must include the advancement of the entire nation rather than any partisan bloc, religious community or ethnic subgroup. This maxim must hold true for both the majority and the minority.

The Hallmark series “ When Calls the Heart ” is gearing up to announce the return date of Season 6 after some retooling in the wake of star Lori Loughlin ’s indictment for money laundering in the ongoing college admissions scandal . Hallmark confirmed to Fox News that it had cut ties with the embattled 54-year-old star and fired her from “When Calls the Heart.”
""We are saddened by the recent news surrounding the college admissions allegations,"" a statement from Crown media reads. ""We are no longer working with Lori Loughlin and have stopped development of all productions that air on the Crown Media Family Network channels involving Lori Loughlin, including 'Garage Sale Mysteries,' an independent third-party production.""
LORI LOUGHLIN COULD NOW FACE UP TO 40 YEARS IN JAIL AFTER NEW CHARGES, REPORT SAYS
This stalled the production on Season 6. However, according to Deadline , the network will soon announce the show’s return sometime next month. It’s unclear how the show will address the loss of Loughlin’s Abigail Station character, but the outlet reports that some creative editing will be implemented to remove her from future episodes.
Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were indicted on fraud and money laundering charges Tuesday in the multimillion-dollar college admissions cheating scam that has ensnared dozens of wealthy parents trying to get their kids into the nation's most prestigious colleges.
The ""Fuller House"" star and her husband, along with 14 other parents, were charged in Boston in a ""second superseding indictment with conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering,"" the Department of Justice said in a statement to Fox News. "
"Charles Van Doren, figure in game show scandals, dead at 93",www.foxnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/charles-van-doren-figure-in-game-show-scandals-dies-at-93,"The dashing young academic&apos;s meteoric rise and fall as a corrupt game show player served as a cautionary tale about the staged competitions of early television after he admitted to cheating on the 1950s show “Twenty-One.” His son John Van Doren told the Associated Press that his father died of natural causes Tuesday at a care center for the elderly in Canaan, Conn. Funeral services will be private.
The handsome scion of a prominent literary family, Van Doren was the central figure in the TV game show scandals of the late 1950s and eventually pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to a grand jury that investigated them. He spent the following decades largely out of the public eye.
""It&apos;s been hard to get away, partly because the man who cheated on &apos;Twenty-One&apos; is still part of me,"" he wrote in a 2008 New Yorker essay, his first public comment in years.
Before his downfall, he was a ratings sensation. He made 14 electrifying appearances on ""Twenty-One"" in late 1956 and early &apos;57, vanquishing 13 competitors and winning a then-record $129,000. NBC hired him as a commentator.
In a February 1957 cover story on Van Doren, Time magazine marveled at the ""fascinating, suspense-taut spectacle of his highly trained mind at work.""
""Just by being himself,"" Time wrote, ""he has enabled a giveaway show, the crassest of lowbrow entertainments, to whip up a doting mass audience for a new kind of TV idol — of all things, an egghead.""
Later, as the triumph unraveled into scandal, he initially denied he had been given advance answers, but he finally admitted that the show was rigged.
He retreated to his family&apos;s home in rural West Cornwall, Connecticut, after telling a congressional committee in 1959 that he was coached before each segment of the show.

After spending much of the 1960s and &apos;70s in Chicago, Van Doren and his wife, Geraldine, returned to Connecticut, residing for years in a small brown bungalow on the family compound. They did some teaching but largely lived in semi-seclusion, refusing to grant interviews and even leaving the country for several weeks when Robert Redford&apos;s film ""Quiz Show"" was released in the fall of 1994.
Van Doren refused to cooperate in the movie&apos;s making and declined to meet with actor Ralph Fiennes, who portrayed him in the film. Fiennes later told People magazine that after Van Doren brushed him off, he knocked on his door pretending to be lost so he could observe Van Doren&apos;s movements and speech patterns.
Van Doren broke his silence in 2008, writing an account of his downfall in The New Yorker and how he finally had publicly admitted a half-century earlier that he was ""foolish, naive, prideful and avaricious.""
""People who knew the entertainment business didn&apos;t have much doubt about what was going on, although they didn&apos;t speak out,"" he wrote.
In light of the large profits the rigged game shows were making, he added, ""why would they?""
He also disclosed that he eventually did watch ""Quiz Show"" and laughed at an insulting reference that a character made about him. He said he had been tempted to take a consulting fee from the producers, but his wife talked him out of it.

Van Doren&apos;s family had a proud literary standing at the time of the scandal. His father, Mark Van Doren, was a critic, biographer and poet who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1940. His uncle, Carl Van Doren, received a Pulitzer in 1939 for a biography of Benjamin Franklin.
Charles Van Doren was himself a rising young academic at Columbia when he became famous on the quiz show. He went on to win $129,000 on the show after defeating Herbert Stempel, a New Yorker portrayed by John Turturro in the movie.
Stempel later went public and said contestants were fed the answers to the questions prior to the show. He said he was told to lose because the show&apos;s producers thought Van Doren had star potential.
25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH In 1962, Van Doren and nine other winners from three NBC shows — ""Twenty-One,"" &apos;&apos;Tic-Tac-Dough"" and ""Hi-Lo"" — pleaded guilty to lying to a grand jury that had investigated the scandal. They were spared jail terms by a judge who said the nation&apos;s scorn was punishment enough.
After the scandal broke, Van Doren lost the $50,000-a-year job NBC gave him when he defeated Stempel. He also was dropped from the faculty at Columbia, where his father had been a professor for decades.
Friends said Van Doren&apos;s family was shocked by his eventual revelation that he had been given the answers in advance.
Bucky Whitney, a longtime friend, recalled the family&apos;s shame.
""His father took it real hard. The old man was never the same after that,"" Whitney told a reporter who visited Cornwall when ""Quiz Show"" came out.
Van Doren later joined the Institute for Philosophical Research, a nonprofit Chicago think tank, and worked at Chicago-based Encyclopaedia Britannica for many years. Among his books were ""The Idea of Progress,"" a philosophical work, and ""A History of Knowledge; Past, Present, and Future.""
Van Doren and his wife had two children, Elizabeth and John.
""He was a loving husband and a terrific father, and he&apos;s going to be deeply missed,"" John Van Doren said.
In West Cornwall, neighbors were protective of ""Charley,"" as Van Doren was affectionately known.
Walter DeTheir, the proprietor of a store in Cornwall, said Van Doren was a quiet, shy man who came in regularly to pick up the Sunday New York Times.
""It&apos;s not that he isn&apos;t friendly, he just doesn&apos;t have much to say,"" DeTheir said.
In his New Yorker piece, Van Doren said he liked to avoid ""people who say, &apos;Aren&apos;t you Charles Van Doren?&apos; Well, that&apos;s my name, I say to myself, but I&apos;m not who you think I am — or, at least, I don&apos;t want to be.""

Albanian military sent in to airport after cash heist,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/albanian-military-sent-in-to-airport-after-cash-heist,"Europe Published 6 hours ago Albanian military sent in to airport after cash heist TIRANA, Albania – The Albanian Defense Ministry has sent in the military to secure the country&apos;s only international airport after armed men stole a large sum of cash as it was loaded onto a passenger plane.
Defense Minister Olta Xhacka said Wednesday she has ordered military police and a special air forces battalion to install a security perimeter around Mother Teresa International Airport in Tirana.
The robbers took the cash as it was loaded onto an Austrian Airlines plane on Tuesday afternoon. One robber was shot dead in an exchange of fire with police, but the cash was not recovered.
Cash is regularly sent out of Albania by private banks because the country&apos;s central bank does not accept foreign currency.
Hong Kong-based China Everbright Ltd, which runs the airport, rejected as ""incorrect"" claims by the interior minister that security at the airport had failed."

When he checked back in to find out his score, however, the 17-year-old said he got quite a surprise. ""I was shocked, I showed my friend because I was walking to school,"" he told FOX13 on Tuesday. ""We both kind of freaked out for a second and then ran to class.""
Harrison said he studied for the SAT and took practice tests to prepare. But between his other extracurricular activities, the teen wasn&apos;t expecting a perfect score.

His mother, Sheri Harrison, said she was initially confused because she thought her son was joking.

Harrison said while he may have achieved a perfect score, he&apos;s focused on his other activities and newfound tutoring business. After graduating from high school, the 17-year-old is looking to go on to college to study statistics.
""There&apos;s a lot of attention with getting 1,600, but you know, I&apos;m just kind of moving on from it, and focusing on other things in my life,"" he told FOX13.
