President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday that he wasn't ""disturbed"" by a series of North Korean short-range missile tests conducted last week, despite concerns that the tests violate both United Nations restrictions and an informal agreement inked between North Korea and the United States last year.
Trump tweeted about the tests Saturday, calling the missiles ""small weapons,"" and focusing instead on North Korea's comments about former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden. North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019
""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?"" Trump tweeted.
The statement runs counter to his administration's official position on the tests. On Saturday, National Security Adviser John Bolton told media that he had “no doubt” that the tests were in violation of United Nations regulations and that North Korea should be held responsible, according to CNN .
""The U.N. Security Council resolution prohibits the launch of any ballistic missiles and there is no doubt that North Korea has violated the resolution,"" Bolton told reporters.
North Korea resumed short- and long-range missile tests earlier this month, its first since 2017, before it began actively negotiating with the Trump administration to end sanctions across the board and resume normal relations with western nations.
White House staff wrote off allegations that the president was actively contradicting his own top advisers by saying that North Korea's new efforts aren't, in fact, disturbing, by indicating that Trump was simply agreeing with North Korean state television's accompanying comments about Biden, calling the former VP's comments, critical of North Korea, a ""sophism of an imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being, let alone a politician.""
""I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told NBC's Meet the Press Sunday morning. “The president doesn’t need somebody else to give him an assessment of Joe Biden. He’s given his own assessment a number of times.”
Biden's campaign responded by saying that Trump had been tricked into making concessions to North Korea.
Typically, the back-and-forth between Trump and his advisers, and his off-the-cuff social media remarks wouldn't have immediate or catastrophic consequences, but this week Trump is on a state visit to Japan and engaging in a series of meetings with Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe.
Japan is deeply concerned about North Korea, given that the country is within targeting range. Abe agreed with Bolton, telling reporters over the weekend that he also believes North Korea's recent missile tests are in violation of United Nations resolutions and that he would like to see North Korea discontinue their attacks. The United States and Japan haven't agreed on an approach to North Korea, but Bolton said he would be encouraging Japanese diplomats to return to talks with North Korea.
Trump and Shinzo Abe will discuss ""making sure the integrity of the Security Council resolutions are maintained"" during meetings on Monday."
PRO-LIFE WIN: Another State Passes Major Abortion Ban | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47691/pro-life-win-another-state-passes-major-abortion-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 26, 2019 views
On Friday, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed into law one of the most pro-life laws in the nation, outlawing abortion at eight weeks, save an exception for the life or risk of major physical harm to the mother. The legislation does not include an exception for rape or incest, and sex- , ability- , and race-selective abortions are also banned outright.
The law is set to go into effect on August 28, though pro-abortion organizations are expected to challenge its constitutionality. As noted byFox News, the Missouri law was crafted to stand up to legal challenges, not provoke a showdown over Roe v. Wade: “ If the eight-week ban is struck down, the bill includes a ladder of less-restrictive time limits at 14, 18 or 20 weeks.”
Additionally, if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned, the law is designed to kick-in as a full abortion ban.
Responding to criticism over the lack of exceptions for abortion post-eight weeks, Gov. Parson argued that two months is enough time to decide to get an abortion, even in tough cases.
""Is it a terrible thing that happens in those situations? Yes it is,” the Republican acknowledged, according to Fox. “But the reality of it is bad things do happen sometimes. But you have two months to decide what you're going to do with that issue, and I believe in two months you can make a decision.”
After the law goes into effect, those performing illegal abortions could face 15 years behind bars. Mothers, however, cannot be punished for having an abortion — as with Alabama’s strict abortion ban signed last week.
Sara Baker, a rep from the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, called the law “unconstitutional""; the organization has vowed to look at “all options, including litigation, to block the law from going into effect.""
Democrats have responded to sweeping pro-life legislation with their own proposed bill: the euphemistically-named “Women’s Health Protection Act,” or WHPA. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), would block and upend vital pro-life legislation, such as so-called “heartbeat bills” — which protect unborn babies with a detectable heartbeat from abortion — waiting periods, and mandates on ultrasounds, among other abortion restrictions, as reported by The Daily Wire on Friday.
Speaking at a press conference about the bill on Thursday — flanked by Planned Parenthood president Leana Wen — Chu boasted, “Our bill finally puts a stop to the state-based attacks that anti-abortion advocates have been trying to use to undermine or even reverse Roe . ... It means no abortion bans.""
“Access to safe & legal abortions isn't just a women's issue—it's a human rights issue. Today, we introduce the Women's Health Protection Act to guarantee a person's right to control their own body & future, everywhere in America,” read a post on Sen. Blumenthal’s Facebook page. “We refuse to stand by as extremist state lawmakers try to undermine women's health care. Proud to stand up with Judy Chu& hundreds of our colleagues to say: It's time to fight back against anti-choice state laws. #ActForWomen”"
Argentinian Doctor Convicted For Refusing To Perform Abortion; Faces Up To 2 Years In Prison | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47696/argentinian-doctor-convicted-refusing-perform-frank-camp,"Argentinian Doctor Convicted For Refusing To Perform Abortion; Faces Up To 2 Years In Prison Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images May 26, 2019 views
Argentinian OB-GYN Dr. Leandro Rodríguez Lastra has been found guilty of ""breaching the duties of a public official"" after he allegedly interrupted the process of a medication-based abortion in 2017, according to local news outlet La Mañana de Cipoletti.
In April 2017, a 19-year-old woman who claims to have been raped arrived at Pedro Moguillansky Hospital in Cipoletti having taken misoprostal in order to induce an abortion. Dr. Rodríguez Lastra, head of gynecology, did not perform the abortion, but allegedly gave the woman drugs to reverse the effects of the misoprostal.
Live Action reports that the doctor ""determined that [the woman] had an infection and was in danger of septic shock. She was at risk of losing her uterus and of dying. An obstetric expert testified that this diagnosis was correct, and that Rodríguez Lastra saved the woman’s life.""
While often used ""for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers associated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,"" misoprostal is also ""useful for elective medical abortion, cervical ripening before surgical abortion, evacuation of the uterus in cases of embryonic or fetal death, and induction of labor,"" according to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
The Catholic Herald reports that the fetus was almost 23 weeks gestational age upon inspection by the doctor. After Rodríguez Lastra treated the woman, she reportedly carried the child nearly to term, after which labor was induced, or a c-section was performed, and the child was adopted.
While abortion is largely illegal in Argentina, the law states that in cases of rape, the procedure may be carried out:
The abortion practiced by a licensed physician with the consent of the pregnant woman is not punishable:
1. If it has been done in order to avoid a danger to life or health of the mother and if this danger can not be avoided by other means;
2. If the pregnancy comes from a rape or an attack on the shame committed on an idiot or demented woman. In this case, the consent of your legal representative shall be required for the abortion.
La Mañana de Cipoletti quotes Judge Álvaro Meynet, who stated that because Dr. Rodríguez Lastra was not officially known as a ""conscientious objector,"" he was obligated to perform the abortion:
During the events, Rodríguez Lastra was not in the registry of conscientious objectors. It can be inferred that the accused did not have a public position contrary to the practice of abortion, at least in cases covered by the law. He is accused of not having provided a professional medical benefit in the legal framework to which he is obliged.
The judge added: ""The administration of drugs is added to reverse the process initiated by the patient, so the accused never had the slightest intention of carrying out the practice that the patient claimed.""
Following the verdict, Rodríguez Lastra stated in part:
I am disappointed, I trusted another result, the Justice had its reading, the Judge decided and manifested it, I remain convinced of my actions. ... This is simply a setback, and all it does is show the strength we have. Justice is much more than just what has just happened. We have to accept this setback as it is. Thank you very much for everything.
The Buenos Aires Times reports that Rodríguez Lastra will be sentenced ""in the coming days."" La Mañana de Cipoletti writes that the doctor faces up to two years in prison and/or a suspension of his medical license. However, the exact sentence remains a mystery as of publication. "
"Tornadoes Rip Through Oklahoma And Missouri, Killing 5 And Injuring Dozens | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47697/tornadoes-rip-through-oklahoma-and-missouri-emily-zanotti,"Tornadoes Rip Through Oklahoma And Missouri, Killing 5 And Injuring Dozens Photo by Reed Hoffmann/Getty Images May 26, 2019 views
Tornadoes ripped through Oklahoma and Missouri overnight Saturday night, leaving at least two dead, dozens injured, and more missing.
Oklahoma has been raked by severe weather all week, with multiple incidents of tornadoes over the course of several days, but Saturday night, large, F3 tornadoes formed across the state, as well as across the Texas panhandle and parts of Missouri.
The Weather Channel reports that the first tornado touched down in El Reno, Oklahoma — about 25 minutes outside Oklahoma City — just after 10:30 p.m. Two people who were taking shelter in their mobile home were killed and at least 30 more were injured when the same formation tore through a motel at the corner of Interstate 40 and U.S. Highway 81. Some of the injuries were deemed ""critical"" but no specifics were given about victims' injuries.
The City of El Reno has established a GoFundMe to help residents affected by the tornado, which lasted only ""5 to 10 minutes"" but lofted debris ""up to a height of 7,000 feet,"" ripping mobile homes from their foundations and tearing through streets and highways.
“It’s a tragic scene out there,” El Reno Mayor Matt White told journalists Sunday morning. “People have absolutely lost everything.""
“The thing about El Reno is we are more than a community, we are a family. ... We’re going to overcome this. It’s so devastating to see the loss out there,” White later added.
Areas in metropolitan Oklahoma City also reported damage from the high winds and heavy rain that followed the tornado, including ""trees snapped in half"" and blown-out windows.
A second tornado scraped through the suburbs of Tulsa, Oklahoma, causing damage but, so far, no reported injuries. Officials are still determining the strength of that weather formation. That tornado comes on the heels of days of rain that forced the evacuation of hundreds of Tulsa residents. More rain is expected this week.
Missouri, Kansas, and the Texas panhandle also suffered significant storm damage on Friday, and then again overnight Saturday to Sunday, the latest incidents in a week of weather that has seen back-to-back severe storms and tornadoes — a weather pattern that meteorologists told the Kansas City Star repeats itself every 15-20 years, leaving typically hardy mid-westerners tired and weather-weary.
""[A]s the clock ticked toward midnight, a twister with EF-3 winds in excess of 135 miles per hour cut a path through Jefferson City, the state’s capital, heaving bricks and turning homes into dollhouses ripped open to the sky,"" the Kansas City Star reported on the severe weather that ripped through Friday. Three people were left dead Friday night after the same tornado destroyed Golden, Missouri, AccuWeather adds.
Although some politicians have seized on the record-breaking weather as proof of ""climate change,"" local meteorologists say that that explanation is somewhat lacking. Certainly, global warming may cause incremental temperature shifts that ultimately affect weather patterns, but there is ""no clear link"" between global warming and the number of tornadoes that hit a given area of the United States.
Tornado alley, though — the area of the United States where severe weather is more likely — is shifting, as is tornado season. Areas to the south and east are now more likely to experience tornadoes alongside the central plains states, and tornadoes begin forming in early May now, rather than in early June.
Scientists tell the Kansas City Star that they're not willing to make any proclamations as to why ""Tornado Alley"" is slowly relocating, and while it may be climate motivated, much more research is needed."
Jon Voight Praises Trump. Alyssa Milano Mocks Him: ‘Has Been’ ‘F-Lister’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47700/jon-voight-praises-trump-alyssa-milano-mocks-him-hank-berrien,"Jon Voight Praises Trump. Alyssa Milano Mocks Him: ‘Has Been’ ‘F-Lister’ Photo by Maury Phillips/Getty Images for SAG-AFTRA May 27, 2019 views
On Saturday, actress Alyssa Milano, who may be 100% talent-free, stood atop her leftist soapbox and denounced protean actor Jon Voight, who had released a video in which he championed President Trump for his work as president, calling him “the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.” Milano tweeted:
Now I understand why Republicans like to discredit actors and our political views. “Stay in your lane, Jon!” “Has been!” “F-lister trying to stay relevant!” “Nobody cares what an out of touch actor thinks!” Now I understand why Republicans like to discredit actors and our political views. “Stay in your lane, Jon!” “Has been!” “F-lister trying to stay relevant!” “Nobody cares what an out of touch actor thinks!” https://t.co/LcIGgBO9az — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) May 25, 2019
Voight said in the video:
People of the Republican Party: I know you’ll agree with me when I say our president has our utmost respect and our love. This job is not easy. For he’s battling the Left and their absurd words of destruction. I’ve said this once and I’ll say this again: that our nation has been built on the solid ground from our forefathers and there is a moral code of duty that has been passed on from President Lincoln.
I’m here today to acknowledge the truth, and I’m here today to tell you, my fellow Americans, that our country is stronger, safer, and with more jobs because our president has made his every move correct. Don’t be fooled by the political Left, because we are the people of this nation that is witnessing triumph. So let us stand with our president; let us stand up for this truth: that President Trump is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln. God bless America, and may God continue to guide this nation.
Since Milano was so eager to disparage Voight as a “Has been!” and “F-lister,” let’s take a quick look at how their careers compare. First, let’s examine Milano’s esteemed history. She’s a three-time winner of a Blimp Award, which is won from a vote for the Kid’s Choice Awards from Nickelodeon; she has been nominated for a Teen Choice Award, and she has garnered one nomination from the People’s Choice Awards. Most of the awards were for her role in “Who’s The Boss.” Oh, and she got another Blimp nomination for “Charmed.”
Pretty impressive.
Now for Voight. As The Daily Wire reported on Friday:
Voight, one of the few outspoken conservative voices in Hollywood, is currently working alongside Dennis Quaid on a drama on Ronald Reagan which follows the actor-turned-president from ""his childhood to his time in the oval office."" Voight also recently played Justice Warren E. Burger in the film "" Roe v. Wade "" (in post-production), which tells the story of the ""national battle in this untold conspiracy that led to the most famous and controversial court case in history.""
Along with his roles in several television series over his decades-long career, Voight has starred in major films from a wide range of genres, including ""Catch-22"" (1970), ""Deliverance"" (1972), ""Heat"" (1995), ""Mission Impossible"" (1996), ""Transformers"" (2007) and ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" (2016). Voight was nominated for Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role for ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969) and ""Runaway Train"" (1985) and best actor in a supporting role for ""Ali"" (2001). In 1979, he won the Oscar for best actor in a leading role for ""Coming Home"" (1978). He's also won several Golden Globes, including two for his role as Mickey Donovan.
As critic David Shipman once said of Voight, “His performance in Midnight Cowboy is one of the best ever in American film.”
If there’s a “has-been’ and “F-lister” between these two actors, it sure as hell ain’t Voight."
"Ex-CNN Contributors: Network 'Openly Despises Conservatives,' Has Become The 'Hate Trump' Network | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47701/ex-cnn-contributors-network-openly-despises-james-barrett,"May 27, 2019 views
According to several former contributors to the cable news network, CNN has increasingly become the anti-conservative, ""hate Trump"" network that allows only Republicans critical of the president on their airwaves and has systematically ""squeezed out"" conservative voices.
""Most of us got squeezed out involuntarily,"" former CNN contributor and former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA) told Mediaite . ""I was there for 2 years and was certainly willing to continue. It was clear to me in the end that the Republicans they prefer are anti-Trump Republicans.""
Mediaite also spoke with former CNN analyst Stephen Moore, who echoed Kingston's sentiments about the network's apparent preference for anti-Trump Republicans, noting that one of the few Republicans they feature is former Ohio Gov. and vocal Trump critic John Kasich.
""CNN is the hate Trump network,"" said Moore. ""They just trash Trump every single hour of every single day. All they’ve talked about for two years is the Muller report and how bad does it make them look now that it proved nothing?""
Another former CNN contributor that has not been shy about voicing complaints about CNN's ""obvious"" bias is talk radio host Buck Sexton, who told Mediate that the network now ""openly despises conservatives who are pro-Trump.""
""CNN used to pretend it accepted right wing voices for balance, but now it openly despises conservatives who are pro-Trump,"" Sexton told Mediaite. ""Today the entire enterprise clings to a fundamental dishonesty: that it has no political agenda. Taking down Trump is obviously the agenda. And in this regard, some of CNN’s ‘hard news’ anchors are the biggest journalistic frauds of all.""
As Fox News notes, the list of CNN's right-leaning voices has been dwindling at a rapid pace in recent months. Some of their departures have been prompted by Trump appointments: ""Last week, the network fired former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli as reports indicated he was being considered for a high-ranking immigration post in the Department of Homeland Security. Earlier this year, CNN fired economic analyst Stephen Moore after President Trump nominated him to serve on the Federal Reserve Board.""
Others have been fired ostensibly over scandals, the competing cable news network reports: ""Previously, CNN let go other commentators who supported President Trump. Contributors Jeffrey Lord and Ed Martin were fired for remarks they made outside the network. Paris Denard was let go after he was accused of sexual misconduct from a previous job.""
Others, like Kingston, former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer, Corey Lewandowski, Marc Short and Jason Miller, found that their contracts, often short-lived, were not renewed.
As The Daily Wire noted last week, amid accusations of the network's political bias against those on the right, particularly those who support the president, and declining ratings, CNN is also reportedly facing significant layoffs. ""Specific details were not yet known, but a source told Fox News that 'basically the whole division' will lose their jobs,"" Fox New's Brian Flood reported last week. TVNewser confirmed that report on Friday."
German Government Tells Jews: Don't Look Like Jews | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47699/german-government-tells-jews-dont-look-jews-hank-berrien,"German Government Tells Jews: Don't Look Like Jews Photo by Jens Büttner/picture alliance via Getty Image May 27, 2019 views
According to Germany’s government commissioner on anti-Semitism, Jews in his country should stop wearing kippahs (skullcaps) in public lest they incur the wrath of anti-Semites.
Quoted in an interview published on Saturday by the Funke regional press group, Felix Klein, whose job was created in 2018, stated, “I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere, all the time, in Germany.” Klein posited that “the lifting of inhibitions and the uncouthness which is on the rise in society” had contributed to the soaring rise in anti-Semitism, commenting, “The internet and social media have largely contributed to this, but so have constant attacks against our culture of remembrance.” Klein added he had “changed his mind compared to previously.”
The Guardian notes, “Antisemitic hate crimes rose by 20% in Germany last year, according to interior ministry data, which blamed nine out of ten cases on the extreme right. There were 62 violent antisemitic attacks, compared to 37 in 2017. “
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin responded on Sunday, saying that he was ""shocked"" by Klein’s recommendation, continuing, “Fears about the security of German Jews are a capitulation to anti-Semitism and an admittance that, again, Jews are not safe on German soil. We will never submit, will never lower our gaze and will never react to anti-Semitism with defeatism — and expect and demand our allies act in the same way.”
Richard Grenell, U.S. ambassador to Germany, added on Twitter, “The opposite is true. Wear your kippa. Wear your friend’s kippa. Borrow a kippa and wear it for our Jewish neighbors. Educate people that we are a diverse society.”
In April 2018, Klein noted that some of the rising anti-Semitism in Germany came from immigrants from the Middle East. He asserted :
There are several developments. One, of course, is the great influx of refugees and people who came to Germany that were raised and educated in countries that are still in the state of war with Israel, or that have been brought up with certain perceptions of Jews in Israel that are totally unacceptable to a German society. So we’re facing an integration problem. Because, of course, these people do not leave that image of Jews in Israel when they enter Germany … We have Palestinians in Germany that have lived here for a long time, and we see that crimes and incidents are also committed at a high percentage by people from that group.
Klein quickly added, “I would not say that generally Arabs or Muslims are anti-Semitic. That’s not true. You can’t generalize it. But of course there’s a certain image of Jews that is not acceptable.”
Asked which was more pervasive, anti-Semitism from Muslim immigrants or from the far-Right, Klein answered:
I wouldn’t like to prioritize the kind of anti-Semitism to combat first. It is generally unacceptable. But what I think is particularly difficult, and absolutely unacceptable, is the way the extreme right is threatening and insulting Jews, also with historical prejudices and arguments. That’s particularly insulting to them. Whereas I think more aggression and physical attacks maybe generally fall more into the category of anti-Semitic attacks that are motivated by Muslims."

An NBC poll which debuted Sunday on ""Meet the Press"" revealed a characteristic about Bernie Sanders (I-VT) voters that wasn't exactly flattering.
It turns out, the less you pay attention to politics, the more likely you are to support the socialist option for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
WATCH Chuck Todd deliver the bad news to his panel. WATCH: Poll shows the less you pay attention, the more likely you are to support Sanders #MTP #IfitsSunday Bernie Sanders is not the ""hot new kid anymore,"" @yamiche says pic.twitter.com/faUAnrbfuT — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) May 26, 2019
""The less you are paying attention, the more likely you are a Bernie Sanders supporter,"" Todd says, pointing to a Monmouth poll taken recently showing that Sanders is losing definite ground to both former Vice President Joe Biden and a suddenly-much-stronger Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has jumped between 5 and 6 points in the polls since Biden entered the race.
The implication, of course, is that Sanders voters are ""low information."" Todd's panel seems to agree, pointing out that Warren has been working harder than Sanders at courting primary state voters, and that Warren built on Sanders' 2016 campaign, turning what was then mere policy positions into what is now definitive policy proposals.
Unfortunately, Sanders voters, who often consider themselves the most informed, progressive (and maybe smartest and most talented) of voters didn't take kindly to the poll's suggestion that they really just don't know what they're doing and haven't been paying attention to the political landscape.
On social media, they were downright insulted.
Some accused Todd and NBC of being in the bag for Joe Biden and beholden to their corporate overlords at Comcast. ""It is obvious that Chuck Todd and others at NBC (owned by corporate Comcast) are Biden supporters. They are afraid of Bernie. They constantly try to spin things against Bernie,"" one commentator observed. It is obvious that Chuck Todd and others at NBC (owned by corporate Comcast) are Biden supporters.

A few went so far as to call the interview an ""ad"" for Biden's campaign.
Others simply lashed out at the news media altogether, accusing NBC — among other mainstream outlets — of being ""propaganda"" arms for the Democratic National Convention, in tweets tinged with more than a little tin foil hatted-ness. This is just stupid.

Others even went so far as to call the mere notion of ""information"" an anti-Bernie Sanders conspiracy. So, the less you consume anti-Bernie propaganda, the more likely you are to support him? I hope someone got paid a lot of money to uncover that gem. https://t.co/wUblLser34 — Anomaly (@spatial_anomaly) May 26, 2019
Bernie Sanders supporters are notoriously prickly. In 2016, they organized a sustained social media campaign against Hillary Clinton supporters in the hopes of elevating their candidate to a competitive position — and they had reason to believe that there was a conspiracy to deny Sanders the nomination because there was. Clinton's allies in the DNC were clearly rooting for their preferred candidate and willing to do what they could to marginalize Sanders.
This time around, though, Sanders' position isn't under quite the same threat. Four years after he burst onto the scene, Sanders' policy positions have been well-integrated into the Democratic party platform and younger, more ambitious political leaders — including Warren — are turning what, from Sanders, were mere complaints, into policy papers and draft legislation.

"Fed Up Waiting For The Feds, Private Groups Are Building A Border Wall In New Mexico | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47710/fed-waiting-feds-private-groups-are-building-emily-zanotti,"Fed Up Waiting For The Feds, Private Groups Are Building A Border Wall In New Mexico Photo by Jeff R Clow/GettyImages May 27, 2019 views
A private group called ""We Build the Wall"" says they've finished construction on a segment of border wall in New Mexico, closing a gap in the existing border wall themselves rather than waiting for Congress and the President to come to an agreement over how to fund the massive construction project along the United States' southern border.
The Washington Times reports that We Build the Wall unveiled their half-mile section over the weekend.
""The 18-foot steel bollard wall is similar to the designs used by the Border Patrol, sealing off a part of the border that had been a striking gap in existing fencing,"" the Times says. The gap runs from the Texas border, where it ends at the Rio Grand, up through southern New Mexico along the ""lower elevations"" or Mount Cristo Rey.
We Build the Wall claims the half-mile section of steel wall is the first privately constructed part of the border wall, and that their project moved faster and, at $8 million, required less funding than a similar project headed up by the federal government. The group, led by former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, also says they've got the blessing of President Donald Trump and United States Border Customs and Protection, who were grateful for the help.
""We’re closing a gap that’s been a big headache for them,” Kobach told reporters.
The half-mile segment of border wall, the group says, closes a gap frequently used to smuggle both people and drugs. Kobach added that on a ""typical night"" around 100 migrants and $100,000 worth of illegal narcotics passed through the half-mile hole.
The Trump Administration was working on a plan to construct around 234 miles of steel fencing, effectively sealing off the southern border with a ""border wall,"" but attempts to secure funding for the project have stalled. Congress refused to agree to any funding for the border wall beyond the $1.6 billion promised in the 2018 budget, and President Donald Trump's ""national emergency"" declaration — which would have detoured funding to the border wall from other Army Corps of Engineers projects — was halted by a judge pending ongoing litigation.
Funding for the border wall has also taken a backseat to a more urgent need: funding for border processing. More than 100,000 migrants are presenting themselves at the United States' southern border per month now, and, forced by law to process anyone who requests asylum, the CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are now overwhelmed with detained immigrants.
Although the Trump administration officially ended the ""catch and release"" policies of the Obama administration, the federal government has reportedly — according to Politico — been shipping migrants who declare asylum to cities in Texas and California, far from the southern border, in order to relieve the stress on border patrol facilities.
""The Trump administration is flying migrants to San Diego and Del Rio, Texas, and busing them to El Centro, Calif., and Laredo, Texas, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official familiar with the plan,"" Politico says. ""There, they are being processed — which includes photographs, health screenings, fingerprints and background checks — before they are often released and told to return for a court hearing at a later date.""
The administration is also reportedly considering sending migrants to less populated areas in Florida and in the American southwest, in the hopes that, by personally relocating them, they're better able to track asylum seekers while they await their day in court."
The NSA Lost Control Of A Cyberweapon. Now It’s Being Used Against American Cities. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47706/nsa-lost-control-cyberweapon-now-its-being-used-ashe-schow,"The NSA Lost Control Of A Cyberweapon. Now It’s Being Used Against American Cities. Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images May 27, 2019 views
In 2017, the National Security Agency (NSA) lost control of some of the hacking tools it used “to spy on other countries,” The New York Times reported . The NSA, it appeared, had itself been hacked — or infiltrated:
Fifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency’s counterintelligence arm, known as Q Group, and the F.B.I., officials still do not know whether the N.S.A. is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider’s leak, or both. Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.
Some of the tools appeared to have been obtained by a group called the Shadow Brokers, who went on to taunt the agency while disclosing information about highly classified operations.
Fast forward to today, and one of the stolen tools, known as EternalBlue, is being used to commit cyberattacks against major U.S. cities.
The Times reported Saturday that Baltimore and other cities have been targeted by “state hackers in North Korea, Russia and, more recently, China.” In Baltimore, hackers had “frozen thousands of computers, shut down email and disrupted real estate sales, water bills, health alerts and many other services.”
The computer screens of city workers would suddenly lock, the Times reported, and a message would appear demanding $100,000 in Bitcoin to unlock the screens. The message appeared in broken English, just like the messages from Shadow Brokers two years earlier.
“We’ve watching you for days,” the message said, according to The Baltimore Sun . “We won’t talk more, all we know is MONEY! Hurry up!”
Baltimore city officials have refused to pay and are trying to find ways to work around the errors.
The Times reported that Baltimore and other cities, some in Pennsylvania, Texas, and in between, were unaware that part of the malware being used against them was created by the NSA.
It has been two years since the Times first reported on the Shadow Brokers and says the FBI still doesn’t know whether they “are foreign spies or disgruntled insiders.”
EternalBlue, the Times reported, was so named because it originally crashed computers by exploiting a flaw in Microsoft’s software, causing an EternalBluescreen (the original name). The tool was used successfully without alerting the computer company to the issue and used it to gather intelligence.
The Times reported that North Korea has used the tool to attack “the British health care system, German railroads and some 200,000 organizations around the world.” Russia used the tool to attack Ukraine. Their attack spread to major companies, costing FedEx more than $400 million and pharmaceutical company Merck $670 million.
Russia also used the tool to go after hotel Wi-Fi networks. Iran used it to hack Middle Eastern airlines.
The story doesn’t appear to be receiving the attention it deserves."
‘An Anti-Semitism Crisis’: NYPD Records Staggering 83% Rise In Hate Crimes | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47714/anti-semitism-crisis-nypd-records-staggering-83-josh-hammer,"May 27, 2019 views
According to The Wall Street Journal , the New York Police Department (NYPD) has recorded a truly harrowing and eye-popping increase in city-wide hate crimes over the past year. Specifically, NYPD statistics reveal that hate crimes have increased by a whopping 83% — and the City Council's speaker minced no words in lamenting the epidemic presently afflicting the city with the nation's largest Jewish population as ""an anti-Semitism crisis.""
Per the Journal:
The New York Police Department had 176 complaints of hate crimes from Jan. 1 to May 19, the most recent date for which the data is available, according to figures provided to The Wall Street Journal. That is an 83% increase in hate-crime complaints across all categories, compared with the same period in 2018.
The New York City Council created the Office of Hate Crime Prevention in January to coordinate city agencies’ efforts to address illegal bias incidents. ...
""Our residents should feel free to worship without fear–and yet they can’t right now,"" [City Council Speaker Corey Johnson] said. ""We have an anti-Semitism crisis in New York. It’s a national problem, but New York accounts for way too many incidents."" ...
Experts disagree on the reasons behind the rise in crimes, but NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said at a news conference earlier this month that many individuals arrested for hate crimes have previously committed similar acts. ...
""Things are out of control,"" said former State Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn, who is founder of the group Americans Against Antisemitism. ""All the resources in the world should be allocated to this purpose.""
The Daily Wire has reported before on the shocking rise in anti-Semitic incidents in New York City over the past couple of years. Curiously, however, much of the news surrounding the tragic rise has gone unreported by the mainstream press. Last November, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro explained why that might be the case:
Jews don’t fit the intersectional classification necessary in order to receive narrative attention from either the mainstream media or from progressive groups. Orthodox Jews, who are often the targets of anti-Semitic attacks, aren’t seen as victims; their victimizers, who aren’t conservatives and who can’t be linked with conservatives, aren’t seen as victimizers. There’s a reason Al Sharpton, who helped initiate a riot against Orthodox Jews in Crown Heights in 1991, has a show on MSNBC where he opines about President Trump’s linkages to white supremacist anti-Semitism. Certain types of anti-Semitism are worthy of note. Others aren’t. And those on the Left often decide which is which with simple reference to a preferred narrative in which Jews are part of the white privileged class, unless they are victimized by white supremacists.
New York University, which is the largest private university in New York City, has also seen appalling incidents of unhinged anti-Semitism , of late. Perhaps even worse, the international edition of The New York Times, the city's most famous and iconic newspaper, engaged last month in open and transparent anti-Semitism. The Daily Wire reported on the Third Reich-reminiscent cartoon and the Times' initial non-apology, at the time:
The New York Times came under intense fire over the weekend after the newspaper's international edition published a vile anti-Semitic cartoon that was widely condemned across the political spectrum. The newspaper was ripped again late Saturday for failing to apologize in their initial statement on the anti-Semitic cartoon. ...
The Times faced increased backlash after their non-apology and was forced to issue a new statement claiming the paper was ""deeply sorry"" after a white nationalist terrorist opened fire at a synagogue in California on Saturday, killing one and injuring three others.
""We are deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon last Thursday in the print edition of The New York Times that circulates outside of the United States, and we are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again,"" The Times said in a new statement. ""Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it’s all the more unacceptable."""

ABC News' Martha Raddatz grilled far-left Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Iran over the weekend, calling him out for not truthfully acknowledging what is going on.
Buttigieg blamed National Security Adviser John Bolton for escalating tensions with Iran, saying that Bolton was trying to ""prosecute a case to lead to higher tensions, escalation and perhaps conflict with Iran.""
""But this is also based on intelligence and the military,"" Raddatz responded. ""Central Command -- you know Central Command very well -- they asked for these troops for force protection, based on intelligence about missiles in some Iranian boats, so this is not John Bolton asking for this. This is the military.""
Buttigieg tried to deflect from Raddatz pointing out that his statements were false.
""But let me stick to this because it's based on intelligence,"" Raddatz pressed. ""Do you believe the intelligence?"" Democrat Pete Buttigieg blames John Bolton for escalation w/Iran Martha Raddatz: ""This is not John Bolton asking for this. This is the military.""

Transcript provided via ABC News :
RADDATZ: I want to move to foreign policy. The -- the Pentagon is sending 1,500 more military personnel over to the Middle East to deter Iran. Is that a good idea? Is that something you would have approved?
BUTTIGIEG: This is not a good sign. Escalation is the last thing we need in the Middle East right now. And when you see what's been happening, it appears that the administration, driven by the way by John Bolton, one of the architects of the Iraq War, is continuing to try to prosecute a case to lead to higher tensions, escalation and perhaps conflict with Iran as though we learned nothing from the last 15 years of armed conflict -- conflict in the Middle East.
RADDATZ: But this is also based on intelligence and the military. Central Command -- you know Central Command very well -- they asked for these troops for force protection, based on intelligence about missiles in some Iranian boats, so this is not John Bolton asking for this. This is the military.
BUTTIGIEG: Look, there is clearly a pattern of misbehavior and provocation by the Iranians that goes back in different ways across my entire lifetime.
RADDATZ: But let me stick to this because it's based on intelligence. Do you believe the intelligence?
BUTTIGIEG: Well, I can't weigh in on intelligence that I haven't seen, but what I do see is a pattern...
RADDATZ: But you've heard people in the military, commanders in the military today, saying, this was the intelligence they found.
BUTTIGIEG: And I think our national security policy has to be to avoid escalation in the Persian Gulf.
RADDATZ: But how do you do that if you're under threat? So if they think their forces need to be protected more and you don't send more…
BUTTIGIEG: I think that we have the means to protect our assets in the Middle East. And the way this is being talked about makes me wonder whether this -- this is driven as much by domestic politics as it is by national security imperatives."
Hillary: Trump Is Spreading 'Sexist Trash' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47717/hillary-trump-spreading-sexist-trash-james-barrett,"May 28, 2019 views
On Friday, Hillary Clinton came to the defense of fellow Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi by throwing down the ""sexism"" card against the man who stole her chance to become the first female President of the United States. Trump, she told a group of Democrats in Houston Friday, is posting ""sexist trash"" to try to disparage the Democratic leader. The twice-failed presidential candidate also warned the audience that her former opponent has put us in a ""very real constitutional crisis.""
""We have to remind Americans: we are the party that can deliver for them, but we also are the party that will stand up and protect the Constitution and address what is a very real constitutional crisis that this president has put us in,"" Clinton told a group of Democrats in Houston, Texas, as reported by The Washington Times .
As what she presented as evidence of this crisis, Clinton pointed to the ""doctored"" video of Pelosi Trump posted the day before. ""Just look at what’s happened in the last 24 hours. The president and his cronies have been running around spreading a doctored video of Nancy Pelosi. Now, it is sexist trash, but it is also a sign that Trump is running scared.""
As The Daily Wire reported last week, Trump posted a video edited to highlight moments where Pelosi struggled to deliver her comments. The video, which reportedly aired previously on Fox Business' ""Lou Dobbs Tonight,"" is a 30-second montage of Pelosi stammering over the course of a 20-minute news conference earlier that day. “PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE” pic.twitter.com/1OyCyqRTuk — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 24, 2019
Pelosi's team immediately accused Trump of pushing a ""doctored"" video, her daughter describing it as ""altered for speed,"" and her chief of staff pointing to a Washington Post report on a different video of Pelosi making the rounds that was indeed ""doctored"" to make her appear to be slurring her words more. But a digital forensics expert told NBC News that the video Trump posted was not ""altered for speed,"" but rather edited to highlight the stammering in a way that's ""highly deceptive"" because it makes her ""relatively small verbal stumbles"" seem more dramatic.
""Hany Farid, a computer-science professor and digital-forensics expert at University of California, Berkeley, told The Post that there was no doubt that video had been altered,"" NBC News reported. ""But he said he believed the video Trump tweeted Thursday had not been slowed down.""
""Unlike the video referred to in The Washington Post article, I don’t believe that this video montage was slowed down. This montage, however, is highly deceptive as it compiles in rapid succession relatively small verbal stumbles in an attempt to portray Speaker Pelosi as stumbling through her press conference,"" Farid told NBC.
While Trump posted the edited ""stammering"" video, Trump's legal adviser Rudy Giuliani reportedly posted the other doctored video of Pelosi slurring. After blowback for the video tweets, Giuliani responded online: ""Nancy Pelosi wants an apology for a caricature exaggerating her already halting speech pattern. First she should withdraw her charge which hurts our entire nation when she says the President needs an 'intervention.' 'People who live in a glass house shouldn’t throw stones.'""
The public feud between Trump and Pelosi has intensified over the last week and has begun to feature more personal attacks by each of them. After Pelosi accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and storming out of a meeting with Democrats, Trump described her as a ""mess"" and having ""lost it"" and floated a new nickname for her: ""Crazy Nancy."" Pelosi, in turn, mocked him as an ""extremely stable genius"" and slammed him for not being ""presidential.""
""When the 'extremely stable genius' starts acting more presidential, I’ll be happy to work with him on infrastructure, trade and other issues,"" Pelosi tweeted. "
Pro-Life Victory: SCOTUS Reinstates Indiana’s Fetal Remains Disposal Law | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47732/pro-life-victory-scotus-reinstates-indianas-fetal-josh-hammer,"May 28, 2019 views
In 2016, then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed into law an omnibus pro-life bill that had two particularly noteworthy provisions. First, the law required that unborn children who die via miscarriage or abortion be either cremated or buried — and not incinerated along with other medical byproducts. Second, as described by Rewire News, the Indiana law banned ""someone from obtaining a pre-viability abortion if [the] decision [to abort] is based on the race or sex of the fetus or concerns that the fetus has a diagnosis or 'potential diagnosis' of Down syndrome or 'any other disability.'""
Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which has appellate jurisdiction over Indiana, upheld the ruling of a lower district court judge that halted enforcement of the provisions for alleged unconstitutionality. Notably, the Seventh Circuit panel included a stinging rebuke from a dissenting Judge Daniel Manion, who objected that the Indiana law's fetal remains provision ought to be easily upheld under federal courts' highly deferential ""rational basis"" standard of review. ""Under traditional rational basis review, if state action doesn’t infringe upon a fundamental right or affect a protected class, we will uphold it so long as it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest,"" Manion wrote. ""The fetal remains provision easily satisfies that extremely deferential standard.""
On Tuesday, in an unsigned Per Curiam opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court vindicated Judge Manion and reinstated Indiana's fetal remains disposal law. Notably, seven justices of the Court signed onto the reinstatement — with only far-left Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor refusing to join. Note that Justice Kagan (and Breyer) apparently join the Court in upholding the IN fetal remains law. 7-2 (Ginsburg and Sotomayor). https://t.co/1RPR8TNHgS — Casey Mattox (@CaseyMattox_) May 28, 2019
The Per Curiam majority clarified that the fetal remains disposal law did not implicate the ""undue burden"" constitutional standard fabricated in the Court's landmark 1992 case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey , but instead relied solely on ""rational basis"" review.
The Court also upheld the Seventh Circuit's invalidation of Indiana's race/sex/""abnormality""-selective abortion ban — a ban that the Seventh Circuit's prominent Judge Frank Easterbook previously described as a ""eugenics statute."" As Easterbrook powerfully opined last June in dissenting from the Seventh Circuit's decision not to rehear the case in front of the full court, ""None of the [Supreme] Court’s abortion decisions holds that states are powerless to prevent abortions designed to choose the sex, race, and other attributes of children.""
Today, in a lengthy concurrence that will surely be discussed in abortion litigation for years to come, originalist stalwart Justice Clarence Thomas took pains to outline the history of the 20th-century eugenics movement in America and to connect it to the Indiana law at issue. Here were some highlights :
The use of abortion to achieve eugenic goals is not merely hypothetical. The foundations for legalizing abortion in America were laid during the early 20th-century birth-control movement. That movement developed alongside the American eugenics movement. And significantly, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger recognized the eugenic potential of her cause. She emphasized and embraced the notion that birth control ""opens the way to the eugenist."" ...
Whereas Sanger believed that birth control could prevent ""unfit"" people from reproducing, abortion can prevent them from being born in the first place. Many eugenicists therefore supported legalizing abortion, and abortion advocates — including future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher — endorsed the use of abortion for eugenic reasons. Technological advances have only heightened the eugenic potential for abortion ...
Abortion advocates were sometimes candid about abortion’s eugenic possibilities. In 1959, for example, Guttmacher explicitly endorsed eugenic reasons for abortion. ...
Judge Easterbrook was correct. Whatever else might be said about Casey , it did not decide whether the Constitution requires States to allow eugenic abortions. ...
Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement. "
WATCH: Gillette Ad Shows Father Teaching Transgender Child How To Shave | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47726/watch-gillette-ad-shows-father-teaching-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 28, 2019 views
If you thought Gillette hit peak wokeness level with its widely-panned “toxic masculinity” ad , think again. The razor company outdid itself on Thursday, unleashing a commercial featuring a father teaching his female-to-male transgender child how to shave her face for the first time.
In a Facebook post, Gillette posted the ad, titled, “First Shave, the Story of Samson,” showcasing trans activist Samson Bonkeabantu Brown shaving for the first time as dad watches and offers advice.
“Whenever, wherever, however it happens – your first shave is special,” the video is captioned.
“Growing up, I was always trying to figure out what kind of man I want to become and I’m still trying to figure out what kind that I want to become,” Brown says in the video.
As the activist begins to shave, Brown’s father advises, “Now don’t be scared. Shaving is about being confident. You are doing fine.”
“It’s not just myself transitioning. It’s everyone around me transitioning,” Brown adds.
The ad closes with a close-up shot on Brown smiling, with overlaying text reading, “The best a man can get.”
“I shot this ad for Gillette and wanted to include my father, who has been one of my greatest supporters throughout my transition, encouraging me to be confident and live authentically as my best self,” Brown posted on Facebook. “With the help of Gillette, I was able to share an important milestone in every man's life with my father.”
“I am confident that this ad will encourage many of my trans siblings and fill them with the knowledge that our existence in this world can be filled with the love and support we deserve,” the activist wrote. ""Be good to yourselves. Love yourselves. And know that when you greet the world with love, it can and will love you back, often in the places you least expect.”
“We anticipated there would be some negative response to this video, however we’re thrilled with the overwhelmingly positive responses we’ve seen, from both consumers as well as organizations,” a statement from Gillette said, according to PEOPLE magazine. “As a brand committed to helping men look, feel and act their best, it’s important to us to embrace inclusivity in how we portray masculinity. This is especially true for Samson and others in the trans community, which is why we created ‘First Shave.’”
While Gillette’s controversial ad tackling “toxic masculinity” earned praise from some on the far left, the company also faced a slew of backlash from consumers. For example, a campaign to boycott the “anti-masculinity” razors grew online in January, as previously reported by The Daily Wire, and the video racked up a stunning 98,000 “ dislike ” reactions on YouTube, far exceeding the “like” reactions.
The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh thoroughly dissected the problems with the ad in January — including Gillette’s stereotyping of men, which Walsh argued would never fly if it had been done with regard to women:
""The ad says that 'some men' act the right way. Can you in your wildest and most fevered dreams even imagine the reaction to an ad that spoke about women in these terms? Imagine an ad for Dove body wash that shows women doing stereotypically negative things like gossiping and nagging and shopping too much, and then the narrator comes on: 'Sure, some women act the right way.' Feminists would be rioting in the street. They'd storm Dove headquarters and stone the head of marketing to death with loofahs dipped in cement.""
""But no such ad would or could ever exist. Women are not lectured and scolded this way. This sort of treatment is reserved for men. And men are tired of it. We've heard it enough. We're terrible; we're horrible; we've ruined the world. Okay, we get it. Thank you. Now shut up and sell your 14-bladed razors and leave us alone.""

Wen tweeted, “If Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis health center cannot provide abortion care, this will be the first time since 1974 that safe, legal abortion care will be inaccessible to people in an entire state.”

On May 24, Missouri governor Mike Parson signed HB 126 into law. He stated , “By signing this bill today, we are sending a strong signal to the nation that, in Missouri, we stand for life, protect women’s health, and advocate for the unborn. All life has value and is worth protecting.” He added, “Thanks to decades of pro-life leadership, Missouri recently hit an all-time low for the number of abortions. We’ve gone from a high of more than 20,000 in our state, to now below 3,000. By working together, we can continue to assist more Missourians in choosing life.”
Except in cases of medical emergency, no abortion shall knowingly be performed or induced upon a pregnant woman if the fetal heartbeat of the unborn child has been detected in accordance with the provisions of this section.
The bill also states that the physician must determine whether the heartbeat of the unborn child can be detected, and if that is possible, the prospective mother must be given the option of hearing the heartbeat and be informed that unless there is an emergency, no abortion shall be performed:
A physician who intends to perform or induce an abortion upon a pregnant woman shall determine whether there is a detectable fetal heartbeat of the unborn child … The physician shall record in the pregnant woman's medical record the estimated gestational age of the unborn child, the method used to test for the presence or absence of a fetal heartbeat, the date and the time of the test, and the results of the test. The physician shall give the pregnant woman the option to view or hear the fetal heartbeat. If a fetal heartbeat is detected, the physician shall, in writing, inform the pregnant woman that a fetal heartbeat has been detected and that an abortion may not be performed under Missouri law except in cases of medical emergency.
The bill adds that a physician will be punished if he/she does not conduct a fetal heartbeat detection test, and if an abortion is performed subsequent to the detection of a heartbeat, the physician will have his/her license revoked:
… a physician who fails to conduct a fetal heartbeat detection test prior to the performance or inducement of an abortion upon a pregnant woman shall, for each instance of failure, be subject to having his or her license or license application rejected, revoked, or suspended by the state board of registration for the healing arts in accordance with the provisions of section 334.100 for a period of six months and shall be subject to a fine of one thousand dollars. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 188.075, a physician who performs or induces an abortion upon a pregnant woman after a fetal heartbeat detection test reveals the presence of a fetal heartbeat in the unborn child shall have his or her license revoked, and any future license application rejected, by the state board of registration for the healing arts in accordance with the provisions of section 334.100.

Taylor Swift Will 'Get Political' On Her New Album | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47742/taylor-swift-will-get-political-her-new-album-emily-zanotti,"Taylor Swift Will 'Get Political' On Her New Album Axelle/Bauer-Griffin / Contributor / Getty Images May 28, 2019 views
Country star-turned-pop princess Taylor Swift says her next album will have ""political undertones"" and that it's no accident her new music will debut just as the 2020 presidential election season is heating up — even though going political has done little for Swift's career.
In a post on Instagram , Swift declared that her new songs will feature ""political undertones"" and that she plans on encouraging her fans to register to vote and become politically engaged before the next election.
“I definitely think there are political undertones in the new music I made,” she added in an interview, according to Elle Magazine . “I’m not planning to stop encouraging young people to vote and to try to get them to talk about what’s going on in our country. I think that’s one of the most important things I could do.”
Swift was badgered into becoming political ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. As one of pop's primary rising stars, she was constantly asked to weigh in on elections and issues, but until November of last year, Swift resisted the urge to say much, sticking instead to non-partisan statements, and encouraging her fans and followers to vote regularly. But with close friends like Lena Dunham, it seems Swift could only avoid making a public political statement for so long.
In October of last year, Swift penned a lengthy Instagram post endorsing Phil Bresden over Marsha Blackburn for an empty Tennessee Senate seat, citing Blackburn's lack of support for gay marriage, the Violence Against Women Act, and equal pay legislation. The post stopped just short of calling Blackburn a traitor to her gender, but the implication was there.
Swift also said that she was breaking her silence on politics because of the unique nature of the 2018 elections.
""I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now,"" Swift wrote.
Bresden ultimately lost, and while Swift wasn't forced to take back her endorsement, her left-leaning friends probably recognized a big problem with her alliance: Bresden said publicly that he would have voted to confirm now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh if he had been in the Senate at the time of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, upending Swift's claims that Bresden was the more feminist-friendly candidate.
In March of 2019, Swift doubled down in a personal essay printed in Elle, claiming that she now felt it was her responsibility to speak out against ""dangerous rhetoric"" and ""racism.""
“Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric,” she said. “I’m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.""
“I’m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change,” Swift added. “Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers.” "

""The Guardian obtained a copy of Siege and viewed the documents concerned.""
The Guardian notes that Wolff specifies that the book’s findings on the Mueller investigation are ""based on internal documents given to me by sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel.""
But when The Guardian contacted Mueller’s team about the alleged indictment draft, they received some disappointing news for those hoping Wolff’s latest bombshell claim will actually be legitimate.
""The documents that you've described do not exist,"" Mueller spokesman Peter Carr told the outlet.
Siege is Wolff’s second book on the Trump administration, and as The Guardian notes, Mueller’s flat denial of the existence of the documents on which the book is based ""will only add to controversy and debate around the launch of Wolff’s eagerly awaited new book.""
The Guardian also notes that Wolff found that the ""paramount issue"" of the special counsel's investigation quickly became whether or not Trump would allow it to continue:
Of Mueller’s thinking, Wolff writes that as a former FBI director, he “had not risen to the highest levels of the federal government by misconstruing the limits of bureaucratic power”, and had therefore continually weighed the odds with his staff about whether the president would fire them. Thus, Wolff writes, “the very existence of the special counsel’s investigation had in a sense become the paramount issue of the investigation itself”.
Wolff’s credibility and journalistic practices came under heavy fire after the release of his first Trump-themed book, Fire and Fury. The Guardian describes the book as having contained many assertions ""confirmed"" by later works, like Bob Woodward's Fear: Trump in the White House , and notes that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was booted from the administration due to his alleged role as a major source for Wolff's book.
As The Daily Wire reported at the time, Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs published a report in early 2018 on how Wolff was able to worm his way into the White House to get information for his first book:
​In what reads like an instruction manual in shameless, muckraking, tabloid ""journalism,"" Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs describes in detail how ""Fire and Fury"" author Michael Wolff managed to manipulate his way into the White House so he could write his partly debunked and thoroughly sketchy hit piece on the White House.
Citing ""interviews with multiple current and former Trump aides and advisers,"" Jacobs provides an account of Wolff's ""embarrassing"" exploitation of the ""inexperienced"" Trump White House.
First among Wolff's various deceptive strategies was lying to Team Trump about the way he planned to frame the book, including presenting them with a fake title: ""The Great Transition: The First 100 Days of the Trump Administration,"" which he invented to make it appear as if he was going to approach the administration from a sympathetic angle.
Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that ""close to 95%"" of the interactions between Wolff and the staff came at Bannon's request, though Jacobs found that some other key aides, including Kellyanne Conway, invited Wolff in at times. Jacobs reported that one source said the author managed to get into the White House about 17 times. "

Over the weekend, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman penned a piece focusing on former prominent White House staffer Hope Hicks being subpoenaed by Congress.
“Hope Hicks, one of the best-known but least visible former members of President Trump’s White House staff, is facing an existential question: whether to comply with a congressional subpoena,” the Times captioned the piece.
The write-up includes a photograph of Ms. Hicks taken by freelance photographer Tom Brenner — which Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) ironically took serious issue with.

Talk show host Soledad O’Brien claimed the shot used of Hicks, in part, exposed the Times’ pro-Trump bias ( yes, really ), and AOC couldn’t agree more.
""This is a good example of bias in the [New York Times]: a picture of a person who is considering not complying with a subpoena is basically a glam shot, and it’s framed as a thoughtful, perfectly equal choice,"" Soledad said, captioning the Times' piece.

Professor Headed Project Photographing Unsuspecting Students And Faculty | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47758/professor-headed-project-photographing-hank-berrien,"Professor Headed Project Photographing Unsuspecting Students And Faculty To aid development of facial recognition technology Photo by Andrzej Wojcicki/Science Photo/GettyImages May 28, 2019 views
In 2012, a professor at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs headed a project that was partially funded by U.S. intelligence and military operations and took photographs of unsuspecting students and faculty members to aid in developing facial recognition technology.
The targeted students, faculty and others were walking at the time.
According to The Denver Post , “The photographs were posted online as a dataset that could be publicly downloaded from 2016 until this past April.” The story was first reported by the Colorado Independent .
Professor Terrance Boult and his team worked on the project; Boult stated, “The study is trying to make facial recognition better, especially at long range or surveillance applications. We wanted to collect a dataset of people acting naturally in public because that’s the way people are trying to use facial recognition.”
University of Denver law professor Bernard Chao told The Denver Post, “It’s yet another area where we’re seeing privacy intrusions that disturb us.”
In order to photograph his targets, Boult used a long-range surveillance camera 150 meters from from the West Lawn of the Colorado Springs campus. The camera took over 16,000 images; Boult asserted that he waited five years to release the photos in order to protect the targets’ privacy.
Jared Verner, a CU Colorado Springs spokesman, stated, “The research protocol was analyzed by the UCCS Institutional Review Board, which assures the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects in research. No personal information was collected or distributed in this specific study. The photographs were collected in public areas and made available to researchers after five years when most students would have graduated.”
Chao countered, “There’s creeping concern that maybe he has all this data and all these photos, and what other use could be used for that?”
Boult insisted, “As long as the systems are bad, their potential misuse is consistent. If police use them and they match the wrong person, that’s not good. Our job as researchers is to balance the privacy needs with the research value this provides society, and we went above and beyond what was required.”
Chao concluded, “He may be helping them do something that’s not right in the first place. I’m not sure I want to be in a state where every place I walk, my picture is being taken and automatically uploaded into facial-recognition software. I actually know I would not like that. I think the response is, ‘Maybe we just shouldn’t be doing this, period.’”
The Colorado Independent noted:
The city of San Francisco rocketed facial recognition technology into the news in mid-May by passing a ban on its use — a shocker for the tech-happy metropolis that made international headlines. The Board of Supervisors passed the law on an 8-1 vote, making San Francisco the first major city to block the technology, which is increasingly used by police to target criminal suspects.
The Colorado Independent added:
A recent report from Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy & Technology found Detroit and Chicago were using real-time facial recognition technology on vast surveillance camera systems. “Detroit’s system was designed to be able to operate on the city’s ‘Project Green Light’ network of over 500 cameras, including cameras outside places of worship, women’s reproductive clinics, and youth centers,” Georgetown’s website notes.

"WATCH: Journalist Claims She Was Abused, Racially Profiled By Cops. Then The Video Comes Out. | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47718/watch-journalist-claims-she-was-abused-racially-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 28, 2019 views
Jenni Monet, a self-styled “award-winning journalist” and Native American activist, claimed she was racially profiled both at a liquor store and by responding police officers and was the victim of police brutality. But released surveillance video from the night of her arrest for aggravated DWI in Santa Fe, New Mexico, captures the other side of the story, which includes Monet making obscene gestures at liquor store employees and screaming obscenities at law enforcement.
Court documents obtained by KRQE News 13 say the journalist was turned away by a liquor store in Santa Fe when she tried to buy two bottles of wine while allegedly appearing to be drunk.
According to surveillance video obtained by the news network, Monet pulls up to the store and goes inside, but is refused service. ""She then went back out to her car before she went back inside, and started screaming and making obscene gestures toward the staff.""
After the encounter, both Monet and the employees at the liquor store called authorities.
Footage from the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department, which was also obtained by KRQE News 13, captured the activist’s seemingly belligerent behavior.
After Monet denies that she’s been drinking to a deputy, he asked the woman, ""How come I can smell a really strong odor of alcohol?""
""I don't know. I've not been drinking,"" Monet answered.
The woman said she was racially profiled by staff at the liquor store. ""How were they racially profiling you is what I'm trying to get at?"" the deputy asked.
""Because I'm a brown woman,"" she responded. ""Do you not see that?""
Things heated up when Monet refused to take a sobriety test.
""I'm not walking any f***ing line for you. You hear me?"" she is heard yelling on video. ""I am not walking any f***ing line for you.""
As the officers cuff Monet, she repeatedly screams, ""Police brutality!""
Then more insults and accusations come: ""You f***ing fat-fingered f***!"" and ""You f***ing racist motherf***er. You f***ing white supremacist!""
During the encounter with authorities, Monet reportedly ""told the deputies multiple times that she's an award-winning journalist and to 'look [her] up,'"" KRQE News 13 reported.
Still, Monet is sticking to her story, and has even threatened to sue KRQE News 13 for their coverage of the story. The news outlet has disclosed that Monet worked for their organization some 20 years ago, but has not since had any affiliation with KRQE.
""I am one of a majority of people who are victimized by this kind of racial profiling that exists on a daily basis,"" Monet told KRQE News 13 after speaking at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe.
""Neither was I drinking or driving at the time, and we're confident that the evidence that stands in my favor will vindicate me,"" she continued. ""The fact that I'm an award-winning journalist and that I said that to these officers, and they didn't even run an ID check on me or check my name, or even validate the fact that I had called them for help ..."" Monet added. "
"Dianne Feinstein Recently Dined With Top Official From Terrorist Iranian Regime, Report Says | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47754/dianne-feinstein-recently-dined-top-official-josh-hammer,"Dianne Feinstein Recently Dined With Top Official From Terrorist Iranian Regime, Report Says Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 28, 2019 views
The United States may be on the seeming precipice of war with the jihad-exporting terrorist regime that has governed the Islamic Republic of Iran since the fateful Islamic Revolution of 1979, but apparently that hasn't stopped the notoriously authoritarian regime-friendly Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) from recently meeting with infamous Iranian regime mouthpiece Mohammad Javad Zarif — foreign minister for the terrorist mullocracy.
Per Politico 's ""Playbook"":
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CALIF.) had dinner with IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER JAVAD ZARIF when he was in the United States a few weeks ago, several sources told us. Last week, Playbook reported that Feinstein was walking around the Capitol with Zarif’s contact information pulled up on her iPhone -- we spotted it in an elevator.
FEINSTEIN’S team tells us that the dinner was ""arranged in consultation with the State Department."" ""The office was in touch with State in advance of the meeting to let them know it was happening and to get an update on U.S.-Iran activity,"" Feinstein’s office said. A State Department official told us that they did not ask Feinstein to go to the dinner with Zarif, a smooth-talking, American-educated Iranian diplomat who worked on the nuclear deal with John Kerry.
OF COURSE, the United States and Iran are in the middle of a high-wire diplomatic and military staring contest. The United States has moved additional military resources into the region, and has indicated it has intelligence that the Iranians were readying to attack American interests in the region.
Politico also casually referred to Feinstein's ""dining with the foreign minister of an adversary"" as ""a bit unusual.""
As the Washington Examiner notes , Zarif was one of the preeminent public-facing Iranian regime figureheads during the Obama administration's negotiations that led to the United States' entrance in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (i.e., the Iran nuclear deal):
Zarif was also one of the Iranian officials who met with former Secretary of State John Kerry about salvaging the Iran nuclear deal. This led to accusations by the Trump administration that Kerry violated the Logan Act, a more than 200-year-old law that prohibits unauthorized private citizens from acting on behalf of the U.S. in disputes with foreign governments but has never been used to prosecute anyone.
The Logan Act routinely comes up in discussions regarding non-presidential governmental figures and foreign government officials, but it is never actually invoked. Conservative commentator and radio host Erick Erickson actually once referred to it, during the context of the Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)-led Republican senator pushback against the Iran deal, as a ""talking point of hacks and morons"":
The Logan Act originated in 1799. Not a single person has ever been convicted under the Logan Act. Ironically, the namesake of the law, George Logan, after compelling John Adams to get the act passed, became a United States Senator. The Logan Act serves mostly as a partisan tool to throw at opponents who dare to contradict a sitting President’s foreign policy. ...
It’s a stupid talking point used by unserious people who want to avoid having to deal with the fact that the President of the United States is giving away the farm to Iranians who, given the chance, would gladly kill him, you, me, and everyone complaining about a Logan Act violation."

Former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential campaign criticized President Donald Trump for agreeing with remarks apparently made by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who, according to Trump, called Biden a ""low IQ individual.""
Trump tweeted: ""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?""

Trump later confirmed the remarks during a press conference, saying Kim ""made a statement that Joe Biden is a low IQ individual."" Trump said that the remark ""probably is based on his record. I think I agree with him on that.""
Kate Bedingfield, Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director for Joe Biden, responded by saying: ""The President’s comments are beneath the dignity of the office. To be on foreign soil, on Memorial Day, and to side repeatedly with a murderous dictator against a fellow American and former Vice President speaks for itself.

Tim Murtaugh, Director of Communications for Trump 2020, fired back in a statement, saying: ""That's rich coming from Joe Biden, who bashed President Trump while standing on foreign soil earlier this year in Germany. But unlike the Obama-Biden administration, which failed to make any progress with North Korea, President Trump has actually increased pressure and gotten them to the negotiating table. If you want an example of 'siding with a murderous dictator,' how about the disastrous Iran nuclear deal? Or failing to follow through on the 'red line' with Syria?

That’s rich coming from Joe Biden, who bashed President Trump while standing on foreign soil earlier this year in Germany. — Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) May 28, 2019
Murtaugh's comment about Biden's remarks overseas stems from a trip Biden took to Germany in February where he bashed the policies of the Trump administration and said that America was ""an embarrassment.""
""The America I see values basic human decency, not snatching children from their parents or turning our back on refugees at our border. Americans know that’s not right,"" Biden told the Munich Security Conference. ""The American people understand plainly that this makes us an embarrassment. The American people know, overwhelmingly, that it is not right. That it is not who we are.""
Earlier this month, Gates told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" that he stands by a statement in his memoir where he said that Biden has ""been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.""
Trump then fired off another shot at Biden, tweeting: ""I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil.

"Justice Clarence Thomas: Abortion Could Become A Tool Of Racists, Eugenicists | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47755/justice-clarence-thomas-abortion-could-become-tool-emily-zanotti,"May 28, 2019 views
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas issued a stinging concurrence Tuesday, in the case of a comprehensive Indiana law greatly restricting the reasons a woman can obtain an abortion and requiring that all aborted babies be either cremated or buried.
Thomas agreed with the Court's 7-2 ruling that Indiana was free to require medical facilities to provide a dignified burial or cremation for children aborted under their watch, but dissented from the Supreme Court's decision not to rule on the part of the Indiana law that banned abortions done on the basis of gender, race, or disability.
Thomas cautioned that if the Court side-stepped the issue permanently, it could open the door for abortion to be used as a tool of racists and eugenicists, in line with the wishes of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger and other early, prominent abortion activists.
Thomas agreed that ""because further percolation may assist our review of this issue of first impression,"" the Court was smart to pass on ruling on the Indiana law, The Hill reports , but the Court can't ignore the issue forever.
""Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana’s,"" Thomas wrote. “So long as the Supreme Court forces a policy of unfettered elective abortion on the entire country, it ought to at least allow for states to protect babies from unjust discrimination.""
“Although the court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever. Having created the constitutional right to an abortion, this court is dutybound to address its scope,” he added.
The Indiana law is targeted largely at preventing the selective abortion of babies diagnosed with Down Syndrome, but it is based on model law that could move forward in more than just a single state.
""Indiana does not allow a fetus to be aborted solely because of the fetus’s race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, or diagnosis or potential diagnosis of the fetus having Down syndrome or any other disability,"" the law reads.
Babies diagnosed with Down syndrome already face a staggering 60% - 80% abortion rate, based on a study from Planned Parenthood's former statistics arm, the Guttmacher Institute. In some European countries, Down syndrome has been all but ""eradicated,"" not through cures, but through selective abortion.
Unborn girls are also at risk of sex-selective abortion. In countries like China and India, early gender detection has led to the widespread practice of aborting female fetuses, leaving both countries with heavily lopsided demographics. The UNFPA believes that as many as 160 million girls are ""missing"" because of sex-selective abortion and population control programs abroad.
Thomas referenced genetic screening in his concurrence, noting that a baby's gender can be determined by an elective blood test given between 7 and 10 weeks, and that disabilities like Down syndrome can be detected before the end of the first trimester. Pairing these tools with unfettered abortion access paves the way for “modern-day eugenics,” Thomas says, and states should have the right to protect unborn children from such abject discrimination.
“So long as the Supreme Court forces a policy of unfettered elective abortion on the entire country, it ought to at least allow for states to protect babies from unjust discrimination,"" Thomas wrote.
Such practices aren't foreign even to the nation's foremost abortion provider, Planned Parenthood. As The Federalist points out , Margaret Sanger, the group's founder, was an avid fan of eugenics — and particularly birth control and abortion programs that directly affected minority communities.
Such discrimination runs counter to America's constitutional guarantees of civil rights, Thomas said.
“Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement,” he wrote. “In other contexts, the Court has been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even potentially subjected to race, sex, and disability discrimination.” "

Mueller’s report on alleged Russia meddling in the 2016 election failed to find sufficient evidence of collusion to recommend criminal charges. Trump has dismissed the report, saying it proves he did not collude or obstruct justice.
After he handed over the report to the Justice Department, Mueller sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr over the handling of his report. Barr testified before Congress that he offered Mueller the opportunity to review his four-page synopsis after the special counsel completed his two-year, $30 million probe into allegations that members of Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to alter the outcome of the 2016 election, but Mueller declined.
Appearing before the House Appropriations Committee for a hearing on the Justice Department's budget, Barr said the redactions in the report would be broken down into four categories so readers can see why the information was omitted.
“First is grand jury information,"" Barr said. ""The second is information that the intelligence community believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods. The third are information in the report that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions. You’ll recall that the special counsel did spin off a number of cases that are still being pursued. And we want to make sure that none of the information in the report would impinge upon either the ability of the prosecutors to prosecute the cases, or the fairness to the defendants.""
""And finally, we intend to redact information that implicated the privacy or reputational interest of peripheral players where there is a decision not to charge them,"" Barr said.
Barr also said he is handling Mueller's report in a way that conforms with rules set out during Bill Clinton's presidency. ""I'm operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report,"" Barr told lawmakers. ""But I am relying on my own discretion to edit the report to remove classified information for eventual release.""
In his summary of the report, Barr wrote: ""The Special Counsel found no evidence that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired with the Russians to influence the election, despite offers by the Russians to do so.""
""Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction of justice offense,"" Barr said. In fact, Barr concluded that the ""report identifies no actions that in our judgement constitutes obstructive conduct."""

Four Pinocchios: Washington Post Hits Planned Parenthood President Over Major Lie | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47765/four-pinocchios-washington-post-hits-planned-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 29, 2019 views
On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood’s new president Leana Wen was smacked with four Pinocchios — the worst possible rating — from a Washington Post fact check over the abortion leader’s repeated false claim concerning abortion in the days before the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision.
Wen has falsely claimed time and again during her tenure that “thousands” of women died from illegal abortions before the Roe decision.
“We face a real situation where Roe could be overturned. And we know what will happen, which is that women will die. Thousands of women died every year pre-Roe,” the president told WFAA of Dallas in early March.
In April, she repeated: “Before Roe v. Wade, thousands of women died every year — and because of extreme attacks on safe, legal abortion care, this could happen again right here in America. #WeWontGoBack."" Before Roe v. Wade, thousands of women died every year — and because of extreme attacks on safe, legal abortion care, this could happen again right here in America. #WeWontGoBack https://t.co/9orqLaif0J — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) April 24, 2019
“We’re not going to go back in time to a time before Roe when thousands of women died every year because they didn’t have access to essential health care,” Wen told cohosts on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
But the claim is false. As highlighted by Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that the number of deaths from illegal abortions in the United States pre- Roe (1972) was 39 — miles away from the executive’s “thousands” claim. Moreover, in that same year, the number of deaths from legal abortion was 24.
As noted by LifeNews, the statistic Wen is apparently citing was based upon data before vital medical advances and admittedly inflated:
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) similarly has claimed up to 5,000 women died annually from unsafe abortions prior to 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its infamous abortion case.
But the Washington Post called this ""shoddy"" data. Its fact checker did not find research to back up these claims. Instead, it found what pro-life advocates have been saying for years: that few women died from abortions in the decade prior to Roe, and a rise in the use of antibiotics appears to be the biggest factor in the drop in maternal deaths, not legalized abortions.
“Wen is a doctor, and the ACOG is made up of doctors. They should know better than to peddle statistics based on data that predates the advent of antibiotics,” Kessler chided Wen. “Even given the fuzzy nature of the data and estimates, there is no evidence that in the years immediately preceding the Supreme Court’s decision, thousands of women died every year in the United States from illegal abortions.”
“Wen’s repeated use of this number reminds us of the shoddy data used by human trafficking opponents,” he continued. “Unsafe abortion is certainly a serious issue, especially in countries with inadequate medical facilities. But advocates hurt their cause when they use figures that do not withstand scrutiny.""
""These numbers were debunked in 1969 — 50 years ago — by a statistician celebrated by Planned Parenthood,"" Kessler added. ""There’s no reason to use them today.”"
"French Senate Defies Macron, Says Notre Dame Should Be Rebuilt Exactly How It Was | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47734/french-senate-defies-macron-says-notre-dame-should-emily-zanotti,"French Senate Defies Macron, Says Notre Dame Should Be Rebuilt Exactly How It Was LUDOVIC MARIN / Contributor / Getty Images May 28, 2019 views
Over the weekend, the French Senate approved a bill paving the way forward for restoring Notre Dame cathedral, which nearly burned to the ground back in April in a construction fire. There's one caveat, however: the cathedral must be returned to its ""last known visual state.""
In other words, despite French president Emmanuel Macron's desire to see parts of the cathedral rebuilt with an eye to more ""contemporary architecture,"" the French government wants to see Notre Dame returned to its former glory, according to The Local .
""French Senators have stipulated that Notre-Dame cathedral must be restored exactly how it was before the devastating fire that tore through the Paris landmark,"" the Parisian news outlet reported Tuesday.
The stipulation came in the form of an addendum to a bill authorizing French authorities to begin work on Notre Dame so that the cathedral is completely rebuilt in time for the Paris Olympics in 2024 — just five years from now. The French Parliament approved the measure earlier this month but did not comment on how the cathedral should look once restoration work was finished.
The bill is controversial already: it's written so that the French government can bypass the traditional requirements of public and legislative approval before it can shuttle money from national coffers into the project. It's also tied to what experts consider a ""rush job,"" allowing only five years for a refurbishment that could — or should — take decades.
France 24 reports that several hundred historians and architects have weighed in on the bill and found it wanting.
""Surveying a medieval monument is the work of a dozen different specialists. You have to get these people together to understand what they can bring because an edifice like this one is so complex that no single person has all the expertise necessary,” one historian told France 24.
“From an archaeological point of view, one of the risks of rushing in is that you can’t guarantee the sustainability of the work,” he added. “Building a monument is something that can be done rapidly. Restoring a monument is infinitely more complex.”
Part of the problem, the historians said, was that Macron and others wanted to incorporate contemporary modifications into the cathedral restoration. Proposed ideas included a new glass spire, a glass observation roof, and even a roof addition with a public swimming pool and community garden. Integrating those ideas into a centuries-old monument could prove almost impossible.
The government, seemingly unconcerned about the historical and architectural ramifications of incorporating contemporary modifications, has already put in motion plans for an international design competition, allowing architects from all over the world to submit their ideas for ""modernizing"" Notre Dame.
Fortunately, the French Senate seems to have put an end to that endeavor, demanding that any restoration project that bypasses legislative and cultural affairs approval ""must be faithful to the 'last known visual state' of the cathedral.""
Since the Senate bill and the Parliamentary bill are now different, the two legislative bodies must meet to discuss how to merge the two pieces of legislation. France's Parliament did not add the restrictions but has not signaled opposition to a project that would simply return Notre Dame to normal. "
Mueller's Statement Leaves Everyone Frustrated | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47780/muellers-statement-leaves-everyone-frustrated-hank-berrien,"Mueller's Statement Leaves Everyone Frustrated Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images May 29, 2019 views
On Wednesday, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III made his first public comments since the release of the results of his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. It left people more confused than ever.
Mueller started by saying that his investigation was “complete,” that the special counsel’s office would be closed, and that he was returning to private life. He then outlined the interference in the 2016 election allegedly committed by Russia:
Russian intelligence officers who are part of the Russian military, launched a concerted attack on our political system. The indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cybertechniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks.
The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate. And at the same time, as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment, a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation, where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to influence an election.
Mueller continued by explaining that there were two parts to his report: the “efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election,” including “the Trump campaign’s response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy,"" and the second part, which dealt with the “obstruction of justice investigation involving the president.”
Significantly, Mueller stated, “The order appointing me special counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. We conducted that investigation, and we kept the office of the acting attorney general apprised of the progress of our work. And as set forth in the report, after that investigation, if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.”
Mueller continued, “The introduction to the Volume II of our report explains that decision. It explains that under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that, too, is prohibited. A special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.”
Mueller described the Department of Justice’s written opinion, stating that “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing. And beyond department policy, we were guided by principles of fairness. It would be unfair to potentially — it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.”
He added, “Those were the principles under which we operated. And from them, we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime. That is the office’s final position, and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the president. We conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the attorney general, as required by department regulations.”
Mueller said, “There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress. In addition, access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office.”
Some reaction to Mueller’s statement: If he had the evidence, Mueller could have identified criminal conduct & *recommended* charges, then let DOJ decide whether OLC guidance would or would not permit those charges being filed against a sitting POTUS. Instead, he decided not to recommend anything. — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) May 29, 2019 Exactly right. If Mueller was never going to be able to find obstruction of justice because of DOJ policy, then what was the point of investigating that in the first place? By Mueller’s reasoning, he couldn’t have said Trump/campaign had conspired with Russia if he had found that https://t.co/RjX8HlHMYU — Brit Hume (@brithume) May 29, 2019 Is this how it works? Isn't it the other way around? You look for evidence that a crime was committed, and if you don't find it you say ""we didn't find any."" You don't look for evidence that it wasn't and then say, ""we couldn't find evidence of innocence."" https://t.co/nkMeI2O2BA — Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) May 29, 2019 ""If we had confidence that the president did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" That is not the standard of a prosecutor. Prosecutors exist to determine whether someone committed a chargeable offense, not whether they are exonerated of charges. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) May 29, 2019 Barr said that Mueller told him ""several times in a group meeting that he was not saying that but for the OLC opinion he would have found obstruction."" This isn't quite opposed to Mueller's statement today -- Mueller says he didn't have to find on obstruction thanks to OLC. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) May 29, 2019 This means that the OLC opinion was used as a threshold that allowed Mueller not to make a determination on obstruction; it's possible that both Mueller and Barr are telling the truth, in other words. If Mueller wanted to say Trump would be indicted but for OLC, he could have. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) May 29, 2019 Today underscored once again why Congress must be restored. We asked the executive branch to investigate itself, which guaranteed ""obstruction"" questions. Then the investigator acknowledged he can't indict anyway, and used a ""not exonerated"" standard. Recipe for disaster. (1) — Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) May 29, 2019 Of course this was a Rorschach test. We asked a man to investigate his boss, while his boss retained legitimate power to direct investigations, and also told him he can't indict even if he discovers something. Again: There's no fourth branch of government. This doesn't work. (2) — Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) May 29, 2019 The structure of government matters. There was simply no way for this to be anything less than a rolling disaster. And so it was. (3)"
‘Mind-Boggling’: Alex Trebek's Surprising Cancer Update | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47770/mind-boggling-alex-trebeks-surprising-cancer-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 29, 2019 views
Three months after announcing his diagnosis of stage four pancreatic cancer, Jeopardy host Alex Trebek told PEOPLE about a “mind-boggling” update: He’s “near remission,” according to his doctors.
“It’s kind of mind-boggling,” the beloved host told the magazine.
“The doctors said they hadn’t seen this kind of positive result in their memory ... some of the tumors have already shrunk by more than 50 percent,” he said.
The 78-year-old will “still have to go through several more rounds of chemotherapy to hopefully get into full remission, but he’s elated at how far he’s come,” according to PEOPLE.
Trebek said he cried “tears of joy” upon hearing the encouraging medical update.
“I’ve got a couple million people out there who have expressed their good thoughts, their positive energy directed towards me, and their prayers,” noted the host. “I told the doctors, this has to be more than just the chemo, and they agreed it could very well be an important part of this.”
“I’ve got a lot of love out there headed in my direction and a lot of prayer, and I will never, ever minimize the value of that,” added Trebek.
In early March, Trebek made the shocking cancer announcement in a video posted to social media. Though the outlook for stage four pancreatic cancer is grim, he vowed to fight.
“I have some news to share with all of you, and it's in keeping with my longtime policy of being open and transparent with our Jeopardy! fan base,” he said in the video, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “I also wanted to prevent you from reading or hearing some overblown or inaccurate reports regarding my health. So therefore, I wanted to be the one to pass along this information. Now, just like 50,000 other people in the United States each year, this week I was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer.”
“I'm going to fight this, and I'm going to keep working,” he added. “And with the love and support of my family and friends and with the help of your prayers also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease.” A Message from Alex Trebek: pic.twitter.com/LbxcIyeTCF — Jeopardy! (@Jeopardy) March 6, 2019
In mid-April, Trebek gave an update on his status, telling the public that he was “feeling good” and will host another season of Jeopardy!
“Some of you may recall that at the beginning of this season I promised you that we had some surprises in store for you. Well, of course, I had no idea at that time that there were some surprises in store for me as well,” he said in another video message.
“I wanted to once again thank you for your continuing messages of encouragement and support particularly the many cards I’ve received from young people. I’m touched beyond words,” the host continued. “I’ve always tried to be straight with you and I’m not going to stop now, so despite what you may have heard, I’m feeling good. I’m continuing with my therapy and we — by we, the staff — is already working on our next season. ... So I look forward to seeing you once again in September with all kinds of good stuff.”"
CNN's Chris Cuomo Directs Ambiguous Tweet At Rape Survivor.

Here's Her Response. Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images May 29, 2019 views
CNN's Chris Cuomo was on the receiving end of blistering criticism on Wednesday after an ambiguous comment he made on Twitter toward a rape victim.
Cuomo's tweet was aimed at Kim Corban, who was raped in 2006 when she was 20 years old after a man broke into her apartment and sexually assaulted her for approximately two hours. In a 2016 report , The Washington Post noted how Corban has ""struggled with depression, PTSD and stress-related seizures"" as a result of the attack.
Corban appeared in an ad video for the National Rifle Association (NRA) where she discussed the importance of owning firearms.
""I'm a mother of two, and if a predator or anyone else tries to harm me or my family, they have to come through my firearm first,"" Corban said.
Shortly after the video came out, Cuomo tweeted: ""Only in America."" Only in America https://t.co/rPfsxGU8Gh — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) May 29, 2019
Corban immediately responded to Cuomo's comment, tweeting: ""Hi @ChrisCuomo. Looks like you forgot to tag me. Care to chat about this?"" Hi @ChrisCuomo . Looks like you forgot to tag me. Care to chat about this? — Kimberly Corban (@Kimberly_Corban) May 29, 2019
Cuomo's remarks were quickly met with criticism online, as he had not clarified what exactly he meant for three hours after leaving up his tweet.
Ben Howe noted that Corban and ""her husband were recently the targets of an assassination plot by white supremacists up on (among other things) illegal gun charges of which her husband was the prosecutor.""

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden stirred ire on social media on Tuesday after he touched a young girl at a campaign rally despite pledging last month to be ""much more mindful"" about not invading people's personal space without their permission.
The New York Times reported that the interaction between Biden and the 10-year-old girl happened after she asked him a question about political division in the country.
""She told him that her favorite subject was journalism, so Mr. Biden proceeded to bring her to the back of the room, where journalists and TV cameras were congregated, and put his hands on her shoulders,"" the Times added. ""The moment raised some eyebrows among online commentators. In the weeks leading up to his entrance into the race, a number of women said Mr. Biden had made them uncomfortable by touching them, leading to a reckoning around the physical way he has often interacted with women in public.""
Washington Post national political reporter Felicia Sonmez also documented the incident, tweeting: ""In a somewhat odd moment at tonight's AFT town hall, Biden tells a 10-year-old girl, 'I’ll bet you’re as bright as you are good-looking.' He takes her over to the assembled reporters, then stands behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders while he's talking.""
""Recall that Biden filmed a video last month in which he vowed to respect women's personal space,"" Sonmez added. ""Seems he hasn't quite gotten the message.""

Ocasio-Cortez Appears To Change Mind Again On 'Climate Disaster' Deadline | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47761/ocasio-cortez-appears-change-mind-again-climate-ryan-saavedra,"Ocasio-Cortez Appears To Change Mind Again On 'Climate Disaster' Deadline Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images May 29, 2019 views
Democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) appeared to change her mind again on how long humans have before time runs out and cataclysmic climate disaster strikes.
Ocasio-Cortez has focused on pushing climate alarmism ever since she won the Democratic nomination for New York's 14th Congressional District last June. The main claim that she stakes her agenda on is that humans only have 12 years left to implement her $93 trillion Green New Deal before the planet faces ""cataclysmic climate disaster.""
Earlier this month, after widespread criticism and watching her poll numbers sink , Ocasio-Cortez tried to play off her claim, suggesting that it was a joke and that anyone who believed her has ""the social intelligence of a sea sponge.""
""This is a technique of the GOP, to take dry humor + sarcasm literally and 'fact check' it,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on May 12. ""Like the 'world ending in 12 years' thing, you’d have to have the social intelligence of a sea sponge to think it’s literal. But the GOP is basically Dwight from The Office so who knows."" This is a technique of the GOP, to take dry humor + sarcasm literally and “fact check” it.

But the GOP is basically Dwight from The Office so who knows. https://t.co/pmkwrdeAnq — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 12, 2019
Yet, on Tuesday night, Ocasio-Cortez appeared to re-embrace her belief in the 12-year climate deadline in a tweet where she was responding to the recent spate of tornadoes flaring up across the country.
""This guy reminds me of every climate scientist warning people we have 12 years left to cut emissions in half before our future is irreversibly damaged & all the GOP wants to do is yell about communist cow farts,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, ignoring the fact that she has been one of those yelling about ""cow farts."" This guy reminds me of every climate scientist warning people we have 12 years left to cut emissions in half before our future is irreversibly damaged & all the GOP wants to do is yell about communist cow farts “No! We’re not going back to the show!” https://t.co/CKpLKS9BuE — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 29, 2019
Ocasio-Cortez's tweet also largely ignored a recent rebuke she received from a prominent meteorologist over her claim about ""casual tornadoes"" and climate change.
That same meteorologist, Ryan Maue, explained separately on Tuesday that the link between tornadoes and climate change is ""tissue paper thin.""
Citing a New York Times article published by MSN, Maue tweeted: ""Tornadoes & climate change — how strong is the evidence? Tissue paper thin. 'Its almost impossible to see any signal in the (tornado) data.' After quiet 2018 & a long violent tornado 'drought', month of May hyperactivity is more reflection of normal.""
""As research is done w/more advanced models, we will learn more about tornadoes within our current climate & predict changes ahead e.g. location shifts or intensity distribution to more/less violent,"" Maue continued. ""Check back in 10 years. But we need better weather forecasts now, desperately.""

""From recent National Academies Report: Severe convective storms: Includes tornadoes,"" Maue added. ""Understanding of effect of climate change: Low.

Prominent climate change scientists have pushed back on Ocasio-Cortez's alarmist rhetoric. Axios reported the following quotes: Andrea Dutton, a paleoclimate researcher at the University of Florida: ""For some reason the media latched onto the 12 years (2030), presumably because they thought that it helped to get across the message of how quickly we are approaching this and hence how urgently we need action. Unfortunately, this has led to a complete mischaracterization of what the report said."" Gavin Schmidt, who leads NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies: ""All the time-limited frames are bulls***. Nothing special happens when the 'carbon budget' runs out or we pass whatever temperature target you care about, instead the costs of emissions steadily rise."" Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA: ""12 years isn't a deadline, and climate change isn't a cliff we fall off — it's a slope we slide down. We don't have 12 years to prevent climate change — we have no time. It's already here. And even under a business-as-usual scenario, the world isn't going to end in exactly twelve years.""
Here are just a few examples of Ocasio-Cortez promoting her 12-year deadline theory on climate change:
""We have an expiration date and the IPCC report says we've got 12 years to turn it around!"" Ocasio-Cortez shouted at an MSNBC town hall event designed to promote her climate change hysteria. ""12 years! My concern is we are going to be the frog in the pot of boiling water...and our kids are doomed."" AOC: ""We have an expiration date and the IPCC report says we've got 12 years to turn it around! 12 years!

In responding to a tweet from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted last November: ""Thank you, @NancyPelosi. We have 10 years left to plan and implement a Green New Deal before cataclysmic climate disaster. Reinstating the Select Committee is exactly what we need to do.""
""Next, we should define the standards of that committee,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""To be truly effective, it should: 1. Have a mandate to draft a Green New Deal plan by 2020; 2. Not have officials appointed to it that accept fossil fuel industry contributions."" Next, we should define the standards of that committee. To be truly effective, it should: 1. Have a mandate to draft a Green New Deal plan by 2020; 2. Not have officials appointed to it that accept fossil fuel industry contributions — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 13, 2018
In October 2018, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: ""The IPCC told us this week that we have only 12 years left to avoid climate disaster. We also learned that only *100 companies* are responsible for 71% of global emissions. To save ourselves, we will need a mass mobilization towards 100% renewable energy.""

In January, Ocasio-Cortez doubled down on comments she made at an event for Martin Luther King day, tweeting: ""For some reason GOP seems to think this is a gaffe, but it’s actually a generational difference. Young people understand that climate change is an existential threat: 3,000 Americans died in Hurricane María. The UN says we’ve got 12 years left to fix it.""

In April, Ocasio-Cortez created a propaganda video with The Intercept, tweeting: ""Climate change is here + we’ve got a deadline: 12 years left to cut emissions in half.

Ocasio-Cortez's constant hyperbolic climate change comments and theatrics appear to have impacted her poll numbers.
""A Quinnipiac poll released on Thursday morning found that 23 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the member of Congress, while 36 percent had an unfavorable view — a -13 overall approval rating,"" Vox reported . ""This new poll isn’t a one-off finding.

"Illinois Bucks National Trend, Passes Sweeping Abortion Rights Bill, Rolls Back Partial-Birth Abortion Ban | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47794/illinois-bucks-national-trend-passes-sweeping-emily-zanotti,"Illinois Bucks National Trend, Passes Sweeping Abortion Rights Bill, Rolls Back Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Photo by Tatyana Tomsickova Photography/GettyImages May 29, 2019 views
Weeks ago, Illinois ""fast-tracked"" a shocking bill designed to make the state the ""abortion capital,"" and over the weekend a determined legislature passed the collection of changes to state law, rolling back the state's partial-birth abortion ban and creating a ""fundamental right"" to abortion.
The legislation is even more shocking considering that it comes amidst a national trend in the opposite direction. States like Alabama, Missouri, Georgia, and Louisiana have all greatly restricted abortion and, in some cases, moved to eliminate the practice almost entirely.
But under Illinois' new Democratic governor, eliminating protections for the unborn has become a paramount priority, though it's not immediately clear how many residents of the state — which is so far in debt and mired in fiscal mismanagement that social legislation seems to be little more than a distraction — support the measure. Democrats in the state legislature quietly passed the bill out of committee Saturday, then rushed the measure to a floor vote in the Illinois House on Tuesday.
The Thomas More Society , which fought the bill, released a legal assessment of the measure over the weekend, outlining exactly how extreme Illinois' new abortion laws really are.
The bill not only legalizes abortion up until the very moment of birth, eliminating the state's longstanding ban on partial-birth abortion, it utterly ignores the concept of ""viability,"" making no concessions for unborn children capable of feeling pain in the womb or capable of surviving on the outside.
The bill creates a ‘fundamental right…to have an abortion, and to make autonomous decisions about how to exercise that right,’ but does not put an age limit on who can exercise that right, effectively eliminating the state's Parental Notice of Abortion Act, which requires minor children to obtain an adult's consent before undergoing an abortion procedure. Although the bill doesn't specifically discuss the act, the ACLU has indicated that it will use the bill to undermine parental notification requirements.
The bill also reportedly removes licensing requirements for clinics and for abortion providers, allowing non-physicians to perform medical abortions. And to add insult to injury, the bill mandates that insurance providers — including explicitly Christian or religious insurance providers — cover the costs of both birth control and medical abortion.
""This bill remains the most radically pro-abortion measure of its kind and would make Illinois an abortion destination for the country. The amendment filed last night does nothing to change the core of the bill that bears the deliberately deceptive title ‘Reproductive Health Act,"" Thomas More Society senior counsel Peter Breen said in a written statement.
""The bill, as amended,"" Breen continued, ""would remove any penalty for performing late-term abortions, allow nurses to perform medication abortions, and eliminate licensing and health and safety inspections of abortion clinics. The bill would strip all rights from unborn children and wipe nearly every abortion regulation off the books in Illinois, subjecting any that remain to a court challenge under a near-impossible-to-meet ‘strict scrutiny’ standard.""
Sponsors of the bill don't see it that way. They consider themselves crusaders against what they believe to be a national attack on ""reproductive rights.""
""RHA codifies our existing practices and — and this is critical — treats abortion care just like any other health care, because it is,” state representative Kelly Cassidy (D-Chicago) said in her own statement. “Make no mistake, it doesn’t end here. Since Roe was decided in 1973, our opponents have fought to impede access to care and these efforts have the greatest impact on the most vulnerable population.”
Clearly, Cassidy does not consider the unborn a ""vulnerable population.""
Opponents of the bill rallied near the state capital in Springfield and filed more than 18,000 witness slips according to Illinois Right to Life Action, to no avail.
The bill will go to the Illinois Senate later this week and then to the desk of Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, who is expected to sign it into law."
WATCH: 'Students For Life' President Demolishes Common Pro-Abortion Talking Point From Feminist | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47796/watch-students-life-president-demolishes-common-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 29, 2019 views
During a speaking engagement for her “Lies Feminist Tell"" campus tour at Miami University of Oxford, Students for Life of America president Kristan Hawkins broke down the severely flawed and oft-repeated talking point from pro-abortion activists regarding pro-lifers allegedly only caring about children in the womb.
A female attending the event suggested to Hawkins that abortion is justified because some “unwanted” children will end up in the foster care system and suffer.
“An unborn fetus, that cannot live outside the mother, what right do you have to tell me to carry it to term?” she asked. “If it’s an unplanned pregnancy, and odds are, that if it goes into the foster care system, it will face severe neglect and abuse.”
Hawkins framed the feminist’s question more succinctly: “So, you believe that we should have the right to eliminate the sufferer , not the suffering. Is that what you’re saying?”
“That’s not what I’m saying at all. And that’s not what my question is,” the feminist contended.
“You just said that, if you knew that for 100% certainty, that the child you’re birthing is going to have a lifetime of suffering, that it would be better for the child, for you to kill, to end the life of the child, than for the child to suffer. So, instead of attempting to try to solve the suffering of the child, you’ve just eliminated the potential sufferer. Right?” Hawkins again reiterated.
“My question was, how do we end that suffering to make bringing a child that is unwanted into this world justifiable,” the feminist said.
“As pro-lifers and as Americans, we care about the children in foster care, we care about children who are being neglected, who are living on the streets with their parents,” said Hawkins, adding, “I actually don’t believe anyone in this room, regardless if you’re pro-life or pro-choice, thinks that childcare should be suffering in foster care, or children should live through hunger and homelessness.”
“But what you’re advocating for, is you’re trying to justify legal abortion by saying some people are going to suffer, therefore we’re going to play God and we’re going to eliminate the sufferer,” she continued.
“I think that's absolutely wrong,” said Hawkins. “One, because people come out of adversity. People do suffer. And we will all suffer in our life. But I think it’s wrong for you to say, ‘you will suffer therefore I am going to kill you.’”
Apparently not understanding Hawkins’ point, the feminist repeated herself: “So coming back to my question, how do you propose we solve these problems for the children that are suffering?”
“Do you want to go through today all the world’s problems?” asked Hawkins, again underscoring that the woman’s question was mere obfuscation distracting from the issue of abortion.
The pro-life leader noted that she often hears the common pro-abortion talking point that pro-lifers “don’t care about people once they’re born.”
“Yet, are you upset that the American Diabetes Association doesn’t fight cancer?” asked Hawkins. “Are you upset that the American Diabetes Association doesn’t fight cancer?”
“No,” the feminist conceded.
“Why?” pressed Hawkins.
“Because they are the diabetes foundation,” the woman responded, seemingly aware she was begrudgingly wrapping a bow on Hawkins’ point.
“Exactly!” exclaimed Hawkins. “I am anti-abortion.”
Hawkins noted that real issues, like homelessness and foster care, need their own discussions and policy prescriptions. “But my organization, my mission, is very limited: it’s to abolish abortion; to make abortion illegal and unthinkable, because abortion is the greatest human rights tragedy our world faces. There’s no other act of violence that kills more people every single day in America and across the world than abortion.”
“There is nothing wrong with me fighting and spending 100% of my time doing it,” the pro-lifer continued. “Just like how there’s nothing wrong with the American Diabetes Association putting 100% of their money, their research, and time behind curing juvenile diabetes.”
""No one ever accuses the Diabetes Association or the American Cancer association of not trying to cure every life-ending disease,” she highlighted.
Hawkins ended her answer by noting that too often those accusing pro-lifers of not caring for children post-birth “don’t really care” that pro-lifers are often foster parents, leading adoption efforts, and giving to charity. “It’s just an argument to try to stop the actual discussion from happening, which is abortion is a moral wrong and it should be stopped,” she said.

Scientists Alter Reality By Repeating Absurd Statements Five Times In All Caps [Satire] | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47803/scientists-alter-reality-repeating-absurd-andrew-klavan,"Scientists Alter Reality By Repeating Absurd Statements Five Times In All Caps [Satire] Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images
The following is satirical.
Leftist scientists working around the clock have developed powerful new tools for altering reality. In a speech to the Society for the Promulgation of Irrational Hysteria, left-wing physicist Dr. Geraldo Von Zippitynoodle told a gathering of empty chairs he can now confirm that writing a statement five times over in all capital letters and posting it on Twitter transforms that statement, no matter how absurd, into the truth.
In an experiment that has been reduplicated in multiple peer-reviewed imaginations, scientists posted the words “Transwomen are women,” five times in all caps on their Twitter feeds and discovered that from that time forth men who wore dresses not only became real women but were actually able to conceive and bear children if no one looked too closely.
In a transcript of his speech released through UCLA’s Office of Collecting Undeserved Paychecks by Repeatedly Using the Word Diversity, Dr. Von Zippitynoodle said, “The key to changing reality through Repetitive Twitter Capitalization, or RTC, is to insure that no one damages the results by demanding proof or using such words as ‘nonsense,’ or ‘applesauce,’ or ‘utter and complete horse manure of the purest ray serene.’ If people using such words can be banned from Twitter or silenced through intimidation, then the proper reality change can take place undisturbed or, if not, who is there to say?”
In a related experiment, journalists at CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and all three television networks were induced to claim that climate change would destroy life as we know it in 12 years while simultaneously declaring that if anyone on Fox News denied this fact they were corrupt racists. The result was a fundamental transformation of reality so that climate change will now in fact destroy life as we know it in 12 years or never, whichever comes last.
Leftist scientists say they will continue their experiments until reality has been so fundamentally transformed that leftist ideas begin to improve people’s lives. "
Palestinian-Arab Media Teaches Kids How To Shoot Jews | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47808/palestinian-arab-media-teaches-kids-how-shoot-jews-josh-hammer,"Palestinian-Arab Media Teaches Kids How To Shoot Jews AHMAD GHARABLI/AFP/Getty Images May 29, 2019 views
According to the watchdog group Palestinian Media Watch , recent programming on state-run Palestinian Authority television starkly showcases the genocidal, anti-Semitic, jihadist-in-training propaganda into which the Palestinian-Arab youth population has long been indoctrinated . Here is how Palestinian Media Watch lays out the setting:
During the current month of Ramadan, official Palestinian Authority TV is broadcasting a series called Children of the Village Chief . The series portrays Arab life around the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 and afterwards in a village in what was until the Six-Day War in 1967, the ""West Bank"" of the Kingdom of Jordan.
The first program starts with the so-called Palestinian ""Nakba"" — the ""catastrophe"" of the creation of Israel — and continues until the 1980s. In the series, which deals primarily with daily life during this period, attitudes to Israel and Jews are likewise expressed. In one episode, a boy around the age of 10 asks his uncle to teach him how to use a rifle because he wants to shoot at ""the Jews."" The uncle willingly answers his nephew's request, explaining that he should only aim at ""your enemy,"" who the boy then identifies as ""the Jews"" ...
Palestinian Media Watch then records the full television exchange between the Palestinian-Arab boy and his uncle:
Nephew Fares : ""Uncle Ibrahim, I want you to teach me how to use the rifle"" Uncle Ibrahim : ""Why do you want to learn to shoot?"" Fares : ""So that if the Jews come to the village, I'll shoot them like you shot them at Khirbet Al-Loz."" ... Ibrahim : ""Fares, your weapon will only be pointed at your enemy, and you know who your enemy is."" Fares : ""The Jews, who removed us from our land and our homes, like they removed us from Khirbet Al-Loz."" Ibrahim : ""Therefore, Fares, immediately when you see your target, aim at it well and shoot it. Are you ready?"" Fares : ""Ready!"" Ibrahim : ""Go ahead, hero.""
The watchdog group then elaborates on other Jew-hatred disseminated in the same television series: ""In a later episode, Jews are portrayed as potential rapists and 'impure schemers.' Set during the Six-Day-War in 1967, the villagers discuss running away before 'the Jews' arrive, because the villagers 'have wives and honor is precious' and they fear the Jewish soldiers will rape the village women.""
As Aaron Bandler of Jewish Journal observes , this is hardly the first time that Palestinian Media Watch has unmasked virulent Jew-hatred emanating from Palestinian Authority state-run television: ""Palestinian Media Watch has extensively documented the anti-Semitism promulgated on PA TV, which included a sheikh calling for Jews to be 'killed one by one' in December 2018 and an October sermon stating that Adolf Hitler was punishing Jews for their 'mentality of superiority over other people.'""
Polls consistently demonstrate that the Palestinian-Arabs are among the most virulently anti-Semitic group of people in the world. For example, a landmark 2014 global survey from the Anti-Defamation League showed that a whopping 93% of Palestinian-Arabs harbor anti-Semitic views .
A report in The Forward last September highlighted the extent of Palestinian-Arab textbook indoctrination for impressionable young children being educated in Palestinian-Arab schools:
Textbooks created as part of the Palestinian Authority’s new K-12 educational curriculum ""are teaching Palestinian children that there can be no compromise"" and ""indoctrinat[e] for death and martyrdom,"" according to an analysis by a watchdog group. ...
For example, fourth graders learn addition, and ninth graders learn multiplication, by counting the number of Palestinian ""martyrs"" killed by Israel over the years. And a physics textbook uses the example of a Palestinian wielding a slingshot against Israeli soldiers to teach Newton’s Second Law of Motion.
The textbooks also use ""Jews"" and ""Zionists"" interchangeably when criticizing Israel’s actions, the report continued. The report also found that Israelis are almost never depicted positively and that Israel is almost always referred to as the ""Zionist Occupation."" "
"BREAKING: DOJ, Mueller’s Office Release Joint Statement Clarifying Mueller’s Comments | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47811/breaking-doj-muellers-office-release-joint-ryan-saavedra,"May 29, 2019 views
The Department of Justice and the Special Counsel's office released a joint statement late on Wednesday to clarify remarks made earlier in the day at a press conference by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Kerri Kupec, spokeswoman for the Department of Justice and Peter Carr, spokesman for the Special Counsel's Office, released the following statement:
The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice. The Special Counsel's report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination - one way or the other - about whether the President committed a crime. There is no conflict between these statements.
Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro wrote an analysis of Mueller's press conference, which included the following point: Mueller’s Investigation Never Should Have Included Obstruction by Trump.
""Unlike the election interference investigation, which began as a counterintelligence investigation inside the FBI, the obstruction investigation began as a criminal investigation – and a criminal investigation that Mueller admits he never had the authority to conclude,"" Shapiro wrote. ""Mueller stated regarding Russian interference, 'It was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned. When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of their government’s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.' That would be true of Trump’s associates. That would not be true of Trump himself – Mueller recognizes that he never had the authority to indict a sitting president.""
""[U]nder longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,"" Mueller said. ""That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that, too, is prohibited. A special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.""
Shapiro continued, writing:
Yet Mueller proceeded to write two hundred pages about Trump himself, and his conduct. This means that Mueller spent tens of millions of dollars and years of time investigating unindictable conduct. So what the hell was he doing? Mueller provided two separate explanations for the investigation of Trump’s conduct: first, he said, the investigation was permitted because it is “important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents available.” Evidence of what, though? A crime? But Mueller refused to allege a crime. So evidence of something -- something that wasn’t prosecutable right now, and that Mueller refused to suggest amounted to a crime for the future. Mueller himself said the investigation was justified because perhaps it would have resulted in evidence that “could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be charged now.” But Mueller didn’t charge co-conspirators in obstruction. This is bizarre, at least.
Mueller’s second justification is more obvious: he essentially said he was doing Congress’ impeachment groundwork for them. “The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” Mueller stated. This is an invitation to impeachment.
But that’s not Mueller’s job. He is a member of the executive branch. He is not an independent counsel. He is not a legislative investigator. A criminal investigation that cannot possibly result in charges is a conflict in terms. Mueller never should have agreed to such an investigation under the law, and Mueller’s own standard makes that clear.

Reporter Claims Name Of USS John McCain Covered During Japan Trip.

A Wall Street Journal reporter with a history of anti-Trump bias claimed on Wednesday that the White House covered the name of the USS John McCain during President Donald Trump's recent visit to Japan — which was later disputed by multiple sources.
In a tweet that went viral, WSJ reporter Rebecca Ballhaus wrote that ""a tarp was hung over the ship’s name ahead of the trip, and sailors—who wear caps bearing the ship’s name—were given the day off for Trump’s visit.""

""A tarp was hung over the ship’s name ahead of the president’s trip, according to photos reviewed by the Journal, and sailors were directed to remove any coverings from the ship that bore its name,"" Ballhaus wrote in her report. ""After the tarp was taken down, a barge was moved closer to the ship, obscuring its name. Navy officials acknowledge the barge was moved but said it was not moved to obscure the name of the ship.""
Ballhaus's tweet and report went viral and were used to immediately attack the president before any additional information was able to come out.
A couple of hours later, the Navy Chief of Information tweeted: ""The name of USS John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day. The Navy is proud of that ship, its crew, its namesake and its heritage."" The name of USS John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day.

Even MSNBC appeared to refute Ballhaus' claims, noting that the tarp was removed before the president arrived in Japan.
""A spokesperson for US Pacific Fleet said the picture of the tarp is from Friday and it was taken down on Saturday,"" MSNBC's Katy Tur tweeted.

Ballhaus has a history of distorting things to attack the president.
Earlier this year, Ballhaus took a quote from Trump out of context when the president was responding to the threat of white nationalism.
When asked if Trump saw white nationalism as a growing threat around the world, Trump said: ""I don’t really. I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.""
Yet, in her tweet, Ballhaus only reported part of Trump's comment, writing: ""I don’t really. I think it’s a small group of people.""
Ballhaus faced widespread criticism over her dishonest framing of the president's quote, including from the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who tweeted at her: ""When you leave out the part of the quote that negates the narrative you’re trying to push you really bolster the argument of all those complaining about media bias and #fakenews. I would expect more from the @WSJ, but I probably shouldn’t.""

UPDATES: Man Who Set Himself On Fire Near White House Dies; Identity Revealed | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47824/updates-man-who-set-himself-fire-near-white-house-james-barrett,"May 30, 2019 views
In a horrifying moment caught on video, a man set himself on fire near the White House on Wednesday, walking around fully engulfed in flames for several seconds before Secret Service and police arrived to extinguish the flames and attempt to save his life. The man died from the wounds Wednesday evening, authorities say. More details about the man, who has since been identified, have emerged.
The man, who U.S. Park Police identified early Thursday as Arnav Gupta, 33, of Bethesda, Maryland, died of his wounds Wednesday evening, Washington D.C.'s WTOP reported Thursday. Gupta had been reported missing earlier Wednesday, family members citing concerns about his ""physical and emotional welfare.""
On Wednesday, the Montgomery County Police Department issued the following press release announcing ""Concern for Missing Bethesda Area Man"":
Detectives from the Montgomery County Department of Police – 2nd District Investigative Section are asking for the public’s assistance in locating a missing Bethesda area man.
Arnav Gupta, age 33, was last seen by family when he left his Cindy Lane home at approximately 9:20 this morning (Wednesday, May 29).
Gupta is described as an Indian male who is 5’ 9” tall and weighs 200 pounds. He has black hair, brown eyes, a mustache, and wears glasses.
Police are concerned for Gupta’s physical and emotional welfare.
Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Arnav Gupta is asked to call the Montgomery County Police non-emergency number at 301-279-8000 (available 24 hours). Callers may remain anonymous.
""At approximately 12:20 p.m. a man lit himself on fire on the Ellipse near 15th and Constitution Ave., Secret Service personnel are on scene assisting @NatlParkService and @usparkpolicepio in rendering first aid,"" the Secret Service tweeted Wednesday. At approximately 12:20 p.m. a man lit himself on fire on the Ellipse near 15th and Constitution Ave., Secret Service personnel are on scene assisting @NatlParkService and @usparkpolicepio in rendering first aid. — U.S. Secret Service (@SecretService) May 29, 2019
After authorities put out the flames, Gupta was rushed to a nearby hospital.
""Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, a spokesman for the U.S. Park Police, said the man was in critical condition. Park police assumed jurisdiction because the Ellipse is a national park,"" The Washington Post reported Wednesday. ""Delgado said authorities are trying to identify the accelerant that was used and determine whether the man has a car parked in the area. He said police do not yet know the man’s identity and don’t know a motive.""
The case has since been turned over to the Washington D.C. police department.

"Dershowitz: Mueller's Critics Were Right; He's Biased Against Trump, And He Just Proved It | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47846/dershowitz-muellers-critics-were-right-hes-biased-james-barrett,"May 30, 2019 views
In an op-ed for The Hill , Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, who leans left but has frequently found himself arguing against President Trump's critics, says he can no longer defend Robert Mueller as non-partisan after his controversial final statement as special counsel Wednesday.
""Until today, I have defended Mueller against the accusations that he is a partisan,"" Dershowitz writes. ""I did not believe that he personally favored either the Democrats or the Republicans, or had a point of view on whether President Trump should be impeached. But I have now changed my mind. By putting his thumb, indeed his elbow, on the scale of justice in favor of impeachment based on obstruction of justice, Mueller has revealed his partisan bias. He also has distorted the critical role of a prosecutor in our justice system.""
Dershowitz, whose new book makes the case against Democrats moving forward with impeachment plans against Trump, begins by quoting the most eyebrow-raising of Mueller's comments Wednesday: ""If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that.""
That statement, writes Dershowtiz, is ""worse"" than the infamous statement delivered by then-FBI Director James Comey regarding Hillary Clinton's private email server in the summer of 2016, in which he said, ""although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.""
In that moment, Comey went ""beyond his responsibility to state whether there was sufficient evidence to indict Clinton,"" says Dershowitz.
But what Mueller did, was actually more egregious, Dershowitz argues. ""He went beyond the conclusion of his report and gave a political gift to Democrats in Congress who are seeking to institute impeachment proceedings against President Trump,"" he writes. ""By implying that President Trump might have committed obstruction of justice, Mueller effectively invited Democrats to institute impeachment proceedings.""
Dershowitz underscores that what Mueller did was something that ""virtually everybody"" agrees is out of bounds: he suggested that the subject might be guilty despite insufficient evidence to make the case. Anyone who tries to argue that somehow Mueller and the investigation is a ""special case,"" he stresses, is simply ""wrong.""
Dershowitz concludes that the only logical explanation for Mueller's actions is that he was deliberately attempting to ""help Democrats in Congress and to encourage impeachment talk and action.""
In an op-ed for The Daily Wire Wednesday, Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro comes to the same conclusion. ""Mueller’s investigation never should have included obstruction by Trump,"" Shapiro wrote in an op-ed responding to Mueller's statement.
""Unlike the election interference investigation, which began as a counterintelligence investigation inside the FBI, the obstruction investigation began as a criminal investigation — and a criminal investigation that Mueller admits he never had the authority to conclude,"" Shapiro argues. ""He is a member of the executive branch. He is not an independent counsel. He is not a legislative investigator. A criminal investigation that cannot possibly result in charges is a conflict in terms. Mueller never should have agreed to such an investigation under the law, and Mueller’s own standard makes that clear."" "
WALSH: Martin Luther King Jr. Was Reportedly An Abuser Who Laughed At Rape. Is It Time To Tear His Monuments Down? | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47833/walsh-martin-luther-king-jr-was-reportedly-abuser-matt-walsh,"May 30, 2019 views
A report in a publication called Standpoint makes some startling claims about civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. We should note that this article is in something called Standpoint, rather than, say, The New York Times, because the American mainstream media did not have the courage for it. Indeed, David Garrow, the award-winning biographer who authored the piece based on information found in FBI documents, was not able to find any outlet in the United States willing to publish the details.
Here's what Garrow has to say:
Newly-released documents reveal the full extent of the FBI’s surveillance of the civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King in the mid-1960s. They expose in graphic detail the FBI’s intense focus on King’s extensive extramarital sexual relationships with dozens of women, and also his presence in a Washington hotel room when a friend, a Baptist minister, allegedly raped one of his “parishioners”, while King “looked on, laughed and offered advice.” The FBI’s tape recording of that criminal assault still exists today, resting under court seal in a National Archives vault.
More:
At the Willard Hotel, King and his friends’ activities resumed the following evening as approximately 12 individuals “participated in a sex orgy” which the prudish [Assistant Director William C. Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division] felt included “acts of degeneracy and depravity ... When one of the women shied away from engaging in an unnatural act, King and several of the men discussed how she was to be taught and initiated in this respect. King told her that to perform such an act would ‘help your soul.’”
Garrow's report includes many details like this. A picture is painted of a binge-drinking alcoholic and serial adulterer who constantly used his position as a supposed man of God and civil rights leader to sexually exploit women. King is also alleged to have physically attacked a number of his sex partners, including one whose clothes he tore off and another who, according to King's friend Ralph Abernathy , he knocked down onto his bed in a fit of rage.
So, what do we do with this information?
The American media has decided to do nothing with it. I imagine many Americans will follow suit. They will put their fingers in their ears and pretend they never heard it. King will continue to be worshipped to the same extent as before. These points about his life and character will not make it into textbooks and will not be discussed in classrooms. King was canonized before his death, deified upon his death, and there probably isn't anything that will reverse that process in the year 2019.
But for those who wish to have integrity and moral courage — and who abhor hypocrisy — there seems to be only two options:
1. The new standard applied to Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and Christopher Columbus and Robert E. Lee and any number of other (white) historical figures can also be applied to Martin Luther King Jr. As these men have gone from heroes to villains, and their memorials have been torn down as a result, their murals destroyed , their names removed , their monuments defaced , so the same treatment can be doled out to King. He did not share the same sins as these men, but his sins were no better. Washington and company are blamed for being racists who either participated in or condoned slavery. King, if these very credible reports are true, was a violent misogynist who condoned rape. Would anyone really like to argue that one sin is better than the other? I'd say they are both hideously evil. Indeed, rape and slavery grow from the same tree. The slave owner exploits and dehumanizes his victim. So does the rapist.
It is sad that the achievements of our Founding Fathers come with a giant asterisk because their zeal for freedom and liberty did not apply to non-whites. Well, a similar asterisk now accompanies King, whose zeal for equal rights did not apply to the woman whose brutal rape he reportedly applauded. If an asterisk is enough to knock down a statue, then King's statues must be toppled, too.
2. The other option, and the one that I favor, is that we develop a different standard that can be equally applied to all historical figures. Rather than canonize our heroes on one hand, or demonize them on the other, we can humanize them. We begin to see them as real people, not caricatures, and we strive to understand and appreciate them as such. We do not hide our faces from the darker elements of their personalities. We do not justify their sins or rationalize them. We discuss them, openly and honestly. And we don't look to turn them into cartoon villains, either. We see them as men — nothing more or less than that.
If they achieved great things, if they managed feats that few could manage, if they altered the course of human history, then we honor those accomplishments and perhaps even build statues in remembrance. We don't erase anyone from the history books just because they had personal flaws — even very serious flaws. But perhaps we add another page or two. We keep the monuments because the monuments are part of our history and culture, but we keep in mind that the person commemorated by the monument was just that — a person. And that is how we think of them and remember them.
If this is where our reassessment of our historical heroes ultimately leads, I think it will be a positive change. We will finally be remembering and studying history like adults, not children. And it is through that more nuanced lens that we can, I think, continue to honor Martin Luther King Jr., despite the terrible evil he may have done. But he does not get to be an exception. If we extend that grace to MLK and his legacy, then we must extend it equally to all of our historical heroes. He is not a special case. He was a man just like them, and just as flawed. And that's the point. Recommended For You "
New Study Reveals The Most Dangerous Region In The World | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47837/new-study-reveals-most-dangerous-region-world-ryan-saavedra,"New Study Reveals The Most Dangerous Region In The World Getty Images: Mahaux Photography May 30, 2019 views
A new study from the Australian National University has ranked Latin America as the most dangerous region in the world and found that life expectancies are on the decline in certain parts of the region.
""The disturbing number of people being murdered in Latin America is now so high, it is dramatically reducing life expectancy across the region,"" news.com.au. reported . ""Despite having just eight per cent of the world’s population, Latin America now accounts for about a third of the world’s homicides.""
The report ’s lead author, Professor Vladimir Canudas-Romo, told the publication: ""Despite Latin American countries having seen progress in most other major causes of death, such as reductions in cancer and cardiovascular disease, homicide is still affecting people’s lives so much that there is little progress in life expectancies, particularly among young men.""
""These are very worrying numbers,"" Canudas-Romo added. ""Usually suicide rates are higher than homicides in every part of the world, but in Latin America homicides are much higher.""
Fox News noted that the study showed that ""more than two million people aged 15-19 in Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) between 2005 and 2015 – with young men accounting for most of those deaths. The two most populated countries – Mexico and Brazil – account for the highest number of homicides in absolute numbers, however in El Salvador and Honduras in 2015 [there was] a staggering rate of 109 and 64 homicides per 100,000 people, respectively.""
Latin America has seen an explosion in homicides, kidnappings, hijackings, and extortions in recent years as drug cartels, ineffective policies, and corrupt politicians have all contributed to the worsening conditions.
In January, new statistics released for 2018 showed that the number of murders in Mexico saw a 33% increase from the previous year, as the narco-state continues to become more violent.
A 2016 report from Verisk Maplecroft , an independent risk analysis firm, also found that Latin America is the most dangerous region in the world:
Latin America has been named as the world’s highest risk region for violent crime, due to the widespread prevalence of drug trafficking organisations (DTOs), kidnapping, extortion and robbery across 11 countries, including in its four largest economies, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia. The findings come from new research released by risk analytics company Verisk Maplecroft, which evaluates the risks to populations, business and economies from violent crime in 198 countries.
Weak political institutions, widespread drug trafficking and ineffective police and security forces see conflict stricken Afghanistan topping Verisk Maplecroft’s Criminality Index. However, as home to six of the 13 countries rated ‘extreme risk,’ Latin America ranks as the world’s highest risk region, ahead of South Asia and West Africa. Guatemala (ranked 2nd highest risk), Mexico (3rd), Honduras (6th), Venezuela (7th), El Salvador (8th) and Colombia (12th) all feature in the ‘extreme risk’ category of the index. A further five, including Brazil (31st) and Argentina (43rd), are categorised as ‘high risk.’
A separate report found that for 2018, 42 of the 50 most violent cities in the world were in Latin America, with Tijuana, which is located along the U.S.-Mexico border, being named the most dangerous city in the world. "
"FBI Investigated Bernie Sanders For Ties To Marxist Group, Report Says | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47867/fbi-investigated-bernie-sanders-ties-marxist-group-josh-hammer,"FBI Investigated Bernie Sanders For Ties To Marxist Group, Report Says Sean Rayford/Getty Images May 30, 2019 views
Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination who has often polled behind only former Vice President Joe Biden, has long had a soft spot for Communist nations. As Fox News reported last month, a recently unearthed video from 1986 showed Sanders praising the Fidel Castro-led Communist revolution in Cuba:
Unearthed video footage showed 2020 hopeful Bernie Sanders recalling his excitement surrounding the Cuban revolution in the 1950s.
""I remember, for some reason or another, being very excited when [former Cuban dictator] Fidel Castro made the revolution in Cuba,"" he said, while speaking at the University of Vermont in 1986.
""I was a kid ... and it just seemed right and appropriate that poor people were rising up against rather ugly rich people.""
The Reagan Battalion has also tweeted out the video of Sanders praising Castro.

In a Daily Wire op-ed in February, furthermore, I elaborated on Sanders' long history of dalliances with the Leninist thuggery of the Soviet Union:
Toward the end of the hellish Cold War, facing a hegemonic Soviet arch-nemesis whose only reason for not annihilating us via nuclear holocaust was a game theory-backed faith in ""mutually assured destruction,"" Bernie Sanders honeymooned with his second wife in the Soviet Union. Toward the end of the hellish Cold War, facing a hegemonic Soviet arch-nemesis whose only reason for not annihilating us via nuclear holocaust was a game theory-backed faith in ""mutually assured destruction,"" Bernie Sanders flew a hammer-and-sickle Soviet flag in his Vermont mayoral office. At the end of the hellish Cold War, facing a hegemonic Soviet arch-nemesis whose only reason for not annihilating us via nuclear holocaust was a game theory-backed faith in ""mutually assured destruction,"" Bernie Sanders willfully addressed a known front group for a political party whose members swear an oath of allegiance to that very hegemonic arch-nemesis.
Now, according to reporting from the Washington Examiner , it turns out that the FBI has even investigated Sanders for his former ties to and campaigning for an overtly Marxist political party operating in the United States:
Bernie Sanders campaigned for the Socialist Workers Party in the 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns and was investigated by the FBI for his ties to the Marxist group.
Sanders has always played down the extent of his involvement with the party, which included radicals who praised the Soviet Union and Cuban communists, and has denied ever being a member. Asked in 1988 about his role as an SWP elector in 1980, he said: ""I was asked to put my name on the ballot and I did, that’s true."" In fact, his ties to the party are deep and enduring. ...
[In 1984,] he backed and campaigned for the SWP presidential nominee Mel Mason, a former Black Panther, saying it was important for there to be ""fundamental alternatives to capitalist ideology."" During the campaign, Mason praised the Russian and Chinese revolutions and said: ""The greatest example of a socialist government is Cuba, and Nicaragua is right behind, but it's still developing.""
It is unclear, at best, whether Sanders will be punished by voters for this revelation in his presidential primary race in an increasingly hard-left Democratic Party. "
ICE Tears Into Washington State For Enacting Sanctuary City Policies | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47735/ice-tears-washington-state-enacting-sanctuary-city-josh-hammer,"ICE Tears Into Washington State For Enacting Sanctuary City Policies Carl Larson / Contributor via Getty Images May 28, 2019 views
It might surprise many Americans to learn that, per Department of Justice statistics , a whopping 43% of all federal offenses are committed by non-citizens. Tragically, as then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions put it last year , every single crime committed by an illegal alien is, by definition, a readily preventable crime:
Every crime committed by an illegal alien is, by definition, a crime that should have been prevented. It is outrageous that tens of thousands of Americans are dying every year because of the drugs and violence brought over our borders illegally and that taxpayers have been forced, year after year, to pay millions of dollars to incarcerate tens of thousands of illegal aliens.
As The Daily Wire has recently reported , the state of Washington has been experiencing an upsurge in crime committed by illegal aliens. Earlier this month, The Seattle Times noted how a 51-year-old Seattle-area man charged with luring and second-degree assault after he allegedly tried to force a 14-year-old girl into his pickup truck turned out to be a twice-deported illegal alien. Seattle-based radio host Dori Monson opined on the lawless sanctuary city laws that mollycoddle criminal aliens throughout Washington state:
We have the most lax laws. We are attracting drug vagrants, and we are attracting illegal immigrants. We are seeing the ramifications of it on the streets with all of the women who are being sexually assaulted, from the woman at the Ballard car dealership to Kelly Herron at Golden Gardens, to this teenage girl in Burien.
Washington is the best place to be if you’re an illegal immigrant. We’ve got sanctuary everything and a governor who tells you you’re a pillar of the community when you come into this country illegally and commit crimes. What a great place to come and abduct 14-year-old girls.
Now, as The Daily Caller reported last week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has taken it upon itself to hone its crosshairs upon and utterly excoriate Washington state's lax sanctuary city regime:
Immigration and Customs Enforcement ripped Washington for becoming the latest state to enact policies that protect illegal immigrants from local law enforcement and federal authorities.
""ICE maintains that cooperation by local law enforcement is an indispensable component of promoting public safety. It’s unfortunate that current local and state laws and policies tie the hands of local law enforcement agencies that want and need to work with ICE to promote public safety by holding criminals accountable and providing justice and closure for their victims,"" the agency said Thursday in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation. ...
""Sanctuary policies not only provide a refuge for illegal aliens, but they also shield criminal aliens who prey on people in their own and other communities,"" ICE stated. ""When ICE officers and agents have to go out into the community to proactively locate these aliens, it puts personnel and potentially innocent bystanders at risk.""
According to The Daily Caller, ""The newly-enacted legislation largely prohibits local law enforcement from asking about an individual’s immigration status or place of birth, with an exception if it pertains to a criminal investigation."" "
WATCH: Elizabeth Warren On ‘The View’: Fox News A ‘Hate-For-Profit Scam’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47854/watch-elizabeth-warren-view-fox-news-hate-profit-paul-bois,"
This article has been updated since its original publication.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is continuing to solidify herself as the radical candidate whose ideas are just too good for the deplorables watching Fox News.
Earlier this month, Sen. Warren attempted to differentiate herself from the 2020 herd by rejecting an invitation for a Fox News town hall, denouncing the network as a ""hate-for-profit racket that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracy theorists.""
""Fox News is a hate-for-profit racket that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracy theorists,"" she wrote on her website at the time. ""I won’t ask Democratic primary voters to tune in to an outlet that profits from racism and hate in order to see our candidates. Hate-for-profit works only if there’s profit, so Fox News balances a mix of bigotry, racism and outright lies with enough legit journalism to make the claim to advertisers that it’s a reputable news outlet. It’s all about dragging in ad money — big ad money.""
While hardcore progressives certainly appreciated the move, others in the Democratic Party believed it showed Warren's inability to face all of the United States and persuade people whose views differ from her own. As Whoopi Goldberg put it on ""The View"": ""If you can’t face the Fox audience, you can’t face the U.S. It’s that simple.""
On Thursday, Elizabeth Warren appeared on ""The View"" to defend her rejection of Fox News — and she doubled-down on her assertions that the network runs a ""hate-for-profit scam.""
“Here’s how I see this, I want to go everywhere,"" Warren began. ""Look at it this way. I have three brothers, older brothers I grew up with back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat, do the math on this. I want to reach out to everybody. I’ve been to 18 states. I was just in Kermit, West Virginia. They describe it as the reddest of the red. We did a town hall where there were folks who quite openly said I voted for Donald Trump, may vote for him again, but wanted to hear what I had to say and wanted selfies by the time we got to the end.""
She continued: ""That’s a good thing. I’ve been to a lot of different places, not just our early battleground states but to Utah, into Mississippi, into Alabama, and Tennessee and I want to keep doing that. Here’s the deal about Fox News executives and that is they’re running a hate-for-profit scam.""
The senator from Massachusetts went on to also say that Fox News gives platforms to those with hardline anti-immigration stances. She said her move against Fox News is simply to boycott their business, not the Americans who watch it.
""Here’s the deal about those town halls, they make a lot of money off those town halls,"" Warren continued. ""Right now, advertisers are getting really antsy about being with Fox on a regular basis because they don’t want their brands associated with them. We do town halls and bring in a big Democratic audience to watch that night and then the sales reps for Fox come out and say, 'oh, look at our high numbers and look how even-handed we are.' I’m just not going to give them a full hour to help raise money and help get credibility because they were willing to talk to me for an hour.""
Warren did receive some pushback for her harsh characterization of Fox News as a ""hate-for-profit"" organization. Both co-hosts Meghan McCain and Sunny Hostin pointed out that Warren will alienate a potential audience by taking such a strong stance.
""I was really proud to work at Fox News. I don't consider them a racist organization I will say that,"" said Meghan McCain. ""There's so many people that watch that are really good people and I just think you're alienating an audience. And for me it just sounds like you don't care about the people who watch Fox.""
""There are journalist like Shep Smith and Chris Wallace that are doing very balanced journalism there,"" said Sunny Hostin. "
"Biden Announces War On Guns In ‘Education’ Plan, Wants Far-Left Semi-Auto Ban | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47872/biden-announces-war-guns-education-plan-wants-far-ryan-saavedra,"Biden Announces War On Guns In ‘Education’ Plan, Wants Far-Left Semi-Auto Ban Spencer Platt/Getty Images May 30, 2019 views
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden announced on his campaign website that he intends to wage war on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens as a part of his ""education"" plan for America.
As noted by Second Amendment columnist AWR Hawkins , Biden said that the National Rifle Association (NRA) must be defeated ""in order to make our schools safer,"" and he wants to ban semi-automatic firearms.
Biden said that arming school faculty members does not make schools safer and the only solution is to implement more gun policies, which is contrary to what experts around the nation are discovering.
In the wake of the Parkland massacre in 2018, the 15-member Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission unanimously approved letting school faculty members carry firearms so they can quickly respond to a shooting.
In his education plan, Biden stated that he wants to ban semi-automatic firearms, despite the fact that the 1994 assault weapon ban had virtually no impact in reducing crime . Here's Biden's full statement:
Defeat the National Rifle Association – again – in order to make our schools safer. Parents shouldn’t have to worry about whether their kids will come home from school, and students shouldn’t have to sacrifice themselves for their friends days before graduation. We cannot let gun violence become an acceptable part of American life. Biden knows that arming teachers isn’t the answer; instead, we need rational gun laws. As President, he will secure passage of gun legislation to make our students safer, and he knows he can do it because he’s defeated the National Rifle Association twice before. He’ll begin by again championing legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines – bans he authored in 1994. In the months ahead, he will release additional proposals to address the gun violence epidemic in our country.
""Biden’s plan overlooks two very important issues. First, the deadliest school shooting of the 21st century–Virginia Tech, April 16, 2007– was carried out with handguns, not 'assault weapons,'"" Hawkins continued in his report . ""That horrid attack perfectly illustrated the Rockefeller Institute of Government’s findings mass shooters prefer handguns over rifles by a margin of three to one.""
""Secondly, Biden fails to note that school shootings occur in places where the most gun controls exist; places where law-abiding individuals who otherwise carry a gun for self-defense are mandated to disarm for gun-free zone policies,"" Hawkins concluded. ""These and other gun controls already guarantee that an attacker does not have to worry about facing armed resistance."" "
New Damaging Info Comes Out On Disgraced FBI Agent Peter Strzok | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47868/breaking-new-damaging-info-comes-out-disgraced-fbi-ryan-saavedra,"New Damaging Info Comes Out On Disgraced FBI Agent Peter Strzok SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images May 30, 2019 views
The FBI did not warn the Trump campaign that two members of its campaign were under FBI investigation when agents met with the campaign in August 2016 to warn it about national security threats.
Fox News' Catherine Herridge reports that the FBI's mid-August 2016 counterintelligence ""defensive briefing"" for the Trump campaign did not notify campaign officials that Mike Flynn and George Papadopoulos were under investigation. Fox News reports :
Strzok, who was later removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigative team for sending anti-Trump texts, was a central coordinator for the FBI on the defensive briefing, which included multiple agencies. Three weeks earlier, Strzok opened an FBI counterintelligence investigation into campaign aide George Papadopoulos.
A source familiar with sensitive records documenting the August briefing told Fox News that Strzok was in a unique -- and apparently conflicted -- position. Strzok opened the FBI investigation into Russian outreach to Trump campaign aides, while at the same time he was supposed to be warning the Trump campaign about Russian activities.
During a segment on Fox News, Herridge noted that the time of the events is significant as days before the briefing Strzok and Page spoke about their ""insurance policy"" against then-candidate Donald Trump.
""I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office – that there’s no way he gets elected – but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk,"" Strzok texted FBI lawyer Lisa Page, whom he was having an affair with.""It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.""
After that text message was released last summer, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro wrote :
This looks an awful lot like motivation for launching an investigation into Trump in order to sink Trump as a hedge against Trump’s victory. The FBI’s investigation into Russian governmental interference in the election began in July 2016, just weeks before Strzok’s text message. And that means that there is now more of a smoking gun of FBI corruption against Trump than there is of Trump colluding with Russia.
Herridge further notes that just a couple of days before the infamous ""insurance policy"" text message, the two anti-Trump agents had the following text message exchange:
Page: [Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!
Strzok: No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.
When that text message was released last summer, Shapiro responded to it by writing :
This is an explicit admission that high-ranking actors in the FBI saw preventing Trump’s presidency as paramount. Barring some highly damning information demonstrating the full legitimacy of the Russia investigation, this text from Strzok to Page could and should completely destroy whatever faith that America still had in the legitimacy of the Russia investigation.
Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News on Thursday:
There was a defensive briefing of candidate Trump on Aug. 17 of 2016. And I can tell you what he wasn't told: He wasn't warned about a Russia investigation that Peter Strzok had opened 18 days earlier.
Why would Peter Strzok, who would participate at Jim Comey's direction in a defensive briefing designed to protect and warn a candidate, be the same person who is in fact at that time already investigating the candidate's campaign? That shouldn't happen. There should be answers to those questions. "
"CAIR Asks L.A. Mayor To ‘Retract’ Support For Jerusalem Embassy, Demands Apology | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Jeffrey Cawood,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47874/cair-asks-la-mayor-retract-support-jerusalem-jeffrey-cawood,"DailyWire.com CAIR Asks L.A. Mayor To ‘Retract’ Support For Jerusalem Embassy, Demands Apology Mayor Eric Garcetti recognizes Jerusalem as capital of both Israel and a “fully sovereign Palestinian state that we all want to emerge.” Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images May 30, 2019 views
Muslim and Jewish activist groups are demanding an apology from Los Angeles Democratic Mayor Eric Garcetti over recent comments backing a Jerusalem-based U.S. Embassy in Israel.
A coalition led by the L.A. chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) penned a letter to Garcetti last week requesting he “retract” his support for relocating operations from Tel Aviv, where the embassy had been from 1966 until May 2018.
Garcetti, who describes himself as “half-Chicano and half-Jewish,” voiced his approval of the change during a trip to Israel earlier this month.
“I support the embassy being there,” Garcetti told the Los Angeles Times. “Israel shouldn’t be the only country in the world that can’t determine where its capital will be, but there is usually a process to these things rather than what seems like an overnight, one-sided, partisan move.”
In 2017, President Donald J. Trump broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy after recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and vowed to move the embassy there. The new location opened last year, infuriating Palestinians who claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
“There is absolutely a space to be pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian,” Garcetti continued. “And if anybody thinks there will be resolution to this conflict, how can you not be pro-both?”
Garcetti’s remarks prompted a letter from leaders of several ""interfaith groups"" including CAIR-LA Executive Director Hussam Ayloush, who asked him to reconsider his stance and “stand against Trump’s reckless decision.”
The letter told Garcetti that moving the embassy to Jerusalem was a “dangerous and offensive action” and called on the mayor to “apologize” to constituents for supporting the switch. The coalition wrote: “We were distraught when hearing of this news…especially in the month of Ramadan.”
Partial transcript as follows: We were deeply offended at your recent endorsement of the unilateral decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. This place, what Palestinians call Al Quds, the Holy City, is sacred to Christians and Muslims alike, not just to Israeli Jews… We strongly believe that the status of Jerusalem is a matter for negotiations between the government of Israel and representatives of the Palestinian people. The Trump Administration’s decision to move the US Embassy undercuts our government’s reputation and ability to act as a trusted broker for a revived peace process. It also supports the racist intentions of the Netanyahu government and its supporters who would ethnically cleanse the Palestinian people from their homes in Jerusalem.
The condemnation was co-signed by Friends of Sabeel, North America (FOSNA); Islamic Shura Council of Southern California; Arab American Civic Council; and the L.A. chapters of the Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and the Episcopal Peace Fellowship’s Palestine Israel Network (EPF PIN).
Garcetti issued a statement responding to the criticism.
“I recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” he wrote. “And I have always recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state that we all want to emerge from negotiations toward a two-state solution.”
“As I made clear in my comments last week, I disagree strongly with how the Trump administration made its decision. It was outside the scope of any talks, without balance or coordination.”
“But we cannot allow this president’s thoughtless partisanship to divide friends and take our eyes off what is most important, which is moving forward to peace,” he said. “We have to keep pressing for peace and a two-state solution, with Jerusalem as the rightful capital of both nations.”
Garcetti spent five days in Israel leading a delegation from the U.S. Conference of Mayors. According to the L.A. Times, the trip aimed “to boost U.S.-Israel relations at the municipal level.”

Hypocrites: Netflix Films In Middle Eastern Countries As It Threatens Georgia Over Abortion Law | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47890/hypocrites-netflix-films-middle-eastern-countries-paul-bois,"May 31, 2019 views
Though Netflix threatens to boycott the state of Georgia for passing a fetal heartbeat law to protect unborn children from abortion, the company still films in countries like Jordan and Egypt, where abortion is illegal.
Earlier this week, Netflix helped start a chain reaction of major studios threatening to boycott Georgia if lawmakers did not overturn the fetal heartbeat law.
""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,"" Netflix's chief content officer Ted Sarandos told Variety . ""It’s why we will work with the ACLU and others to fight it in court. Given the legislation has not yet been implemented, we’ll continue to film there, while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to. Should it ever come into effect, we’d rethink our entire investment in Georgia.""
Netflix was later joined by Disney, NBCUniversal, CBS, Showtime, and WarnerMedia with similar calls to boycott Georgia throughout the week. But, as noted by LifeNews , Netflix is clearly willing to work in heavily abortion-restrictive countries.
According to Variety , on the very same week that Netflix threatened Georgia, the company began working on its third Arabic original, titled ""Paranormal,"" which will, of course, be produced in Egypt. From the report:
Netflix is stepping up production in the Middle East with its third and most ambitious Arabic original, titled “Paranormal,” with young Egyptian director Amr Salama (“Sheikh Jackson”) on board as director and showrunner.
“Paranormal,” based on bestselling Arabic horror books by late Egyptian author Ahmed Khaled Tawfik, is being jointly produced by Salama and prominent Egyptian indie producer Mohammed Hefzy , whose Film Clinic shingle is known internationally for churning out a stream of edgy titles such as “Microphone,” “Sheikh Jackson” and “Yomeddine.”
The series, set in the 1960s, marks the streaming giant’s first foray into a drama produced in Egypt, which is historically the Arab world’s production powerhouse. “Paranormal” depicts the adventures of lead character Dr. Refaat Ismail, a hematologist who finds himself “faced with a series of supernatural events.”
As many as three Netflix original series are shot in the Middle East, two of which are produced in Jordan – ""Jinn"" and ""Al Rawabi School for Girls.""
So how restrict are the abortion laws in both Jordan and Egypt? According to the Washington Free Beacon , Jordan restricts abortion in nearly all cases except in cases when the life or mental health of the mother is at risk. People in violation of those laws face imprisonment. The country Jordan also provided locations for parts of Disney's ""Aladdin,"" another studio threatening Georgia.
Over in Egypt, the Pew Research Center reports that the country has maintained a ban on abortion in nearly all circumstances since 1937.
""The Egyptian Penal Code of 1937 bans abortion in all circumstances, but criminal law allows flexibility on grounds of 'necessity,'"" the report says. ""Physicians rely on that principle to justify performing an abortion when they believe the mother’s life or health is in danger or in cases of fetal abnormality. A committee of physicians must agree that the abortion is acceptable within the confines of the law."" "
"Bubonic Plague ‘Likely’ Already Present In Los Angeles, Dr. Drew Says | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47888/bubonic-plague-likely-already-present-los-angeles-joseph-curl,"Bubonic Plague ‘Likely’ Already Present In Los Angeles, Dr. Drew Says MARK RALSTON / Contributor / Getty Images
Los Angeles is going down the drain.
The city, with a population topping four million and a broader metropolitan area with many millions more, is awash in massive problems — overcrowding, lack of housing, and high demand for free services among them. But other far more serious problems are lurking, Dr. Drew Pinksy said on Thursday.
“We have a complete breakdown of the basic needs of civilization in Los Angeles right now,” Pinsky told Fox New host Laura Ingraham. “We have the three prongs of airborne disease, tuberculosis is exploding, rodent-borne. We are one of the only cities in the country that doesn’t have a rodent control program, and sanitation has broken down.”
Pinsky said bubonic plague — also known as the “Black Death,” a pandemic that killed off millions in the 14th century — is “likely” already present in Los Angeles. The plague is spread by infected fleas and exposure to bodily fluids from a dead plague-infected animal, with the bacteria entering through the skin and traveling to lymph nodes.
Typhus, which broke out in the city last year, will likely return, Pinsky said. Already, a Los Angeles police officer has contracted typhoid fever, which infects fewer than 350 Americans each year. The various types of typhus are caused by a bacterial infection and spread by body lice, chiggers or fleas. In the 1600s, the disease decimated Germany.
“This is unbelievable. I can’t believe I live in a city where this is not Third World. This is medieval,” Pinsky said, according to Fox News . “Third World countries are insulted if they are accused of being like this. No city on Earth tolerates this. The entire population is at risk.”
Pinsky said the city simply can't handle the demand for services, noting that many homeless are mentally ill and don't want to accept housing.
“[T]he government is somehow insisting that housing is the problem when in fact we have chronic mental illness, we have addiction, we have people who don’t want to leave the streets,” Pinsky said. “They literally won’t take the housing if we give it to them. And that’s the population that’s vulnerable, and is going to get so ill this summer. It scares me for their well-being.”
The famed doctor also said California cities are suffering after allowing thousands of illegal aliens to flow in. He said the liberal politicians running most cities are “disgustingly negligent.”
Homelessness is also exploding in San Francisco — the home district of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
“A federal count shows the number of homeless people increased by double-digit percentages in three San Francisco Bay Area counties over two years as the region struggled to tackle the growing problem, including 17% in San Francisco and 43% in the county that includes Oakland,” the Associated Press reported.
Meanwhile, a new map compiled by the group Open the Books titled “2011-2019 San Francisco Human Waste Reportings” features a little pin (appropriately brown) showing where city residents have reported human feces. From the looks of the map, the entire city has been covered in poop.

“Since 2008, over 23,800 cases of human waste were reported in the heart of San Francisco. There were 13 reports of human feces in front of City Hall; 17 events at the U.S. Marshals office; and 67 reports at the Tenderloin police station on Eddy Street,” Forbes reported.
Even the biggest companies that call San Francisco home have not been spared. “The largest concentration of complaints was in the area of Market St., where the headquarters of companies such as Twitter and Uber are located. Nearly a hundred markers also were clustered along the block that surrounds city hall,” Fox said. "
"WATCH: Rand Paul Smashes Robert Mueller Over Trump Investigation, Amash On Impeachment Talk | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47900/watch-rand-paul-smashes-robert-mueller-over-trump-hank-berrien,"WATCH: Rand Paul Smashes Robert Mueller Over Trump Investigation, Amash On Impeachment Talk Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images May 31, 2019 views
Speaking with Fox Business Network's Stuart Varney on Thusday, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) blistered special counsel Robert Mueller, saying he” completely and fundamentally misunderstands our justice system,” and also took a shot at fellow libertarian Rep. Justin Amash, (R-MI), who said Congress should go forward with the impeachment of President Trump. Paul stated, “I don't understand a libertarian who would take this investigation and say we should pursue it and impeach the president. It goes against everything libertarians are for.”
The exchange went like this:
Varney: What do you make of all this impeachment talk?
Paul: The thing that shocks me is that someone like Mueller, who is supposed to be esteemed and has been around for decades, completely and fundamentally misunderstands our justice system. The burden on the government is to prove that you're guilty. Nobody proves that you’re innocent. You're presumed to be innocent. So he’s out there, all over television, saying, “We never said, we never concluded the president was innocent.” Completely misunderstands our judicial system. You're presumed to be innocent; they have to prove you're guilty. He was not charged. He was not indicted, so he is innocent, and so it’s really wrong-headed but misunderstands our system for him to go around saying, ""If he was innocent we would have said he was innocent."" That never happens in our country. Grand juries never issue a bill about innocence. They only either indict you or try to prove that you're guilty. But you're presumed to be innocent in our country and Mueller completely misunderstands that.
Varney: If we go with all the impeachment talk and investigations and subpoenas, and heaven knows what else, am I right in saying the government is essentially stalled, nothing gets done?
Paul: Yes, and I think people are sick and tired of this. You talk in my hometown to people who have been watching all this overwrought from some of the networks, it has become so partisan, so malevolent and hateful towards the president. People are sick of watching it, to tell you the truth. Can you imagine how sick they are gonna get if we get a year or two of some sort of partisan impeachment process? It’s going to be terrible for the country.
Varney: I think of you as a libertarian. Justin Amash is a libertarian, he’s a Republican, and he is saying, yeah, he was the first person to say, it’s in Congress's court, go forward with impeachment, what do you make of that? Paul: Libertarians like myself have for a long time said the intelligence community has too much power and that we’re very concerned that either CIA or FBI could be investigating Americans for political purposes. That’s long been our complaint. So I don't understand a libertarian who would take this investigation and say we should pursue it and impeach the president. It goes against everything libertarians are for. We don't like too much power. We don't like the secret FISA court going after Americans. Foreigners are one thing, but always we've been very concerned about the FISA court being used against Americans. So I've been talking with the president. I spoke with him last night about how do we try to prevent this from happening to the next president or to the Americans at large? I think the president is open to trying to figure out a way, either legislatively or through executive order, we can try to prevent this abuse of power from happening again.
Varney: So you're really involved in taking steps to make sure this does not get repeated?
Paul: Absolutely, while I'm a supporter of the president, I'm really a supporter of every American whether you're a Republican donor, Democrat donor, activist politically, you should not be targeted by your government. I fear if this happens that from now on the new normal will be that administrations will go after their enemies. We've had a problem with that in our country before and that’s why we’ve had reforms. Right now this shows me, the whole Trump investigation shows me we need more reforms. It’s about trying to control the government. Government, they say power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. We need to limit the power of the government to spy on Americans. I think the president may do some of this so I'm working with him on ideas, if they want to look at foreign intelligence, if they want to look at an American, they have to go to a public court, the district court here in New York, in public, and say we have probable cause we want to investigate an American. Otherwise, it shouldn't happen. They abused the FISA system, which is supposed to be about going after foreign spies, to go after an American campaign. This is a terrible abuse of power and I want to be part of making sure it never happens to anybody again. "

On Thursday, the hatred of Cher for President Trump exploded in a Vesuvius-hot tweet in which she apparently called for him to be sexually assaulted in prison, tweeting, “Been Giving IMPEACHMENT MUCH Thought Throughout The Day,& I Would *love* 2 See trump Impeached, Brought 2 Trial, *locked* Up In *prison* & Toy Boy Big Bubba!!

Cher’s fervent hostility toward Trump goes back years; in June 2016, at a ""She's With Us"" concert held in honor of Hillary Clinton, Cher snapped , “When I see Trump talking, I just want to blow my brains out, well maybe not my brains but I'm just like 'What are you talking about, Jesus!' I know that Hillary fights for equality for all people and we are no good unless all of us are equal.""
One month later, Cher was at it again, tweeting that Trump was a traitor. And the next month, a series of rants in which Cher stated , “MY Friend,Associate Professor of Psychiatry at HARVARD, SAID ""[Trump’s} A MALIGNANT NARCISSIST, PERSON WHO MUST CRUSH PPL HE ""PERCEIVES"" AS ENEMIES.""

Three weeks later , at a fundraiser for Hillary, Cher ranted, “I just think he's a f***ing idiot,” adding, ""He doesn't mean we want to make America great again. He means we want to make America straight and white.” She also stated Trump reminded her of ""despots, you know Stalin and Hitler,” continuing, “It’s like ‘Racist Fun with Dick and Jane.’ We’re going to build walls.” She posited that if Trump were elected, “our world would be the worst place… I don’t think we could imagine how bad it could get … If breaking news ever happened and he had to go to the podium, we would just all go, 'F***.” "

Former President Barack Obama told multiple lies on Thursday to a crowd in Brazil while discussing gun laws in the United States — something that he repeatedly did during his presidency.
In a clip flagged by Grabien's Tom Elliott, Obama stated: ""Some of you may be aware our gun laws in the United States don't make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, any time.

Everything stated by Obama was a blatant lie.
Stephen Gutowski, a Second Amendment reporter for The Washington Free Beacon, highlighted some of Obama's in a series of tweets on Friday.
""Former President Obama just straight up lied about America's gun laws while at an event in Brazil--a country with strict gun laws and an unfathomably-high gun murder rate,"" Gutowski tweeted. ""Former President Obama told the Brazilian crowd 'anybody can buy any weapon any time without much, if any, regulation' of our gun laws which is just plain false on its face. A complete lie.""

""It's especially stark given that he's talking about American gun laws in relation to the Sandy Hook shooting where the shooter did not legally purchase his firearms but instead murdered his own mother and stole hers,"" Gutowski continued .
In a series of tweets from 2017, after the Las Vegas shooting, Gutowski highlighted existing regulations on firearms.
""First, the sale of new fully-automatic firearms was effectively banned in 1986 under the Hughes Amendment,"" Gutowski tweeted. ""Fully-automatic firearms that were registered under the National Firearms Act before 1986 were grandfathered in & are still legal.""

""However, in order to obtain a legal fully-automatic firearm you must apply to the ATF, pay a $200 tax, & register with the ATF,"" Gutowski continued. ""The ATF has a registry of every legally-owned full-auto firearm & informs local law enforcement of all who own them in their jurisdiction.

""Beyond the registration process, which can take up to 9 months to complete, the price of fully-automatic firearms is extremely high,"" Gutowski noted. ""A fully-automatic rifle that might have only cost $500 to produce sells for $20,000-$30,000 on the civilian market now because of the 86 ban.""

Making blatantly false statements about firearms is somewhat of a hobby for Obama, as he often lied about firearms during his presidency as he tried to push for far-left gun control measures.
In 2016, Obama said : ""We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.""
A Washington Post fact-check rated the claim as false, writing:
Federal law prohibits licensed firearms dealers from selling a handgun, such as a Glock, to people under 21 years old. It prohibits unlicensed people, like family, from selling or transferring handguns to anyone under 18. In most states, you need to be at least 18 to purchase and own a handgun.
Public libraries, on the other hand, generally don’t have an age limit or a background check for children to get a library card and access books and computers for free.
In 2015, Obama said : ""There are neighborhoods where it’s easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable.""
A Washington Post fact-check rated the claim as false, writing:
This is just a very strange comment that appears to have no statistical basis. Perhaps one can just shrug it off as hyperbole, but is this really something the president of the United States should say to college students? As far as we know, there are no areas in the United States where background checks are needed to buy vegetables. Recommended For You "
Rolling Thunder Exec Director: We'll Ride On Washington If Pelosi Tries to Impeach Trump | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47909/rolling-thunder-exec-director-well-ride-washington-hank-berrien,"views
The executive director of Rolling Thunder, the annual military event that features hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists traveling to Washington to call for full accountability for prisoners of war and missing in action service members, said that the entire membership would arrive in the nation’s capital if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he called an “arrogant little b****,” decides to try to impeach President Trump.
Artie Muller, 74, who served as a U.S. Army sergeant in the Vietnam War and is listed on the group’s website as a co-founder, spoke at the National Mall on Monday and posited that Pelosi should be ousted from Congress for the series of investigations she is involved with. He stated, “I would like to see Nancy Pelosi and her hypocrites work on the POW issue instead of bulls***ting [and] aggravating the President of the United States, who's doing a fantastic job.” He added, “When the hell are they going to wake up? It's not their children, their mothers, their fathers that are left behind in the POW camps.”
The Washington Examiner noted, “The numbers involved in a pro-Trump rally could be large. More than 1 million bikers are believed to have traveled to D.C. for this year’s Rolling Thunder rally. And infrequent, unrelated biker activism has drawn large numbers, including a 2013 ride that brought thousands of bikers to counterprotest a 9/11 event originally billed as the Million Muslim March.”
Muller also commented on the rumor that Trump had stormed out of a meeting with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last week, saying, “He walks out of a meeting with Nancy Pelosi not because he's had a hissy fit like she said. [It's] because he's tired of putting up with her bulls**t … We should look at her and her family background. I have to look at it myself because somebody told me her family background. They're all a bunch of damn thieves. Let's investigate Nancy Pelosi and throw her the hell out of Congress.”
Last November, Rolling Thunder decided to end their annual Memorial Day event in Washington D.C. after a disagreement with Pentagon officials over parking issues. Instead, the group decided to fragment the event into various local events next year.
Rolling Thunder’s first ride was to the Vietnam War Memorial in 1987. It was inspired after Ray Manzo, a former United States Marine Corps Corporal, discovered that American servicemen had allegedly been abandoned in Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War was over. Manzo drafted a letter to motorcycling publications; Sgt. Major John Holland, 1st Sgt. Walt Sides, and Sgt. Ted Sampley joined him to found the group. Sampley's colleague, Bob Schmitt, was looking at the Memorial Bridge, imagining the motorcycles going across it, and stated, ""It will be like the sound of rolling thunder coming across the bridge."" Thus the name of the group was born.
On Memorial Day 1988, 2,500 men and women made the trip to Washington D.C.; by 2018, 500,000 motorcyclists reportedly made it there. "
Hamas Admits It Receives Arms And Money From Iran’s Terrorist Regime | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47905/hamas-admits-it-receives-arms-and-money-irans-josh-hammer,"Hamas Admits It Receives Arms And Money From Iran’s Terrorist Regime Ashraf Amra/Anadolu Agency/Gety Images May 31, 2019 views
In an unusually stark and blunt admission this week, Yahya Sinwar, chieftain of the Sunni sharia supremacist death cult Hamas, which was democratically elected to govern the Gaza Strip following Israel's 2005 unilateral withdrawal from the area, openly admitted that the jihadist group takes funding from the terrorist Shiite sharia supremacist regime in Iran.
Per Algemeiner :
The leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip publicly admitted on Thursday that the terrorist group was getting military and financial backing from Iran.
""We have developed our capabilities,"" the Israeli news site Mako quoted Yahya Sinwar saying at a Hamas rally in Gaza, ""and we have received financial and military support from Iran.""
""We will only continue to improve our capabilities,"" he pledged, and admitted, ""If Iran didn’t support us in recent years, we wouldn’t have achieved what we achieved.""
Sinwar stated that the Grad rockets fired at Israel during the latest round of fighting in early May were of ""Iranian manufacture.""
Iran is mainly known for funding Hamas rival Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is a fellow terrorist group also operating in the Gaza Strip. Sunni nations Qatar and Turkey, by contrast, have emerged over the past decade as the chief benefactors of Hamas.
Since its unilateral withdrawal in 2005, Israel has been forced into three full-scale wars with Hamas, which routinely bludgeons Israeli civilians and metropolitan areas with indiscriminately fired terrorist rockets. In a March Daily Wire op-ed, I laid out the case for Israel to utterly destroy Hamas once and for all:
Try as the Israel Defense Forces might to keep on ""mowing the grass"" when the ""infidel""-loathing jihadists of Hamas flare up in impulsive paroxysms of "" anti-Zionism"" Jew-hatred, the status quo in Gaza is completely unsustainable. No other sovereign country on Earth would deal so passively with such a cancerous threat living on its border — with its biggest civilian centers under constant fear of city-wide sirens signaling the incoming threat of crude Iran-manufactured rockets fired haphazardly from a bordering terroristic death cult. Indeed, no sovereign country on Earth should have to deal with such a threat. If the Sinaloa Cartel or Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion ever decided to shoot terrorist rockets at Texan or Arizonan ranchers, the United States would (rightfully) send in M1 Abrams tanks across the Rio Grande tomorrow. ...
It is long past time for the Israeli government to commence a full-on, comprehensive land/air invasion to hunt down and permanently root out every last one of the Hamas leadership there. Israel surely has no interest in formally re-annexing Gaza — calamitous as Sharon's withdrawal was, the Israeli government could not be any less interested in now re-absorbing the radicalized Arab populace there. And while the Israel Defense Forces would no doubt suffer high and tragic casualties as a result of a prolonged land invasion, one is forced to consider the tradeoff of inaction — the continuance of the status quo. And that status quo is truly terrible for all parties involved.
Hamas is merely the Palestinian-Arab branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , which is the preeminent Islamist group in the world and often serves as a ""gateway drug"" for more universally recognized extremist groups such as al-Qaeda, Islamic State, and Jamaat-e-Islami. The Brotherhood's founding Egyptian preacher, Hassan al-Banna, described his ideology thus: ""It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet."" Today, Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, the Brotherhood's spiritual leader who finds a comfortable home surrounded by terror-supporting emirs in Doha, publicly endorses suicide bombings against ""infidels"" such as U.S. soldiers deployed in the Middle East.

Obama’s Pro-Iran Echo Chamber Still Secretly Talks With Terrorist Regime And Insists It’s ‘Normal’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47903/obamas-pro-iran-echo-chamber-still-secretly-talks-josh-hammer,"Obama’s Pro-Iran Echo Chamber Still Secretly Talks With Terrorist Regime And Insists It’s ‘Normal’ Iranian Presidency / Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images May 31, 2019 views
Today, a stunning report in the Daily Beast reveals the depths to which the sycophantic pro-Iran capitulators of the Barack Obama foreign policy apparatus continue to sink to support the terrorist regime that remains the world's number one state sponsor of jihadist exportation.
In unusual journalistic fashion, the Daily Beast anonymously quotes many former Obama administration officials throughout the piece — thus lending cover to those who would openly collude with a brazen American geopolitical foe against the interests of the American people.
Per the Daily Beast:
As the Trump administration sent warplanes and an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, a small group of former Obama administration officials reached out to their contacts in the Iranian government, including Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Their message to Iran: Don’t take Trump’s bait. Stay calm.
Conversations between former Obama officials and Iranian government officials have been ongoing since November 2016. Zarif, who visits the U.S. every year for the U.N. General Assembly in New York, usually meets with lawmakers, think tanks, journalists, and former officials when he is in town.
But the recent round of conversations, which took place over the phone and in person over the last two months, came as lines of communication between the U.S. and Iran, through intermediaries in Europe and elsewhere, deteriorated.
The Daily Beast further noted how the Obama officials seem to have a clear motive: Discerning whether the possibility exists of the U.S. re-entering a new Iran nuclear deal in a post-President Donald Trump world. ""Separately, some former Obama officials are trying to keep the roots of the Iran nuclear deal alive by taking the pulse of lawmakers on Capitol Hill to gauge whether they are in favor of restarting talks in the future,"" the outlet stated.
Conservative, anti-Iran national security hands had a field day with the report.
Omri Ceren, national security advisor for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), tweeted: ""Former Obama officials have been working with Iran and friends on the Hill to isolate the Trump admin. Their most recent contacts were a couple weeks ago. They told [the Daily Beast] that them secretly talking to Iran is 'normal.'""

Foreign policy consultant Jason Epstein tweeted: ""I’m old enough to remember when war veteran Tom Cotton and his GOP colleagues were cursed as 'traitors' for merely penning a letter to Khamenei explaining how the Senate worked.""

Epstein was referring to Cotton's decision to spearhead a March 2015 letter sent, on behalf of 47 total U.S. senators, to the terrorist-supporting ruling mullahs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Quite presciently, the letter noted how the Iran nuclear deal, structured as it was as an ""executive agreement,"" could easily be altered or terminated in the future.
""The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time,"" the letter read. ""We hope this letter enriches your knowledge of our constitutional system and promotes mutual understanding and clarity as nuclear negotiations progress,"" it concluded. "
Feminist Calls Louisiana Dem Governor ‘Misogynist’ For Supporting Pro-Life Bill. She Gets Wrecked. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47848/feminist-calls-louisiana-dem-governor-misogynist-hank-berrien,"Feminist Calls Louisiana Dem Governor ‘Misogynist’ For Supporting Pro-Life Bill. She Gets Wrecked. Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images for 2017 ESSENCE Festival May 30, 2019 views
After news broke the Democratic Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards would break with his party and sign his state’s fetal heartbeat bill into law, one feminist author went ballistic, tweeting that he was an “unrepentant misogynist” and should be expelled from the Democratic Party.
As Sister Toldjah of RedState reports , author Jill Filipovic reacted to a report in Slate that cited AP saying Edwards would sign the bill. After the Louisiana House passed the bill on Wednesday, Edwards stated, “I know there are many who feel just as strongly as I do on abortion and disagree with me — and I respect their opinions. As I prepare to sign this bill, I call on the overwhelming bipartisan majority of legislators who voted for it to join me in continuing to build a better Louisiana that cares for the least among us and provides more opportunity for everyone.”
Filipovic then vented her spleen, tweeting, “No more bigots in the Democratic Party. The tent can’t be so big you allow in unrepentant misogynists who are willing to sign away women’s most basic rights.” No more bigots in the Democratic Party.

Sister Toldjah herself confronted Filipovic, writing, “Stop acting like a total (word that rhymes with witch). Edwards is pro-life because his unborn daughter was diagnosed with spina bifida and they were advised to abort. She's now grown up, married, and a public school counselor. This has nothing to do with ‘misogyny,’ ghoul.” Stop acting like a total (word that rhymes with witch).

This has nothing to do with ""misogyny"", ghoul. https://t.co/zWZ4cX3imr — Sister Toldjah (@sistertoldjah) May 30, 2019
As The Washington Post has noted:
Nearly three decades ago, when Democratic Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards’ wife was 20 weeks pregnant with their first child, a doctor discovered their daughter had spina bifida and encouraged an abortion. The Edwardses refused. Now, daughter Samantha is married and working as a school counselor, and Edwards finds himself an outlier in polarized abortion politics. “My position hasn’t changed. In eight years in the Legislature, I was a pro-life legislator,” he said. When he ran for governor, his view was the same. “I’m as consistent as I can be on that point.”
Sister Toldjah also noted, “Filipovic, by the way, is also the same unhinged feminist who recently suggested that pro-life men should be forced to mutilate their man parts for ‘every pregnancy they create.’ So she’s not exactly playing with a full deck of cards, if you catch my drift.”
When Edwards ran for governor in 2015, he ran a pro-life ad showing him and his wife Donna speaking of their daughter. His wife recalled when she first heard the diagnosis that her daughter had spina bifida and her husband’s subsequent reaction:
I was twenty weeks pregnant with our first child when the doctor discovered she had spina bifida and encouraged me to have an abortion. I was devastated, but John Bel never flinched. He just said, “No. No, we’re gonna love this baby. No matter what. And at that moment, I watched the boy I fell in love with become the man I’m still in love with today. Samantha’s getting married next spring, and she’s living proof that John Bel Edwards lives his values every day.” "
"BREAKING: DOJ Preparing Anti-Trust Probe Of Google Examining ‘Search And Other Businesses,’ Reports Say",www.dailywire.com,admin,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47914/breaking-doj-preparing-anti-trust-probe-google-ryan-saavedra/,"Home / WORLD NEWS / BREAKING: DOJ Preparing Anti-Trust Probe Of Google Examining ‘Search And Other Businesses,’ Reports Say BREAKING: DOJ Preparing Anti-Trust Probe Of Google Examining ‘Search And Other Businesses,’ Reports Say 3 hours ago WORLD NEWS
The U.S. Justice Department is preparing an anti-trust investigation of Google and is expected to examine the tech giant’s “search and other businesses.”
The Federal Trade Commission, which investigated Google several years ago, is deferring the investigation to the DOJ this time, The Wall Street Journal reported.
“With turf now settled, the department is preparing to closely examine Google’s business practices related to its search and other businesses, the people said,” according to The Journal. “It couldn’t immediately be learned whether Google has been contacted by the department. Third-party critics of the search giant, however, already have been in talks with Justice Department officials, some of the people familiar with the matter said.”
“The report comes amid discussion from politicians and the public about whether large technology companies should be broken up,” CNBC reported. “The Justice Department launched a major antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998 that led to several rules the company had to follow for years.”
“Alphabet, which racked up $136.8 billion in revenue in 2018, has faced antitrust pressure in the past,” CNBC added. “In 2010, the company faced antitrust complaints from the European Commission regarding ranking of shopping search results and ads, which resulted in Google paying $2.7 billion in 2017. In 2016, the EC complained of certain Android practices to which the company recognized a charge of $5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2018.”
The Verge noted that Google has dominated “positions in the markets for search engines, web browsers, mobile operating systems, email, and numerous other product categories, all of which aid in its ability to collect data and serve targeted ads.”
President Donald Trump has repeatedly railed against Google, which has been accused by many of having a strong anti-conservative bias.
“Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD,” Trump tweeted. “Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of results on “Trump News” are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!” ….results on “Trump News” are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous.

WATCH: Steven Crowder Responds To Campaign To Get Him Banned From YouTube | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47919/watch-steven-crowder-responds-campaign-get-him-james-barrett,"May 31, 2019 views
On Thursday, Carlos Maza, who writes Vox's ""Strikethrough"" video series, launched a campaign on Thursday to pressure YouTube to ban conservative commentator and comedian Steven Crowder for producing a series of rebuttal videos to ""Strikethrough"" that include mocking references to Maza's identity. In response, YouTube says its now looking into his channel and has reportedly already begun demonitizing some of his videos. On Friday, Crowder responded by condemning this as yet another example of ""corporate censorship"" of a conservative voice and making clear that ""this is a war ... we will fight to the absolute bitter end both legally and publicly.""
Maza — whose Twitter handle is ""GayWonk"" and whose self-description on his account reads ""Marxist pig. Tucker Carlson is a white supremacist."" — issued a series of tweets Thursday complaining that YouTube is allowing Crowder to poke phone at his identity and effectively giving a ""megaphone"" to ""a***holes"" by not enforcing their harassment policies thoroughly enough. Maza also suggests that Crowder is to blame for him getting doxxed last year, which resulted in his phone getting ""bombarded with hundreds of texts at the exact same time"" calling on him to ""debate Steven Crowder"" — an accusation Crowder expressly denies in a video response to Maza's ban campaign posted Friday (video below).
""Since I started working at Vox, Steven Crowder has been making video after video 'debunking' Strikethrough,"" Maza wrote in a series of tweets . ""Every single video has included repeated, overt attacks on my sexual orientation and ethnicity."" As an example, Maza includes a clip of Crowder referring to him as ""gay,"" a ""gay Latino,"" and a ""lispy queer."" ""I've been called an anchor baby, a lispy queer, a Mexican, etc. These videos get millions of views on YouTube. Every time one gets posted, I wake up to a wall of homophobic/racist abuse on Instagram and Twitter. Last year, I got doxxed, and it scared the f*** out of me. My phone was bombarded with hundreds of texts at the exact same time. The messages? ['Debate Steven Crowder.']""
Maza then turns up the pressure on YouTube to ban Crowder: ""I'm f***ing pissed at @YouTube, which claims to support its LGBT creators, and has explicit policies against harassment and bullying: [ see policies here ]. Crowder, claims Maza, is protected because he has 3 million YouTube subscribers, ""and enforcing their rules would get them accused on anti-conservative bias."" Maza insists ""this isn't about 'silencing conservatives,'"" but rather YouTube ""helping incredibly powerful cyberbullies organize and target people they disagree with."" Maza then calls on his supporters to organize and target Crowder by going to his videos and flagging them as harassment. Again, the problem isn't Crowder. There will always be fucking assholes trying to get attention by being bigots. The problem is that @YouTube is designed to give those assholes a megaphone, push new followers in their directions, and keep them listening. It's a weapon. — Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 31, 2019
In response, Crowder fired back in a video on Friday arguing that despite Maza's insistence that he's not trying to silence a conservative, that's exactly what this is about — and YouTube appears to be complying. While Crowder acknowledges that he's made fun of him, he says he didn't do so maliciously and notes that he's a comedian who ""ribs"" everyone. Crowder also stresses that he has always condemned any form of doxxing online and challenges him to find proof.
In the end what this is really about, says Crowder, is ""corporate censorship"": Vox and YouTube working together to silence voices and opinions they don't like. ""This is corporate censorship, and this is yet another giant company trying to lean on this channel, your channel, and the content that you've created,"" he says. ""And this is a war ... we will fight to the absolute bitter end both legally and publicly.""
WATCH:
Crowder has also created a page that provides all of his ""Strikethrough"" rebuttal videos . ""Watch them in full context for yourself, and please note our pesky habit of citing sources to support our facts,"" he notes. "

On Wednesday evening, actor John Cleese, most famous for his work with the comedy troupe Monty Python, which he co-founded, and his work on “Fawlty Towers,” which he co-wrote, suggested on Twitter that his opinion expressed years ago that London was not English anymore was even more true now, connecting it to the fact that Londoners were the most vociferous group in the United Kingdom to favor staying in the European Union.
For his remarks, Cleese was pilloried on social media. Cleese precipitated their outrage by writing, “Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city any more. Since then, virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation So there must be some truth in it... I note also that London was the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU.” Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city any more Since then, virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation So there must be some truth in it...

London mayor Sadiq Khan reacted , ""These comments make John Cleese sound like he's in character as Basil Fawlty.Londoners know that our diversity is our greatest strength. We are proudly the English capital, a European city and a global hub.""
One British TV and radio writer snapped, “Some years ago I said something a bit ignorant and dog-whistly. I hang out with people who are also a bit ignorant and dog-whistly. So it must be correct...

Cleese answered his critics by noting:

Nevis has excellent race relations, a very well educated population, no sign of political correctness … no sign of Rupert Murdoch, conscientious lawyers, a relaxed and humorous life style, a deep love of cricket, and a complete lack of knife crime And, of course, wonderful weather.

In a shockingly anti-Semitic move, a resolution from a California Democratic state assemblyman that links the Israeli government to the October 2018 massacre of 11 Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue will reportedly be considered by members of the California Democratic party.
Fox News reports, “The document was one of a slew of secretive, unpublished proposals obtained by Fox News that are slated for debate beginning Friday morning … Tentatively titled ‘Commending the House for resolving to fight all racism and bigotry and for resisting the false conflation of support for Palestinian rights with antisemitism,’ the resolution blasting Israel's purported role in furthering white supremacy was authored by David Mandel, an elected state Assembly delegate and progressive attorney … ""
Fox News continues, “The document calls the October synagogue shooting ‘the culmination of an alarming re-emergence of virulent antisemitism that is a core element of historical and currently resurgent white supremacism in the United States and around the world.’ The ‘Israeli government, along with some of its U.S. backers,’ the resolution continues, ‘welcomed support from Christian fundamentalist and ultra-right groups in the United States and abroad, dangerously ignoring their deeply rooted antisemitism while aligning with their virulent Islamophobia.’""
Mandel told Fox News, ""The Israeli government and its supporters here seem to be embracing the right-wing and not caring what they say about anything else — Islamophobia, dog whistles for anti-Semitism. That, I think, does indirectly lead to some of the violence … What we're saying is the Israeli government is aligning itself with right-wing governments around the world, including in this country, and those right-wing groups — a core tenet of their ideology is antisemitism.""
Mandel boasted, ""Most of the 3,000 or 4,000 delegates at the convention will agree with us, but that doesn't mean we're going to succeed in passing the resolution.""
Mandel has written on his Facebook site, where a picture of Bernie Sanders is featured, “I frequently advocate at the Capitol for progressive measures of all sorts and against attacks on protected speech, particularly regarding the exceptionalism with which Israel is treated – and Palestinians mistreated. I also work with Jewish Voice for Peace, the National Lawyers Guild and DSA.” His leftist, anti-capitalist perspective is reflected thus: “Together with allies statewide, I’ll fight to make the party more representative, vibrant, small-d democratic and progressive. The goal is not to elect more opportunists who call themselves Democrats; it's to ally with grassroots progressive social movements throughout the state and country to build a majority for comprehensive transformation to an anti-racist, non-sexist, post-carbon, post-capitalist and peaceful world.”
Mandel said that he created some of his leftist resolutions jointly with Chris Yatooma, Kari Khoury, Yassar Dahbour, Iyad Afalqa, and Murad Sarama, calling it a ""team effort.""
Fox News notes, “In 2017, Mandel hastily negotiated with the Rules Committee to secure passage of an unprecedented resolution condemning what it characterized as the U.S. support for Israeli 'occupation of the Palestinian lands,' and opposing crackdowns on economic boycotts of Israel.”
Another resolution reportedly to be considered by the Democrats complains about the ""untenable status quo – rocket firings into Israel from Gaza, regular air and artillery bombardment of Gaza neighborhoods, and sniper shootings of unarmed civilians at the fence, with hundreds of Palestinians killed and thousands wounded since March 2018.""

The New York Times has started cracking down on the shows that its reporters can appear on as the newspaper has recently decided to ban reporters from multiple shows on hyper-partisan cable news networks CNN and MSNBC.
Vanity Fair reported that New York Times finance editor David Enrich recently had to cancel an appearance on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" because the newspaper ""was wary of how viewers might perceive a down-the-middle journalist like Enrich talking politics"" with a hyper-partisan host like Maddow.
Vanity Fair noted that MSNBC's ""The Last Word With Lawrence O'Donnell"" and CNN's ""CNN Tonight"" with host Don Lemon are also blacklisted by The Times for being too partisan.
""Sources told the magazine the Times' executive editor Dean Baquet expressed concerns certain primetime shows are becoming more opinionated and that reporters who appear on their shows would be 'perceived as being aligned' with the show's politics,"" Fox News reported . ""Both MSNBC and CNN have hired several prominent New York Times reporters as contributors in recent years, but it is unclear from the Vanity Fair report if they would be discouraged from appearing on shows deemed 'too partisan.'""
The decision by The Times comes a few weeks after Special Counsel Robert Mueller released the report from his Russia investigation, which largely contradicted much of Maddow's programming from the last two years.
Maddow, in particular, saw a massive decline in ratings, losing ""half-a-million viewers in just one week after special counsel Robert Mueller’s report indicated that he did not find enough evidence to support collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,"" The Daily Caller reported .
CNN's ratings were so devastated following Attorney General William Barr's letter to Congress that Fox News host Tucker Carlson beat CNN's entire prime time lineup combined by more than 1,000,000 viewers.
Maddow faced widespread criticism over many of the salacious and unverified claims she pushed on her show during Mueller's investigation.
Reporter Aaron Maté documented dozens of Maddow's wild claims following the release of Barr's letter to Congress:

Ocasio-Cortez: Guaranteed Housing Comes Before A Person’s ‘Privilege To Earn A Profit’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47910/ocasio-cortez-guaranteed-housing-comes-persons-ryan-saavedra,"May 31, 2019 views
Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) demanded at a town hall event in the Bronx on Thursday that everybody be given ""access"" to guaranteed homes before anyone is allowed the ""privilege to earn a profit.""
""We have to make sure that housing is being legislated as a human right,"" Ocasio-Cortez arrogantly stated. ""What does that mean? What it means is that our access and our ability and our guarantee to having a home comes before someone else’s privilege to earn a profit.""
The 29-year-old former bartender said that the tax code needed to be changed, saying that the government needs to remove ""tax breaks for bad behavior.""
""I want to make sure that we connect some dots because when we introduced the Green New Deal we were saying what is a girl from the Bronx doing and talked about environmentalism that doesn't make any sense, right?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Wrong. Because one of the big things that we talked about was that we need to clean our buildings. ... When we talk about our right to a clean home, when we talk about retrofitting buildings, what we're talking about is cleaning our air and cleaning our water because when we talk about what housing as a right means, it doesn't mean that you have a right to four crumbling walls and a dirty floor.""
""What it means is that we all have a right to dignified housing, good heat, responsible structures, low noise, clean air, and clean water at an affordable price! At an affordable price!"" Ocasio-Cortez ranted.
Ocasio-Cortez then documented getting her luxury apartment in Washington, D.C.
""I come into this building and it's marketed a luxury building in D.C., right?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""I move into this luxury building in D.C. and what does it have? It's an efficient building, it's clean, it has public space, it has a rooftop garden, y'all watch my Instagram, it has all of these things, it has clean air, it has clean water.""
""And I think about this and I'm like this is what a luxury building is like, right?"" Ocasio-Cortez added. ""What we have been taught that is a luxury, should not be a luxury."" "
WALSH: Illinois Is Set To Repeal Its Ban On Partial Birth Abortion. Here's How That Barbaric Procedure Is Done. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47907/walsh-illinois-set-repeal-its-ban-partial-birth-matt-walsh,"May 31, 2019 views
The Illinois state House this week passed a radical pro-abortion bill that would legalize abortion through every stage of pregnancy and officially codify the dehumanization of the unborn into law. It would also eliminate spousal consent and require insurance companies to cover abortion. Under this law, a woman would have the right to kill her child at any point in pregnancy, for any reason, regardless of the father's wishes, and regardless of her ability to pay. And that's not even the most extreme aspect of the legislation.
Democrats in Illinois felt it necessary to go several steps further and repeal the state's ban on partial birth abortion. This should not immediately result in any partial birth abortions actually taking place, as the federal ban on the practice remains, for now, intact, but it is bad enough that Democrats want this unthinkable barbarism to be legal. It is increasingly clear that Democrats will get rid of the federal ban if ever they have enough power to do so. When that day comes, here is a description of the procedure that will be performed legally in Illinois and probably several other states:
A fully developed and viable infant child is pulled feet-first out of the womb with forceps. The baby is delivered until just his head remains lodged in the birth canal while the rest of his body dangles out. The child at this point is alive and moving. He has been almost completely delivered. A pair of scissors are then jammed into the base of his skull. The child has a fully functioning nervous system so he will feel the indescribable pain of sharpened metal piercing through his tiny neck. A vacuum tube is shoved into the hole and his brains are sucked out of his head while he's still alive. His collapsed skull is then pulled out of the vagina and the child's corpse is thrown in the garbage.
This is what Democrats in Illinois support.
Any decent human being can see that this is savagery. You do not need to be right-wing or conservative to oppose sucking the brains out of infants. You merely need to be a human being. Only a soulless animal could possibly look with approval on such a practice. There are a lot of soulless animals in the Democrat Party, unfortunately. In fact, I doubt you'd find even as many as ten Democrats on Capitol Hill who would come out against it. And that is a fact that Republicans should be obsessively highlighting from now until 2020 and beyond.
There was quite a lot of hand wringing and bellyaching over the ""extremism"" of Alabama's law, which prohibits abortion in almost every case. Well whether that was extreme or not — and it wasn't, it was just morally and intellecutally consistent — it certainly does not come close to the extremism of crushing an infant's skull 10 seconds before birth. Indeed, the word extremism doesn't do it justice. This is ghastly. Beastly. Demonic. And, for the modern Democratic Party, mainstream. "
"Sophie Turner Vows To Never Work In Anti-Abortion States, Gets Asked About Where 'Game Of Thrones' Was Filmed | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47891/sophie-turner-vows-never-work-anti-abortion-states-james-barrett,"Abortion DailyWire.com Sophie Turner Vows To Never Work In Anti-Abortion States, Gets Asked About Where 'Game Of Thrones' Was Filmed Charles McQuillan/Getty Images May 31, 2019 views
The Hollywood boycott of states with highly restrictive abortion laws is continuing to pick up steam, with dozens of high-profile stars signing on to a pro-life state boycott, pledging not to work in states like Georgia that have passed ""heartbeat bills"" banning abortion after a heartbeat is detected. But some of those stars are being called out for their willingness to film in countries that have even more stringent abortion laws than the states they're now boycotting.
Among those officially joining the boycott movement are Jessica Chastain and Sophie Turner, who are co-starring in the upcoming X-Men film ""Dark Phoenix."" In an interview with Sky News published Wednesday, Chastain and Turner announced that they both signed a letter along with dozens of their colleagues pledging to boycott pro-life states.
""There's a letter going around that I signed saying I'm not going to work in any state that denies rights for women, for the LGBTQ community, for anyone,"" Chastain told Sky News. ""I'm not going to work in a state that discriminates.""
""I signed it too,"" said Turner. ""I have yet to tell my agents I signed it. They're going to be like: 'What? You can't work in these states?' Yeah, I can't work in these states.""
Turner was then asked about her willingness to work for years on ""Game of Thrones,"" most of which was filmed in Northern Ireland — ""where women can face life in jail for aborting a pregnancy,"" Sky News notes.
Turner didn't try to reconcile the conflict; instead, she just expressed relief that the show is over. ""There was a lot of work of 'Game Of Thrones' there, so luckily we're moving on,"" she said.
As highlighted by HuffPost a couple of weeks ago amid outrage over Alabama's abortion bill, Northern Ireland, where a majority of the HBO series was filmed, ""has some of the most restrictive abortion laws of any developed nation"":
Under no circumstances except to preserve the woman’s physical and mental health are abortions legal in Northern Ireland. And while the Alabama law penalizes doctors who perform abortion, threatening them with up to 99 years or life behind bars, Northern Ireland penalizes both the doctors and the women who terminate their pregnancies. Both can face life in prison.
The boycott movement supported by Turner and Chastain would particularly impact Georgia, which has become the third-largest film production state in the country and brought in some $2.7 billion in direct revenue through the film industry last year. Along with three other states, including Alabama, Georgia has recently passed a law protecting unborn children from abortion when a heartbeat is detectable, which can be as early as six weeks into the pregnancy.
The pro-life state boycott movement is gaining momentum, with help from Netflix, Disney, NBCUniversal, CBS, Showtime, and WarnerMedia, who have all threatened to take action against abortion-restricting states. But, like Turner, some of these companies are facing uncomfortable questions about their willingness to film in places with highly restrictive abortion laws.
As The Daily Wire reports, Netflix is particularly getting hammered: ""The very same week that Netflix threatened Georgia, the company began working on its third Arabic original, titled 'Paranormal,' which will, of course, be produced in Egypt. ... As many as three Netflix original series are shot in the Middle East, two of which are produced in Jordan – 'Jinn' and 'Al Rawabi School for Girls.'"" Jordan (where parts of ""Aladdin"" were filmed) restricts abortion in nearly all cases except when the life or mental health of the mother is at risk; those who violate the law face imprisonment. Egypt likewise bans abortion in nearly all cases. "

At roughly 4 p.m. on Friday, a gunman who was reportedly an employee of the Virginia Beach Municipal Center in Virginia, entered Building 2, which includes offices for planning and public works and is adjacent to City Hall, and opened fire. By the end of the incident, he had killed 11 victims and he was killed in a gunfight with police, according to police.
Six more people were injured and taken to a hospital, according to Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera, who added that one injured victim was a Virginia Beach Police officer wearing a bulletproof vest.
The suspect was killed after engaging with police officers, according to Cervera. He stated:
We do know that shortly after 4 p.m., the suspect entered building 2; he is a long-time employee of public utilities, I will not release his name at this time, and he immediately began to indiscriminately fire on all the victims. Officers entered once the call went out, the officers were at headquarters, they responded to building 2; they secured as much of the victims as they could, and then they engaged with the suspect. The suspect did shoot a police officer; officers returned fire; suspect is deceased. While the scene is secure, we have a long-term investigative process that’s being undertaken right now. There’s a lot of work to be done; it’s still an active scene. We are being assisted due to the size and scope and intensity of this scene, we are being assisted by the FBI Forensics Unit, DHS Forensics Unit, and the Virginia State Police Forensics Unit.
Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer told a press conference, “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach. The people involved are our friends, co-workers, neighbors, colleagues. “ "

Witherspoon has remained relatively apolitical throughout her career, though she has identified herself as a “feminist” and has been vocal in supporting “Time’s Up” — a movement advocating for females’ equal pay and representation in Hollywood.
Speaking to Glamour, Witherspoon said she’s a feminist, in part, because sexuality is never shameful. “A big part of when I read Cheryl Strayed’s book 'Wild,' was how she dealt with her own sexuality,” she said. “And kind of gave herself an opportunity to forgiver herself. Every choice and decision that you make, bad good, right or wrong, it’s part of your life. And it’s part of defining who you are, and building character, and becoming the woman that you want to be.” "
WILLIAMS: Slavery Is Neither Strange Nor Peculiar | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Walter E.

The favorite leftist tool for the attack on our nation's founding is that slavery was sanctioned. They argue that the founders disregarded the promises of our Declaration of Independence ""that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" These very ignorant people, both in and out of academia, want us to believe that slavery is unusual, as historian Kenneth Stampp suggested in his book, ""Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South."" But slavery is by no means peculiar, odd, unusual or unique to the U.S.
As University of Nebraska-Lincoln political science professor David P. Forsythe wrote in his book, ""The Globalist,"" ""The fact remained that at the beginning of the nineteenth century an estimated three-quarters of all people alive were trapped in bondage against their will either in some form of slavery or serfdom."" Slavery was common among ancient peoples — Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Greeks, Persians, Armenians and many others. Large numbers of Christians were enslaved during the Ottoman wars in Europe. White slaves were common in Europe from the Dark Ages to the Middle Ages. It was only during the 17th century that the Atlantic slave trade began with Europeans assisted by Arabs and Africans.
Slavery is one of the most horrible injustices. It posed such a moral dilemma at our 1787 Constitutional Convention that it threatened to scuttle the attempt to create a union between the 13 colonies. Let's look at some of the debate. George Washington, in a letter to Pennsylvania delegate Robert Morris, wrote, ""There is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of it."" In a Constitutional Convention speech, James Madison said, ""We have seen the mere distinction of color made in the most enlightened period of time, a ground of the most oppressive dominion ever exercised by man over man."" In James Madison's records of the Convention he wrote, ""(The Convention) thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in men.""
John Jay, in a letter to R. Lushington: ""It is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished. The honour of the States, as well as justice and humanity, in my opinion, loudly call upon them to emancipate these unhappy people. To contend for our own liberty, and to deny that blessing to others, involves an inconsistency not to be excused."" Patrick Henry said, ""I believe a time will come when an opportunity will be offered to abolish this lamentable evil."" George Mason said, ""The augmentation of slaves weakens the states; and such a trade is diabolical in itself, and disgraceful to mankind.""
Northern delegates to the Convention, and others who opposed slavery, wanted to count only free people of each state to determine representation in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College. Southern delegates wanted to count slaves just as any other person. That would have given slave states greater representation in the House and the Electoral College. If slaveholding states could not have counted slaves at all, the Constitution would not have been ratified and there would not be a union. The compromise was for slaves to be counted as three-fifths of a person when deciding representation in the House of Representatives and Electoral College.
My question for those who condemn the Three-Fifths Compromise is: Would blacks have been better off if northern convention delegates stuck to their guns, not compromising, and a union had never been formed? To get a union, the northern delegates begrudgingly accepted slavery. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass understood the compromise, saying that the three-fifths clause was ""a downright disability laid upon the slaveholding states"" that deprived them of ""two-fifths of their natural basis of representation.""
Here's my hypothesis about people who use slavery to trash the founders: They have contempt for our constitutional guarantees of liberty. Slavery is merely a convenient moral posturing tool they use in their attempt to reduce respect for our Constitution.

MALKIN: Revoke Ilhan Omar's Marriage Fraud Immunity Card | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Michelle Malkin,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47923/malkin-revoke-ilhan-omars-marriage-fraud-immunity-michelle-malkin,"June 1, 2019 views
If you are not a member of the Democrats' protected class of bitter loudmouths who hate America, you can be investigated and prosecuted for marriage fraud. The headlines have been filled with recent crackdowns.
In Texas last week, 96 people were indicted on federal charges of conspiring to defraud our immigration system by arranging phony unions between American citizens and sham spouses in Vietnam.
In Bridgeport, Connecticut, three men pleaded guilty to participating in fraudulent marriages with noncitizens and sponsoring them for green cards under false pretenses.
At Fort Bragg in North Carolina last month, two soldiers and two African immigrants were indicted by a grand jury related to a scheme involving an entire ring of service members who attempted to match female soldiers with foreigners from Ghana and Nigeria. They each face between 15-35 years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines each.
In Alabama, an Indian national pleaded guilty to arranging 80 fake marriages using U.S. citizen recruits to bail out Indian foreign nationals who had overstayed their visas or Student Exchange Visitor Program requirements.
You wouldn't know it from the radio silence of Democratic leaders regarding radioactive Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar's long-festering and bizarre bigamy scheme (which she still refuses to address), but marriage fraud is a federal felony. As the Department of Homeland Security makes clear, it is a serious crime — not a victimless, harmless infraction — that ""weakens our nation's security and makes us less safe.""
No kidding. I have long documented the national security consequences of marriage fraud by deadly jihadists:
Eight Mideastern men who plotted to bomb New York landmarks in 1993 all obtained green cards and permanent legal residence by marrying U.S. citizens.
El Sayyid A. Nosair put a ring on American Karen Ann Mills Sweeney's finger to avoid deportation for overstaying his visa. He acquired U.S. citizenship, allowing him to remain in the country, and was later convicted for conspiracy in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that claimed six lives.
Top Osama bin Laden aide Ali Mohamed became a U.S. citizen after marrying a woman he met on a plane trip from Egypt to New York. He was convicted for his role in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Africa that killed 12 Americans and more than 200 others.
A year after 9/11, Homeland Security officials cracked a vast Middle Eastern marriage-fraud ring for illegal immigrants in ""Operation Broken Vows"" that stretched from Boston to South Carolina to California.
Faisal Shahzad, the 2010 Times Square bomb plotter, married an American woman, Huma Mian, in 2008 after spending a decade in the country on foreign student and employment visas.
Anyone capable of and willing to lie to federal officials in face-to-face interviews, falsify government forms under penalty of perjury, and conspire to undermine the integrity of our immigration system is a threat to our country. Terrorism is not the only concern. Other complex criminal organizations are often involved. Even nations governed by open borders loons like Canada's Justin Trudeau take marriage fraud seriously. Last week, the government moved to strip a Chinese national of his fraudulently acquired Canadian citizenship after paying a woman $5,000 to enter a sham marriage.
We have enough native-born scam artists and fraudsters without having to import more from around the world. But you know what's even more of an insult than an ordinary foreign marriage faker? An entitled, arrogant and unrepentant marriage faker hiding behind the ""Islamophobia"" and ""sexism"" cards. Yes, I'm looking at you, Omar.
Investigations dating back to 2016 by blogger Scott Johnson of Power Line (which recently celebrated 15 years in the blogosphere), David North of the Center for Immigration Studies, Alpha News reporter Preya Samsundar and PJMedia.com reporter David Steinberg have determined that the outspoken Somalian Muslim refugee likely married her own brother named Ahmed Elmi in 2009 for some unknown ill-gotten gain while still informally married to the man she calls her husband and father of her three children, Ahmed Hirsi. After a Somalian website floated questions about the marriage arrangement with Elmi and Johnson's initial reporting broke into the local news, Omar sought to divorce Elmi. Her use of $6,000 in state campaign funds, some of which went to pay a personal divorce lawyer, is currently under state investigation.
Social media posts, photographic evidence and publicly available biographical data strongly suggest that Elmi (now living in London) and Omar are siblings with the same father. Many of the pair's Instagram and Facebook comments to each other have been deleted. Omar's staff and lawyer have rebuked questions about the arrangement as ""categorically ridiculous and false"" and suggested that truth-seekers in the matter are ""people who do not want an East African, Muslim woman elected to office."" For good measure, Omar has decried ""Trump-style misogyny, racism, anti-immigration rhetoric and Islamophobic division.""
Hey, I'm not the one who bragged last week that Omar, a naturalized American citizen, brought ""the perspective of a foreigner"" to her role on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. That was Rep. Omar. Perhaps she'll share her ""foreign perspective"" on how any other sane nation would handle an elected official who won't answer questions about possible felony immigration fraud while sitting on a sensitive legislative panel. I'm all ears.

She Claimed She Was Sexually Assaulted And Kidnapped. Now She’s Being Charged With Lying To Police. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47930/she-claimed-she-was-sexually-assaulted-and-ashe-schow,"DailyWire.com She Claimed She Was Sexually Assaulted And Kidnapped. Now She’s Being Charged With Lying To Police. Jantanee Phoolmas June 1, 2019 views
A Boise, Idaho, woman has been charged with lying to police after claiming a strange man climbed into her car in a parking lot and forced her to drive to another location, where he raped her.
On May 1, Patricia Crosby-White, 24, told police that she was sitting in her car in a parking lot when a man she did not know “forced his way into her vehicle,” KTVB reported . The man, who Crosby-White claimed was wearing a holster and may have potentially had a gun, then forced who drive somewhere else. There, she said, he raped her, before having her drive back to the parking lot and leaving her vehicle.
After her accusation, police reviewed surveillance video of the area and found a photo of a man, who Crosby-White identified as her attacker. Police, according to KTVB, asked the public to help identify the man, which they did. Police found the man and spoke to him. During their interview, police learned that the man knew Crosby-White and that the couple had planned to meet in that parking lot.
Police provided prosecutors with “surveillance videos, witness interviews, social media records and other electronic messages,” relating to the case, according to KTVB. Prosecutors declined to charge the man and instead charged Crosby-White with a misdemeanor for lying to police. Because she was charged with only a misdemeanor, she was not arrested and will only receive a summons to appear in court.
The man’s identity, thankfully, was not revealed to the public. Women who make false accusations against men rarely receive any real punishment.
In January, State University of New York student Nikole P. Tucker accused a man with whom she had consensual sex of rape and was charged with only a misdemeanor . In June of last year, 21-year-old Mary Zolkowski was charged with lying about being raped in a parking lot at Delta College. She spent 45 days in jail for her crime. She could have been sentenced to up to four years and a $2,000 fine. Had the man whom she accused been convicted thanks to her false testimony, he could have faced decades in prison.
In August 2015, University of Arkansas student Lindsey Sweetin claimed she was sexually assaulted in a parking garage, but surveillance video proved she was lying. She was actually charged with a felony . It is unclear what punishment she received.
Then there’s Nikki Yovino, the most famous recent example of a woman lying about sexual assault. She was sentenced to a year in prison (one of the longest sentences I’ve ever seen for a false accusation, even though the women are often attempting to ruin another person’s life with their claims) and is being sued by the men she falsely accused.
The examples above don’t seem to have an effect on feminists claiming “women never lie.” This lie, along with the intellectually dishonest claim that prosecuting women who lie will keep women who tell the truth from coming forward, help fuel false accusations. When the punishment is minimal (or nonexistent) what’s to stop someone? "
"Mueller Report Edited Conversation Between Trump, Flynn Lawyers. The Transcript Was Just Released. | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47927/mueller-report-edited-conversation-between-trump-ashe-schow,"Mueller Report Edited Conversation Between Trump, Flynn Lawyers. The Transcript Was Just Released. Drew Angerer/Getty Images June 1, 2019 views
The final report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller contains an edited transcript from a voicemail left by an attorney for President Donald Trump to an attorney for former national security adviser Lieutenant Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.).
John Dowd, an attorney for Trump, left a voicemail for Rob Kelner, Flynn’s attorney in November 2017.
In Mueller’s report , this voicemail is selectively edited to give the impression that Trump’s attorney was asking Flynn’s attorney for information that might hurt the president while reminding the attorney about what Trump has said about Flynn:
I understand your situation, but let me see if I can't state it in starker terms. . . . [I]t wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with ... the government. ... [I]f . .. there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue, . . . so, you know, . . . we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can .... [R]emember what we've always said about the ' President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains ....
This makes it seem like the president’s counsel was trying to obstruct justice, or at the very least, hide something damaging to Trump.
The actual transcript of this voicemail has now been released, and shows what Mueller left out:
Hey, Rob, uhm, this is John again. Uh, maybe, I-I-I-'m-I'm sympathetic; I understand your situation, but let me see if I can't ... state it in ... starker terms. If you have ... and it wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh ... I understand that you can't join the joint defense; so that's one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there's information that ... implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don't know ... some issue, we got to-we got to deal with, not only for the President, but for the country. So ... uh ... you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of ... protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any ... confidential information. So, uhm, and if it's the former, then, you know, remember what we've always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains, but — Well, in any event, uhm, let me know, and, uh, I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, Pal.
The Mueller report left out the part where Trump’s attorney specifically asked for information that was not confidential. Mueller’s report strings along sections of the voicemail to give one impression.
This is the second example of selective editing in the Mueller report that we know about so far. The Daily Wire previously reported that important context was left out of a text-message exchange between former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and a Georgian-American businessman. The businessman, Giorgi Rtskhiladze, sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr demanding a footnote be retracted from the Mueller report misrepresenting his conversation. "
Adam Schiff Demands Materials From Probe Into Russia-Collusion Investigation | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47928/adam-schiff-demands-materials-probe-russia-ashe-schow,"Adam Schiff Demands Materials From Probe Into Russia-Collusion Investigation Mario Tama/Getty Images June 1, 2019 views
If Donald Trump or Devin Nunes were doing this, it would be considered obstruction or intimidation.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has sent a letter to the heads of various U.S. intelligence agencies demanding they turn over materials that are being sent to the Department of Justice as it reviews the origins of the FBI investigation in Trump’s 2016 campaign. Schiff sent the letter to Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, according to CNN .
Schiff called Trump’s May 23, 2019 directive to the agencies ordering them to assist in the review “a disturbing effort by the President and the Attorney General to politicize the Intelligence Community and law enforcement, and raises grave concerns about inappropriate and misleading disclosures of classified information and IC sources and methods for political ends.
That’s a rich accusation coming from Schiff, who acted as a sieve for confidential information during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election.
Schiff worries in his letter that the investigation and directive, which may declassify information relating to how the investigation in Trump’s campaign began, “threatens national security by subverting longstanding rules and practices that obligate you and other heads of IC agencies to safeguard sources and methods and prevent the politicization of intelligence and law enforcement.”
He called the move “unnecessary,” and claimed Barr’s review didn’t require such declassification of IC methods.
The problem here, is that the IC community and law enforcement were politicized by the Obama administration, which used them to spy on the Trump campaign. It was Hillary Clinton’s campaign that paid for the dossier from ex-British Intelligence officer Christopher Steele (then working as an opposition researcher) that was included as evidence to obtain warrants against Trump campaign officials. Barr is trying to reveal that politicization.
It’s telling that Schiff does not want this information revealed.
Schiff also said in his letter that his committee would “conduct rigorous, ongoing oversight” of the intelligence agencies “and others in the IC to ensure that the Attorney General does not abuse his new and sweeping authority.” Schiff, of course, attempted at every turn to stop former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) from doing the same of Mueller’s investigation.
If anyone is at risk for revealing classified information, it’s Schiff. The California congressman is known for leaving behind-closed-door meetings with congressional witnesses to leak information from those meetings to CNN. Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) said Schiff left during Donald Trump, Jr’s testimony often. Shortly after, CNN would have a “scoop” on what was being said in the meeting.
Donny Ferguson, who worked for former congressman Steve Stockman, said Schiff did the same thing during closed-door Benghazi hearings.
Schiff is now demanding an “in-person briefing” from the heads of U.S. intelligence agencies to explain what has been requested of them during the DOJ investigation and to provide his committee with all the materials that have been requested or delivered as part of the review. He also demanded they inform his committee of any impending declassification requested by the DOJ. "
Extreme Abortion Bill Passes Illinois State Senate; Governor Expected To Sign | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47931/extreme-abortion-bill-passes-illinois-state-senate-frank-camp,"Extreme Abortion Bill Passes Illinois State Senate; Governor Expected To Sign MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images June 1, 2019 views
On Friday, the Illinois state Senate voted 34-20 to pass the ""Reproductive Health Act."" The legislation already passed the state House, as The Daily Wire previously reported , and will now head to the desk of Governor J.B. Pritzker, who is expected to sign it into law.
The following are several pertinent portions of the "" Reproductive Health Act "" text:
This act sets forth the fundamental rights of individuals to make autonomous decisions about one’s own reproductive health, including the fundamental right to use or refuse reproductive health care.
This includes ... the fundamental right of an individual who becomes pregnant to continue the pregnancy and give birth to a child, or to have an abortion, and to make autonomous decisions about how to exercise that right.
This act restricts the ability of the state to deny, interfere with, or discriminate against these fundamental rights...
A fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights under the laws of the state...
Except as otherwise provided in this section, no individual or group policy of accident and health insurance that provides pregnancy related benefits may be issued, amended, delivered, or renewed in the State after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly unless the policy provides a covered person with coverage for abortion care.
In a 13-page document , the Thomas More Society condemns the legislation, and breaks down what each component means.
The legislation would eliminate the Abortion Performance Refusal Act , which states that ""no physician, nurse or other person who refuses to recommend, perform or assist in the performance of an abortion ... shall be liable to any person for damages allegedly arising from such refusal,"" and provides financial penalties for those who would discriminate against individuals who refused to participate in an abortion procedure.
The legislation would also compel insurance plans to provide ""coverage for abortion care,"" and make regulating abortion clinics much more difficult.
The legislation would repeal the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act , which states that ""any person who knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus or infant is guilty of a Class 4 felony."" The law defines a partial-birth abortion as ""an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living human fetus or infant before killing the fetus or infant and completing the delivery.""
The Thomas More Society concludes by stating that the ""Reproductive Health Act is an extreme bill that would basically enshrine abortion as a positive good in Illinois law.""
After the news broke that the Illinois state Senate passed the RHA, abortion advocates across the country cheered, and pro-life organizations sent out messages of condemnation.
The Illinois chapter of NARAL tweeted: The IL legislature just passed the Reproductive Health Act!

REPORT: Radical Muslims Suspected In May Attacks On Nigerian Christians | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Jacob Airey,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47897/report-radical-muslims-suspected-may-attacks-jacob-airey,"May 31, 2019 views Earlier this week, Christians traveling home following church services near the city of Jos, Nigeria were ambushed by terrorists who murdered at least thirty congregants. The Sun of Nigeria reports that the violence erupted in communities of Dutse Uku, Angwan Rukuba, and Rikkos, in the Nigerian state of Plateau. “We have received reports of tension around Dutse Uku, Rikkos, Cele Bridge and we have mobilized our personnel to the area,” Police Public Relation Officer DSP Mathias Terna Tyopev told The Sun. “As we speak, the Area Commander, Jos Metropolis is there on the ground. We are still on the trouble spots to bring the situation under control, I can’t guarantee you that I will issue a statement today but until I return from the area.” Locals have accused radical Islamic Fulani herdsmen of attacking the Christian communities in their ongoing plan to create a “Fulanisation and Islamization” in the African nation. Jos city pastor Luke Shehu told Morning Star News , “Despite the intervention of security operatives, in less than twelve hours about thirty Christians were killed and over twenty houses where burnt or destroyed by Muslim militia, some in military uniforms from around Tina junction, Cele bridge, Dutse Uku, and Nasarawa areas, all bordering Muslim communities in Jos North.” He continued, “These targeted attacks on innocent Christians are unacceptable, particularly with confirmed arrests of over thirty Christian women fruit and food vendors by soldiers around Tina junction in Jos after the attack today, 27th May 2019.” This comes on the heels of seven Christians being kidnapped from choir practice at the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) in the village of Dankande in Nigeria's Kaduna state, which saw at least one congregant murdered. An unidentified witness told Sahara Reporters , “As we were in the church, the armed men numbering over twenty just surrounded the church and started shooting. Everybody was terrified but there was no how we could run because they had already surrounded the church.” Rev. Nathaniel Waziri confirmed that minister Zakariya Ido was taken with his daughter and fifteen other worshippers, including ten women and five men. “The gunmen came and asked everyone in the church to surrender phones and thereafter demanded the whereabout of the pastor,” he told Morning Star News . “After threatening the choristers, they became afraid and showed them the pastor’s house.” Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has responded to the attacks by purposing an executive order that would revoke gun licenses, but many Christians see this as an attempt to disarm them in the face of heavily armed radical Muslim. One survivor of the attacks, identified only as Aisha , told Christian persecution watchdog group Open Doors that she and others have been sexually assaulted during the ongoing struggle. “And, as I said before, Iʼm not the only one in my community — many other women have been raped. We are weak, as women,” Aisha said. “We do not have strength to fight back, and the attackers have [a] great advantage over us. We are not [educated] and don’t have the money to reach out and tell the world what is happening.” She added, “Continue to pray for us. Pray also for me. I really want to go to school. I was in school before. I dropped out because of finances. Iʼm not going to school, and my children are not going to school. If thereʼs one thing I desire in this life, it is to go back to school. I want my children to have an education. Please pray for that.” "

We have one answer to your bad hair days or NO hair days. #alopecia @rachelfleit ... wraps! (oh, it’s been around for thousands of years...)
Fleit shared the same photo with the caption: ""Turban tutorial with the incomparable @selmablair""
Shortly after the post went live, accusations of ""cultural appropriation"" rolled in.
Fatforestgoddess wrote: ""You are so wonderful and I know you mean no harm, but this is serious cultural appropriation. I’d be happy to have a private conversation about how this is hurtful to Sikhs if you're open to it.""
A number of commenters dragged Fatforestgoddess:
""I’ve been scrolling and scrolling for someone to say this. Still looking for an offended Sikh.""
""So nobody else on the planet can wear a head wrap except Sikhs? Wow.""
""Are you Sikh? Because assuming you know what is and isn’t hurtful to Sikhs is offensive as well.""
Joseph.a91 wrote: ""This cultural accessory is very significant and precious to Sikh people. They even get bullied for it. Some are victims of racism and you’re wearing this as a fashion statement because you’re having a bad hair day? This is very, very alarming and ignorant. Don’t get me wrong. You have a great heart, my mother is struggling with a neurodegenerative disease and I feel for you. But this picture is beyond pathetic and it is disappointing.""
Despite receiving significant pushback from other users, Joseph.a91 continued to defend his remarks.
Blair later responded:

Blair interacted with quite a few commentators and even posted a second photo of herself wearing the head wrap — this time with her son Arthur. "

But just hours earlier, Trump posted a tweet on Twitter that prompted the New York Times to declare ""Trump Admits to Russia ‘Helping Me to Get Elected’.""
""President Trump on Thursday acknowledged for the first time that Russia helped 'me to get elected,' and then quickly retracted the idea,"" the Times wrote. ""The original comment, a clause in one of several Twitter posts this morning, is an extraordinary admission from Mr. Trump, who has avoided saying publicly that Russia helped him win the presidency in 2016 through its election interference.""

In his statement on Wednesday, former special counsel Robert Mueller said there were two prime allegations his team investigated.
""As alleged by the grand jury in an indictment, Russian intelligence officers who were part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system,"" he said. ""The indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information, and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks. The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate. And at the same time as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment, a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to influence an — an election.""
Mueller never said in his statement whether his team of investigators proved the allegations, instead making the bulk of his comments about alleged obstruction. But he finished with this: ""I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments, that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. And that allegation deserves the attention of every American.""
Well, the allegation doesn't. If it's true, then sure, but not an allegation.
Here's the bigger problem: Nowhere in the 448-page report compiled by Mueller does it explain how the alleged ""social media operation"" or ""sophisticated cyber techniques"" led to 1,405,284 voters in Wisconsin pulling the lever for Trump, or 2,279,543 in Michigan, or 2,970,733 in Pennsylvania — all states the Democratic nominee won in 2008 and 2012.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders summed it up succinctly on Wednesday: ""After two years, the Special Counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same."" "
"KLAVAN: Oh, Go Ahead, Taylor Swift, Have Babies | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47915/klavan-oh-go-ahead-taylor-swift-have-babies-andrew-klavan,"June 1, 2019 views
One of my biggest problems with left-wing identity movements is that they seem to identify an oppressor — and then adopt the oppressor’s values as their own. If whites have discriminated against blacks in the past, they say, that can be fixed by adopting that racism and discriminating against whites now.
This never works, of course. All racism goes on one side of the scale: the devil doesn’t care who does the hating as long as the hating gets done.
But nowhere is this moral error more destructive than in the philosophy of feminism. Feminists have essentially proclaimed that male power can be equaled only by women willing to accept male values and play by male rules. Virtually every movie seems to feature a woman who is shown to be “strong” in the ways men are strong. They throw punches, they pose with their fists on their hips, they look grim and macho. Feminine attributes like tenderness, nurturing and generosity? Forget it. That’s girl stuff.
I think this is bad news for women for the simple reason that, unlike the races, the two genders are really very different from one another. Forcing one sex into the other’s roles not only tends to make most people unhappy, it also damages society — which is, after all, built on the bedrock of human nature, not the other way around.
This week, the illogic of the feminist outlook was dramatized in the realm of popular music. Pop star Taylor Swift, soon to turn 30, was asked by a German interviewer if she would like to be a mother someday. Swift said, “I really do not think men are asked that question when they turn 30, so I’m not going to answer that now.”
Now it’s not news that a pop star says something silly, but this was a representative silliness. Men are not asked the question because men don’t become mothers, and women only have a certain period of time in which to bear.
But Swift felt this was demeaning because it suggested that motherhood is somehow a defining experience for women. But, of course, that’s exactly what it is — and if saying so feels demeaning, it may only be because feminists have adopted male values that set other occupations above motherhood.
Mind you, I don’t blame men for telling themselves that running a company or being a soldier or getting your name in the newspaper is more important than creating and nurturing new humans. But why should women accept those judgments? After all, it’s entirely possible men puff themselves up over their endeavors to compensate for being the less important sex.
All this matters greatly. The Centers for Disease Control recently reported that U.S. fertility rates are plummeting and have hit a record low. American women are no longer having enough babies to replace the generations. Leftists leapt to explain this phenomenon in economic terms: it’s so expensive to have children, there’s no paid maternity leave, we don’t have universal health care, and so on.
I guess it’s too much to expect leftists to wonder if maybe the cause is leftism itself. But if you live in a society that denigrates motherhood, why should women aspire to it?
A counter example to Taylor Swift likewise appeared in the pop music world. An excerpt from the show “America’s Got Talent” went viral on social media. It showed the performance of a young man named Kodi Lee, who is blind and severely autistic. His mother Tina brought him onstage and explained to the judges that she had seen his eyes light up when he first heard music and so she had nurtured his ability.
Kodi’s piano and voice rendition of Leon Russell’s “A Song for You” was spectacular and sparked a standing ovation. “That’s all for you,” Tina whispered in his ear.
Yeah, the kid got the applause. But watching Tina, all I could think was: There ought to be a Nobel Prize for motherhood. In fact, that’s the only Nobel Prize there ought to be. Watching that video was like watching the opposite of an abortion: a heroic battle against the forces of death, not in the name of mere life but in the name of human fruition. The hero of that epic was Tina — and as such, she was the representative of every mother who surrenders body and soul not just to create biological life, but to make life in full: real, loved, nurtured life.
I enjoy Taylor Swift’s music, but let’s be honest: If there were no more Taylor Swifts forever, who really would give a damn? But to lose even one Tina? That would be a vast moral tragedy.
Money, fame, applause — these all attend on traditionally male achievements, I know. Men have built the world that way in honor of themselves.
But why shouldn’t women have a value system of their own? "

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images June 2, 2019 views
At least six Los Angeles Police Department officers from the same downtown precinct are showing signs of typhoid fever and a ""typhus-like"" illness after working in or near the city's growing homeless encampment.
Late last week, radio host Dr. Drew Pinsky made headlines declaring that Los Angeles is the epicenter of a ""public health emergency"" stemming from a growing homeless population that finds nothing wrong with setting up permanent encampments across large swaths of the city's downtown area, and cautioned that, unless city officials took immediate action, it's likely the homeless population in LA could see an outbreak of the bubonic plague.
The plague, of course, killed tens of millions across Europe in the 14th century, before the advent of public sanitation and clean water systems. But as Pinksy recalled to Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week, Los Angeles is suffering from a complete lack of a sanitation strategy, and just as these serious communicable diseases seem to be taking root, the city council is considering a ban or moratorium on using rat poison.
The six LAPD officers include at least one detective who has already been diagnosed with typhoid fever. The city's police union announced late Saturday that five others are showing symptoms of the same rare illness.
Typhus and typhoid fever are spread through contaminated food and water, and through fleas and ticks. The six officers, who work at the city's Central Division Station, may have come in contact with the disease while policing the city's growing homeless encampments — particularly on Skid Row, which is in the Central Division's district — or simply from interacting within the station itself. A state investigation into conditions in and around the Central Division Station, the Associated Press reports , turned up a myriad of public health issues, landing the building a $5,000 fine and an order to clean up immediately.
But the city's police officer's union says it isn't that simple. Los Angeles needs to get serious about breaking up homeless encampments — even if they feel a sense of progressive empathy over them — before they become a widespread public health hazard.
In addition to typhus and typhoid fever — and potentially the plague — officers of LAPD's Central Division Station contend routinely with cases of Hepatitis A and staph infections, a union spokesperson said in a press conference Saturday.
""The last thing I need is my members coming to work worried about contracting an infectious disease and bringing it home to their families,"" the spokesperson told reporters.
Infectious disease experts told the Associated Press that conditions inside the station would have had a marked effect on the spread of illnesses like typhus. The police union agrees and believes the city of Los Angeles should make keeping police officers safe and improving their working conditions at top priority.
Los Angeles, of course, isn't the only city facing these kinds of problems — and it certainly isn't the first time Los Angeles has faced typhus and typhoid fever. Several years ago, when the homeless population temporarily exploded, LA faced a small outbreak of the disease that led to a massive cleanup. This time around, though, like its sister city, San Francisco, California, Los Angeles' city government isn't chomping at the bit to address the root cause of the problem: rampant homelessness.
In San Francisco, there is a similar threat of disease, particularly given that sidewalks and public ways across the city are littered with human waste, and the homeless encampments there have gotten so crowded that some members of the transient population are now building makeshift boats so that they can live in San Francisco's famous bay.

"‘I WAS REVOLTED’: Veterans Storm Out Of Meeting With Ocasio-Cortez After She Bashes America, Report Says | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47937/i-was-revolted-veterans-storm-out-meeting-ocasio-ryan-saavedra,"June 2, 2019 views
Military veterans who attended a recent private event with socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) stormed out of the meeting after Ocasio-Cortez reportedly bashed U.S. foreign policy and attacked Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Silvio Mazzella, a Vietnam War vet, told the New York Post: ""She knocks the country, she knocks the president. And that’s not what America is about.""
""I just couldn’t hear her BS anymore,"" Mazzella said. ""I just got up, got my umbrella in my hand and walked right out.""
Ocasio-Cortez blasted U.S. foreign policy and suggested that the U.S. was at least partially to blame for people getting killed in Yemen, to which Mazzella said, ""That really turned me off completely.""
Another attendee, who wished to remain anonymous, told the New York Post that they were ""revolted"" when Ocasio-Cortez bashed President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The New York Post says that Ocasio-Cortez's office claimed that only one person left the meeting because they had to go pick up their kids.
Army veteran Anthony Vitaliano, who served 38 years in the NYPD, disputed the claims from Ocasio-Cortez's office, saying, ""That’s bulls–t. Everybody that was there knows I walked out.""
During an interview on Fox News' ""FOX & Friends"" on Sunday, Mazzella said : ""It was a prepared agenda for the — let’s put in this way, she is our congresswoman from January, we haven’t seen her in our area until May 28, Tuesday at 5:30. Everybody else in the United States has seen her except her own district.""
Mazzella said that Ocasio-Cortez's comments about ""American bombs"" in Yemen is what initially angered him during the meeting.
""I heard that, ‘'American bombs.' In my head, I say to myself, 'what about the Iranian bullets and Iranian bombs? Aren’t they killing people, too?'"" Mazzella continued. ""Didn’t feel good. It reminds me when I came home from Vietnam and we had the protesters here. You know that’s not the way to treat people."" "
TRUMP WIN? Mexican President Says He's Ready To Amp Up Immigration Enforcement To End Trade War | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47942/trump-win-mexican-president-says-hes-ready-amp-emily-zanotti,"TRUMP WIN? Mexican President Says He's Ready To Amp Up Immigration Enforcement To End Trade War PAUL RATJE/AFP/Getty Images June 2, 2019 views
White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that President Donald Trump is ""deadly serious"" about levying a 5% tariff on Mexican goods if the Mexican government doesn't step up enforcement of illegal immigration on the southern side of the border, and now it appears the Mexican government is serious about complying to avoid a trade war.
Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday that Trump's threat was not an empty one.
""He is absolutely, deadly serious,"" Mulvaney said on the morning news program, according to Politico . ""I fully expect these tariffs to go on to at least the 5 percent level on June 10.""
He added that the White House has been working with the Mexican government ""for months,"" pushing immigration forces there to turn away ""caravans"" of migrants from central America, and demanding that the Mexican government lend a hand in the border crisis. Now, Mulvaney said, the border is in an ""emergency situation"" and the U.S. will no longer tolerate a lack of attention from Mexican officials.
The reason we're doing things people don't expect is that we're facing things at the border we never experienced before,"" Mulvaney added in a later appearance on NBC, Politico reports. ""We're using extraordinary tools because there is extraordinary circumstances that dictate those.""
The 5% tariff goes into effect this week. If the Mexican government continues to refuse to help, the tariff will increase to ""10 percent on July 1; 15 percent on Aug. 1; 20 percent on Sept. 1; and 25 percent on Oct. 1,"" according to White House officials.
To prove they're listening, Mulvaney said that Mexico would need to show improvement in policing their own southern border, for starters.
Democrats bristled at the thought of instituting tariffs on Meixcan goods and accused Trump, last week, of starting an unnecessary trade war. They also insisted, as before, that the crisis at the southern border is of Trump's own making and that administration policies have forced border patrol officials to detain more immigrants and asylum seekers than ever before.
The White House, of course, fired back, noting that Democrats have dutifully ignored any request from the White House to approve the emergency funding necessary to care for the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers who have appeared at the border in recent months. The administration insists that if Congress will not help, it will pursue other avenues, including tariffs, to entice Mexico to assist.
The plan appears to be working.
The Associated Press reports that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ""hinted his country could tighten migration controls to defuse U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Mexican goods,"" and that he plans on engaging the White House in talks this week, which he hopes will be fruitful.
Lopez Obrador insisted, in the same news conference, that the Mexican government has ramped up immigration enforcement along Mexico's southern border and that officials have been working diligently to turn back migrant caravans, limit the number of migrant visas issued, and capture and deport recognized criminals, including MS-13 gang members.
“The main thing is to inform about what we’re already doing on the migration issue, and if it’s necessary to reinforce these measures without violating human rights, we could be prepared to reach that deal,” Lopez Obrador said Sunday.
“We’re doing all we can to reach a deal through dialogue,” he added. “We’re not going to get into a trade war, a war of tariffs and of taxes.”"

On Friday, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) sent out the following tweet regarding the Virginia Beach shooting: We are nearly 100 days since @HouseJudiciary passed #HR8 , the universal background checks bill, in the House and today there has been another mass shooting in America.

We are nearly 100 days since @HouseJudiciary passed #HR8, the universal background checks bill, in the House and today there has been another mass shooting in America. Thoughts and prayers are not enough, we need action now. #EnoughIsEnough #EndGunViolence
The tweet has nearly 13,000 ""likes,"" and has been retweeted 5,300 times.
According to CBS News , the Virginia Beach gunman used two .45 caliber handguns in his rampage.
During a press conference on Saturday, ATF Special Agent in Charge Ashan Benedict stated that the guns appear to have been purchased legally:
Working with Virginia Beach Police Department, State Police, and our partners with the FBI, we identified two weapons used in the shooting yesterday. Both weapons are .45 caliber pistols. One was purchased in 2016; one was purchased in 2018. Both pistols were purchased by the shooter, and all indications are they were purchased legally.
In addition, ATF agents assisted local police with the search warrant at the shooter’s residence. Two other firearms were recovered from that location. One of the two has been identified, and of the one that has been identified, it also was legally purchased by the shooter.
Given the information that has been provided to the public, namely that the shooter appears to have purchased both of his firearms legally, it’s impossible to know whether or not the ""universal background checks bill,"" or HR8, mentioned by Rep. Nadler would have done anything to prevent the Virginia Beach shooting.
The text of HR8 reads in part :
(A) It shall be unlawful for any person who is not a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who is not so licensed, unless a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer has first taken possession of the firearm for the purpose of complying with subsection (s).
(B) Upon taking possession of a firearm under subparagraph (A), a licensee shall comply with all requirements of this chapter as if the licensee were transferring the firearm from the inventory of the licensee to the unlicensed transferee.
The purpose of the legislation, as described by the bill summary, is to ""[prohibit] a firearm transfer between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check.""
According to a 2015 survey conducted by Matthew Miller, MD, ScD, Lisa Hepburn, PhD, and Deborah Azrael, PhD: ""Among gun owners who acquired their most recent firearm within the past 2 years by way of purchase, 13% (CI, 8% to 18%) did so without a background check.""
As of publication, it’s not known if the shooter purchased his guns from a licensed firearms dealer, thereby undergoing a background check, or if he purchased them from a seller currently exempt from the requirements of a licensed dealer. However, even if a ""universal background check"" law were in place, it cannot be concluded, given the publicly available evidence at this time , that the shooter would have been prevented from legally purchasing the firearms used in the massacre.
Despite the abundance of unknown factors at play in the ongoing investigation, Rep. Nadler used his platform to argue for the passing of legislation the result of which might not have done anything to hinder the Virginia Beach shooting."

On Friday, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) sent out the following tweet after the Virginia Beach shooting: 150 - mass shootings 2,876,775 - thoughts and prayers tweets from cowardly public leaders 93 - days that the Republican controlled Senate has refused to hold a vote on the House-passed background checks bill — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) June 1, 2019
Beneath the senator’s tweet, author and journalist Emily Miller wrote: Please share your list of “150 mass shootings” this year or you can get the Congessional Reaearch Service to provide to you. I’m completely sure you are wrong and purposely trying to scare citizens who elected you. #FactsMatter — Emily Miller (@EmilyMiller) June 1, 2019
Because there isn’t an official set of criteria that can be used across the board to define ""mass shooting,"" many organizations and academics use the FBI definition of ""mass murder"" as the standard by which ""mass shooting"" is determined.
In a report published by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) in 2015, William J. Krouse and Daniel J. Richardson wrote:
According to the FBI, the term ""mass murder"" has been defined generally as a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered, within one event, and in one or more locations in close geographical proximity. Based on this definition, for the purposes of this report, ""mass shooting"" is defined as a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms, within one event, and in one or more locations in close proximity.
Similarly, a ""mass public shooting"" is defined to mean a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms, within one event, in at least one or more public locations, such as, a workplace, school, restaurant, house of worship, neighborhood, or other public setting.
Despite this somewhat standardized definition, other organizations have set different criteria for what constitutes a mass shooting.
Mother Jones , which has compiled a comprehensive list of mass shooting incidents dating back to 1982, defines a mass shooter as one who kills three or more, as opposed to four or more.
Mass Shooting Tracker (MST), on the other hand, defines a mass shooting as ""an incident where four or more people are shot in a single shooting spree. This may include the gunman himself, or police shootings of civilians around the gunman.""
Gun Violence Archive (GVA) defines a mass shooting as ""four or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident], at the same general time and location, not including the shooter.""
According to Mother Jones, there have been four mass shootings in 2019; according to Mass Shooting Tracker, there have been 175; and according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 153.
It’s likely that Sen. Murphy used GVA as his source.
The problem with the senator’s likely sourcing is that public perception of what constitutes a mass shooting appears to be much more aligned with the Mother Jones data set — an incident in which one or more active shooters open fire in a school, church, or public space with the express and singular intent of killing as many innocent people as possible.
Shootings such as those that took place at Columbine High School, Pulse night club, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and the Las Vegas music festival are what many Americans think of when they hear the term ""mass shooting."" Such events typically feature a high death toll and multiple serious injuries, and are widely covered by the national media.
Given the association many Americans have with the term ""mass shooting,"" it’s both disingenuous and misleading for Sen. Chris Murphy to state that there have been 150 mass shootings in 150 days without further explanation as to how he defines his terminology.

KNOWLES: World's Tiniest Surviving Baby Ends Abortion Debate | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47908/knowles-worlds-tiniest-surviving-baby-ends-daily-wire,"KNOWLES: World's Tiniest Surviving Baby Ends Abortion Debate Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images June 3, 2019 views
On Friday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,"" the host discusses how baby Saby, the world’s smallest newborn, destroys the Left’s argument in favor of abortion. Video and partial transcript below.
The world's tiniest baby has been born. This is wonderful. The baby weighs basically nothing, twenty-three weeks old born and has survived, a wonderful feel-good story. Obviously, this raises some serious questions about the abortion discussion that we've been having for weeks because, in many states in this country, that baby could be killed. And in many states in this country, people deny that that baby is a baby, but the baby was born, and the baby is now alive. And this is how the mainstream media covers it.
NBC News: ""Tonight, an amazing announcement from San Diego. What doctors are calling the world's tiniest surviving baby, just eight point six ounces when she was born prematurely at twenty-three weeks. Well after five months in intensive care the little girl named, Saby, is now healthy and she's headed home. And we are so happy for her family.”
Only 8.6 ounces, half a pound. This baby apparently was the size of an apple, born at twenty-three weeks and now going home happy, healthy, alive. Good thing for that baby that baby wasn't born in Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, or Virginia, to parents who wanted to kill it because if that had been the case she would be dead. It wouldn't even be admitted that she was a baby.
In all of those states in the country, you can kill babies who are at least as old if not significantly older than that baby. And those states want to pretend that the baby isn't a baby, but you just heard it. You just saw it — the baby is a baby. This should end the abortion debate. Those pictures should end the abortion debate, or at least what they should do in the abortion debate is take it into honest terms.
Naomi Wolf in the mid-90s came out and said abortion rights mean that we need to kill the baby in all of its humanity in order to have equality for men and women. At least she was honest, what people who support abortion at 23 weeks need to say is — they look at that little baby and say, ""You should die because of my political ideology. My political ideology means that you must be killed."" That's just the cost of it. That's the end of the argument. That certainly should be the end of the argument. We'll see what those states do on abortion. Something tells me they're not going to be protecting babies anytime soon. "
Trump: Claims I Called Meghan Markle 'Nasty' Fake News. Here's What He Said. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47946/trump-claims-i-called-meghan-markle-nasty-fake-james-barrett,"June 3, 2019 views Ahead of his big trip to Britain, President Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to refute claims that he called Meghan Markle ""nasty,"" a reference to comments he made on tape in an interview with tabloid The Sun. ""I never called Meghan Markle 'nasty.' Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold!"" Trump tweeted Sunday. ""Will @CNN, @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!"" I never called Meghan Markle “nasty.” Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN , @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2019 As reported by AFP , the comment that stirred up the controversy came during a recent taped interview with The Sun. When the interviewer for the tabloid notes that Markle — an American who became Duchess of Sussex after marrying Queen Elizabeth II's grandson, Prince Henry in 2018 — said in 2016 that she'd move to Canada if Trump won the presidency, Trump responded by saying he ""didn't know that she was nasty."" Though she vowed to move to Canada, said the interviewer, ""turned out she moved here."" ""Well, a lot of people are moving here, so what can I say,"" Trump told the outlet. ""No, I didn't know that she was nasty."" ""An official Trump campaign Twitter account had rather bizarrely called attention to the 'nasty' comment on Saturday by linking to a video of the interview and suggesting the president had not used the word; it urged people to 'Listen for yourself!'"" AFP reports. The ""move to Canada"" comment is not the only ""nasty"" thing Markle said about Trump; during an interview with late night TV host Larry Wilmore during the 2016 campaign, she condemned the then-candidate as ""misogynistic ... and SO vocal about it."" She also decried him as ""divisive."" In response to Trump's ""nasty"" comment, CNN published an op-ed declaring Trump as having ""proved"" Markle's ""misogynistic"" point (formatting adjusted): We are, by now, used to the President's name-calling -- it is unpresidential and gauche. But ""nasty"" is one that rings out with some significance: he seems to reserve it for women. Recall Trump infamously interrupting Hillary Clinton during the last debate of his 2016 presidential campaign to call her ""a nasty woman,"" a remark so obviously gendered that many women responded by trying to reclaim it. One website that began selling ""Nasty Woman"" T-shirts reported that its design went viral overnight, generating tens of thousands of orders.That Trump has just chosen to hurl the same insult at Markle, while trying to defend himself against her 2016 claim that he is misogynistic, is ironic. On Monday, Trump will begin a three-day visit with officials in the U.K., a trip that will start off with a ceremony at Buckhingham Palace that will feature royal hosts, including the Queen. Markle, however, will not be among them. Markle gave birth to her son Archie just three weeks ago and is on maternity leave. At least, that's the official reason given, AFP notes. In the interview with The Sun, Trump offered his support to Boris Johnson to replace Prime Minister Theresa May, whose reign has come to an end amid continued Brexit turmoil. Johnson is a strong voice in favor of Brexit, something Trump adamantly supports. If the European Union and Britain cannot reach a deal about departure, Trump suggested in the interview, the country should leave without a deal. ""Large anti-Trump protests are expected during his visit, and a huge blimp of Trump as a baby in diapers is being readied to fly over the city if police allow it,"" AFP reports."

Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, ignoring Special Counsel Robert Mueller's protestations that he has no interest in testifying before Congress, is threatening to summon Mueller before Congress anyway, snapping, “We will have Mr. Mueller’s testimony.”
Last week, Mueller spoke at the Department of Justice about the release of his gigantic 448-page investigation into Russian election interference and allegations that President Trump obstructed Mueller’s efforts, asserting, “The report is my testimony … I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak about this matter.""
But according to The Hill , in a radio interview with WNYC on Friday, Nadler stated, “We will have Mr. Mueller’s testimony. I think it's very important that he testify before the American people, even if he doesn't say anything beyond what he said there. The attorney general and the president and others are lying all the time about what was in the report and it's very important that he, to the TV audience and to the American people ... answer questions about it, even if there is no new information. ... Most people are not going to read the 448-page report.”
Nadler added, “Obviously people are frustrated that we haven’t moved faster. And, frankly, I'm frustrated because we have been held up by the unprecedented action by the White House to deny our witnesses. And we can only go so far, until we win in court, to get those witnesses.”
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) echoed to The Hill, “He can help parameterize and bring the report to life for the American people. Many people will watch those hearings. ... Even if it's Bob Mueller sitting there reading the report [and taking questions] — that's fine.” He added, “I think he'll volunteer; I think he cares too much about the process. I don't see him defying the congressional request.”
Nadler insisted that impeachment was necessary because the reelection of the president would be a disaster. He said, “Well, impeachment is ... there might still be a point to it. And that point is to say to future presidents, you cannot do this, to vindicate the Constitution, to say there are certain things that cannot be done. God willing, we have to defeat Trump. ... His reelection would be a national catastrophe.”
The New York Post reported that Nadler insisted that Americans don’t “know the facts,” and that is why they don’t support impeachment of the president, stating, “Impeachment is a political act and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it. The American people right now do not support it because they don’t know the story. They don’t know the facts.” The Post added that Nadler threatened White House officials who have refused to testify before the Judiciary Committee, saying, “We are going to enforce those subpoenas and we’re going to have on the floor as soon as possible, I hope very shortly, contempt citations against these people and we will pursue them in court.”
Roll Call reported that Nadler slammed Mueller, saying he is ""leaning over too far backwards"" by stating he wouldn’t accuse the president if Trump couldn't be charged and couldn’t defend himself in court. Nadler blustered, ""I think that he could have accused him anyway, period.”"

In a little-known report published last week, the cybersecurity firm FireEye found that Facebook and Twitter accounts linked to Iran impersonated U.S. journalists and Republican political candidates in order to push fake news.
“The accounts, most of which were created between April 2018 and March 2019, used profile pictures appropriated from various online sources, including, but not limited to, photographs of individuals on social media with the same first names as the personas,” the report said. “As with some of the accounts that we identified to be of Iranian origin last August, some of these new accounts self-described as activists, correspondents, or “free journalist[s]” in their user descriptions. Some accounts posing as journalists claimed to belong to specific news organizations, although we have been unable to identify individuals belonging to those news organizations with those names.”
The accounts expressed “anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes,” and support for the Obama administration’s Iran Deal. These accounts also blasted the Trump administration for designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, the report said.
In addition to fake Facebook accounts, Twitter also faced the coordinated campaign:
Some Twitter accounts in the network impersonated Republican political candidates that ran for House of Representatives seats in the 2018 U.S. congressional midterms. These accounts appropriated the candidates’ photographs and, in some cases, plagiarized tweets from the real individuals’ accounts. Aside from impersonating real U.S. political candidates, the behavior and activity of these accounts resembled that of the others in the network.
Facebook told technology website CNet that it “took down 51 accounts, 36 pages and seven groups tied to Iran.” It also removed three accounts from its photo-sharing app, Instagram. “Twitter said that in early May it pulled down more than 2,800 fake accounts tied to Iran,” CNet reported .
FireEye also found that some of the fake personas were able to influence print and online media outlets in the U.S. and Israel “to promote Iranian interests via the submission of letters, guest columns, and blog posts that were then published.” Some of these personas actually conducted interviews “with real U.S. and UK-based individuals while presenting themselves as journalists.”
Vijeta Uniyal of Legal Insurrection called this report “the biggest revelation of its kind, highlighting Iran’s ability to influence the media and spread misinformation to shape U.S. public opinion.”
Another example of this kind of disinformation campaign also was revealed last week. The United States Army War College posted a report on Friday detailing how Pakistan was able to spread fake news that turned the people of India against their own government:
In February 2019, in (Indian-administered) Southern Kashmir, a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist cell attacked an Indian paramilitary convoy with an improvised explosive device (IED). Two weeks later, when India launched airstrikes against a suspected JeM camp in Pakistan, it escalated the incident to a military crisis. Pakistan quickly weaponized its social media space, spreading disinformation or “fake news,” using old photographs and videos of downed jets and destroyed equipment, implying their wreckage resulted from the recent aerial duel between its airforce the Indian fighter jets. In doing so, the Pakistani security establishment successfully used social media and television to spread disinformation and chaos through multimedia content, and turned the Indian public against its own political leadership, in what seems to have been — until now — a rare example of organized state-sponsored weaponization of social media — during an active military crisis.
The U.S. and Pakistan currently have a shaky relationship, but they are not considered an enemy. Still, when countries have demonstrated a clear ability to spread disinformation, U.S. media outlets need to use caution in their sourcing."
HAMMER: Conservatives Must Make Their Arguments In Moral Language | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47964/hammer-conservatives-must-make-their-arguments-josh-hammer,"June 3, 2019 views
New York Post op-ed editor Sohrab Ahmari launched a broad intramural conservative dialogue last week with his short essay at First Things entitled, ""Against David French-ism."" David French of National Review, as the eponymous personification of Ahmari's ire, responded in kind . Many others within the right-of-center commentariat have also weighed in, including yours truly .
The dialogue launched by Ahmari is a broad-ranging and multifaceted one. In part, it is downstream of a purely attitudinal debate being aired between hard-edged, ""own the libs""-style Trumpism and softer-edged, cheerily optimistic Reaganism. In part, it is a philosophical discussion about means-ends rationalizations. In part, it is an intellectual discussion about the continued political vitality and relevance of traditional William F. Buckley Jr.-inspired "" Fusionism .""
But the most interesting aspect of the dialogue, from my perspective, is the extent to which it pits the unabashed, forceful public promotion of moral/value-based argumentation of the Ahmari side against the more reserved, procedure-centric, federalism/civil society-imbued classical liberalism of the French side.
In this specific aspect of the dialogue, Ahmari has more to offer to directly confront the current American crises of societal rot, moral decay, and widening cultural chasms between economic classes.
In the original constitutional construct — before there was a Fourteenth Amendment that fundamentally altered the relationship between the states and the federal government that the states created — there was much to be said for value-neutral argumentation about the benefits of pluralistic liberalism, federalism's mutually self-reinforcing spheres of dual sovereignty, and a Tocquevillian (or ""David French-ist,"" Ahmari might say) abiding faith in the ability of the mediating institutions of the civil society to inculcate virtue across generations.
Two Founding-era quotations can succinctly demonstrate the point. James Madison, in The Federalist No. 45 , famously averred : ""The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite."" And it was President John Adams who said : ""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."" The relationship between the two quotations is intuitive: When the states politically dominated over a comparatively meek federal government — indeed, when the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment itself was understood as permitting states to establish their own churches — then the "" laboratories of democracy "" of which Justice Louis Brandeis ultimately spoke could compete in the eternal marketplace of ideas for the conception and promotion of the good life. In this bygone constitutional era, classical, value-neutral, pluralistic liberalism had much to offer as a direct means toward the end of human flourishing .
But it has now been over a century since Woodrow Wilson's progressive commencement of the transmogrification of the republic from a negative liberty-securing limited government into a positive liberty-conferring leviathan monstrosity. Our entrenched bureaucracy in the administrative state — which harrowingly wields a lawless combination of legislative, administrative, and judicial power alike — has sapped the citizenry of our collective willpower to learn basic civics and mature into Cincinnatus-esque citizen-statesmen. Further compounding the problem of self-governance is our modern crisis of judicial supremacy , which has empowered the ""least dangerous"" branch of which Alexander Hamilton spoke over the two political branches ever since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its misbegotten Cooper v. Aaron diktat in 1958.
Amidst this depressing backdrop of an intellectually fatigued and civically lethargic citizenry, political argumentation framed through the values-neutral lens of pluralistic liberalism has increasingly little to offer. Not only have the administrative state and the crisis of judicial supremacy collectively sapped We the People of our capability of republican self-governance, but the permanent mandarins of the former have increasingly worked in monolithic fashion toward advancing the preferred ends of society's culturally hegemonic leftist institutions: The Fortune 500, the academy, Hollywood, and the mainstream media.
A sober assessment of the threat posed by the nexus of post-constitutional governance and culturally hegemonic leftist control over society's major mediating institutions requires a sober, properly calibrated response. If we on the Right are to have any chance of beginning the restoration of a proper constitutional order and the retaking of these institutions that the Left has so thoroughly vanquished, we must recognize that culture and tradition are paramount and hierarchically rank above all other concerns. And in advancing public arguments for culture and tradition, values-neutral pluralistic liberalism simply will not suffice. Instead, we on the Right must make overtly moral arguments about culture, tradition, sovereignty, economics, and foreign policy alike.
Advocates for religious liberty must transition from arguments grounded in individual autonomy and toward arguments grounded in the intrinsic utility of religion as a public good. Advocates for capitalism must transition from arguments grounded in GDP and real, inflation-adjusted poverty reduction and toward arguments grounded in the intrinsic morality of freedom of labor and laissez-faire . Advocates for national sovereignty must transition away from arguments grounded in tangibly protecting Texan and Arizonan ranchers and toward arguments grounded in the virtue of the post-1648 Westphalian nation-state system itself. Advocates for Israel on the American university campus must transition away from pleas for ""peace"" and ""tolerance"" and toward arguments grounded in the inherent, biblically derived morality of a Jewish state existing between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.
And so forth.
It is only by beginning this rhetorical and dialectical shift toward starkly moral terminology that the Right can begin the process of winning back our culture. And it is only upon beginning to take back the culture that the Right can make meaningful process in restoring our constitutional order and regaining control over the dominant institutions of our civil society. And it is only upon restoring constitutional order and seizing back institutional control that we may save the republic."
Police Actually Use Campus Title IX Proceedings To Get Around Civil Liberties | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47983/police-actually-use-campus-title-ix-proceedings-ashe-schow,"Police Actually Use Campus Title IX Proceedings To Get Around Civil Liberties Junjira Konsang / EyeEm June 3, 2019 views
In 2015 I wrote about a police officer who bragged about using information provided by colleges and universities to get around an accused person’s Miranda and constitutional rights.
The officer, Susan Riseling, was the chief of police and associate vice chancellor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (now retired). She told a conference four years ago that police could use information from schools to nail the accused.
""It's Title IX, not Miranda,"" she said. ""Use what you can.""
It was a frightening statement at the time, as the number of lawsuits against colleges and universities for violating the due process rights of accused students was increasing. Riseling’s comments suggest a whole new world of horror for innocent students accused under the new “everyone accused is guilty” rules. If a student wished to exercise his right not to speak to police, law enforcement could just go to the school and obtain his previous interviews with Title IX officials, if there were any.
At the University of Massachusetts, Patrick Amara Jr. faced just such a situation. Amara, a football player at the time and citizen of Sierra Leone and the U.K., was accused of raping a woman at a birthday party. He said the encounter was consensual, but the woman said otherwise. During his trial, he refused to testify. According to professor and author K.C. Johnson, jurors heard Amara testify by obtaining records from UMass regarding the Title IX investigation against him there.
In college accusations, if an accused student doesn’t tell his or her side of the story, the investigation continues with only the accuser’s side of the story. This forces many accused students to tell their side of the story in a feeble attempt to save their education from an institution determined to punish them. In the vast majority of cases, they are telling their story before a biased committee without legal representation.
This is the “testimony” heard by the jury in Amara’s trial. He was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. As Johnson wrote, “for Amara to be convicted on testimony without the advice of counsel – and without counsel cross-examining the accuser and any other witnesses who testified against him – chips away at his civil liberties.”
Amara may very well be guilty — we don’t know what he said during his campus testimony. Local reporting on the trial suggests the case is a he said/she said situation. The accuser claims Amara was intoxicated and forced himself on her in a bathroom, and that he even stopped when someone knocked on the door to say everything was okay. His attorney argued at trial that it was the accuser who opened the door and said everything was okay.
When Amara was found guilty — in less than four hours of jury deliberation — the Daily Hampshire Gazette reported that his attorney, during closing arguments, asked the jury to consider whether Amara could have done what he was accused of due to his level of intoxication and suggested some of the accuser’s claims didn’t make sense. The prosecution, however, said there was no evidence the accuser had given consent and pointed out that two of Amara’s friends gave inconsistent testimony.
Again, Amara could be guilty, but I echo Johnson’s concerns about sidestepping a defendant’s rights by using information obtained in a pseudo campus court."
Hollywood Demands Rubes Obey The Dictates Of Their Moral Inferiors [Satire] | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47994/hollywood-demands-rubes-obey-dictates-their-moral-andrew-klavan,"Hollywood Demands Rubes Obey The Dictates Of Their Moral Inferiors [Satire] FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images
The following is satirical.
Hollywood’s most glamorous stars and other low scoundrels are banding together to battle new anti-abortion laws in states they heard of once but never actually believed existed. The stars say it is appalling that these laws forbid abortion even in cases of rape, incest or a producer knocking up some starlet on the casting couch and then having to actually give her the part he promised her because otherwise she might give birth and sue him for child support.
Hollywood Producer Fairly Scabrous in a statement made to the three mirrors in his walk-in closet said, “Hollywood has the best moral compass, because it has compassion. Those are the immortal words spoken by Harvey Weinstein as he was trying to get Roman Polanski off the hook for raping a 13-year-old girl. And of course, we no longer support Harvey because he can’t greenlight a picture anymore. But I’m speaking symbolically about all the Harvey Weinsteins who are still out there and could end up in prison if any of these abortion laws go into effect, and make it impossible for them to deny they did what they obviously did.”
Studio Executive Deeply Scabrous—no relation to Fairly—issued a statement from an undisclosed location, saying, “It’s a woman’s right to choose to get her employer out of a jam by disposing of the evidence before his wife finds out how he’s been casting his pictures.”
Film star Holly Vacant told reporters she would be boycotting anti-abortion states like Georgia and instead will film her next movie in Northern Ireland where abortion is almost completely illegal but her bosses get big tax breaks. Miss Vacant says this is not hypocritical because boycotting Georgia will sound virtuous so she can continue to get work, whereas boycotting Northern Ireland might cost the studios money and thus make her unemployable.
Anti-abortion states say they are sorry to lose Hollywood’s business, but at least now the local women will be safe."
WATCH: Bill Maher Defends Trump’s Merit-Based Immigration Plan: 'Sounds More Normal' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47932/president-trump-shocked-meghan-markles-nasty-paul-bois,"June 2, 2019 views
Once again, Bill Maher of HBO has allowed some sense to spring forth from his usually irreverent mouth by acknowledging President Trump's merit-based immigration system as something worth achieving, reports Fox News .
The political comedian made his surprising statement about the Trump administration's proposed immigration policy during the ""Overtime"" segment on YouTube, which follows after his ""Real Time"" show on HBO. Maher first began by asking his panel of guests if a merit-based immigration system ""should receive more consideration,"" not that it would be similar to ""what Canada has.""
CNN political analyst Kirsten Powers denounced the proposal for being out of line with the U.S. immigration tradition, which she claims has always been about people just coming to the country with no regard for their merit.
""This country is based on people coming over here not based on having a Ph.D. or having high-level skills,"" Powers said. ""Even when we say 'merit-based,' it sort of suggests that someone who doesn't have a high education doesn't have merit. I think we need people who are unskilled laborers. We need them just as much as people who are engineers.""
Maher disagreed and liked the idea put forward by former Republican governor Bill Weld that the merit-based immigration policy is ""worth some fleshing out.""
""Yeah,"" Maher said to Weld, ""It sounds more normal Republican, the one that was ignored two weeks ago.""
Not all of the segment was in Trump's favor, as Maher went on to blast the president for slapping a 5% tariff on Mexico in order to stem the immigration crisis.
""But I can understand how that side looks at what happened two weeks ago and went, 'Oh, well, if you're not going to even engage on the semi-normal proposal, let's go back to crazy,"" Maher said.
Bill Maher's defense of President Trump's merit-based immigration policy comes several weeks after warning the Democrats that Trump will clean their clocks in 2020 if they turn illegal immigration into a ""woke contest.""
""If it becomes a 'woke' contest, then the Democrats lose on this,"" Maher said. ""Yes, they look better, but it’s impossible not to look better next to him!""
When panelist Wendy Sherman, who served in the State Department during the Obama administration, said that President Trump invented the ""immigration crisis"" by cutting aid to Central American countries and separating families, Maher laughed off the comments.
""This is what Democrats say, which only gets other Democrats,"" Maher told Sherman. ""This is not the speech that is going to win any [swing] voters. You’ve [already] got the compassion vote!""
In March, Maher also denounced social justice warriors as a ""cancer on progressivism,"" arguing they care neither about truth nor justice. ""I don't think they're interested in justice; I don't think they're interested in truth; I think they're interested in clicks,"" he said. ""I think they're interested in things that make people click, and when I read them it makes me glad I didn't have kids who would see this. Hey, I got a smattering of applause there."" "
KNOWLES: The Problem With Pride | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48001/knowles-problem-pride-daily-wire,"KNOWLES: The Problem With Pride John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images June 4, 2019 views
On Monday's episode of ""The Michael Knowles Show,"" the host explains why the 'queen of sin,' pride, has become a virtue in our culture and why that is a bad thing.
Why is it called ""pride?"" It's because the Left has a far bigger agenda than sexual tolerance. Sex is just the way ... because we all love sex and we think about sex all the time and it's a good way to pull people in and attract people. I think, at this point, homosexuality is totally tangential to Pride Month. Now it's about gender, it's about sexual identity, and there aren't just two genders, there are 56 different genders. There is also a sexual pride, a fat pride, a skinny pride, there are all kinds of pride.
What is pride? Pride is excessive love of one's own excellence. Pride is the opposite of humility. If pride is the queen of all sin, humility is the queen of the virtues and they're exactly the opposite. Vice and virtue, sin and virtue, are the opposite and pride and humility are exact opposites.
We know that humility is the beginning of all wisdom. We know this from Scripture. We know this just from our own experience. Proud people come off like idiots. When you meet a proud person, no matter how popular they are, no matter how many credentials they have, they seem like idiots. And when you meet a humble person, even if he has no education, even if he's from a humble station in life, they often come off as very wise.
In a healthy culture, we approach serious questions with humility. Serious people approach questions with humility. So instead of ""pride"" parades, if we had a humble culture, and people who have differing sexual preferences wanted to be more accepted, they might have a parade that was called the, ""Please Don't Ostracize Me For My Sexual Preferences or Sexual Behavior Parade."" Humility would be the recognition that we are all very flawed people, which is certainly the case.
Every single person that you have ever met is a very flawed person. Pride is the opposite; pride is the fantasy that we're all perfect and that is what is being embraced and pushed by the Left. The leftist agenda is to suggest that human nature is perfectible, and we're on our way to Progress — that's what progress with a capital P means. And so, progressives see the utopia and they see perfect human nature and we're just marching there, we're so close, so just give us a little bit more money and a little bit more power.
We have a culture that values the self above all other things. So, in a good culture, you have selflessness. You have people doing acts of charity for each other and you have people sacrificing for each other, for their children, for future generations. But in our culture, we don't have selflessness.
We're about to have the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of storming Normandy. That was an act of selflessness for the country. That's unimaginable today. What we have today are parades celebrating the self. We have self-love and we have self-care. We have selfishness.
Selflessness is replaced by selfishness and humility is replaced by pride. It is a horrible thing. No matter your sexual preferences, no matter your sexual views, no matter your religious views, no matter your moral views, pride is terrible.
It will ruin society and it will ruin your life. If you live in a proud way if you think you're so great and everyone else is just kind of shorting you and cheating you, and you've got a big chip on your shoulder, and everyone's worse than you are, and you're so much better than everyone else, you're going to have a terrible life. Do not be proud. You have no reason to be proud, you should be humble. We should have humility parades."
House Democrats Move Forward To Hold Barr In Contempt | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48010/house-democrats-move-forward-hold-barr-contempt-ashe-schow,"House Democrats Move Forward To Hold Barr In Contempt Win McNamee/Getty Images June 4, 2019 views
House Democrats plan to move forward next week with a vote to hold U.S. Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress, despite signaling two weeks ago that they were moving away from such a vote.
Politico reported that Barr would be held in contempt for refusing to break the law and provide Congress with a fully unredacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in 2016. The report found that the campaign did not collude with Russia. The report contains grand jury material, which cannot be revealed by law. House Democrats are demanding Barr break this law and are threatening to hold him in contempt for refusing.
Democrats want to hold McGahn in contempt for refusing to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee after receiving a subpoena.
The coming vote is supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and other leaders of the party. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement:
“This Administration’s systematic refusal to provide Congress with answers and cooperate with Congressional subpoenas is the biggest cover-up in American history, and Congress has a responsibility to provide oversight on behalf of the American people.”
Two weeks ago, The Daily Wire reported on a letter Barr sent to House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), in which the attorney general outlined what his department was doing to accommodate the Democrats and said that they would get nothing if they held him in contempt.
“To be clear, should the Committee take the precipitous and unnecessary action of recommending a contempt finding or other enforcement action against the AG, then the Department [of Justice] will not likely be able to continue to work with the Committee to accommodate its interests in these materials,” Barr wrote.
At that time, Schiff appeared to back off his threat, Reuters reported .
As Politico reported, this vote “would clear the way for the House Judiciary Committee to take Barr and McGahn to court to enforce their subpoenas.” As the Wire previously reported, Barr’s letter to Schiff provides documentation of the steps the AG has taken to accommodate lawmakers. Should House Democrats continue with their contempt vote and take Barr to court, Barr would likely win — as he has appeared reasonable and accommodating while Democrats have just cried foul.
Politico reported that the House Judiciary Committee already voted in May to hold Barr in contempt after he ignored a request to provide the fully unredacted Mueller report and underlying evidence. Barr, as stated above, maintains that he is barred by law from disclosing grand jury material, to which Democrats have demanded he obtain a “judge’s order to waive grand jury secrecy rules,” Politico reported.
This is all an attempt to set up an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Mueller’s report didn’t include an indictment of the president, nor did it conclude the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to steal the election.
Politico reported that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are also ready to hold Barr in contempt, along with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, for not complying with a subpoena regarding a citizenship question on the 2020 census."

On Monday, Queen Elizabeth II offered a warm welcome to the President of the United States, telling Donald Trump, “It is not only our security which unites us, but our strong cultural links and shared heritage.” She also gallantly offered a tribute to the American soldiers of World War II, calling them, “the American heroes who risked their lives.”
Queen Elizabeth II started by stating:
Mr. President, I’m delighted to welcome you and Mrs. Trump to Buckingham Palace this evening, just 12 months after our first meeting in Windsor. Visits by American presidents always remind us of a close and long-standing friendship between the United Kingdom and the United States, and I’m so glad that we have another opportunity to demonstrate the immense importance that both our countries attach to our relationship. In the coming days, you will see some of our most treasured historical buildings, speak to the business leaders whose expertise and innovation drive our economies, and meet members of our own services, past and present. You will also travel to Portsmouth and Normandy to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day.
On that day, and on many occasions since, the armed forces of both our countries fought side by side to defend our cherished values of liberty and democracy. Mr. President, in your State of the Union address this year, you paid tribute to some of the American heroes who risked their lives, and we owe an immeasurable debt to the British, American, and Allied soldiers who began the liberation of Europe on the sixth of June, 1944.
She recalled, “I paid my first state visit to your country at the invitation of President Eisenhower. As Supreme Allied Commander, he had ultimate responsibility for the execution of the Normandy landings. In his headquarters in St. James’ Square, not far from Buckingham Palace, British and American officers worked closely together to plan the freedom of a continent. And it would be no exaggeration to say that millions of lives depended on their common endeavor.”
The queen continued, “As we face the new challenges of the 21 st century, the anniversary of D-day reminds us of all that our countries have achieved together. After the shared sacrifices of the Second World War, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions to ensure that the horrors of conflict would never be repeated. While the world has changed; we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures; nations working together to safeguard a hard-won peace.”
Then the queen cited Trump’s own connection to Britain and many Americans' own connections with the island nation:
Of course, it is not only our security which unites us, but our strong cultural links and shared heritage. Every year there are almost four million visits by Americans to the United Kingdom with a great number claiming British descent. And with your own Scottish ancestry, Mr. President, you too have a particular connection to this country. We are also bound by the strength and breadth of our economic ties as the largest investors in each others' economies. British companies in the United States employ over one million Americans and the same is true vice versa. Mr. President, as we look to the future, I’m confident that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us.”
Tonight we celebrate an alliance that has helped to ensure the safety and prosperity for both our peoples for decades and which I believe will endure for many years to come. Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you all to rise and drink a toast to President and Mrs. Trump, to the continued friendship between our two nations, and to the health, prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States."
Elton John: I’m Ashamed To Be British | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47884/elton-john-im-ashamed-be-british-paul-bois,"May 31, 2019 views
The fallout over Brexit has made world-class singer Elton John hate his own country of origin, so much so that he no longer wishes to be classified as British, favoring the more progressive term European.
According to The Guardian , the ""Rocketman"" singer delivered his anti-British remarks in Verona while on his last world tour, Farewell Yellow Brick Road. He referred to his fellow countrymen as ""stupid, colonial, imperialist"" idiots.
""I’m ashamed of my country for what it has done. It’s torn people apart,"" Elton John said. ""I am sick to death of politicians, especially British politicians. I am sick to death of Brexit . I am a European. I am not a stupid, colonial, imperialist English idiot.""
As noted by The Guardian, the singer has been quite open about his despondency over Brexit. In July of last year, he said that the pro-Brexit crowd sold a bill of goods to the ignorant masses.
""I don’t think people in Britain were told the truth to start with,"" John said. ""They were promised something that was completely ridiculous and wasn’t economically viable.""
John went on to liken Brexit to ""walking through Hampton Court maze blindfolded, being turned around 16 times and trying to find your way out.""
Elton John made headlines recently with a little bit of a politically incorrect statement of his own when he said that straight actors should be able to play gay characters in films.
""That’s all bulls***, I’m sorry,"" John said in reference to the upcoming biopic about his life starring Taron Egerton. ""If people don’t like it, review-wise, or it doesn’t make one dollar, it’s the movie I wanted to make and that’s all that counts I can look back and say, ‘You know what, I love it. I can live with it.’""
The singer's sentiment over Brexit reflects the attitude of what many remainers felt following the 2016 vote, which has a striking similarity to the mainstream left's reaction to President Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in the same year. Here's what Fareed Zakaria of CNN had to say about the pro-Brexit crowd shortly after they proved victorious:
We are now watching the emergence of a new political divide that is likely to shape the politics of the Western world for the next 50 years. Who voted for Brexit? 68% of Britons who did not finish high school according to the Wall Street Journal, and who voted against it? In other words who voted to stay in Europe? 70% of college graduates. Those who voted for Brexit were disproportionately older, white, working class, less educated, and poorer. Those who voted to remain in Europe were younger, ethnically diverse, better educated and better off. These divisions will sound familiar to Americans because for the most part, they mirror the divide we’re seeing this presidential election. The single factor that best predicts a Trump voter is a college degree. If you have it, you say you will vote against him. If you don’t, you’re for him.
Despite the cruel smears from the likes of Elton John and Fareed Zakaria — not to mention an entire political class intent on crushing Brexit where it stands — the movement has not lost its fervor among its supporters. In the recent European parliament elections, Nigel Farage's Brexit Party snagged 29 of the 73 British EU seats available and almost a third of the votes, according to The Washington Times . "
Sephora Closing U.S. Stores For Day Of ‘Inclusivity Training’ Over Racial Profiling Accusations | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48017/sephora-closes-us-stores-inclusivity-training-paul-bois,"Sephora Closing U.S. Stores For Day Of ‘Inclusivity Training’ Over Racial Profiling Accusations ""Will shut down more than 400 stores"" ANNA-ROSE GASSOT / Contributor / Getty Images June 4, 2019 views
The France-based beauty chain Sephora will be closing all U.S. stores on June 5 for a day of ""inclusivity training"" following accusations of racial profiling from R&B singer SZA, according to Forbes .
""The beauty products juggernaut will shut down more than 400 stores to tackle diversity during a 1-hour session,"" reports the outlet.
This past April, Sephora fell subject to severe scrutiny when singer SZA testified on Twitter to being racially profiled at a store in Calabasas, California. She claimed at the time a staff member called security on her in fear she might be stealing.
""Lmao Sandy Sephora location 614 Calabasas called security to make sure I wasn't stealing. We had a long talk. U have a blessed day Sandy,"" SZA tweeted.
On May 1, Sephora responded to the tweet saying, ""You are a part of the Sephora family, and we are committed to ensuring every member of our community feels welcome and included at our stores."" A few weeks later, the store announced that every U.S. store, distribution center, and corporate would be closing for one day in order to conduct inclusion workshops.
""Sephora believes in championing all beauty, living with courage, and standing fearlessly together to celebrate our differences,"" the announcement said. ""We will never stop building a community where diversity is respected, self-expression is honored, all are welcomed, and you are included. We belong to something beautiful.""
As noted by CNN , Sephora's day of inclusion training almost mirrors what happened to Starbucks after the coffee chain faced accusations of racial profiling when a store manager called the police on a black man for refusing to buy something in order to use the restroom.
""The coffee chain closed its 8,000 stores nationwide in 2018 for diversity training following an incident in which police were called on two African American men who were meeting at a Philadelphia location,"" reports the outlet. ""Starbucks has since changed its policy so purchases are no longer required in order to spend time in a Starbucks or use the restroom.""
Time magazine reported that one single day of diversity training cost the company roughly $12 million in revenue. As LA Mag reports , few employees actually felt the training made an impact and believed the policy changes to the bathroom privileges would make some stores become loitering farms. Frank Dobbin, a Harvard sociology professor, even told Time that diversity training at such large chains produces little to no results.
""It is the most common step companies take,"" Dobbin said. ""Unfortunately, it doesn’t really seem to do much good on average for companies to offer diversity training, because they say you can’t really change people’s inherent biases with a training session.""
Surprisingly, Sephora has faced scrutiny in the past from another social justice constituency which accused the chain of cultural appropriation: Wiccans. Apparently, as Halloween approached last year, Sephora released a ""starter witch kit,"" which included perfumes, a chunk of rose quartz, some tarot cards, and a ""sage smudging stick.""
""I don’t think they’re doing it to spread awareness about the craft, they’re doing it just for profit in my opinion. Although most witches do use what’s in the Sephora box, most of us feel that it’s wrong for just anyone to grab those things and be like 'oh hey I’m a witch now,' because it’s sacred to us,"" one angered Wiccan told Metro UK at the time."
Former British Prime Minister: Jeremy Corbyn Is An Anti-Semite But Doesn’t Know It | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48028/former-british-prime-minister-jeremy-corbyn-anti-josh-hammer,"June 4, 2019 views
While President Donald Trump is across the pond on an official state visit to the United Kingdom, there has been a bit of a kerfuffle between two British Labour Party luminaries: Centrist-leaning ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair and current Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn. Specifically, Blair, who as a prime minister was known for being pro-Israel in his foreign policy outlook, has condemned his fellow Labour Party dignitary for being what everyone in the Western world already knows he is: A loathsome anti-Semite.
Per The Times of Israel :
UK Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn is an anti-Semite who doesn’t know that he is one, Tony Blair said Monday during a visit to Israel, speaking of the ""shameful"" anti-Semitism scandal that has engulfed the opposition party.
Blair, a former prime minister and long-time leader of Labour, said he no longer recognizes the party he led from 1994 until 2007.
""To be frank, this anti-Semitism row, it’s a shameful thing,"" said Blair, who was interviewed at a panel event at Bar Ilan University just outside Tel Aviv.
""If you told me, not merely back in May 1997, but at any point in the next 10 years, that the party I led for 13 years would have a problem with anti-Semitism, I would literally not have credited it, or believed it, and yet it is, and it’s there today,"" said Blair.
The Daily Wire has extensively covered Jeremy Corbyn's anti-Semitism before. As Foreign Policy magazine reminded readers last October, the leading politician of Britain's main center-left party once infamously referred to genocidal sharia supremacist terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah as his ""friends"":
Then, three days after al Qaeda’s suicide bombings in London in July 2005, Corbyn spoke at a Stop the War Coalition rally in the city to stress the reason that civilians there were being blown up on trains and buses was ""because of the way we inflict an insecurity on so many other people around the world. We have to be very clear about that.""
It is a favorite Corbyn theme. At another Stop the War rally (before becoming leader of the Labour Party, attending Stop the War rallies constituted a significant part of Corbyn’s life), he said the Islamic State’s beheading of Alan Henning, a British aid worker, was ""the price of jingoism.""
For groups regarded as less extreme than al Qaeda and the Islamic State, Corbyn has been less restrained — and often a vocal backer. In a 2009 speech in London, where he was addressing the Stop the War Coalition, Corbyn famously described Hamas and Hezbollah as his ""friends.""
He now says he regrets that statement, yet he has been friendly with those in Hamas’s orbit throughout his political life.
Furthermore, as The Daily Wire observed in February, it hardly seems purely coincidental that Corbyn's rise to the top of Britain's major center-left political party has coincided with a shocking escalation of anti-Semitism throughout Britain. As The Jerusalem Post reported at the time, 2018 marked the third consecutive year in which anti-Semitic incidents in Britain set a new annual record:
According to the [the United Kingdom's Community Security Trust (CST)] — a Jewish community organization that works in cooperation with the U.K. police — there were 1,652 reported incidents of anti-Semitism, a 16% rise from the 1,420 anti-Semitic incidents recorded by CST in 2017, which was itself a record annual total, as was the total of 1,375 incidents for 2016.
President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews Marie van der Zyl described the figures as ""very worrying for Jews living in the U.K."""
McConnell On Kavanaugh: ‘We Were Voting On Basic American Principles Of Fairness And Justice.’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48037/mcconnell-kavanaugh-we-were-voting-basic-american-josh-hammer,"June 4, 2019 views
At a recent D.C. gala hosted by the pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List, Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) reflected back on the intensive Senate nomination fight surrounding now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In what can only be read as a direct verbal assault upon the Left's deeply personal character attacks and reliance upon uncorroborated sole witness testimony to defame the decorated jurist, McConnell referred to the fight at the gala as one for ""basic American principles of fairness and justice.""
Per the Washington Examiner :
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell boasted at a prominent anti-abortion gala that he had helped confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh despite Democratic and outside opposition, a move he viewed as one of many victories he secured for advocates who had gathered.
""We were voting more than one man's career,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday evening. ""We were voting on basic American principles of fairness and justice. Does the presumption of innocence still apply in America? Yes.""
The Examiner further succinctly recounts the Kavanaugh fight: ""The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh in October after he faced a bruising confirmation battle when Christine Blasey Ford testified that he had sexually assaulted her when he was drunk and they were both in high school. Until Ford came forward, much of the backlash from outside groups had been centered around whether Kavanaugh would be the deciding vote to overturn Roe v. Wade , the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.""
Famously moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) ultimately provided the decisive vote in Kavanaugh's favor. The Daily Wire reported on Collins' vote — and monumental Senate floor speech announcing her vote — at the time. Collins stated:
In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be. We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy.
The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent function when an accusation departs from a nominee’s otherwise exemplary record. I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward.
Some of the allegations levied against Judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important. I am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by Professor Ford, but of the allegation that, when he was a teenager, Judge Kavanaugh drugged multiple girls and used their weakened state to facilitate gang rape. This outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parroted public statements of others. That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness.
Despite joining the Court as a Republican nominee, Kavanaugh has gotten off to a somewhat slow jurisprudential start . After all, despite the Left's howling and shrieking during his confirmation fight, there existed the indubitable reality that Kavanaugh was hardly the most conservative jurist public proffered as a possible replacement for retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy."
