General Electric agrees to pay $1.5B civil penalty over subprime mortgages - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ge-agrees-to-major-civil-penalty-over-subprime-mortgages,"General Electric has agreed to pay a $1.5 billion settlement for accounting violations related to a now-defunct business that handled subprime mortgages.
What's the story? According to a Friday news release from the Department of Justice, the money will be used to ""resolve claims involving subprime residential mortgage loans originated by WMC Mortgage (WMC), a GE subsidiary.
The DOJ explained that ""WMC, GE, and their affiliates allegedly misrepresented the quality of WMC's loans and the extent of WMC's internal quality and fraud controls in connection with the marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).""
The news release said that the situation with WMC subprime mortgages had gotten so bad at one point that ""In 2005, a WMC quality control manager described his department as a 'toothless tiger' with inadequate resources and no authority to prevent the approval or sale of loans his department had determined were fraudulent or otherwise defective.""
CNBC reported that shares of GE dropped by 0.6 percent after the announcement was made, adding that the reason the drop was so slight was that the settlement was ""largely expected.""
In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt said ""As today's resolution demonstrates, the Department of Justice will continue to employ FIRREA [the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989] as a powerful tool for protecting our financial markets against fraud.""
""This settlement contains no admission of any allegations and concludes the FIRREA investigation of WMC,"" a GE spokesperson told CNBC. ""This is another step in our ongoing efforts to de-risk GE Capital. This agreement represents a significant part of the total legacy exposure associated with WMC and we are pleased to put this matter behind us."""
NY Democrats block college tuition aid for Gold Star families — but approve $27 million in aid for illegal immigrants,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-block-aid-for-gold-star-kids-but-offer-aid-to-illegals,"Democrats in the New York Assembly blocked a college tuition bill that would expand aid to children in Gold Star families.
The move took place Tuesday, just a week after the Assembly's Higher Education Committee approved $27 million allocated from New York State's tax budget to assist illegal immigrants in receiving higher education.
What are the details? The committee voted 15 to 11 Tuesday to shelve the bill, according to Syracuse's Post-Standard .
Committee Chair Deborah Glick (D) said that that expanding aid to Gold Star families was not in the state budget.
According to the New York Post , the bill, had it passed, ""would have added funding to a program that provides free tuition, room and board at any SUNY or CUNY college to children, spouses and financial dependents of 'fallen soldiers' who died, became severely disabled or were classified as missing in action while serving in the military after 1990.""
""We will make every effort to ensure going forward, we have some additional resources allocated to the program so that as an entitlement, it is not falling short of the needs of our military families,"" Glick said.
The outlet reported that the existing program serves 145 students and costs just $2.7 million.
A week earlier, Speaker Carl Heastie (D) — along with Glick — revealed that $27 million from the state budget would be funneled into the Jose Peralta New York State DREAM Act , according to Newsweek .
Assembly member Carmen De La Rosa (D) said that the bill would help New York Dreamers achieve the ""American Dream.""
""With this budget, DREAMers in New York will finally be able to step out of the shadows and use higher education to live their American Dream,"" De La Rosa said in a release . ""By including the Jose Peralta New York State DREAM Act in the budget, we are sending a clear message to our immigrant population that we value their contributions to our state, and we are committed to helping them succeed.""
What else? Republican state Sen. Robert Ortt said that Glick should be ""ashamed"" over the decision to block the bill benefitting Gold Star families.
""Assemblywoman Glick should be ashamed of herself,"" Ortt said. ""We set aside $27 million dollars for college for people that are here illegally.""
He added, ""Apparently $2.7 million is all that the families of soldiers who are killed, get. If you're a child of a fallen soldier, you do not rank as high and you know that by the money."""
7-Eleven owner confronts shoplifting teen who says he and younger brother are hungry. The owner responds in an amazing way.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/7-eleven-owner-feeds-shoplifting-teen,"Last weekend, a clerk alerted Jitendra ""Jay"" Singh — owner of a 7-Eleven in Toledo, Ohio — that someone was pocketing items, so Singh checked out his video cameras and then confronted the teenage shoplifter, WTVG-TV reported .
""Do you want me to call the cops, or will you take it out?"" Singh told the station, recalling his question for the culprit.
But the kid's response was a game changer.
""He said, 'I'm stealing for myself. I'm hungry, and I'm doing it for my younger brother,'"" Singh noted to WTVG.
Amazing response
An employee had a 911 operator on the phone, CNN reported , but Singh told him to hang up.
""I said, 'Well, that's not food. You're stealing gum and candies. That's just something for munching,'"" Singh added to CNN. ""I said, 'If you're hungry, ask me. I'll give you food.'""
Image source: WTVG-TV video screenshot
So Singh sent the teen back to the aisles to grab pizza, sandwiches, and other food and let him have it all for free, WTVG said.
""It's not going to make any difference to me if I give him some food because we make a lot of food, we sell a lot of food,"" he added to WTVG. ""If he goes to jail then he's definitely not going to do anything good in life.""
'He has a great, big heart' ""He has a big heart,"" customer Cedric Bishop told the station. ""He has a great, big heart.""
Image source: WTVG-TV video screenshot
Bishop posted on Facebook about Singh's act of kindness, and the story is spreading.
&lt;br&gt; ""I thought that was just beautiful because the young man could have had a record,"" Bishop added to WTVG.
'I'm really proud of him' Singh's wife of nearly 30 years isn't surprised by the compassion he showed.
""I'm really proud of him, and it is the true self of himself,"" Neera Singh told WTVG. ""I know him; he's very kind.""
Image source: WTVG-TV video screenshot
She added to the station that her husband has always been caring person, and that they view helping others as part of their community duty.
""We are part of the community, and we have to help the community,"" Neera Singh added to WTVG. ""It is a part of our job.""
Jay Singh also told the station he'd be willing to hire the teen if he's old enough to work, and that he hopes at least the kid will be generous to someone else someday.

Gillette stirs up more controversy with ads aimed toward women,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/gillette-stirs-up-more-controversy-with-ads-aimed-toward-women,"Razor company Gillette is in the spotlight again. After taking heat for an advertisement urging men to stand up against "" toxic masculinity "" earlier this year, the firm is being ridiculed online over two separate plugs directed at women.
What are the details? Last week, Gillette released an ad for its Venus razor, which showed plus-sized Instagram model Anna O'Brien in a bikini with a caption telling women to ""go out there and slay the day.""
While the image was intended to encourage body positivity and acceptance, several Twitter users slammed it as a message embracing unhealthy lifestyle choices. The ad sparked plenty of online debate, causing Gillette to step in and defend their choice in models, saying, ""Venus is committed to representing beautiful women of all shapes, sizes and skin types because ALL types of beautiful skin deserve to be shown.""
According to an ""Inside Edition"" report on YouTube, O'Brien responded to her critics by telling ""Good Morning America,"" ""For a lot of people, all they see is fat. They don't see the joy. They don't see the happiness.""
Anything else? According to the Daily Mail , another Gillette ad aimed at females ""sparked outrage among 'disappointed' Twitter users"" by showing a woman shaving her arms.
Users accused the company of trying to sell more razors by depicting arm shaving as part of a ""normal"" routine, while others expressed concern that it gave women — especially teenagers — another reason to feel self-conscious about extra body hair.
Gillette responded to the backlash by issuing a statement saying, ""Many women have told us that they are not only shaving their legs or armpits as portrayed in advertising but other areas such as belly, arms or even toes! We used these examples in our advert to better depict women's realities.
""Our intent is not to put additional pressure on women but to help normalize the fact that hair grows in various areas of the body enabling a personal decision to be made on whether or not to shave it."""
Homeless man who participated in GoFundMe scam sentenced to 5 years' probation,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeless-man-who-participated-in-gofundme-scam-sentenced-to-5-years-probation,"A homeless Philadelphia man, who helped a New Jersey couple fabricate a heartwarming story on GoFundMe that drew in more than $400,000 in donations, was sentenced on Friday to five years of drug court probation, KYW-TV reported.
Johnny Bobbitt Jr. pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to commit theft by deception in a New Jersey state court. As part of his plea deal, the 36-year-old was immediately transferred from the courtroom in Mount Holly, New Jersey, to an inpatient drug treatment facility following his sentencing. He's also expected to testify against Kate McClure and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico, who were allegedly part of the scam.
If Bobbitt doesn't complete the program or if he violates probation, he will serve additional jail time, the judge said. He received 102 days credit for jail time served.
What's the backstory? McClure and D'Amico claimed that Bobbitt had given up his last $20 to help McClure when she ran out of gas on the side of Philadelphia freeway on Thanksgiving night in 2017.
They created a campaign that quickly went viral and donations poured in. The trio might have gotten away with the scam if Bobbitt hadn't filed a lawsuit last summer against the couple for allegedly cutting him off from his money.
As it turned out, McClure and D'Amico had met Bobbitt at a casino about a month earlier and together they concocted the ""fake feel-good story to compel donors to contribute to their cause,"" according to prosecutors.
The couple allegedly blew most of the money on lavish trips, expensive shopping trips, and a new BMW, among other things, according to prosecutors.
What happened to McClure and D'Amico? Last month, McClure pleaded guilty to one federal charge of conspiring to commit wire fraud. She's facing up to 20 years in prison for the charge, WCAU-TV reported.
McClure and D'Amico were each charged on the state level with theft and conspiracy.
D'Amico wasn't charged with a federal crime, and has denied any wrongdoing.
What else? Bobbitt also pleaded guilty last month to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in a federal court, according to WCAU. A sentencing date is not yet scheduled.
GoFundMe has since refunded all the money donated to the campaign."
Rep. Ilhan Omar claims famous George W. Bush quote is equivalent to her Sept. 11 comments,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-ilhan-omar-claims-famous-george-w-bush-quote-is-equivalent-to-her-sept-11-comments,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) defended her much-criticized description of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as ""some people did something"" by referencing a famous quote from former President George W. Bush soon after the attacks had taken place.
Which Bush quote? On Sept. 14, 2001, Bush stood in the rubble of the World Trade Center, speaking to New Yorkers through a bullhorn. When someone in the crowd called out that they couldn't hear him, he gave what turned out to be one of his most memorable quotes:
""I can hear you! I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you, and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.""
The crowd cheered and erupted in cheers of ""USA! USA! USA!""
What did Omar say?
During an event for a Muslim rights group in March, Omar said that the Council for American Islamic Relations (CAIR) ""was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""
Omar faced backlash for this comment, which many say as dismissive of the terror attack. One of Omar's congressional colleagues, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), tweeted a video of her comments and added ""First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something'. Unbelievable.""
What happened now? In a tweet on Monday, Omar quoted Bush's speech in an attempt to defend her own comments: """"The people — and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!"" President George W. Bush Was Bush downplaying the terrorist attack? What if he was a Muslim.""
She ended her tweet with a thinking face emoji and a link to a ""Fact Checker"" Washington Post story by Glenn Kessler. In the piece, Kessler says that Omar's speech in its entirety reminded him of Bush's speech at Ground Zero, as well as a speech he gave three days later at the Islamic Center in Washington, D.C., where he cautioned Americans against blaming their American Muslim neighbors for the attacks.
Kessler did also note that CAIR was founded in 1994, not 2001, and that while not a terror group itself, it had been declared an 'unindicted co-conspirator' by a federal judge in a 2010 case related to a charity that funded terrorism."
"Principal says student's MAGA hat, shirt for America pride day violated dress code",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/principal-student-maga-hat-shirt-violated-dress-code,"Monday was a patriotic America pride day at New Hampshire's Epping High School, so freshman Ciretta MacKenzie put on her shirt and hat, both emblazoned with the phrase ""Make America Great Again"" — the slogan for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
But not long after arriving on campus, Ciretta was called to Principal Brian Ernest's office, the Union Leader reported .
What happened? She told WFXT-TV that the principal said her MAGA hat and shirt violated dress code.
Image source: WFXT-TV video screenshot
According to Ciretta, Ernest also said Trump is a controversial president, and the principal added that he didn't want other students feeling uncomfortable or the day turning political, the paper added.
Ciretta, who turns 15 next week, told the principal she understood but, at the same time, Trump is still the president, the Union Leader reported.
When she asked what would happen if she couldn't find a different shirt, Ciretta told the paper she was informed that she might have to be separated from the other students.
Image source: WFXT-TV video screenshot
Ciretta told WFXT she borrowed a friend's sweatshirt and took off the hat but feels as though her First Amendment rights were violated.
The aftermath
Ciretta told the station she was ashamed after being asked to cover up and was upset by some classmates' comments.
""Some kids are making [me] feel like I'm uneducated and a bad kid for believing what I want to believe, and that's not right,"" she added to WFXT.
Ciretta also told the station there isn't language about political clothing in the student dress code: ""If it said 'no political gear,' I could understand why it was dress coded, but it didn't say that, so I feel like I'm obligated to have my own opinion and other people can have theirs. We don't have to agree; that's fine.""
School board chairman: 'I think it's very wrong' School Board Chairman Dave Mylott told the Union Leader he reviewed the dress code and doesn't believe it prohibits students from wearing shirts supporting Trump or any other political figure. He also told the paper he's concerned about the incident being viewed as a violation of a student's First Amendment rights.
""Personally, I think it's very wrong,"" he told the Union Leader. ""That's a personal opinion.""
Mylott added to the paper that if the concern centers on political intolerance among students and others in the school community, then perhaps the school needs better diversity training.
""I don't think it was maliciously intended,"" he noted to the Union Leader, ""but I think it sets a precedent that I don't think we want to have.""
Mylott also told the paper he'll address the issue at next Thursday's school board meeting.
What did the superintendent have to say? Epping School District Superintendent Valerie McKenney told WFXT that two students were asked to change their clothing but didn't mention what the students were wearing. She added to the station that an investigation has been ongoing since Tuesday and that ""we will take steps to remedy this situation for all parties involved and ensure that this type of situation never happens again in any Epping school.""
Image source: WFXT-TV video screenshot
The MacKenzie family told the station they were planning on meeting with the principal Friday morning
What else did the student have to say? ""It's just a shirt, and it only says 'Trump Make America Great Again'; it doesn't say anything like 'Build a Wall,' so I don't get how it could be offensive, how it could be disrespectful,"" Ciretta added to WFXT.
She added to the Union Leader that it would've been better if the principal let her wear her clothing and made it clear that if anyone harassed her during the day that she should report it to administration so the problem could be addressed.
""I don't think I should have been told to cover it up,"" Ciretta told the paper.
What do her parents have to say? Ciretta's parents, Jason and Rose MacKenzie, told the Union Leader they were surprised by the principal's actions, adding that their daughter bought her MAGA shirt during her eighth-grade trip to Washington, D.C., last year.
Image source: WFXT-TV video screenshot
Rose MacKenzie told the paper she emailed Principal Ernest and questioned his decision.
The Union Leader said his response read, in part, that ""we need to separate political views from patriotism. In today's climate it is important to not mix church or state.""
She told the paper she believes Ernest was looking out for Ciretta in case others bothered her at school, and that it's sad he had to think twice about the clothing issue.
""I think it's a good time for people to stop and reflect: 'Am I teaching my child to be respectful of other people's opinions?' In my opinion the school shouldn't be put in that position,"" Rose MacKenzie added to the Union Leader.
She also told the paper that the ""real problem"" adults aren't practicing tolerance and respect — and so neither are children.
Jason MacKenzie told the Union Leader the decision was the ""easy way out"" and that it could have been more of a teachable moment for all students.
""Is censorship the answer or talking about it?"" he asked the paper. ""I thought it was the wrong way out.""
He also told WFXT that politics should be openly discussed at school.
""We don't want politics to be totally removed from school, it needs to be in school,"" Jason MacKenzie also told the station, adding that ""the way they went about it was remove everything; you don't want that."""
President Trump confirms he's considering shipping illegal immigrants to 'sanctuary cities',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-confirmer-considering-sending-illegals-to-sanctuary-cities,"President Donald Trump has said that he would be in support of immigration officials shipping illegal immigrants from the border and dropping them off in ""sanctuary cities ."" Sanctuary cities have laws in place to prevent cooperation between local officials and federal immigration authorities.
However, according to The Washington Post , senior attorneys working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement had already dismissed the idea as illegal, and the head of the agency had called it ""inappropriate.""
What's the story? On Thursday, the Post published a story saying that the Trump administration was considering releasing illegal immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities, in order to punish those who oppose the president's immigration policies.
According to the Post, one proposed drop off point for these immigrants was Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) district in San Francisco.
A spokeswoman for Pelosi denounced the ""administration's cynicism and cruelty"" and hopes of ""[u]sing human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.""
According to the report, ICE ""rejected the idea as inappropriate."" The person at ICE responsible for this was Matthew Albence, who is now the acting director of the agency. The Post also said that ""senior ICE attorneys told Albence and others that the plan was inappropriate and lacked a legal basis.""
MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff tweeted that a ""former DHS official"" from the Trump administration had also said that the plan was ""so illegal.""
An official from the Trump administration told the Post that the proposal was ""just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion.""
What happened now? But on Friday, a day after the story ran, Trump seemed to have restarted that discussion.
Trump tweeted, ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only. The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy — so this should make them very happy!""
According to the Center for Immigration Studies , as of March 18 there were 33 sanctuary cities and 141 sanctuary counties in the United States. Eight state governments also have sanctuary laws: California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont."
Couple arrested after allegedly giving laxative-laced cookies to a group of striking school workers,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/couple-arrested-laxative-cookies-to-protesters,"An Iowa couple was thrown in jail on $1 million bonds earlier this week, after police were directed to a Facebook video showing the suspects allegedly committing multiple crimes — including crushing laxatives into batter for cookies that they later had delivered to protesters near their home.
What are the details? Bo Cosens, 29, and his girlfriend, Rachel Sharrock, 25, were reportedly bothered by vehicles honking in support of the on-strike employees protesting outside a nearby school. The couple voiced their frustrations on Facebook, explaining that they couldn't sleep due to all the commotion.
The duo allegedly cooked up laxative-laced sugar cookies and bragged about having them delivered to the workers, in a scheme to break up the picket line. CNN reported that while Cosens and Sharrack might have thought what they did was just a prank, police are taking the issue very seriously.
Law enforcement interviewed the protesters who confirmed receiving the baked goods, but no one had eaten them.
""They still had the plate of cookies, and I was able to confiscate them,"" Uhrichsville Police Sgt. Michael Hickman told the Canton Repository . ""We're currently looking for a lab to send the cookies in for testing to confirm that, in fact, that those have laxatives in them.""
One protester told WKYC-TV she was shocked after finding out what they assumed had been a ""goodwill offering"" from the couple was actually sent with malice. She expressed relief that none of the workers' children had stumbled across the cookies and gotten sick.
Anything else? The suspects did more than just show off their baking skills in the two-hour Facebook video. Police said Cosens threatened to get a gun and shoot the protesters during his rant, and also made an apparent drug deal in the footage posted to his social media account.
Cosens and Sharrock have each been charged with a felony for contaminating a substance for human consumption, and misdemeanors of complicity, disorderly conduct, and permitting drug abuse. Police are pursuing an additional felony against Cosens for trafficking drugs in a school zone."

What are the details? Johnson revealed the news in a March 22 Facebook post.
""K-LOVE has decided that they will not run any promos for my movie, Unplanned. So, a Christian radio network won't advertise for a pro-life movie,"" she wrote.

Activists pay for giant pro-life video in Times Square as a 'wake-up call' against NY's abortion extremism,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/giant-pro-life-video-in-times-square,"A giant video advertisement running in New York City's Times Square this week features powerful pro-life messages that Students for Life of America hope will grab New Yorkers' — including Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's — attention.
""The extremism of New York's new abortion law is a wake-up call to pro-life Americans to get active,"" SFLA President Kristan Hawkins said in a news release . ""The Pro-Life Generation has arrived to vote out abortion.""
The ad, which started its three-day run Wednesday, coincided with the group's annual gala, ""Called to Bring Light to the Darkness,"" along with peaceful protests in Times Square.
What's the story?
The pro-life student organization is speaking out against the state's recently passed Reproductive Health Act, which allows a woman to abort her baby up to the point of birth.
""Late term abortion and infanticide for babies born during abortions are barbaric and represent the human rights issue of our day,"" Hawkins said. ""The Pro-life Generation will not forget the least of these among us, mothers and their pre-born infants, who deserve our help and support.""
Three women are featured holding pro-life messages in the 15-second video displayed on a 50-foot-tall screen. It runs about every three minutes in rotation with other ads.
""I reject abortion extremism,"" one sign reads, along with statistics that show only 7 percent of millennials support New York's new abortion laws.
""I don't trust Planned Parenthood,"" another sign reads. ""Today, Planned Parenthood will end the lives of 910 human beings.""
And, ""I am the Pro-Life generation,"" reads the third sign. ""The pro-life generation has arrived to vote out abortion extremism.""
Tens of thousands of visitors in Times Square are expected to see the video which will be played at least 720 times during its run.
Students for Life demonstrators stood along the sidewalk on Thursday holding 910 pink crosses. The crosses that were linked together symbolized the number of babies killed through abortion each day by Planned Parenthood.
""When I asked our supporters if they wanted to send a pro-life message in Times Square, the answer was a resounding YES,"" Hawkins said.
The group's demonstration was part of its Planned Parenthood Truth Tour across 130 college campuses. The organization hopes to bring attention to the ""abysmal standard of care that women endure in New York as a result of the Reproductive Health Act,"" according to the release.
What else?
SFLA said it had to fight to have its message featured in Times Square.
""We had to fight to have our message heard as twice companies pulled the plug on our custom-made ad after intensive negotiations,"" Hawkins said. ""But we don't give up on college campuses, even when facing threats of violence, and we didn't give up on sending a message to the vast majority of New Yorkers who reject infanticide and are horrified by the abortion extremism recently legalized in New York.""

Boston Globe op-ed suggests restaurant waitstaff ‘tamper’ with Republicans’ food,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/boston-globe-op-ed-tamper-with-repubicans-food,"The Boston Globe is under fire after publishing an opinion piece suggesting that restaurant waitstaff tamper with Republicans' — particularly former President Trump staffers' — food.
What are the details of the article? Opinion writer Luke O'Neil wrote the article , which has since been deleted, titled ""Keep Kirstjen Nielsen unemployed and eating Grubhub over her sink.""
O'Neil seemed to suggest that Republicans and former President Donald Trump staffers should be punished for not being Democrats or liberals.
""As for the waiters out there, I'm not saying you should tamper with anyone's food, as that could get you into trouble,"" O'Neill wrote in his article. ""You might lose your serving job. But you'd be serving America. And you won't have any regrets years later.""
O'Neil also admitted that one of his life's ""biggest regrets"" is not urinating in conservative pundit Bill Kristol's food when O'Neil was a server.
""One of the biggest regrets of my life is not pissing in Bill Kristol's salmon,"" O'Neil wrote. ""I was waiting on the disgraced neoconservative pundit and chief Iraq War cheerleader about 10 years ago at a restaurant in Cambridge and to my eternal dismay, some combination of professionalism and pusillanimity prevented me from appropriately seasoning his entree.""
You can read the original article via web archive here .
What is being said now? Boston Globe editors apologized to readers in a note Thursday, and explained that O'Neil is not a staff writer for the publication.
""The Globe Opinion page has removed from its website an April 10 column by Luke O'Neil on former homeland security chief Kirstjen Nielsen because it did not receive sufficient editorial oversight and did not meet Globe standards,"" the statement read. ""The Globe regrets its lack of vigilance on the matter. O'Neil is not on staff.""
Before completely scrapping the article, the Globe attempted to salvage the mess.
""A version of this column as originally published did not meet Globe standards and has been changed,"" the statement read. ""The Globe regrets the previous tone of the piece.""
Has O'Neil said anything? O'Neil issued an apology in a brief and sarcastic statement.
""I am sorry for my commentary regarding the warden of the baby jail,"" O'Neil told The Wrap in a statement.
“In the famously left wing media, you can write op-eds advocating for turning Muslim weddings into bloodbaths forever but if you say human rights violators or war criminals deserve a pube on their salad it's over the line,"" he added.
O'Neil told The Washington Post that while he isn't necessarily an advocate for defiling conservatives' meals, he does believe that former Trump staffers should be harassed in public.
""I wasn't really advocating to piss in somebody's food, that's crazy,"" O'Neil said, adding to the outlet that he was a regular contributor at the Globe. ""But I do think these people should be made uncomfortable in public. I don't think that's a ... radical idea.""
He added, ""I do not apologize for it personally whatsoever.""

Lori Loughlin reportedly believes she did nothing that any other wealthy mom wouldn't do in college admissions scandal,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/lori-loughlin-believes-she-did-what-any-rich-mom-would-do,"Actress Lori Loughlin refused to accept a plea deal and believes she has done nothing that any other mother in her financial situation would do in the college admissions scandal, a source close to the actress reportedly told People magazine .
""From the beginning, she didn't want to take a deal, because she felt that she hadn't done anything that any mom wouldn't have done, if they had the means to do so,"" the unnamed source said, according to the report. ""To her, it wasn't egregious behavior. Was it entitled and perhaps selfish? Perhaps. But she didn't see it as being a legal violation.""
The ""Full House"" actress, along with her husband fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid about $500,000 in bribes to ensure their daughters, Isabella Rose Giannulli, 20, and Olivia Jade Giannulli, 19, were accepted to the University of Southern California, according to prosecutors. Coaches falsely recruited the girls as athletes to the university's crew team. Neither of the girls participated in the sport.
""It's just taking some time for it to sink in that what she was allegedly doing could be considered illegal,"" the source said, according to the magazine.
The couple is among some 50 wealthy people who were charged last month in the biggest college admissions cheating scandal ever prosecuted in the U.S.
What has happened since the charges?
Last week, Loughlin and her husband appeared for a brief hearing in a federal court in Boston.
The couple has rejected all plea deals that would result in jail time. Each faced 18 to 24 years behind bars if found guilty of their crimes.
""They weren't ready to accept that,"" the source, who is familiar with the legal discussions in the case, told People. ""They're really not seeing how serious this is.""
On Tuesday, federal prosecutors slapped Loughlin and her husband with additional charges of money laundering. Each additional indictment could land them in jail for up to an additional 20 years.
And the reality has begun to sink in.
""They were offered the carrot and the stick,"" the source told People . ""The carrot was that this can all go away and you can serve your time and put it behind you. Remember, they were facing 20 years, even before the latest charges. The stick was that [the prosecution] would and could pile on more serious charges.""
Now, they're trying to determine their next move.
""They decided to roll the dice, and it may have been a bad gamble. Now they're in worse shape than before,"" the source said.
But Loughlin's chances of negotiating a plea bargain with little jail time have likely faded.
""Obviously, the deal, if any, will be different than if she had taken a deal a week ago [before the latest charge],"" the source continued. ""She's a smart woman and she realizes that. But she is amenable to discussing how to put this behind everyone now. She's ready for this to go away.""
The couple remains free on bail.
What else? Actress Felicity Huffman, who was also charged, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.
""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community,"" Huffman said in a statement. ""I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.""
The ""Desperate Wives"" actress faces up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and fines. She's expected to appear in court May 21."
Google blasted for labeling pro-life movie 'Unplanned' as 'propaganda',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/google-labled-unplanned-movie-propaganda,"The pro-life movie ""Unplanned"" has faced nothing if not an uphill battle ever since it readied to hit movie screens .
A big case in point was Twitter suspending the movie's account on its opening weekend while the film's Twitter followers inexplicably plunged to under 200 when it had amassed over 200,000 just hours after the suspension. Both the follower count and suspension were soon reversed, but the damage was done.
Now another tech giant has joined the fray.
What happened? Kelsey Bolar of the Daily Signal pointed out Thursday that Google labeled ""Unplanned"" as a ""drama/propaganda"":
""Who knew that 'propaganda' was a movie genre?"" she tweeted along with a screenshot of Google's search results. ""Google once again exposing its gross political bias."" Fox News said it verified the search results.
Another Twitter user compared Google search results of ""Unplanned"" with Google search results of left-leaning movies such as Vice"" — an unflattering look at former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney — and Michael Moore's documentaries, the network said, adding that Google didn't label the latter movies as propaganda.
Fox News also said it researched Google results of the ""God's Not Dead"" film series and documentaries by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza — and again, none of them were labeled ""propaganda"" either.
What did Google have to say?
A Google spokesperson told Fox News that its ""Knowledge Graph"" analyzed web content on ""Unplanned"" and that a large volume of it described the movie as propaganda and created the label.
""When we're made aware of disputed facts in our Knowledge Graph, we work to fix the issues, as we've done in this case,"" the spokesperson told Fox News, which reported that Google updated its search results so that ""propaganda"" no longer appears.
Perhaps not coincidentally, feminist comic Samantha Bee called ""Unplanned"" an ""anti-choice propaganda movie"" during a recent ""Full Frontal"" episode.
Anything else? ""Unplanned"" also received an R-rating prior to its release for ""some disturbing/bloody images"" — which means that while a 15-year-old girl can get an abortion without parental consent, she can't enter a theater to watch ""Unplanned"" without a parent or guardian.
Glenn Beck last week sat down with Abby Johnson — the former Planned Parenthood clinic director who became a pro-life activist and is the subject of ""Unplanned."" Check out their conversation:

Protester rushes stage and throws 'bleach-like substance' at Daily Wire's Michael Knowles during a talk at a university,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/protester-rushes-stage-and-throws-bleach-like-substance-at-daily-wires-michael-knowles-during-a-talk-at-a-university,"A protester rushed the stage and threw a ""bleach-like substance"" at the Daily Wire's Michael Knowles during a speech he was giving at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, titled, ""Men are not women.""
Wait ... what happened? In a video posted by the Daily Wire, Knowles is giving his talk while hecklers try to shout him down.
""I didn't think I was this intimidating,"" he quipped.
""I believe that gentleman just threw paint on me,"" he commented, later noting that he didn't ""know what this substance is"" and speculating that it could be ""milk."" The Daily Wire described it as ""a bleach-like substance.""
He applauded security for taking the culprit down, before continuing his lecture.
""I think whatever sort of paint that guy tried to throw on me, I think it mostly landed on the lectern and on my speech. I've got a very glittery speech about how men are not women,"" he said with a laugh.
Periodically throughout the video, protesters can be seen at the door trying to force their way past security. Protesters were yelling slogans including ""trans rights are human rights,"" ""respect my existence,"" and ""hands up, don't shoot.""
After the incident, Knowles tweeted, ""A student tried to squirt bleach on me during my speech tonight. Lucky for me [h]e was a left-winger and couldn't even shoot a squirt gun!""
""These are the people conservatives on campus are up against,"" he remarked.
Knowles later clarified that authorities had informed him it was not bleach but an ""unknown odorous liquid."" He snarked that it ""appears the attacker was a hoaxer who was fine getting charged with assault but wanted to avoid a felony.""
What did the university say? In a tweet of its own, the university said, ""We have a responsibility to allow free speech, but we cannot condone physical disruptions of peaceful activities. We believe free speech can be exercised constructively in a way that doesn't put people at risk. We are gathering facts and will review campus policies & procedures."""
NYC Council passes bill to block employers from drug testing job applicants. Mayor de Blasio expected to sign.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-bill-blocks-employers-from-drug-testing-applicants,"The New York City Council approved this week a bill that would block many employers from forcing job applicants to undergo marijuana drug testing, the New Tork Times reported.
New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams sponsored the legislation that passed Tuesday in a 40-4 vote.
The legislation is the latest in a series of moves to ease marijuana restrictions in New York City while efforts to legalize marijuana have slowed at the state level.
""I'm proud that the city has taken action where the federal and the state government have stalled,"" Williams said, according to the Times.
Who would the bill affect? Both public and private employers in New York City would be affected by the law, as well as employers with headquarters outside the city.
Williams told the newspaper that it's not clear how many employers currently require drug testing.
The council also passed a bill that would prohibit marijuana testing for those on probation.
Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for the mayor, told the Times that Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration fully supports the bills, which are headed to his desk for his signature.
The legislation would take effect one year after the bills are signed.
Are there any exemptions? The law would not apply to industries where safety is a factor, including law enforcement, construction workers, and those who supervise children.
It would not exempt federal and state employees who are subject to drug testing. The law would not change federal drug screening requirements mandated by the government on truck drivers and pilots, among others.
If someone on the job appears to be under the influence of drugs, the employer could have them tested.
What do supporters say? Dionna King, a policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Times that she believes it's a positive move that could help remove the stigma attached to pot use.
""Through this legislation, there will still be a good number of folks who will no longer have to submit to testing just to get employment,"" King said.
What do opponents say? But some business leaders believe the bill is another example of government overreach by the City Council.
""This is another instance where City Council is interfering in the relationship between employees and employers,"" said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which represents business leaders."

He formally announced his bid for the Democratic nomination in a video released on social media .
This week on Glenn Beck's ""2020 Candidate Profile"" series, Glenn looked beyond former Vice President Joe Biden's troubles with touchiness, and did a deep-dive into the Democratic presidential candidate's alleged dirty dealings in the Ukraine.
After crediting journalists John Solomon and Peter Schweizer for their investigative fact-finding, Glenn launched into a detailed explanation of how Biden steered billions of dollars in aid to the Ukraine, while his son, Hunter Biden, raked in millions through a deal with a Ukrainian energy company.
""This blurs the ethical line so much that you can't even make out the line anymore. What Hunter Biden did may be technically legal, but it is grotesque. And the vice president should never have allowed this on his watch,"" Glenn said. ""This is as bad as anything the Clintons have done.""

He discovered two men had been following him, and as he got outside his northeast Philadelphia house, the two men confronted the 41-year-old victim with a gun and a crowbar and tried to rob him, police told WPVI-TV .
""A guy came behind him and then put a gun behind him and told him to open the door and let him in,"" the man's wife told the station off camera. ""He wanted to come to our house.""
No way But the homeowner refused to back down and began fighting with the crooks, WPVI said, pushing and kicking to keep them from getting into his house.
His wife explained to the station what happened next.
""I opened the door — not all the way — and my husband's right at the door. The guy's two steps down. He still tried to kick him while my husband sneaked in quickly. And we slammed the door shut,"" she told WPVI.
The couple locked the door and called 911, the station said.
One suspect caught Police arrived on the scene and spotted the two suspects in a backyard, WPVI noted.

""They chased the one male,"" Chief Inspector Scott Small told the station. ""That 38-year-old perpetrator was positively identified by the homeowner and his wife.""

The suspect in custody will be charged with attempted robbery and other offenses, WPVI reported. The only description of the suspect who got away was that he was wearing dark clothing, the station added.
Nothing was taken from the home, and no one was injured, WPVI noted, and police found the crowbar they believe one of the suspects used.

'Things could've been a lot worse' The detective told the station it's a good thing the couple fought back.
""Great job done by the homeowner and his wife fighting off these two would-be robbers,"" Small told WPVI. ""Things could've been a lot worse. So it's a pretty good ending because we made one apprehension.""
Still, the homeowner's wife told the station they will likely move.

School suspends 2 students for sharing photos at gun range. Now the ACLU is helping the students sue the school.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/school-suspends-2-students-for-sharing-photos-at-gun-range-here-comes-the-lawsuit,"The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit on behalf of two high school students who received suspensions in 2018 for sharing personal photos of themselves at a firing range on social media.
What's the backstory? The suspension took place in March 2018 after the students — who have since graduated from the high school in question — shared the pictures in question on Snapchat.
One of the posts, according to Insider NJ, read ""hot stuff,"" and ""If there's ever a zombie apocalypse, you know where to go.""
Viewers of the posts apparently took issue with the teens at a legal shooting range with legal firearms and contacted the school to report the students.
As a result, school officials suspended the teens from school.
Much of the public did not react well to the school's decision, and parents flooded a 2018 school board meeting demanding that the policy — which they believed violated the teens' First and Second Amendment rights — be reversed.
What about the lawsuit? The ACLU of New Jersey filed the suit in federal district court on Wednesday along with law firm Pashman Stein Walder Hayden.
Alexander Shalom, a senior supervising attorney for the ACLU, said that the school had no right to suspend the students, or even discipline them as it pertained to the photos.
""There was no threat,"" Shalom said. ""No unlawful behavior whatsoever. That is classic speech. They communicated something to their friends off of school grounds, off of school property, off of school time, and the school simply doesn't have the authority to discipline then for what they're doing outside of school time.""
Shalom explained that school officials didn't even contact authorities to report any threat.
""One of [the teens] referenced the zombie apocalypse, so there could be nothing that could be perceived as an actual threat there,"" he added. ""I want schools to take threats seriously. What I don't want them to do is think they have the ability and the authority to discipline students for their lawful activities off of school grounds.""
The suit seeks to have the suspensions removed from the students' record, and an official note placed in the teens' academic records noting that the school violated the teens' rights. The suit also seeks a court injunction demanding that the school district not discipline students for protected speech when not on school grounds, and adjust corresponding school policies."
A fugitive in Pennsylvania mocked the sheriff's office on Facebook — and led police right to her,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/fugitive-mocks-police-reveals-location-on-facebook,"A wanted woman in Pennsylvania mocked the police in the comments section of a Facebook post, and led police right to her .
What's the story? On March 27, the Greene County Sheriff's Office in Pennsylvania posted photos of their top 10 most wanted fugitives, including a woman named Chloe Jones who was wanted for failure to appear for plea court in a simple assault case.
Jones, under the name Chloe Tyler but using her own profile picture, commented on this post ""Do you guys do pick up or delivery?"" With four laughing emojis. She then proceeded to respond to people in the comments at least 30 different times.
But Jones made a crucial mistake while arguing with people in the comments section: She revealed her current location. As most people who are not Chloe Jones would probably expect, this led to her arrest.
After other commenters called her out and told her to turn herself in, Jones felt the need to inform them that she had only ignored her court appearance because she was at the trauma center at Ruby Memorial Hospital.
She also said that she had only been summoned to court for ""a simple assault case ... a plea deal for a fight I had in jail with another girl.""
Another commenter posted a screenshot from the Judicial System of Pennsylvania's website , showing 29 separate charges that had been filed against Jones since 2014, including driving without a license, driving an unregistered vehicle, reckless driving, theft, and harassment. According to judicial system records , she had been found guilty of eight of these charges and pleaded guilty to another 14.
How did the sheriff's office respond? On Monday, the sheriff's office posted on their Facebook that ""Ms. Chloe Jones and her witty comments are taking a hiatus from our Facebook comments section due to the jail not having internet for her to use."""
Georgetown students vote overwhelmingly in favor of paying a slavery reparations fee as part of their tuition,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/georgetown-students-vote-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-paying-reparations,"Georgetown University's undergraduate student body has overwhelmingly passed a referendum to add a reparations fee to their tuition. If approved by the school's board of directors, a fund would be set up for the descendants of 272 slaves sold by the Jesuit institution nearly 200 years ago.
What are the details? The New York Times reported that in 1838, the priests who ran the nation's premier Catholic institution of higher learning — known as Georgetown College back then — sold the slaves owned by the school in order to keep it afloat. After news of the sale surfaced in recent years, the university apologized, renamed two campus buildings in honor of individuals who had been sold, and implemented an admissions program giving favor to the descendants of any of the 272 slaves.
But many students say more should be done to try to right the wrongs of the past. Student leadership put forward a reparations proposal that would tack on an additional $27.20 tuition fee each semester, to go to the relatives of the slaves. The amount was selected to symbolize the number of slaves sold without placing too heavy a financial burden on students.
According to ABC News , not all students were on board . During a discussion ahead of the vote, some argued it wasn't their responsibility to pay to correct the actions of the institution from long ago — especially while working their way through college. Others expressed concern over how the funds would be spent.
On Thursday, the measure passed overwhelmingly with two-thirds of the vote. If Georgetown's board of directors give it a nod, the fund is expected to raise roughly $380,000 annually.
How did the university respond? In a statement to ABC, the university's media relations manager explained, ""Student referendums help to express important student perspectives but do not create university policy and are not binding.
""The university will carefully review the results of the referendum, and regardless of the outcome, will remain committed to engaging with students, Descendants, and the broader Georgetown community and addressing its historical relationship with slavery."""

""I just read [Cuomo's comment] as somebody who wanted to defend that fact that nobody in broadcast television wanted to hire him, I guess, or he couldn't get the job that he wanted,"" Todd said.
""I don't know what it was, but he was awfully defensive so he took shots at other people,"" he concluded.
He added that Tapper is his friend and that he was ""angrier"" than anyone about Cuomo's comments.
Todd was made the comments to WABC in New York in response to a jab from Cuomo published on Wednesday.
""Anderson Cooper is a hell of a lot bigger than any male anywhere on network television,"" Cuomo said in the interview.
""I would argue that Chuck Todd ain't Jake Tapper,"" Cuomo added. ""Jake Tapper has a much bigger footprint in politics than Chuck Todd does.""
The Hill reported that Chuck Todd's Sunday program has almost four times as many average viewers as Tapper's daily news show on CNN.
Both MSNBC and CNN saw enormous ratings declines after the Mueller investigation ended, while Fox News saw a great increase in their viewer numbers.

Here's the stunning percentage of Millennials who regret taking a loan for college - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/millennials-and-student-debt,"A new poll shows the stunning percentage of Millennials who regret taking a loan out in order to attend college.
The Business Insider/Morning Consult poll says that four out of every ten of indebted Millennials regret going to college: 42 percent.
56 percent of Millennials said it was worth incurring a debt load to go college, with only 2 percent answering that they don't know.
That is a much higher percentage than Baby Boomers who were polled - 27 percent said college was not worth the debt load, while 68 percent said it was worth it.
Student debt has become a key political issue as some Democrats have called for the government to make college free, and others want to forgive the mounting debt that many say are crippling them from obtaining success.
The poll shows that among those who thought that college was worth attending, 64 percent had already paid off their loans, and 48 percent were still paying off their loans.
The total student loan debt has been estimated at about $1.6 trillion.
Despite that attitude about college and the ballooning student debt, experts say Millennials don't behave much differently from their forebears.
""Right now, millennials are in their 20s and 30s, and the types of financial decisions they're making are typical of someone in their 20s and 30s,"" said NerdWallet expert Sara Rathner.
""In 40 years,"" she explained, ""millennials will probably be in much the same place as baby boomers are today.""

Liberals melt down over this tweet President Trump slamming Omar's 9/11 comments,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/trump-tweets-about-ilhan-omar,"President Donald Trump once again poked the hornet's nest of social media when he tweeted a video meant to criticize Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) over her dismissive comments about the horrific 9/11 terror attacks.
""WE WILL NEVER FORGET!"" tweeted the president on Friday with a video compiling Omar's controversial comments with images from the 9/11 attack.
Omar has defended her comments describing the death of thousands of U.S. citizens by an Islamist terror attack as ""some people did something."" Other Democrats, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), stood by their fellow freshman colleague.
The reaction from many on the left to the presidential tweet was one of exasperation and horrified dismay. Many called on Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend the president's account or delete his video.
""I can't believe I'm saying this but please report the President of the United States who has just tweeted out this incendiary video,"" tweeted feminist writer Aimee Vanderpool. ""It's another dog whistle for some unhinged person to hurt her, just like the bombs to the media and the shooter at the synagogue. DESPICABLE.""
""While the CIA was top secret in its efforts leading up to assassinating JFK,"" tweeted progressive journalist Jordan Chariton, ""this is the president of the United States openly inciting people to bring harm to a sitting Muslim Congresswomen. HOW DOES THIS NOT MERIT A SUSPENSION @jack @Twitter?""
"".@Jack please take this video by Trump off Twitter,"" tweeted Democratic columnist David Weissman. ""Incitement doesn't always have to be words. You know how crazy his base can be with previous terror attacks that were committed them. @IlhanMN's life is worth more than some news worthy tweet. @TwitterSafety please do your job.
""Every American should be disgusted by @realDonaldTrump's continued incitement against Rep. @IlhanMN,"" tweeted CAIR Director Nahad Awad.
""Trump going full anti-Muslim here- Trump intercut 9/11 with a Muslim speaking,"" said Muslim comedian and activist Dean Obeidallah. ""This is just like the anti-Muslim videos I see from hate groups.""
After a serious of accusations over other comments that appeared to contain anti-Semitic tropes, it was reported that Democrats were already seeking to replace the controversial representative by searching out for another politician to defeat her in the next primary.
Here's the latest on Omar's 9/11 controversy: Rep. Ilhan Omar blasted for 9/11 remarks www.youtube.com"
Dan Crenshaw responds politely but forcefully to spiteful accusations AOC and Omar,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/crenshaw-fires-back-at-omar-and-ocasio,"Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) had a polite but forceful response to spiteful accusations from Reps. Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) that he wasn't supportive enough of the troops.
""It's terrorists who killed almost 3,000 Americans, and we should talk about it that way,"" Crenshaw told NBC News on Friday. ""We should talk about it with deference.""
He was speaking about the controversy surrounding comments from Rep. Omar that appeared to dismiss the gravity of the 9/11 terror attacks by describing it as ""some people did something.""
'Don't play the victim card' Crenshaw addressed criticism that the comments were taken out of context.
""It was not taken out of context, by the way, there are a lot of claims that it was,"" he explained, ""of course it wasn't. I think everyone should just look at the clip and decide for themselves. I don't think it's out of line to simply call that out and criticize it.""
He called it the ""height of partisanship"" that both sides can't come together and agree that it was improper to ""diminish"" the attack on U.S. soil.
""All Representative Omar had to do was really, I don't know, explain herself, say whatever she wants,"" Crenshaw continued.
""Say she didn't mean it,"" he offered, ""diffuse the situation, but don't double down, alright? Don't play the victim card and don't start making accusations of me — I just think that was uncalled for.""
Crenshaw didn't shrink from citing his own service in the military when he responded to the Democrats who claimed that he didn't do enough to support the military. Among those was Ocasio Cortez, who tweeted a scathing attack on the Afghanistan war veteran.
""You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victim's Compensation Fund, yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes,"" she tweeted in an attempt to deflect from Omar's 9/11 comments.
'I'm really disappointed in them' ""This is a really dishonest attack, and let me tell you how I am for 9/11 victims and 9/11 first-responders. I'm the guy who went overseas to make sure this never happens again, to take the fight to the enemy that committed these attacks,"" Crenshaw responded.
""I would go back and do it every day if I could,"" Crenshaw added. ""So to say that kind of attack, that is the height of partisanship and I'm really disappointed in them saying that, especially coming from New York.""
Crenshaw had already shot down a suggestion from Omar that he was inciting violence against her by criticizing her.

Bratcher, who plays real-life abortion clinic worker-turned-pro-life activist Abby Johnson, recently revealed some of the on-set “Unplanned"" prayer moments that she believes deeply inspired the cast and crew.
One of the most powerful scenes in ""Unplanned"" — a film currently showing in theaters across America — comes when Bratcher portrays the moment Johnson experienced complications from taking an abortion pill. The actress recently told PureFlix.com's ""Pure Talk"" that the scene was the ""most difficult"" to perform — but that prayer made a massive impact .

Shocking ruling from liberal 9th Circuit Court hands President Trump huge immigration victory,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ninth-circuit-trump-victory-asylum-request-policy,"The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has traditionally ruled against the Trump administration, handed President Donald Trump a rare immigration victory Friday night.
What are the details? The appeals court issued a stay against a lower court decision — which came just four days earlier — that blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that forced migrants to wait in Mexico while U.S. authorities processed their asylum requests.
However, the stay was only temporary. The court will consider extending the stay sometime next week, according to the New York Times .
The court gave civil liberty groups until Tuesday to submit arguments for why the policy should be overthrown, while giving the Justice Department until Wednesday to submit arguments for why the policy should remain in place.
What's the background? On Monday, Federal District Court Judge Richard Seeborg granted an injunction against the Trump administration's policy . Seeborg claimed the policy violated existing immigration law. He also claimed the president did not have the power to enforce the policy.
Seeborg's injunction was set to go into effect Friday, which explains the emergency stay from the 9th Circuit.
In December, the Trump administration rolled out a new policy that forced migrants who entered the U.S. illegally to wait in Mexico while U.S. authorities processed their asylum requests.
The policy sought to end the controversial practice of so-called ""catch and release,"" where non-criminal migrants would essentially be released into the general population while courts decided their asylum requests."
College students and alum outraged and 'shaking' that Mike Pence will speak at commencement,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-students-outraged-and-shaking-that-mike-pence-will-speak-at-commencement,"The picture of the aggrieved and trembling college student unable to cope with hearing unpleasant things, or simply things with which they disagree, is fast becoming the face of higher education in the United States. It is therefore not a surprise that the invitation of Vice President Mike Pence to speak on a campus might result in some safe space complaining.
It is perhaps somewhat a surprise that, in this case, it's an evangelical Christian school: Taylor University. In the VP's own state of Indiana.
After it was announced that the Vice President of the United States would give the graduating students the honor of high office at their commencement, some students, and even alum and parents, went into meltdown. PJ Media's Tyler O'Neil has their reactions .
Naturally, there was a petition .
""Inviting Vice President Pence to Taylor University and giving him a coveted platform for his political views makes our alumni, faculty, staff and current students complicit in the Trump-Pence Administration's policies, which we believe are not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear,"" Alex Hoekstra, a former staffer for President Barack Obama and a 2007 Taylor University graduate, said in the petition.
Others proved more angry and visceral.
""I have never been made to feel so physically ill by an email before. Taylor University, you should be ashamed of yourselves,"" Claire Hadley, who graduated from Taylor in 2015, began in a long Facebook post . ""I am physically shaking. The fact that the school who claims to love and support me, and each of it's [ sic ] students and alum, would invite such a vile individual to speak on the most important day of the year??""
""VP Pence is no friend of mine. He does not support me. He does not support equality,"" Hadley declared. ""He does not uphold the values that are at the very core of the church, my own faith, and I would hope, of this University. He is rooted in hate. To stand beside President Trump would have been enough to put him on my watch list."" She argued that Mike Pence ""only values you if you fit in his very narrow, white, straight, box.""
""Taylor University, I feel personally attacked,"" she concluded. ""Please, I'm begging you. Don't do this.""
Lindsey Snyder, a 2014 graduate, said she emailed Taylor University President Lowell Haines. ""This invitation gravely concerns me, because whether intentional or not, it is politicizing Taylor University, aligning the school with the current administration,"" she reported writing. ""Many current and former Taylor students are adamantly against some of Pence's stances and will no doubt feel unsafe at their own graduation. Even if it was someone less controversial than Pence, having a political figure speak at commencement alights unnecessary and grievous conflict.""
There is so much more . Not everyone had the same reaction, and some among the student body and the alumni have responded. On Saturday, O'Neil reported that a counter-petition has been launched, and is picking up steam .
O'Neil spoke with one graduate, Kevin Holtsberry of the class of '94, who told him ""Inviting the sitting vice president of the United States, and former Indiana governor and congressman, to speak at commencement is not an attack on students, faculty or alumni with differing political views or opinions about Mike Pence,"" Kevin Holtsberry.
The fact that these students at a Christian university in middle America, in the state where Pence was the governor not that long ago, shows just how far the ""woke"" college experience has extended. It's not just coastal elites. It's right in your backyard."

As Fox News reported, that plan isn't just about no American paying for healthcare, or even nose jobs, it's about people who are not Americans, too. As in, people who are here illegally.
You see, rather than covering ""citizens"", the legislation Sanders unveiled this week would cover all ""residents"" in the United States. As Fox notes, that's ""a shift from the Affordable Care Act, which limited benefits to citizens, nationals and ""lawfully present"" immigrants. The House bill also prohibits the government from denying benefits because of ""citizenship status.""
More than that, as the Washington Examiner pointed out on Friday, it even aspires to cover those who can't meet the loose definition of resident. ""Even if an individual is not covered under a broad definition of 'residency' by the secretary of HHS, the federal government can take steps 'to ensure that every person in the United States has access to health care.'""
On Fox News on Saturday, Peter Doocy reported on the Medicare for all proposal, and if you listen, you can actually hear money burning. Watch:

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) broke her silence Saturday afternoon, responding to controversy that President Donald Trump ignited Friday when he tweeted out a video highlighting comments Omar made recently about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
What did Omar say? She claimed that ""each and every day"" the Trump administration attacks the foundational principles of America's founding. She also repeated several lies.
Thank you for standing with me – against an administration that ran on banning Muslims from this country – to fight for the America we all deserve.💪🏽
— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) April 13, 2019 Regarding Omar's claim that Trump's administration is guilty of ""cag[ing] children,"" TheBlaze previously reported :
In fact, an image of a child locked in what appears to be some form of cage — which went viral during the migrant crisis last summer that involved family separations — was actually from a staged protest in front of Dallas City Hall, according to fact-checker Snopes . Meanwhile, Trump's administration did not implement a policy ""banning Muslims."" Instead, Trump campaign on — and later implemented — a policy that temporarily prevented people from certain Muslim-majority countries, which are hotbeds for terrorism, from traveling to the U.S.
What's the background? On Friday, Trump tweeted a video criticizing Omar for recently referring to terrorists who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001 as ""some people who did something."" Omar's comments were spliced together with dramatic scenes from 9/11.
In response, Democrats accused the president of inciting violence against Omar. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), one of Omar's closest progressive allies, even exploited the Holocaust in her effort to condemn Trump.
At the center of controversy are comments Omar made while speaking at a CAIR fundraiser in March. CAIR, of course, has been connected to terrorist activity , and was even listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation case, which resulted in numerous convictions for providing material support to Hamas.
""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,"" Omar said at the event.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) ignited outrage Friday after she used a poem about the Holocaust to defend Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democrat who is embroiled in controversy herself.
What happened? On Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted a video criticizing Omar for referring to the Islamic terrorists who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001 as ""some people who did something."" The video spliced together Omar's controversial comments with footage from 9/11.
In response, Ocasio-Cortez urged members of Congress to condemn Trump for ""dangerous targeting"" of Omar.
""Members of Congress have a duty to respond to the President's explicit attack today.@IlhanMN's life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.
With her tweet, Ocasio-Cortez included a picture of the famous poem from German theologian Martin Niemöller, who was imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps from 1938-1945 for opposing Hitler's Nazi regime. Niemöller only narrowly escaped execution.
The poem, which is mounted on a wall at the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., reads:
First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
What was the reaction? Ben Shapiro — who is the biggest target of anti-Semitism online, according to the Anti-Defamation League — condemned Ocasio-Cortez's ""deeply disturbing"" comparison.
Others echoed Shapiro's sentiments:

Report: Former top Clinton aide running 'dark money' campaign to get Brett Kavanaugh fired from teaching job - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/clinton-aide-campaign-brett-kavanaugh,"Hillary Clinton's former campaign spokesman is leading a ""dark money"" campaign to get Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh fired from his summer teaching job at George Mason University, according to a new report.
What are the details? Fox News reported that Brian Fallon, who served as Clinton's 2016 national spokesman, is backing an effort to prevent Kavanaugh from teaching for the university this summer. Fallon leads Demand Justice, a progressive advocacy group that does not disclose its funding.
The effort, which has been dubbed ""Mason 4 Survivors,"" is circulating a petition that has so far garnered more than 5,000 signatures. The group is urging George Mason president Angel Cabrera to ""terminate AND void ALL contracts and affiliation with Brett Kavanaugh at George Mason University.""
""There is a historic amount of institutional negligence on your part to support survivors of sexual assault and the student body as a whole, which has bred a sense of mistrust and suffering within the Mason community and allies,"" the petition claims.
According to HuffPost , Fallon's group is running a Facebook advertisement campaign that targets anyone connected with George Mason University urging them to sign the petition. The ad also directs targeted users to sign a separate petition that calls on Congress to investigate Kavanaugh.
Though sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation process last, none of the accusations ever proved credible.
What's the background? It was announced last month that Kavanaugh would join George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a distinguished visiting professor. He is set to co-teach a two-credit course this summer in England called ""Creation of the Constitution.""
Kavanaugh's appointment was met with immediate pushback and protests .
Fortunately, Cabrera has defended Kavanaugh's appointment, saying in a statement last month that the university will not revoke Kavanaugh's appointment.
""I respect the views of people who disagreed with Justice Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation due to questions raised about his sexual conduct in high school. But he was confirmed and is now a sitting Justice,"" Cabrera said. ""The law school has determined that the involvement of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice contributes to making our law program uniquely valuable for our students."""
New York Press Club to honor CNN's Jim Acosta with 'Truth to Power' award,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nypc-jim-acosta-truth-to-power,"CNN's Jim Acosta was family booted from the White House press corps, and almost as famously returned to it, after fighting for the microphone and refusing to stop talking when he was directing remarks to President Trump last year.
The hallmark of Acosta's reporting, and indeed career, is as a person who battles Trump from the left, rather than as a reporter or uncoverer of truth in his own right.
Acosta's style - a sort of preachy monologue as opposed to traditional question and answer - doesn't sit will with a lot of conservative viewers, and he's faced a good deal of criticism over it, especially at Trump's rallies.
It is presumably on those grounds, his provocateur milieu, on which the New York Press club has decided to award him their ""Truth to Power"" award at their upcoming awards dinner.
For a refresher in how Acosta's job as Trump foil has sky-rocketed his career, you can do worse than to read this explainer from last year at the Daily Wire. But if you want a more recent example, Glenn Beck's biting commentary here is a must.
In the press release announcing his selection, the NYPC said the purpose of the award, which is named for journalist Gabe Pressman, is designed to honor """"an individual whose body of work challenges the power establishment and/or defends journalists.""
Perhaps it is meant specifically with regard to the incident with the White House revoking his credentials, against which Fox News joined all the other press organizations in protest, as opposed to his more general job of simply launching social-media quality liberal talking points at any conservative or republican unfortunate enough to be in front of his mic."

Trump beats Bernie Sanders in latest 2020 poll - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-beats-sanders-2020-poll,"Bernie Sanders is cleaning up when it comes to first quarter fundraising in the massive Dem primary. He's leading the gigantic pack of contenders by a big chunk of change. But in polling against President Trump? Not so much.
The latest numbers from Rasmussen show him losing in a hypothetical match-up. The nation survey, the results of which were posted on Friday, show Trump knocking down Sanders 47% to 44% among likely voters. That's a three percent lead in a poll with a 1.5% margin of error. (9% were undecided.)
Here's the exact wording of the question: ""If the presidential race in 2020 was between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, who would you vote for?""
On the other hand, in another hypothetical match-up - one that is slightly more hypothetical even if you take into account the lack of a formal announcement - Rasmussen finds a similar lead, but for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. In that one, the margin is 49% for Biden over 44% for Trump.
So a larger 5-point lead for Biden over Trump than the three pointer for Trump over Sanders.
Rasmussen writes of the match-ups they are polling:
Given the large number of candidates expected to enter the race for next year's Democratic nomination, Rasmussen Reports has opted to run a series of matchups over two-week cycles as the contest continues to develop. These longer cycles mean the matchup findings will be based on 5,000 respondents rather than the usual 1,000 for our regular surveys, and they lower the margin of error.
The survey of 5,000 Likely Voters was conducted on March 31-April 4 and April 7-11, 2019 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 1.5 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC . See methodology .
In a separate poll released on Friday, Muhlenberg College/Morning Call's survey on the Pennsylvania Democratic primary finds Biden beating Sanders , too. And Sanders ahead of the rest of the pack of candidates who have actually declared.
Combined with the abysmal fundraising for Democrats so far, it's looking like a rough primary and election no matter how you slice it.
Then again, polls can always change. Can't they, Secretary Clinton?"
Oakland's liberal mayor attacks Trump over immigration policies. Trump swings back with defiant challenge. - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/donald-trump-libby-schaaf-immigration,"President Donald Trump and Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) traded barbs on social media Saturday over the president's controversial immigration policies.
What's the background? Last week, the Washington Post revealed top White House aides once considered releasing detained migrants in ""sanctuary cities,"" which are almost exclusively Democratic-led progressive cities. Trump later confirmed he is considering enacting the policy.
In fact, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News' Jeanine Pirro Saturday that the administration is actively working with Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to begin sending illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities.
""They have said they wanted all of these illegal aliens into their communities,"" Gidley said. ""We're working with DHS, we're working with ICE, to try and make sure that happens because after all, it's what they want. They should not say 'This is retribution politically,' they should say, 'This is an olive branch.'""
What happened between Trump and Schaaf? After the Washington Post revealed the proposed policy, Schaaf, in an interview with KTVU-TV , called the policy idea an ""outrageous abuse of power,"" characterized it as un-American, and said the Trump administration essentially proposed using human beings as ""instruments of political payback.""
In a separate interview with CNN , Schaaf similarly denounced the proposed policy, but added that she is ""proud to be the mayor of a sanctuary city.""
Trump hit back at Schaaf on Saturday, questioning why non-sanctuary cities should be forced to carry the burden of caring for illegal immigrants when sanctuary cities already welcome them.
Schaaf swung back, accusing the president of ""fanning hate and division.""
About 30 minutes later, Trump responded by declaring the legal right to release illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities while demanding, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that California, a liberal safe haven, accept them.
Schaaf did not respond to Trump's last tweet."
Rep. Rashida Tlaib makes stunning accusation about Democratic Party leadership - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rashida-tlaib-democratic-leaderhip-accusation,"Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) over the weekend accused Democratic Party leadership of exploiting Muslim lawmakers, only using them to bolster the party's image of diversity, yet silencing them at the legislative drawing board.
What did she say? Amid controversy between President Donald Trump and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — stemming from the president criticizing remarks Omar made recently when she refused to denounce the 9/11 attackers as terrorists — Tlaib launched a broadside at her party's leadership.
The Michigan lawmaker is seemingly upset over what she believes is a failure by Democratic leadership to properly condemn Omar's critics.
""They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse. However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored,"" Tlaib charged. ""To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.""
Tlaib echoed comments from Maheen Ahmed, a legislative staffer in the California Assembly. Ahmed charged that the failure from Democratic leadership to defend Omar and ""subsequent lack of support from Democratic leadership continues to prove that this system was never meant for us.""
""Do not applaud diversity and the 'first' Muslims in any space if you're not willing to be a true ally and defend us,"" Ahmed said.
Tlaib and Omar are the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress.
What has Democratic leadership said? As Tlaib noted, party leaders have been somewhat muted on the issue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) condemned Trump for using 9/11 footage in his Omar criticism video — yet did not rebuke the president for criticizing Omar.
Meanwhile, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, though he initially dodged questions , rebuked the president over the weekend.
On the other hand, Democrats running for president — including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, and others — forcefully rebuked the president, even accusing Trump of inciting violence against Omar."

A man at the Mall of American in Minnesota apparently threw a 5-year-old boy over the third floor railing, and so far no one knows why. Police say the suspect, Emmanuel Aranda, 24, is cooperating.
WCCO-TV in Minnesota reported a witness heard the boy's mother shouting ""Everybody pray, everybody pray. Oh my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge.""
The child, Landen Hoffmann of Woodbury, Minnesota, fell over forty feet and suffered significant injuries, according to authorities.
The family posted about the terrible incident on social media, and a GoFundMe was started to raise money for the family during this horrific time of need. It was started by friends of the family after Landen's cousin April Hoffmann, posted an Instagram tribute.
""This is Landen, he is the sweetest kindest 5 year old you will ever meet. His soul is soft and gentle and instantly brings a smile to everybody he meets,"" the fundraiser reads. ""He is full of energy and life and enjoys soccer, playing with friends and family and playing hockey with his brother and sister.""
It relates the family's story. ""He was enjoying a day at the Mall of America with his mom and friend on Friday morning when a stranger maliciously grabbed him and threw him over the 3rd floor balcony for no apparent reason. The family doesn't know him and are completely clueless as to why this monster would target their family with this heinous act of violence.""
The fundraiser was over $400,000 by Sunday morning.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, revealed his campaign's main agenda on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, which focuses on gun control.
But just how far does Swalwell want to go? CNN host Jake Tapper asked tough questions to clarify Swalwell's vision.
What did Swalwell say? Last year, Swalwell said that semi-automatic ""military-style assault weapons,"" like the AR-15, should be outlawed. He advocated gun buybacks and criminally prosecuting those who do not comply with stiff gun control measures. Tapper pressed on that point.
""What's the punishment for people who don't hand in their guns, do they go to jail?"" Tapper asked.
""Well Jake, they would,"" Swalwell admitted, ""but I also offer an alternative, which would be to keep them at a hunting club or a shooting range. And the reason I have proposed this is because these weapons are so devastating.""
The California Democrat said ""fear"" is another reason the Second Amendment should be curtailed.
""But it's not just the violence that they've caused, it's the fear, the immeasurable fear that our children live in because they are still on our streets. I want to get rid of that fear, I want to do what Australia did, and New Zealand just recently did. I think this issue just needs some bold leadership to do it,"" Swalwell said.
Noting that most gun owners are law-abiding citizens and that the vast majority of firearm-related deaths in the U.S. are not related to ""military-style semi-automatic"" rifles, Tapper asked: ""Isn't it fair to say you actually do want to take away people's guns?""
Under his vision for America, Swalwell said Americans would retain possession of handguns, long rifles, and shotguns — just not the ""weapons of war."" He said:
You know, keep your pistols, keep your long rifles, keep your shotguns. I want the most dangerous weapons, these weapons of war, out of the hands of the most dangerous people. But when it comes to what else we can do, because I don't even suggest this is all we can do, I also want background checks. So do 73% of NRA members. I want to invest in gang violence prevention programs, especially in our cities.
I want more community oriented policing. My brother is a sheriff's athletic league police officer. He works in tough neighborhoods and helps them get kids out of the streets and into sports. There's a lot that we can do on this issue, but unless it's the number one issue for a president, it's just going to be one that we respond to shooting to shooting. I want to lead on it.
Finally, Swalwell claimed the Second Amendment ""is not an absolute right.""
Swalwell's admission came when Tapper asked if the Second Amendment should be repealed, which former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens advocated last year.
""No. I don't agree, but I think the greatest threat to the Second Amendment is doing nothing,"" Swalwell said. ""And the Second Amendment is not an absolute right.""
""Just like free speech, you can't shout fire in a theater or lie about the products you're selling, you can't own a bazooka, you can't own a tank, you can't own rocket propelled grenades, so we should put some limits in place, and I think the American people are with me,"" he continued. ""I'm no longer intimidated by the NRA. The moms and the kids, they are behind us on this issue, and I think it just takes leadership in Washington.""

Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley spoke with Fox News Channel's Jeanine Pirro on Saturday, and after he articulated the notion, Trump tweeted about it . Gidley indicated this an active plan that they are working on implementing right now.
""They are telling us you cannot keep family units who come here illegally and unlawfully at the southern border. You can't keep them at detention facilities. You can't deport them,"" said Gidley. ""The only thing you can do is, as an administration is, release them into American communities.""
""So, the president said listen, there are sanctuary cities out there where Democrats have said we welcome any and all whether they criminals, whether they are here illegally, seeking asylum, regardless. Anybody who disagrees with us is racist,"" he continued, putting the rationale into words. ""So the president said fine, I've got a great idea. We'd love to work with you guys to figure out exactly the best way to transport these people were here illegally and unlawfully and into your communities and your districts and your states.""
He added that no Democrats from those cities have come to the White House and said ""We love to work with the administration, send everybody to our town."""
Twice failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tells Dems how they should campaign to beat Trump,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-advice-2020-democrats,"Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who ran two failed presidential campaigns, recently offered Democrats running for president advice on how to best campaign against President Donald Trump.
Clinton's advice came despite her loss to Trump in 2016.
What did Clinton say? Speaking with CNN's Fareed Zakaria at Tina Brown's Women in the World summit Friday, Clinton offered Democrats running for president two pieces of advice.
""You really have to do two things simultaneously — and it's challenging,"" Clinton said.
""You do have to present what you want to do,"" she explained. ""What is your vision? What is your hope for our country? How do you see the future? What are you going to propose that will make a difference in the lives of Americans and maintain the values, the ideas of America in a very complex world?""
""So, you bare that responsibility. At the same time,"" Clinton continued, ""you have to be able to counter and ignore where possible, respond where necessary, to the diversion and distraction that we see working, unfortunately, by the current incumbent in the White House.""
Zakaria also asked Clinton to respond to comments from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is running for the Democratic nomination and recently told Washington Post magazine about Trump , ""at least he didn't go around saying that America was already great, like Hillary did.""
According to the Hollywood Reporter , Clinton responded: ""I don't want to comment on any of the candidates. Like I said, I think they have a lot to contribute not only to the Democratic party, but to the country. And it will be up to voters to decide who our nominee is.""
However, she later went on to criticize Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-All proposal, which would reportedly cover illegal immigrants .
""The specifics, though, matter,"" Clinton said. ""What are the details? How do we pay for it? Who is going to get what they need? There are a lot of complicated questions."""

What are the details? Mexico's National Immigration Institute announced that about 350 migrants broke down the border gate to enter Mexico, according to the Associated Press .
The agency said the migrants were ""hostile"" and ""aggressive."" Authorities also accused the migrants of attacking Mexican police in the border town of Metapa. The migrants later joined a larger caravan, of about 2,000, making their way north to the U.S.
One of the migrants who spoke to the AP, Claudia Jaqueline Sandoval said she is HIV positive. But that is not her reason for journeying north. Instead, money is scarce in her home country of Honduras, and she hopes to make a better life for her family in America.
According to the AP, there are already several caravans of migrants, including groups of several thousand people, making their way north. The only thing stopping them is Mexico's delayed process for issuing visas that allow the migrants to journey north to the U.S. border.
The AP explains:
A group of several hundred Cuban, African and Central American migrants have been waiting at the immigration offices in Tapachula for documents that would allow them to travel to the U.S. border, where most plan to request asylum.
Some members of that group have scuffled with immigration authorities and broken windows at the offices in recent days, accusing officials of making them wait too long for papers.
And another group of an estimated 2,500 Central American and Cuban migrants have been stuck for at least a week further west in the Chiapas town of Mapastepec, also waiting for papers. The situation has become so tense that a riot broke out at an immigration station in Tapachula, Mexico, last week, where migrants allegedly ransacked the building and burned documents.

Illinois lawmakers consider separating Chicago as its own state - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/illinois-lawmakers-consider-separating-chicago-as-its-own-state,"For his 2015 film, director Spike Lee dubbed the Windy City ' Chi-Raq ', obviously a take on the country of Iraq, for the level of gang violence and crime in America's 'Second City'. It is not another country, of course, but some lawmakers are considering whether it ought to be another state.
A group of Republican members of the state legislature have signed on to a resolution that would urge the U.S. Congress to separate the city from Illinois and make it its own state.
Speaking with the State Journal-Registe r, Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer said the resolution is a way to ""spark discussion."" And it has.
""It's more of a frustration of the policies than the true belief that Chicago and Illinois would be better off as separate states,"" Davidsmeyer told the paper. But he said he doesn't really think the separation is a solution, adding that ""our relationship is mutually beneficial.""
On the other hand, Rep. Brad Halbrook, one of the original sponsors of the bill, seems rather serious. The Journal-Register reports that he ""supports the idea of removing Chicago from the rest of Illinois"" over ""ideological differences,:"" offering examples like abortion and gun rights, where the urban center is out of step with the rural parts of the state.
Resentment for the big burg from those ""downstate"" locales, as the rest of Illinois is referred to, is an ongoing issue, and one that has bubbled up many times in the past. The new Chicago Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot addressed the ""resentment"" issue last week when speaking to the Illinois House of Representatives.
""We are all Illinoisans, and we all have the best interests of our constituents at heart,"" she said.
""Let's be clear. When Illinois thrives, Chicago thrives,"" she added. ""And the reverse is also true.""
But Rep. Davidsmeyer, articulating a belief held by many, said that ""the policies that come down from Chicago are actually pushing [the rest of the state's] economic opportunity away.""
The bill, House Resolution 101, delves into other issues as well, including taxes. The addition of Davidsmeyer's name to the list of Republicans in support has intensified the issue, and whether it is to spark debate, or a serious idea, won't change that the underlying issues are now taking a front seat in the state's politics.
And, like the blue states trying to undermine the electoral college, or the ticket sales for Unplanned, it's yet another example of the deep and seemingly unbreachable divide in this country along every social, political, and economic line."

Nancy Pelosi issues new demand of President Trump amid controversy over Omar 9/11 video,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-statement-trump-omar-video,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a new demand of President Donald Trump on Sunday amid ongoing controversy over Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar's refusal to identify the 9/11 attackers as terrorists.
Instead, at a CAIR fundraiser last month, Omar referred to the 9/11 perpetrators as ""some people"" who ""did something.""
In response, Trump tweeted a video Friday highlighting Omar's controversial comments. Spliced in between her words were dramatic scenes from 9/11. Democrats later accused the president of inciting violence against Omar.
What did Pelosi say? In a short statement released Sunday afternoon, Pelosi demanded the president remove the video, which he has since ""pinned"" to the top of his Twitter account.
""The President's words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger. President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video,"" Pelosi said in a statement .
""Following the President's tweet, I spoke with the Sergeant-at-Arms to ensure that Capitol Police are conducting a security assessment to safeguard Congresswoman Omar, her family and her staff,"" she said. ""They will continue to monitor and address the threats she faces.""
Pelosi's statement comes after Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who is one of Omar's closest progressive allies in Congress, criticized Democratic leadership for seemingly exploiting Muslims.
Omar and Tlaib are the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress. They were elected last year."

The police tweeted the photos of their new design, which features the American flag within the lettering on the side, and that was enough to trigger a negative response from some. Enough of a response, in fact, that the City Council is going to meet to decide if they can keep it.
It's not the first meeting about the design.
""People are screaming that the American flag on a police car is somehow or another ... hurting people's feelings who might be immigrants or visitors,"" Councilman Peter Blake said according to the LA Times . ""People are actually ridiculous enough to bring up comments about our cop cars having American flags on them.""
At the first council meeting, a resident said the ""boldness"" of the design was ""shocking.""
She also said that she ""thought the aesthetic didn't really represent our community."" The aesthetic is the American flag, which apparently doesn't represent their ""amazing community of artists.""
""It feels very aggressive,"" she said.
Not everyone in the town is so upset by the red, white, and blue design. One officer told the Times that he is complimented on the freshly-painted vehicle ""every time"" he pulls up to a stop sign.
The new black and white design, with the colored logo, is meant to make the vehicles more visible, identifiable, and therefore safer, said the Police chief."
Democrats at War: Bernie Sanders fires both barrels at Clinton-allied think tank - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/sanders-clinton-ocasio-cortez-war-pelosi,"The Democrats are at war, and the biggest front to open so far was opened by 2020 candidate and self-diagnosed ""democratic socialist"" Bernie Sanders.
Sanders made big waves against a big target on Sunday as news of his scathing rebuke of the Center for American Progress made the rounds. It's not the only front on which the war is being fought, but it's the hottest strike zone so far.
That rebuke came in the form of a letter, obtained and printed by the New York Times , and it minces no words. Sanders is accusing the think tank, a John Podesta joint, of ""using its resources to smear Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and myself, among others,"" thereby undermining their mission to defeat Trump.
The battle line here is ideological, with Sanders and the ""progressives"" on one side, and American Progress and it's action fund on the other, stemming from articles published by the affiliated ThinkProgress website.
Sanders is arguing that the Clinton and Podesta part of the party is owned by corporate interests, and is therefore hostile to the turn, particularly among 2020 candidates, toward the politics now closely associated with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez--previously more closely associated with Sanders himself.
That dynamic is playing out in all sorts of ways lately, including in how Democratic leaders and long-time Democrat politicians discuss things like the controversies surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar, but in the case of Sanders there is also the deeper wound of the 2016 primary.
Part of the fallout from the leaking of DNC emails was the revelation that the party was essentially deliberately undermining Sanders in favor of Clinton in 2016. Despite two years of effort at healing that wound, in many ways, and for many of his supporters, it's still very much open.
Amusingly, the particular article about him that set off the Vermont socialist was a criticism over his previously barely mentioned status as a full-fledged millionaire. The first line of that ThinkProgress article reads: ""It's all very off-brand and embarrassing, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is a millionaire.""
""Last week, you published an article on ThinkProgress criticizing me for my appearance and for the income I earned from writing a book,"" wrote Sanders in his letter. ""Then, a day later, you published a video that dishonestly attacked me for hypocrisy in my effort to address income inequality in America – a video that was excitedly discussed on many conservative websites.""
""Center for American Progress leader Neera Tanden repeatedly calls for unity while simultaneously maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas,"" he said of that criticism.
On Sunday morning, Waleed Shahid, Democrat strategist and communications director for the far left PAC Justice Democrats, said on CNN that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib have ""significant disagreements"" with the Democratic leadership.
Shahid argued that Republicans know about that divide and hope to exploit it. ""It's another divide and conquer strategy because they know the Democratic party leadership will be slow in their response, and sometimes even dismissive"" of ""these three progressive women of color,"" and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Steny Hoyer ""will not come out swinging tor them.""
Shahid singled out Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as being the politicians who would defend the three.
Meanwhile on CNN's ""State of the Union"" host Jake Tapper spoke with member of the leadership Rep. Jerry Nadler about the 9/11 controversy swirling around Rep. Omar. He pointed out to Nadler that Pelosi's statement could be read as a slight dig at Omar's comments in addition to the President.
Quote: : ""The memory of 9/11 is sacred ground, and any discussion of it must be done with reverence.""
Tapper asked Nadler if he had any problem with Omar's comment about 9/11. He said ""I've had some problems with some of her other remarks but not with that one.""
So he didn't contradict Tapper about whether Pelosi's comment may have been partially aimed at Omar, and although he had ""no problem"" with her 9/11 comments, he made sure to point out he has had a problem with other comments she has made.
And of course, there was last week's dig at Ocasio-Cortez's substance by Speaker Pelosi in an interview with USA Today. ""While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what's important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House,"" she said.
The hard left turn in the party, of which AOC was at least the harbinger if not the bringer, is not a group turn. It's meeting resistance. And with Bernie Sanders salvo at the Clinton-Podesta industrial complex, it's clearly not going to get better until it first gets worse."

WCCO-TV in Minnesota reported a witness heard the boy's mother shouting ""Everybody pray, everybody pray. Oh my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge.""
The child, Landen Hoffmann of Woodbury, Minnesota, fell over forty feet and suffered significant injuries, according to authorities.
The family posted about the terrible incident on social media, and a GoFundMe was started to raise money for the family during this horrific time of need. It was started by friends of the family after Landen's cousin April Hoffmann, posted an Instagram tribute.
""This is Landen, he is the sweetest kindest 5 year old you will ever meet. His soul is soft and gentle and instantly brings a smile to everybody he meets,"" the fundraiser reads. ""He is full of energy and life and enjoys soccer, playing with friends and family and playing hockey with his brother and sister.""
It relates the family's story. ""He was enjoying a day at the Mall of America with his mom and friend on Friday morning when a stranger maliciously grabbed him and threw him over the 3rd floor balcony for no apparent reason. The family doesn't know him and are completely clueless as to why this monster would target their family with this heinous act of violence.""
The fundraiser was over $400,000 by Sunday morning.
In the press conference about the incident, Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said Landen is ""receiving care. I think we're just asking for your thoughts and prayers for that child to recover.""
The suspect has been charged with attempted homicide. Police credited a concerned bystander for chasing the suspect, and the Mall security for tracking him to the transportation station where he was apprehended.

Only all-male historically black college in US to admit biological females who identify as males - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/americas-only-all-male-historically-black-college-to-admit-biological-females-who-identify-as-males,"America's only all-male historically black college — Morehouse College — will admit biological females who identify as males starting in the fall 2020, which the Associated Press said is a ""major shift"" for the Atlanta institution where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other famed figures attended.
But biological men who identify as women won't be allowed in, the policy states .
In addition, the policy ""affects students who transition while enrolled at Morehouse. Once admitted, students are expected to continue to self-identify as men throughout their matriculation at Morehouse. If a student transitions from a man to a woman, that student will no longer be eligible to matriculate at Morehouse.""
'Masculine pronouns'
The policy also said that the school ""will continue to use masculine pronouns, the language of brotherhood, and other gendered language that reflects its mission as an institution designed to develop men with disciplined minds who will lead lives of leadership and service.""
What did Morehouse's president have to say?
""I think Morehouse having the courage to speak to issues of masculinity in today's environment is important,"" Morehouse College President David Thomas told the AP. ""For 152 years, the world has, in some way, seen Morehouse as the West Point of black male development.""
Controversial filmmaker Spike Lee and former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson also are alumni of the school, the outlet said, adding that about two dozen historically black colleges have adopted transgender policies of some form.
What did an LGBT equality group have to say? A spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign — the largest LBGT equality group in America — told the AP it's a step in the right direction.
""Young people are incredibly supportive of LGBT equality, including transgender equality,"" Sarah McBride told the outlet. ""Schools are responding in kind. In many ways, our college campuses look like the country we'll have in 10 or 15 years. There are a lot of reasons for hope.""
More from the AP:
Morehouse has had challenges around LGBT issues, most notably the 2002 attack of a 19-year-old student accused of beating a fellow student with a baseball bat who he mistakenly thought was making a sexual advance.
Gregory Love's skull was fractured in the beating. Aaron Price was found guilty of assault and initially sentenced to 10 years in prison.
The incident was widely seen as reflective of a larger and pervasive attitude toward the LGBT community among African Americans.
Thomas acknowledged that historically black colleges and universities — mainly established after the Civil War with the help of religious institutions like the Baptist and Methodist churches — face added challenges in addressing issues of gender and sexuality because of opposition in black churches.
""I can't speak for all HBCUs, but we know in the black church there has largely been silence on this issue,"" Thomas added to the outlet. ""I can imagine there may be people who would say, 'Why would you even raise this?' I say to those people we live in an era now where silence on these issues is actually not helpful. For us, as a school for men, it's important for us to set clear expectations about what that means. That's what we're trying to do with this policy.""
The AP also said Morehouse in 2009 updated its dress code, ""in part to address a handful of students who were wearing women's clothing on campus."" The outlet said Morehouse offered its first LGBT course in 2013 and has a scholars program named for civil and gay rights icon Bayard Rustin."
Scientists create the first-ever 3D-printed heart with human tissue. Experts hope it could lead to personalized organ transplants.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientists-create-first-3d-printed-heart,"A team of Israeli scientists on Monday unveiled the first-ever 3D-printed human heart, the Jerusalem Post reported.
Researchers at Tel Aviv University printed the tiny vascularized heart in about three hours using cells and biological material from a patient.
""This is the first time anyone anywhere has successfully engineered and printed an entire heart replete with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers,"" lead researcher Tal Dvir of the TAU School of Molecular Cell Biology and Biotechnology said in a release. ""People have managed to 3D-print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels.
""This heart is made from human cells and patient-specific biological materials. In our process, these materials serve as the bio-inks, substances made of sugars and proteins that can be used for 3-D printing of complex tissue models,"" Dvir said. ""It's completely biocompatible and matches the patient.""
While the 2.5 centimeter-sized heart is too small for a human, the researchers believe it puts them a step closer to creating personalized organs for those in need of a transplant. Personalized organs would be more easily accepted by the body.
""The method we have developed will allow us in the future to print a heart of any size required from the human tissue of patients themselves, meaning that the body will not reject it,"" Dvir said. ""In fact, this method allows us to print any organ that is required for a transplant and we believe that this method opens the door to future technologies, which will make the need for organ donors completely unnecessary.""
How did they do it? The researchers took a fatty tissue biopsy from a patient and separated the cellular and noncellular materials, according to the study .
Then the cells were reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells, the extracellular matrix that was processed into a personalized hydrogel that served as the ink for the printer that printed the heart.

What's next? The hearts need to learn how to beat and pump like human hearts before they can be tested on animals and eventually in humans.
Printing a human heart would require billions of cells and could take a full day to print, Dvir said, according to the Post.
Dvir hopes that within the next decade ""there will be organ printers in the finest hospitals around the world, and these procedures will be conducted routinely."""
WATCH: Nancy Pelosi is asked about AOC's influence. Her response might ignite war within Democratic Party.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-mocks-aoc-influence,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) mocked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired over the weekend, diminishing the influence that the New York Democrat and other ultra-progressive lawmakers wield in the halls of Congress.
What did Pelosi say? In the interview, CBS News' Lesley Stahl pointed out the Democratic Party, more than ever, has waring factions within its caucus between moderates and progressives, many of whom describe themselves as ""democratic socialists.""
""You have these wings: AOC, and her group on one side—"" Stahl said.
""That's like five people,"" Pelosi interrupted.
""No, the progressive group is more than five,"" Stahl shot back.
""Well, the progressive— I'm a progressive. Yeah,"" Pelosi responded.

Just prior to the exchange, Pelosi readily dismissed the radical agenda of her party's progressive wing, which those like Ocasio-Cortez are eager to implement, and said that, in the end, Democratic lawmakers will be forced to tow the mainstream line, if for no other reason but the Democratic Party's vitality.
""By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with, they know that we have to hold the center,"" Pelosi said.
Later, Pelosi admitted she rejects socialism ""as an economic system,"" despite younger Democrats promoting a socialist agenda. Pelosi said socialism ""is not the view of the Democratic Party.""
Pelosi's interview aired one day after one of the Democratic Party's popular young progressives, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), criticized Democratic leadership for, in her eyes, failing to defend controversial Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from critics upset that she referred to the 9/11 terrorists as ""some people"" who ""did something.""
Pelosi responded to Tlaib's frustration by directly condemning President Donald Trump, who controversially posted a video to social media that highlighted Omar's remarks. The video spliced together Omar's comments with dramatic scenes from 9/11."
Smiling character on CBS drama promotes punching 'Nazis' as 'enforcement' — since 'some speech is not equal',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbs-show-punching-nazis-speech-not-equal,"Last week's episode of ""The Good Fight"" — a CBS All Access drama frequently fueled by left-wing talking points and decided dislike of President Donald Trump — portrays a character punching a Nazi in a bathroom, which was followed by an all-out brawl in the street between Nazis and Nazi-haters .
Amid the melee, the character who threw the bathroom punch — Jay Dispersia, a law firm investigator — speaks directly at the camera and pushes the Antifa -like view that violence is an acceptable way to deal with abhorrent speech. ( Content warning: Profanity ):
Is it alright to hit a Nazi unprovoked? I was always taught to never throw the first punch, never instigate. Defend, but don't attack. But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face during an interview, and I realized Spencer was in a pressed suit, wearing a tie, being interviewed like his opinion mattered — like it should be considered part of the conversation, like neo-Nazism was just one political point of view. And then I realized there's no better way to show some speech is not equal. Some speech requires a more visceral response. It's like Overton's window — that's the term from which ideas are tolerated in public discourse. Well, Overton's window doesn't mean s**t unless it comes with some enforcement. So yeah, this is enforcement. It's time to punch a few Nazis. Interestingly, the episode portrays Democrats and Republicans teaming up to battle the Nazis in the street, which might come across as unusual, given it would seem to serve as a softball scenario for demonizing the GOP — but it seems ""The Good Fight"" doesn't go for the easy plot line in that respect.
'Always feels great to watch Nazis get punched' As you might expect, a couple of reviewers seemingly enjoyed the violence in the episode, which is aptly titled ""The One Where a Nazi Gets Punched.""
Scott Tobias of Vulture said ""sometimes it's really satisfying for a piece of art to deliver on its title, especially if it involves literally beating back the surge of white supremacists in this country"" and called the episode ""like that first deep breath of fresh mountain air — crisp and pure and totally invigorating. Always feels great to watch Nazis get punched.""
Chancellor Egard of EW suggested the episode title ""might make you hopeful"" and noted the ""cathartic, funny, theatrical, and unsettling brawl.""
Pushback
Rob Dreher of the American Conservative makes no bones about disliking neo-Nazis and the alt-right, but warned that ""a scripted network television show aired with approval a statement encouraging street violence against [Spencer], and against those who agree with him, in an effort to silence political speech.""
More from Dreher:
Having taken the position that ""some speech is not equal,"" and that there is ""no better way"" to demonstrate that than to beat up unpopular speakers, what is the limiting principle, CBS? What would you, CBS, say to some right-wing person who attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar over her words, you having promoted the point of view that violence is the best way to set the limits on free speech?
I'm old enough to remember when liberals defended the right of racist deplorables to gather peaceably , because by so doing, liberals were defending important liberal principles enshrined in the First Amendment. I do not enjoy seeing peaceful American citizens, however disgusting their words and beliefs, being physically assaulted to punish them for their words, or to deter them from speaking — and you shouldn't either. Not even Richard Spencer. CBS is not a bit player. It's a Hollywood mainstay — and for the sake of being edgy, woke, and of-the-moment, it has violated an important taboo in liberal democracy. CBS is the Antifa network. On that note A 1981 TV movie based on the real-life controversy over Nazis who wanted to march in Skokie, Illinois — to the horror of Jewish people in the area — culminated with a thought-provoking perspective from a Jewish representative of the ACLU. He argued to the angry community that the Nazis should be allowed to march as a way of protecting the rights of Jewish people to maintain the right to speak out against them. In other words, the answer to hate speech is more speech, not shutting speech down.
Ironically, CBS is the network that aired ""Skokie."" Check the scene:

"Pete Buttigieg officially announces 2020 bid in stirring speech, brings in $1 million in fundraising in the hours following announcement",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pete-buttigieg-officially-announces-2020-bid,"South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg formally announced his presidential bid Sunday night in South Bend, Indiana.
What are the details?
In a highly attended and stirring speech, Buttigieg — who initially appeared alongside his husband, Chasten — told the crowd that the ""horror show"" in Washington, D.C., has to end.
""My name is Pete Buttigieg,"" he told the gathered crowd. ""They call me 'Mayor Pete.' I am a proud son of South Bend, Indiana, and I am running for president of the United States.""
""The horror show in Washington,"" the 37-year-old added, ""is mesmerizing, all-consuming. But starting today, we are going to change the channel.""
Buttigieg touted his experience as South Bend's mayor as well as his time as a combat soldier in Afghanistan during the announcement and delivered the remarks at Studebaker Building 84.
""I ran for mayor in 2011 knowing that nothing like Studebaker would ever come back,"" he admitted. ""But believing that we would, our city would, if we had the courage to reimagine our future. And now, I can confidently say that South Bend is back.""
""That's why I'm here today,"" he added. ""To tell a different story than 'make America great again,' because there is a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities: the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.""
""It comes from people who think the only way to reach communities like ours is through resentment and nostalgia, selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with,"" Buttigieg explained. ""The problem is, they're telling us to look for greatness in all the wrong places.""
The 37-year-old told the audience that he is aware of the ""audacity"" of running as a ""Midwestern millennial mayor.""
""More than a little bold ... to seek the highest office in the land,"" he added, arguing that America is ripe for a chance.
""If America today feels like a confusing place to be, it's because we're on one of those blank pages in between chapters,"" he explained. ""Change is coming, ready or not. The question of our time is whether families and workers will be defeated by the changes beneath us, or whether we will master them and make them work toward a better everyday life for us all.""
Buttigieg pointed to climate change, immigration, and freedom as some of his primary concerns as a presidential candidate. He also suggested that the Electoral College be abolished.
""We can't say it's much of a democracy when twice in my lifetime, the Electoral College has overruled the American people,"" he said, pointing to the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections.
""Let's make it easier to register and to vote,"" Buttigieg said. ""Let's make our districts fairer, our courts less political, our structurer more inclusive, and yes — let's pick our president by counting up all the ballots and giving it to the woman or man who got the most votes.""
What else do we know about him? Buttigieg's husband of one year, Chasten, is a school teacher and has joined him on the campaign trail across the country.
Buttigieg is a Rhodes Scholar and a graduate of Harvard and Oxford universities, and speaks seven foreign languages including Arabic, Dari, French, Italian, Maltese, Norwegian, and Spanish. He was raised Catholic, but is now Episcopalian.
If elected, Buttigieg would be the first U.S. mayor to ascend straight to the presidency, and would be the youngest man to ever be president at the age of 39.
Buttigieg's campaign has brought in more than $7 million in January, February, and March — which is more than his fellow Democratic contenders Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) — and raised over $1 million in the hours following his Sunday announcement.
In April, Buttigieg polled third in Iowa and New Hampshire, behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced a bid for presidency.

President Trump's plan to ship migrants to sanctuary cities could backfire. Here's how.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-immigration-plan-sanctuary-cities-backfire,"The Trump administration was heavily criticized last week after the Washington Post revealed top White House aides have floated a policy that would ship illegal immigrants to so-called ""sanctuary cities"" while U.S. authorities process their asylum requests.
On Friday, President Donald Trump confirmed he is considering enacting the policy, saying over the weekend he has the ""absolute right"" to do so . Meanwhile, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley revealed on Fox News Saturday the White House is actively discussing the policy with officials at Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
But the policy could have unintended blowback for the Trump administration, working against its immigration agenda instead of advancing it.
 Though details about the policy are scarce, a new report from the Associated Press highlights how the policy would likely backfire on the White House by helping more illegal immigrants receive the resources they need to remain in the U.S. longer and legally.
In fact, if the president were to enact the policy, most migrants shipped to sanctuary cities, which are overwhelmingly progressive metropolises, would not fear deportation or law enforcement. Instead, their biggest concern would likely be the high cost-of-living associated with most cities.
The AP spoke to immigrant Wilson Romero, who came to the U.S. illegally from Honduras last year. He lives with his mother in San Jose, California, and his 7-year-old daughter attends public school.
More from the AP:
Romero says he goes about daily errands in public without worry of discrimination. His daughter has made friends and has playdates with the children of Mexican American families. It's a far cry from his hometown in the violence-plagued outskirts of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, that he fled after his brother-in-law was killed.
To him, the biggest problem with being in the Bay Area is the high cost of living. The former textile factory worker relies on his mother's income from waitressing for food and clothing, and he's started thinking about asking legal permission to move to North Carolina, where an uncle resides and says it's cheaper to live and work. Indeed, most often, the best resources for immigrants, including non-profit organizations that provide effective legal services, are located in ""sanctuary cities,"" where large populations of illegal immigrants already live.
Will the president implement the policy? Although White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated Sunday the policy is one of many the administration is currently considering to alleviate stress at the border, she said the plan is not the administration's ""first option.""
Meanwhile, many logistical concerns surround the policy. Who will pay to transport the migrants to sanctuary cities? How would the migrants be stopped from leaving the cities and settling in other areas? As the AP noted, migrants are conditionally required to provide authorities with an address before they are released from custody, but what, then, is the point of sending them to sanctuary cities if they will remain in custody?
It's clear the policy, at least right now, is more about politicking than providing a genuine solution to the border crisis."
New Jersey legalizes physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nj-approves-assisted-suicide-for-terminally-ill-patients,"New Jersey has now legalized physician assisted suicide for terminally ill patients.
Here's what we know The bill will go into effect on August 1. It requires a psychiatrist or psychologist to verify that the patient is of sound enough mind to know what they are agreeing to do before the procedure can be carried out. Two separate doctors will also have to confirm that the patient has less than six months to live, and will have to discuss other options with the patient. Ultimately, patients who choose to end their own lives will have to administer the drugs on their own after getting a prescription.
In a statement from a Friday press release , New Jersey governor Phil Murphy (D) said ""Allowing residents with terminal illnesses to make end-of-life choices for themselves is the right thing to do. By signing this bill today, we are providing terminally ill patients and their families with the humanity, dignity, and respect that they so richly deserve at the most difficult times any of us will face. I commend Assemblyman Burzichelli for steering us down this long, difficult road, and thank the Legislature for its courage in tackling this challenging issue.""
But some worry that the bill, which only passed each chamber of the New Jersey state legislature by a single vote , will have serious and negative repercussions.
""The bill has lasting ramifications and lots of loopholes,"" Republican Sen. Robert Singer said, according to CNN . ""We are so concerned about opioids, and not trusting doctors with opioids. But now we are willing to trust them with this.""
California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Oregon, Vermont, Washington state, and Washington D.C. already allow physician assisted suicide.
Murphy acknowledged that his support for this bill runs contrary to his faith Murphy also noted in a longer statement from Friday that this law would allow something directly forbidden by the faith he espouses.
As a lifelong, practicing Catholic, I acknowledge that I have personally grappled with my position on this issue. My faith has informed and enhanced many of my most deeply held progressive values. Indeed, it has influenced my perspectives on issues involving social justice, social welfare, and even those topics traditionally regarded as strictly economic, such as the minimum wage. On this issue, I am torn between certain principles of my faith and my compassion for those who suffer unnecessary, and often intolerable, pain at the end of their lives. The Catholic Church considers it a mortal sin to participate in assisted suicide, either as a patient or as a medical professional. According to the church's Second Vatican Council , ""whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia or wilful self-destruction....poison human society, but they do more harm to those who practice them than those who suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are supreme dishonor to the Creator.""
Murphy justified this disparity between the black and white guidelines of the church he professes and the law he signed by saying ""[a]fter careful consideration, internal reflection, and prayer, I have concluded that, while my faith may lead me to a particular decision for myself, as a public official I cannot deny this alternative to those who may reach a different conclusion."""
"Cher argues against California harboring influx of illegal immigrants, GOPers take note",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cher-illegal-immigration-repubilcan-party,"Far-left celebrity Cher has been jokingly welcomed to the Republican Party after questioning California's priorities with regard to immigration while the state struggles with homelessness among its own citizens.
What are the details? On Sunday, the singer tweeted, ""I Understand Helping struggling Immigrants, but MY CITY (Los Angeles) ISNT TAKING CARE OF ITS OWN. WHAT ABOUT THE 50,000+ Citizens WHO LIVE ON THE STREETS. PPL WHO LIVE BELOW POVERTY LINE, & HUNGRY? If My State Can't Take Care of Its Own (Many Are VETS) How Can it Take Care of More""
According to Fox News , Los Angeles has the second-highest homeless population in the country, next to New York City, and California has more homeless veterans than any other state.
Cher's argument came as a follow-up to a fit she threw Friday over President Donald Trump's confirmation that his administration was ""giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only.""
President Trump accused sanctuary cities — particularly in California, where there is a state law protecting such policies — of balking at the prospect of having illegal immigrants released into their safe harbors by the administration.
Anything else? Several Twitter users pointed out Cher's apparent change in heart from 2017, when she urged Americans to provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants ""in their home and protect them,"" promising she ""will do the same.""
Others took the opportunity to joke about Cher's new-found conservative stance on the issue of immigration, with Donald Trump Jr. saying on Instagram, ""Welcome to the Republican Party Cher!"""
75-year-old Florida man attacked and killed by a dangerous bird he kept as a pet,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/75-year-old-man-attacked-and-killed-by-giant-bird-in-florida,"A 75-year-old Florida man was attacked and killed by a giant exotic bird called a cassowary that the man kept on his property in Alachua.
The bird reportedly attacked its victim, Marvin Hajos, after he tripped and fell Friday at about 10 a.m., the Gainesville Sun reported. Cassowaries are considered by some to be the world's most dangerous bird.
""My understanding is that the gentleman was in the vicinity of the bird and at some point fell. When he fell, he was attacked,"" Deputy Chief Jeff Taylor of the Alachua County Fire Rescue Department told the newspaper.
First responders transported Hajos to a local hospital where he died.
Authorities believe the man was possibly breeding the flightless birds on his farm, WOFL-TV reported. At least two cassowaries were found on the property.
What is a cassowary? Cassowaries typically live in the rainforest in New Guinea and some parts of Australia. The bird can grow up to 5.6 feet tall and weighs as much as 167 pounds, according to the San Diego Zoo website .
Each 3-toed foot on a cassowary features a dagger-like claw that is about 4 inches long. It can slice open its predators with a swift kick, according to the San Diego Zoo website.
Mike Taylor of the Jacksonville Zoo told WOFL the birds are also territorial and protective of their young.
""They are definitely capable of doing some damage,"" Taylor added.
Cassowaries have powerful legs and can run up to 31 mph through dense underbrush in the rainforest. The birds also have the ability to jump nearly 7 feet straight up in the air and they are excellent swimmers.
What else? The sheriff's office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation are still investigating the man's death.
The bird involved remains secured on the victim's property, Alachua County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Brett Rhodenizer told the Gainesville Sun."

The extent of the damage is not known at this point, but videos taken from bystanders show substantial flames and large plumes of smoke rising from the roof of the building.
Here's what we know Construction on the historic Catholic church started in 1163 and the edifice was slowly completed over the next couple centuries. Recently, it had been undergoing some much-needed restoration work. Just a few days prior to this, 16 bronze statues from the roof of the cathedral were removed and transported to be restored.
The BBC reported that fire fighters in Paris believe that the fire could be somehow linked to this work. Reuters , citing France 2 television, reported that authorities believe it was an accident.
The spire of the cathedral has fallen, and France 24 reported that the ""roof has entirely collapsed"" as well.
Reuters reported that no one has been injured in the blaze. This is Holy Week for Catholics, so Catholic churches would typically have more activity than usual, particularly iconic ones like Notre Dame, in addition to the usual tourist activity.
According to Axios, Notre Dame spokesperson Andrew Finot has told the media ""Everything is burning, nothing will remain from the frame.""
The fire has also spread to one of the cathedral's square towers .

High school boys raid girls' bathroom during protest of transgender's use of boys' room. Girl gets expelled for fighting back.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/boys-raid-girls-bathroom-girl-fights-back-gets-expelled,"A group of boys at North Pole High School in Alaska allegedly tried to enter the girls' bathroom earlier this month out of protest after a transgender male used the boys' room. Eight students were disciplined in connection with the incident, including a girl who was reportedly expelled for kicking one of the young men in the crotch during the dust-up.
 According to the school's investigation, a transgender student who was transitioning from female to male took a selfie from the boys' bathroom and uploaded it to Snapchat, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported. Fairbanks North Star Borough School District Superintendent Karen Gaborik said a group of boys ""were upset about the public nature of the post and how that played out.""
A social media post purportedly from one of the boys rallied, ""tomorrow identify as a women [sic] and use the women's bathroom if you want this s**t to end, my foster dad called the school and they said they [can't] do anything because she identify as men [sic].""
In response, seven boys decided to ""identify as female"" and enter the girls' bathroom to take a selfie of their own. But when they entered, a female student in the restroom reacted by giving one of the protestors a knee to the groin. The boy on the receiving end of the kick was encouraged to seek medical treatment, but the extent of his injuries — if any — is unclear.
The girl's family told the Washington Post she has been expelled from school for using ""excessive force,"" while her sister claimed on Twitter that the boy ""was blocking her in the womens [sic] bathroom.""
Meanwhile, Gaborik confirmed that all the boys who took part were also disciplined for ""attempting to enter the girls' bathroom.""
The transgender student was not present during the incident.
How are people responding? Alaska state Rep. Tammie Wilson (R) spoke out in defense of the girl, saying the student was merely defending herself. ""Was she supposed to not protect herself?"" the lawmaker asked the Daily News-Miner . ""She was where she belonged. They were not.""
The Post noted that feminist writer Mikki Kendall also questioned why the girl was disciplined, saying ""after all the bulls**t bathroom panic bills about trans kids, when a group of cis boys actually harass girls in a bathroom the girls are punished for defending themselves?"""
Pelosi: Socialism 'is not the view of the Democratic Party',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-socialism-and-the-democratic-party,"Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday that ""socialism as an economic system"" was ""not the view of the Democratic Party.""
What happened? During an interview on CBS's "" 60 Minutes ,"" correspondent Leslie Stahl asked Pelosi about some of the ideas promoted by the ""self-described socialists"" on the ""left flank"" of the party. Pelosi said that despite the ""orientation they came to Congress with"" even the socialist members know that the party has to ""hold the center"" and ""go down the mainstream.""
Pelosi also defended the Affordable Care Act — a.k.a. Obamacare — saying that it was better than the 'Medicare for All' plan promoted by some of the more left-leaning members of her own party.
""Well, Medicare for All, it's not only being pushed by some members of your caucus,"" Stahl noted, ""but also by some of the presidential candidates, and it is allowing the president to say you're all socialists.""
Stahl was referring to Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), and former-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who have all come out in support of Medicare for All. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and former-Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) have all supported expanding Medicare beyond the Affordable Care Act, but haven't fully embraced Medicare for All.
Pelosi responded:
Do you know that when we did — when Medicare was done by the Congress at the time, under Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan, said, 'Medicare will lead us to a socialist dictatorship.' This is an ongoing theme of the Republicans. However, I do reject socialism as an economic system. If people have that view, that's their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party. "
40-year-old man sues parents after they trashed his nearly $30K porn collection,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-sues-parent-for-destroying-porn-collection,"A Grand Haven, Michigan, man is suing his mother and father for throwing away his prized pornography collection valued at approximately $29,000.
What are the details? In his lawsuit, 40-year-old ""Charlie"" said that the collection was no ordinary collection.
His parents, however, have responded to the suit and said that they threw away the collection for a very good reason.
Charlie moved back to his parents' home in Grand Haven in 2016 after a divorce. His parents didn't make him pay rent — he did chores to chip in at the household instead.
Charlie was asked to leave the residence just 10 months later after police visited the house for what Fox News referred to as a ""domestic situation."" In 2017, his parents purportedly delivered some of his personal effects to his new residence. According to Charlie, 14 boxes full of pornography and sex toys were absent from his inventory of personal belongings.
When asked about the boxes, Charlie's said they'd disposed of the lurid collection. Angered, Charlie phoned the sheriff's department and said that his parents destroyed the collection worth approximately $29,000. The prosecutor's office, however, declined to press charges in the matter.
According to WXMI-TV , Charlie sent his father an email about the matter. Charlie wrote, ""If you had a problem with my belongings, you should have stated that at the time and I would have gone elsewhere. Instead, you choose to keep quiet and behave vindictively.""
Charlie's father responded in a kind manner.
""Believe it or not, one reason for why I destroyed your porn was for your own mental and emotional heath [sic]. I would have done the same if I had found a kilo of crack cocaine,"" his father wrote. ""Someday, I hope you will understand.""
""I did you a big favor by getting rid of all this stuff,"" Charlie's father added .
In April, Charlie filed a suit against his parents, seeking nearly $87,000 in damages.
Anything else? Fox News reported that Charlie's problem goes decades.
Fox's David Aaro wrote, ""According to his father, Charlie's addiction turned into a small porn business during his high school and college days.""
""He was reportedly kicked out of high school and college for selling pornography to other students,"" Aaro wrote. ""His son was warned that if he ever found porn in his house again, he would destroy it."""
Prosecutors drop all charges against woman who reportedly assaulted Kellyanne Conway - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/prosecutors-drop-all-charges-against-woman-who-reportedly-assaulted-kellyanne-conway,"A Maryland state attorney's office announced on Monday that it dropped all charges against a woman who reportedly attacked Kellyanne Conway.
According to CNN , a spokesperson for the county said that the woman apologized for her behavior.
What's a brief history on the attack? The woman — later identified as 63-year-old Mary Elizabeth Inabinett — purportedly attacked Conway when the White House aide was visiting a restaurant in 2018 with her daughter.
In an interview with CNN , Conway revealed that she and her daughter were visiting a restaurant when a woman approached her.
Conway, 63, said that the woman approached Conway and her daughter and began ""screaming her head off."" According to Conway, Inabinett placed her hands on Conway and began shaking her.
""Somebody was grabbing me from behind, grabbing my arms, and was shaking me to the point where I felt maybe somebody was hugging me,"" Conway told the outlet, noting that Inabinett was simply ""out of control.""
However, investigators reviewed video of the incident and spoke with 10 eyewitnesses at the scene, and determined that the only physical contact that occurred was that Inabinett grabbed Conway's elbow ""to get attention,"" which they described as ""de minimis touching.""
According to Conway, ""her whole face was terror and anger. She was right here, and my daughter was right there. She ought to pay for that.""
William Alden McDaniel Jr., an attorney for Inabinett, said that his client would not plead guilty.
""Ms. Inabinett saw Kellyanne Conway, a public figure, in a public place, and exercised her First Amendment rights to express her personal opinions,"" McDaniel said. ""She did not assault Ms. Conway. The facts at the trial will show this to be true, and show Ms. Conway's account to be false.""

So what's happening now? Ramon Korionoff, a spokesperson for the Montgomery County state's attorney's office revealed that charges were dropped.
""It is the best resolution for all parties concerned,"" Korionoff said in a statement. ""The defendant in this matter did apologize to the victim in this matter and did so in a recent letter.""
According to CNN, ""a person familiar with the case said it was not uncommon for the state's attorney to act as a mediator.""
""The defendant realizes she was wrong to interrupt a little girl's birthday party,"" the person told the outlet.
The unnamed person added, ""Everybody realized let's just not waste the court's resources on case like this.""
The unnamed source called the action ""de minimis touching,"" which the source said means that the incident was minor.
Conway herself has not issued a statement on the matter at the time of this writing."
"BBC poll: Fewer than half of UK Christians believe Jesus died, rose again for forgiveness of their sins",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bbc-poll-less-than-half-of-christians-believe-easter-story,"With Holy Week upon us, a new BBC poll found that fewer than half of Christians in the U.K. — 46 percent — believe Jesus died and rose again for the forgiveness of their sins .
A BBC Radio program that aired Sunday said the online poll was taken in early March and surveyed more than 2,000 British adults. The host said the results raise the question: ""How much of the traditional Easter story is actually optional for Christians?""
'It just doesn't make sense' The program aired commentary from Dave Tomlinson — an Anglican priest and author of ""How to Be a Bad Christian ... and a Better Human Being"" — who said the reason why it appears fewer people believe the traditional Easter story as the Bible presents it is because ""it just doesn't make sense.""
""I think it makes God out to be some kind of weird monster, really,"" Tomlinson said, adding that he sees some Evangelicals also questioning the Easter story and Christ's atonement for our sins.
But wait The program added that, according to poll, 82 percent of Christians who attend worship services at least once a month overwhelmingly agree that the Easter story is true.
So it would seem the numbers depend greatly on how individuals define themselves: Respondents can say they identify as Christians, insist they don't believe Christ died and rose from the dead for the forgiveness of their sins — but it appears most of them don't identify as Christians enough to attend church at least once a month.
The BBC program also featured a pair of guests who debated the issue. The bulk of the content can be heard after the 34-minute mark .
Pushback
Among the replies to the BBC tweet about the new poll's findings were those who questioned the Christian faith of those who don't believe the traditional Easter story:
""Um.... then they are not Christians."" ""How can they say they're Christian if they don't believe in the main part of the story?"" ""This makes them not Christians."" But one commenter countered, ""What do you call someone who lives their life in the way Jesus did (loving everyone, fighting injustice, following the Sermon on the Mount), but who doesn't think Jesus was/is God and didn't rise again after his death?""
That was met with following reply: ""Tragic. Because if you're living the way Jesus did, it's impossible that He wouldn't have inspired your soul to search for Him and understand that being holy is infinitely more than just being nice and good. That means you've turned down His invite for you to really follow Him.""
Anything else?
A similar poll was taken two years ago , and a quarter of survey respondents who identify as Christians said they don't believe in Christ's resurrection — but 57% of ""active Christians"" (again, those who attend church at least once a month) believe the resurrection took place.
And believe it not, that 2017 BBC poll said 9% of non-religious people believe in the Resurrection — and 1% of them say they believe it literally."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) says that she's done with Facebook for the sake of her own mental health.
Calling the platform and other social media ""a public health risk,"" the freshman congresswoman advises that everybody else follow suit and be mindful of how social media impacts them.
What are the details? During a Sunday appearance on Yahoo podcast ""Skullduggery,"" Ocasio-Cortez, 29, said that too much time spent on social media can be damaging to one's psyche.
""I personally gave up Facebook, which was kind of a big deal because I started my campaign on Facebook,"" she admitted. ""And Facebook was my primary digital organizing tool for a very long time. I gave up on it.""
She added, ""Social media poses a public health risk to everybody.""
Ocasio-Cortez went on to point out the myriad effects of social media on people young and old.
""There are amplified impacts for young people, particularly children under the age of 3, with screen time,"" she said. ""But I think it has a lot of effects on older people. I think it has effects on everybody. Increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.""
""I've started to kind of impose little rules on myself,"" she admitted. ""Like, every once in awhile, you'll see me hop on Twitter on the weekends, but for the most part, I take consumption of content, when it comes to consumption and reading, I take the weekends off. And so I'm not, like, scrolling through trying to read everything online that journalists are writing on weekends. I try to do that during the workweek.""
Elsewhere in the podcast, Ocasio-Cortez said that she does still compose her own tweets and Instagram and attempts to engage on social media ""both as a person with a larger audience, but also as an individual user of these platforms.""
The Washington Post points out that Ocasio-Cortez no longer uses the platform personally, but notes that her campaign still uses the platform for ad purposes.

Cory Booker harassed by 'Justice for Palestine' protestors during campaign tour kickoff,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/justice-for-palestine-protestors-harass-cory-booker,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) launched what he calls a ""Justice for All"" campaign tour over the weekend, but his kickoff speech was interrupted by protestors shouting ""Justice for Palestine.""
What are the details? Booker was speaking to a crowd in his adopted hometown of Newark on Saturday, when activists began shouting ""Justice for Palestine"" and ""from Palestine to Mexico, borders have to go."" The 2020 hopeful ignored the distraction while supporters began a counter-chant of ""Cor-y, Cor-y.""
Most of the approximately one dozen interlopers were shuffled out of the venue after their initial disruption, but a few stayed behind and continued to antagonize Booker while he met with supporters after the rally, Yahoo News reported.
One protestor, Wajeeh Abushawish, mocked Booker's tour slogan speaking with Yahoo, telling the outlet, ""You say 'Justice for All' and he named, you know, clean water, housing, affordable health care, freedom but he doesn't ... talk about Palestine. They're struggling just as much as us here — even more.""
Another activist claimed, ""Booker actively supports the oppression of Palestine.""
Yahoo reported all three of the protestors who spoke with the outlet declared their support for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with Abushawish yelling, ""Bernie 2020!""
Anything else? According to NJ.com , Booker is the only Democratic presidential candidate to co-sponsor new legislation called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which would oppose the ""Palestinian-led boycott, divestiture and sanctions movement, better known as BDS, which does not support Israel's right to exist.""
Booker also attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference last month, Fox News reported, in spite of a warning from liberal group MoveOn.org calling on Democrats to boycott the AIPAC event entirely."
Alyssa Milano asks social media users to share their 'personal abortion' stories to show 'importance of bodily autonomy',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/alyssa-milano-asks-social-media-users-to-share-their-personal-abortion-stories-to-show-importance-of-bodily-autonomy,"Actress and activist Alyssa Milano is asking women to share their ""personal abortion"" stories for her to broadcast on her new weekly podcast, ""Sorry Not Sorry.""
What are the details? In a Friday tweet, Milano wrote, ""If you'd like to share your personal abortion story on my podcast to help shine a light on the importance of bodily autonomy, please record story on your voice memo app and email it to below address.""
""If you'd like to remain anonymous please say so in your email,"" she added.
According to Deadline , Milano's latest project is set for a spring release.
The outlet reported that Milano's podcast will address ""social, political, and cultural issues from the perspective of unapologetic guests.""
""The podcast will focus on shaping narratives and changing hearts and minds to bridge the ideologies of a divided nation,"" the Deadline's report added.
Some of those ""unapologetic guests"" include former Vice President Joe Biden, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and more.
""I'm not sorry for using my voice. I'm not sorry for making people uncomfortable while being the voice for those who have been silenced,"" Milano said. ""I am grateful for this opportunity to instigate empathy and conversation while highlighting the people leading change by service throughout our great country.""
What else? In March, Milano was one of the celebrities instrumental in trying to strongarm Virginia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp into vetoing a bill on abortion.
The ""heartbeat bill,"" Georgia H.B. 481, would prohibit the majority of abortions as early as six weeks from conception. Current Georgia state law permits abortions up to 20 weeks. Abortions after six weeks would be permitted in cases such as incest, physical emergency, rape, and any pregnancies considered ""medically futile.""
Earlier in April, the Georgia House of Representatives approved the bill by a vote of 92 to 78. The bill awaits Republican Gov. Brian Kemp's signature. The governor has said that he will sign the bill into law.
""Georgia values life,"" Kemp said of the bill. ""We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. The Legislature's bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state.""
Milano and her Hollywood cronies promised to withdraw production work from the state if Kemp signed the bill into law, and circulated an open letter to that effect.

Embattled Kim Foxx asks Cook County inspector general to review how her office handled Jussie Smollett case,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-mayor-elect-on-jussie-smollett-case-this-doesnt-rank-as-a-matter-of-any-importance-to-me,"Embattled Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx asked the county's inspector general to review how her office handled the case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett case, WLS-TV reported .
Foxx's office last month dropped all 16 of Smollett's charges imposed by a grand jury after police accused him of staging a racist, homophobic attack against himself in January.
Image source: Chicago Police Department
Mayor Rahm Emanuel last month angrily blasted the decision to drop all charges against Smollett and called it ""not on the level."" In addition, associations from every police department in Cook County announced "" no confidence "" in Foxx, and the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association accused her of making ""repeated misleading and deceptive statements to the public"" and having ""failed in her most fundamental ethical obligations to the public.""
It was widely reported that Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case after rumblings that she interfered in the investigation — but then it came to light that she never actually recused herself at all .
'Full cooperation'
Foxx in a statement Friday said she pledges her ""full cooperation,"" welcomes Inspector General Patrick Blanchard's investigation, and added that ""ensuring that I and my office have the community's trust and confidence is paramount to me,"" WLS reported.
Former prosecutor Bob Milan — who once supervised Blanchard when they worked at the State's Attorney's Office — added to the station that the review ""could prevent a special prosecutor from being appointed.""
""He's a career Cook County prosecutor before he became the inspector general,"" Milan also told WLS. ""Very well respected, very smart, and he's a man of integrity.""
Anything else? Foxx wondered whether racism and sexism is behind criticism she's been receiving.
""As someone who has lived in this city, who came up in the projects of this city to serve as the first African American woman in this role, it is disheartening to me, that when we get in these positions somehow the goalposts change,"" she said during an event hosted by the Rev. Jesse Jackson two weekends ago.
Prosecutors cited Smollett's community service for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH coalition , as well as his $10,000 bond forfeiture, as factors in the dropped-charges decision.
In stark contrast to Emanuel, Chicago Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot — the first black woman and openly gay candidate elected to the city's office — said the Smollett case ""doesn't rank as a matter of any importance to me.""
""We've got a lot of things on our plate, a lot of pressing issues that are truly affecting people's lives,"" she told WLS.
Emanuel promised to send a bill to Smollett for what it cost Chicago to investigate his claims — and now the city is suing him after he missed a deadline earlier this month to pay the $130,000 charge.
Smollett also claimed his attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" 2016 campaign slogan — put a noose around his neck, and poured a substance that smelled like bleach on him while beating him in the street around 2 a.m. in near zero temperatures. Smollett denied that he orchestrated a hoax.

Firefighters scale scaffolding at burning Notre Dame Cathedral to fight the flames,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/firefighters-scale-scaffolding-to-fight-notre-dame-fire,"On Monday, the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France erupted in flames , which caused its spire and roof to collapse. Desperate to save as much of the building as they could, firefighters in Paris reportedly climbed up the scaffolding surrounding the cathedral while the fire was still burning.
Here's what we know In an image tweeted by British journalist Henry Jones, firefighters can be seen climbing up the scaffolding next to the building. This scaffolding was put in place as part of a $6.8 million restoration project that was ongoing at the time. French authorities suspect that the fire was somehow started due to this restoration work.
Both the spire and roof of the cathedral have completely collapsed, and the fire has spread to one of the building's square towers.
Construction on the cathedral began more than eight centuries ago.
Video from the fire shows firefighters spraying a hose from halfway up the scaffolding.
Canada's CBC News reported that firefighters were also trying to salvage some of the cathedral's priceless works of art. According to CNN , 400 firefighters are involved in trying to combat this disaster."

The Natural Resources committee recently advanced Assembly Bill 1162 , which would ban ""lodging establishments"" from offering small plastic bottles of ""personal care products"" to guests. The committee voted 6-3, with two members abstaining, to move the measure forward.
Democratic Assemblymen Ash Kalra and Mark Stone introduced the bill aimed at reducing the amount of plastic in the environment.
""The amount of plastic produced is increasing exponentially, and we must consider all options to reduce this pollution from entering our waste streams,"" Kalra said, according to KSWB-TV . ""While it may not appear to be a problem on an individual level, small plastic bottles that are less than 12-ounces represent a sizeable amount of waste collectively that the state must address.""
What are the details? The ban would prohibit hotels, motels, vacation rentals, and resorts from distributing toiletries in plastic containers 12-ounces or smaller in guest rooms.
Local agencies would inspect properties for compliance.
Violators would receive a written warning for the first violation. After that, the property could face a $500 fine for each subsequent offense, not to exceed $2,000 a year, according to the bill's text.
Hospitals, nursing homes, jails, homeless shelters, and hosted rentals, among others, would not be subject to the ban.
If passed, the ban would take effect Jan. 1, 2023.
What else? Last year, the Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that banned lodging establishments from providing toiletries in small plastic bottles. The measure will go into effect Dec. 31, 2020."

"White House reportedly considering travel restrictions for more countries, based on visa overstays",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-travel-restrictions-visa-overstays,"The Trump administration is reportedly considering restricting travel from countries whose citizens have a high rate of overstaying their visas while in the United States.
Here's what we know This potential move was first reported by the Wall Street Journal , and later confirmed by Politico , which spoke to an official from the Department of Homeland Security. Politico's source said that a final decision and announcement could come as soon as this week.
According to a report from the Department of Homeland Security , 701,900 non-immigrants from other countries overstayed their visas in the United States during fiscal year 2017.
The countries with the highest overstay rates include several in Africa, namely Angola (10.06 percent), Burkina Faso (14.51 percent), Burundi (13.09 percent), Chad (24.39 percent), Djibouti (42.30 percent), Eritrea (26.54 percent), the Gambia (12.36 percent), Liberia (20.74 percent), Sierra Leone (12.66 percent), South Sudan (14.01 percent), and Sudan (13.70 percent), as well as some non-African countries including Bhutan (14.21 percent), Laos (11.28 percent), and the Solomon Islands (30.12 percent). Politico suggested that these countries could be targeted for immigration restrictions because of President Donald Trump's reported description of African nations as ""s**thole countries.""
Notably, some of these countries have a high rate, but a comparatively low number of total visa holders entering the United States. For example at 30.12 percent the Solomon Islands (which are near Papua New Guinea) have one of the highest rates of people overstaying their visas, but that percentage represents only 103 people.
A White House spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that the administration was prioritizing visa overstays. During the 2016 campaign , Trump had promised to address this issue, saying that if the U.S. didn't ""enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border — it's as simple as that.""
Politico , citing a 2006 Pew Research Center study , noted that as many as 45 percent of all illegal immigrants in the United States are believed to have entered legally on a visa and then never left, a number ranging from 4.5 million to 6 million."

Retired Master Sgt. Cedric King said that he hopes his story inspires others who face challenges in their lives.
""I want people in Boston to understand that if I can do this, then they can do any challenge they have in front of them,"" he told WBZ over the weekend.
What's the story? In 2012, King lost both of his legs after he stepped on an improvised explosive device during his deployment to Afghanistan.
Less than two years later, he competed for the first time in the Boston Marathon.
""Even though I was in a position where I lost my legs, it did not give me an excuse not to keep fighting,"" King said.
He's competed in the 26.2-mile race on his prosthetic legs and he's done it in a wheelchair.
This year, King competed in the handcycle race.
""The preparation for this year has been a little tough,"" King said. ""Finishing it on all three platforms is fantastic. It gives me the ability to know that if I can do this on three different platforms — prosthetics, a wheelchair, and a handcycle — then I can do anything.""
What else? King spends much of his time traveling around the country and sharing his story through the Penfed Credit Union Foundation Speaker's Bureau.
""Corporations and businesses in this country, they need to hear the stories coming out of Afghanistan and Iraq,"" he told the news station.

Bill Weld went on CNN with Jake Tapper to explain why he was mounting an unlikely attempt to unseat the president from his re-election in 2020.
""I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we've had out of the White House the last two years, that would be a political tragedy and I would fear for the Republic,"" said the 74 year-old Weld, ""so I would be ashamed of myself if I didn't raise my hand and run.""
Tapper challenged Weld by listing off polling numbers that show Trump is highly popular within the Republican party, including his latest financial campaign statement that showed he had already raised historic donations for his re-election.
""What we have now is a president that mocks the rule of law, I spent seven years in the Justice Department trying to keep the politics out of law enforcement - he's trying to put it in,"" Weld said.
""A president who says we don't need a free press, who says climate change is a complete hoax,"" he added, ""he's not paying attention, I doubt very much that he's made a study of any of those issues.""
Weld said that he is a very fiscally economic conservative and criticized Trump for not even pretending to be fiscally conservative.
Weld was the governor of Massachusetts for two terms and worked as the head of the criminal division at the U.S. States Attorney office under Ronald Reagan's administration. He had said in February that he was thinking about running against Trump.

""The Democrats don't just want illegal immigrants being limited to [sanctuary cities.] They want them everywhere,"" said Jon. ""After all, you can't transform a country with those cities alone.

Their chorus created a hauntingly sad and beautiful backdrop to the scene they were witnessing; a centuries-old Christian landmark slowly being destroyed by flames despite the efforts of hundreds of firefighters to control it.
What's going on?
Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire Monday afternoon , presumably due to an accident related to renovations that were being made to the landmark.
The roof and spire of the cathedral collapsed, and officials initially believed that the entire structure would burn to the ground. However, as of Monday evening, fire officials said that the building would be partially saved .
""We now believe that the two towers of Notre Dame have been saved,"" Paris fire chief Jean-Claude Gallet told Reuters. ""We now consider that the main structure of Notre Dame has been saved and preserved
Officials also said that at least some of the most precious art contained within the cathedral had been saved, although it will be some time before the total scope of the damage and loss is known for sure.
One fireman has been reported as seriously injured while fighting the fire. As many as 400 firefighters were working to control the fire throughout the day.
French President Emmanuel Macron is already looking ahead to efforts to rebuild the cathedral.
""I'm telling you all tonight—we will rebuild this cathedral together,"" Macron said, according to CBS News . ""This is probably part of the French destiny. And we will do it in the next years. Starting tomorrow, a national donation scheme will be started that will extend beyond our borders.""

Trump 2020 campaign reports first quarter fundraising effort — and trounces top two Democratic contenders - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-fundraising-for-2020,"The campaign to re-elect President Donald Trump in 2020 will report the first quarter fundraising totals, and it will eclipse that of Democratic candidates Senators Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
According to numbers obtained by the Associated Press, the campaign will report raising $30.3 million for the first quarter of 2019.
Harris reported raising $12 million, while Sanders reported raising $18 million in the same period. Beto O'Rourke reported $9.4 million.
The vast majority of Trump's reelection fundraising (99 percent) came from donations that were less than $200 each, according to the campaign.
In a CNN interview with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, he said they were developing a digital voter list that would dwarf the efforts that first got Trump into the Oval Office.
""It now has hundreds of millions of records in voter history, consumer data, and when we put polling data in that machine and we say this is what's happening,"" Parscale explained to Dana Bash, ""it can spit out models saying these are the people you need to talk to, and these are the messages you should talk to them about.""
The campaign now has $40.8 million on hand — an unprecedented sum for so early in a reelection campaign.

Nancy Pelosi hurls yet another insult at Ocasio-Cortez and the district that elected her,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-versus-ocasio-cortez,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched another insult at progressive upstart Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) during an interview Monday.
""When we won this election it wasn't in districts like mine,"" Pelosi explained, ""or Alexandria's, however, she's a wonderful member of Congress I think all of our colleagues will attest.""
Pelosi was speaking at the London School of Economics and Political Science when she was asked about the popularity of Democratic Socialist Ocasio-Cortez.
""But those are districts that are solidly democratic. This glass of water would win with a 'd' next to its name in those districts,"" she said to laughter from the audience.
""And not to diminish the exuberance and the personality and the rest of Alexandria and the other members,"" she continued, ""but when I said three, they were talking about three that were getting a good deal of press on it.""
""But the 43 districts, we won 43 net gain of 40, were right down the middle,"" she concluded.
This follows upon another jab that made headlines when Pelosi dismissively said that the progressive wing that Ocasio-Cortez led was comprised of about five people.
While the far left progressive policies of Ocasio-Cortez and her dexterity with social media have catapulted her to the forefront of Democratic media coverage, more establishment Democrats have criticized her for trying to remake the party in her radical image.

Bernie Sanders' 1-percenter status confirmed with release of tax returns,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-one-percenter-status-confirmed-with-release-of-tax-returns,"Just minutes before going on Fox News to advocate for higher taxes, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released the past 10 years of his own tax returns , confirming that the Democratic Socialist has benefitted significantly from the economic system he so often rails against.
According to the New York Times, Sanders' income puts him in the top 1 percent of taxpayers.
""These tax returns show that our family has been fortunate,"" Sanders said via statement. ""I am very grateful for that, as I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and I know the stress of economic insecurity.""
What do the numbers show? In 2018, Sanders and his wife earned $561,293 in gross income. Approximately $393,000 of that came from his book sales. They paid a federal effective tax rate of 26 percent ($145,840).
The Sanders family's income multiplied significantly when they started selling books. In 2014, he and his wife earned an adjusted gross income of about $200,000, while in 2016 and 2017 they earned more than $800,000 each year just in book revenue, not even counting his six-figure congressional salary.
Isn't profiting from book sales capitalism? During his Fox News town hall Monday, host Bret Baier asked Sanders if he would credit his wealth to a capitalist economy.
""When you wrote the book and made the money, isn't that the definition of capitalism and the American dream?"" Baier asked. Sanders paused for a moment, then simply answered ""no.""
""This year, we had $560,000 in income,"" Sanders said. ""In my and my wife's case, I wrote a pretty good book. It was a bestseller, sold all over the world, and we made money. If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do it.""
Sanders was also asked why he wouldn't voluntarily pay more in taxes since he believes the wealthy should pay much more than they do right now. He brushed that suggestion off and pivoted the conversation to President Donald Trump.
""Pfft, come on. I paid the taxes that I owe,"" Sanders said, according to Fox News. ""And by the way, why don't you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes? President Trump watches your network a little bit, right? Hey President Trump, my wife and I just released 10 years. Please do the same."""

Instead, they want ""unassimilated"" immigrants spread throughout the country because they are more likely to vote Democrat.
""The Democrats don't just want illegal immigrants being limited to [sanctuary cities.] They want them everywhere,"" said Jon. ""After all, you can't transform a country with those cities alone.

Alyssa Milano mangles the truth in tweet rant against Trump on tax day,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/milano-tweets-against-trump,"Hollywood actress and outspoken liberal Alyssa Milano attempted to bash President Donald Trump in a Twitter rant about tax day, but instead managed to mangle key facts about Republican tax cuts.
""Now that Tax Day is almost here, and Americans are seeing for themselves who the Republican Party really cares about,"" Milano tweeted, adding a list of points about the federal tax filing deadline.
2/ Already this April, we've learned that tax refunds are down this year by $6 BILLION.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 14, 2019 3/ According to a recent NBC/WSJ poll, only 17 percent of Americans think their taxes went down, and a majority don't think they got any tax cut at all. And this isn't partisan. Only 33 percent of Republicans think they got a tax cut.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 14, 2019 But, as the New York Times reports, Americans' perceptions of whether they got a tax cut does not match with the reality of whether they got a tax cut. While 64.8 percent of Americans actually received a tax cut, only about 40 percent believe they got a tax cut.
4/ And we just learned from the Center for Public Integrity that the number of big companies that pay zero taxes—that's right, zero—have gone from 30 to 60.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 14, 2019 5/ But here's the thing—Americans aren't dumb. We knew from the beginning what Republicans were doing. As of March, the GOP tax scam only had a 36 percent approval rating. That's worse than Trump's.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 14, 2019 The New York Times report also explains why Americans have such a low opinion about the Republican tax plan - propaganda from liberals like Milano.
""To a large degree, the gap between perception and reality on the tax cuts appears to flow from a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase,"" the report states.
Milano drew her anti-Republican and anti-Trump conclusions from opinion divorced from reality.
""We knew the @GOP was just doing a giant favor for their corporate donors and friends,"" Milano said in the last tweet of her rant. ""We knew it would add to an already unsustainable deficit. And we knew the middle class were an afterthought.""
In 2017, Milano blamed a Trump aide for a store's holiday arrangement that she said was pro-Nazi."
ICE deported the husband of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan—then brought him back a week later,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ice-deported-the-husband-of-a-u-s-soldier-killed-in-afghanistan-then-brought-him-back-a-week-later,"An illegal immigrant who had been married to a soldier killed in Afghanistan was deported back to Mexico last week, forcing him to leave his daughter behind in Arizona.
Monday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement brought the man back to the U.S. to be released, according to the Arizona Republic .
How did this happen? Jose Gonzalez Carranza, 30, first came to the U.S. illegally in 2004 as a teenager. In 2007 he married Barbara Vieyra.
In 2010, Army Pfc. Vieyra was killed in Afghanistan when her unit was attacked by insurgents with an IED and grenade launchers. They have a daughter, Evelyn, who is now 12.
Carranza was granted a ""parole in place"" after his wife's death, which allowed him to remain in the U.S. without fear that he would be deported.
However, in 2018, ICE refiled his case, and he was ordered to be deported by a judge in December 2018 after not showing up for a hearing. Gonzalez said he never received notice of the hearing. His attorney said ICE sent notification to the wrong address.
Carranza said he found out about the deportation order last Monday when he was arrested by ICE agents on the way to his welding job. He was deported to Nogales, Mexico, a few days later and had been living in a shelter there while his daughter stayed in Arizona with her grandparents.
How did he get back to the U.S.? Carranza's attorney, Ezequiel Hernandez, sent out a press release after his client was deported, hoping to draw attention to what he believed was an injustice.
""There are plenty of people you can go after but not a guy whose wife died in Afghanistan,"" Hernandez told the Arizona Republic.
Hernandez said that not long after he spoke to the Republic about the case, an ICE official called him and said the agency was bringing Carranza back to the U.S.
Customs and Border Patrol brought Carranza back into the U.S. and to their Tucson, Arizona, offices, where he would be picked up by ICE agents, brought back to his home in Phoenix, and released.
As of Monday night, ICE had not commented on the specifics of the situation or why the agency opted to bring Carranza back. A spokesperson for Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) told the Republic that Sinema's office reached out to assist Carranza."
"NYU professor wants to know when the ‘memory of 9/11’ became ‘sacred,’ calls Rep. Dan Crenshaw ‘lieutenant commander s**thead’",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyu-professor-sept-11-sacred-dan-crenshaw-shthead,"An NYU professor is under fire after taking to Twitter to question the memory of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The professor, Talia Lavin, who teaches journalism at the university, also took aim at Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) in profane tweets.
According to her university bio , Lavin teaches a class titled ""Reporting on the Far-Right"" and focuses on ""far-right extremism and social justice.""
What are the details? In a Saturday tweet, Lavin wrote, ""[W]hen did the memory of 9/11 become 'sacred'? [I]n what way? [A]nd to whom?""
""[I] meant this as a genuine question,"" she continued. ""[I]t was indisputably tragic, world-changing, evil and despicable, and a turning point of history. [B]ut 'sacred' is a particular word with its own religious meanings, and [I] wanted to pinpoint what it means to call such a day 'sacred' specifically.""
Lavin tweeted her thoughts in response to recent controversy sparked by remarks that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) made about the 9/11 attacks. Omar made the remarks in March while speaking at a CAIR fundraiser. During her remarks, Omar appeared to minimize the attacks as ""some people did something.""
What else? Lavin later took aim at Crenshaw, who previously criticized Omar for the remarks she made during the CAIR fundraiser.
Addressing Omar's remarks on his Twitter page, the Texas congressman wrote, ""First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something.'""
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was just one person who jumped to Omar's defense .
""You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victim's Compensation Fund, yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes,"" she wrote. ""In 2018, right-wing extremists were behind almost ALL US domestic terrorist killings. Why don't you go do something about that?""
Lavin later tweeted a video of Crenshaw defending his criticism of Omar's CAIR fundraiser remarks.
Lavin captioned the video, ""[T]he real victim, captain s**thead, speaks.""
Criticism poured in, but Lavin stuck to her guns and doubled down on her insults of Crenshaw.
""[A]ctually, ur [sic] right, I should respect his rank,"" she added . ""[H]is name is Lieutenant Commander s**thead.""

WATCH: Fox News hosts corner Bernie Sanders' hypocrisy on taxes. His response says it all.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-taxes-fox-news-town-hall,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, was cornered over his hypocrisy on taxes during a Fox News town hall Monday, dodging tough questions from two Fox News hosts.
What happened? Sanders — who is now officially confirmed as a member of the infamous ""one percent"" after he released his past 10 years of tax returns — was asked why he accepts the lower tax rate afforded to him by Republican-passed tax reform when he advocates the wealthiest Americans pay their ""fair share.""
""Your taxes do show you're a millionaire,"" Fox News host Bret Baier said. ""But your marginal tax rate [in 2018] was 26 percent because of President Trump's tax cuts. So why not say: 'I'm leading this revolution, I'm going to take those.'?""
Sanders responded: ""Pffttt...come on...I am— I paid the taxes that I owe.""
Without directly answering Baier's question, Sanders launched into a broadside against President Donald Trump.
""And by the way, why don't you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes,"" Sanders said angrily. ""I am eagerly awaiting you doing that.""
But Baier was not satisfied, and pushed the line of questioning further asking Sanders why he is ""vilifying"" millionaires and billionaires for being wealthy. Sanders denied that he vilifies wealthy Americans, repeating his oft-cited talking point that wealthy Americans should pay their ""fair share.""
What happened next? Then it was Fox News host Martha MacCallum's turn. Noting that Sanders does not advocate taxing the wealthiest Americans at 70 percent — like some of his Democratic colleagues — Sanders said he believes the rate should be 52 percent, which he advocated for during his 2016 presidential campaign.
""Alright, so 52 percent. So, would you be willing to pay 52 percent on the money that you made?"" MacCallum asked. ""You can volunteer, you can send it back.""
""You can volunteer, too,"" Sanders interrupted.
""But that's what you suggested everybody in your [tax] bracket should do,"" MacCallum shot back.
""Martha, why don't you— you make more money than I do! Why don't you give—"" Sanders replied.
""I didn't suggest a wealth tax,"" MacCallum said back. Baier added that MacCallum also is not running for president.
Sanders later said he's going to ""fight for a wealth tax."" He went on to bash Trump once again, vilifying the tax reform bill by highlighting the savings it provided for billionaires and massive corporations."
Man accused of throwing young boy off Mall of America balcony makes chilling admission to police,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-mall-of-america-attack-chilling-admission,"The man accused of throwing a 5-year-old boy off the third-story balcony at the Mall of America last week, nearly killing the child, admitted to police he went to the mall in search of someone to kill — and was upset that his plan did not ""work out.""
What are the details? According to KMSP-TV , 24-year-old Emmanuel Aranda, who was formally charged with first-degree attempted premeditated murder on Monday, told police he went to the mall last Friday with the intention of killing someone.
He even went to the mall last Thursday with the same intentions — but for some reason did not follow through with his plan. His plan was to throw an adult over the balcony, but he admitted he chose the young boy instead. Why he chose the child remains a mystery.
The Mall of America Image source: KMSP-TV screenshot
Aranda told police he lashed out in anger because multiple attempts to pick up women at the mall had ended in rejection.
""This crime has shocked the community. That a child, with his mother, at a safe public area like a mall, could be violently attacked for no reason is chilling for everyone,"" Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement, KMSP reported.
What is the background? Court documents say the victim's mother and her son were standing outside a mall restaurant with another parent and child. That's when Aranda approached them and threw the young child over the third-story balcony, immediately fleeing the scene afterward.
According to KMSP, police estimate the child fell 39 feet before hitting the ground below, suffering numerous broken bones and severe head trauma.
Witnesses attempted to stop Aranda from fleeing, but he got away. Police later caught him waiting for the light rail.
One positive development has been the outpouring of support from Americans across the country. Donations for the family have poured in and amounted to more than $685,000 as of Tuesday morning, blowing past the GoFundMe campaign goal of $500,000.
""The family cannot express how grateful they are for all of the prayers, love and support that they are receiving. There truly aren't enough words!"" the latest GoFundMe update reads. ""His condition has very little change at this point, but we are hoping to get some good news back from some upcoming tests in the next few days. The family is continuing to request privacy during this time."""

Photos snapped from inside the 850-year-old Gothic church show smoke and fire billowing inside the nave of the church. Rows of wooden pews leading to the altar also appeared intact.

What other artifacts were saved?
The Crown of Thorns, believed by some to have been worn by Jesus when he was nailed to the cross and considered as cathedral's ""most precious and most venerated relic,"" was rescued from the fire, according to Hidalgo.

The Crown of Thorns and the Tunic of Saint Louis are safe at Paris City Hall, Franck Riester, France's culture minister, said Tuesday morning on French radio, the New York Times reported.
Just days earlier, 16 bronze statues were removed from the cathedral's roof and placed into storage as the structure was undergoing a massive restoration.

The move saved the statues from destruction when cathedral's spire collapsed.
What else? It's sill unclear whether or not a piece of the True Cross and one of the Holy Nails have survived.
Much of the cathedral's Great Organ, which dates back to the 19th century and contains more than 8,000 pipes from the 1200s appears to have survived.

'Submit to God thru Islam': Church vandalized with graffiti; 125-year-old windows apparently broken,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/submit-to-god-thru-islam-church-vandalized-with-graffiti-125-year-old-windows-apparently-broken,"A South Carolina church was vandalized with apparently spray-painted graffiti that read, ""Submit to God thru Islam"" and ""Muhammed [sic] is his prophet.""
Anderson Police on Sunday posted a Facebook photo of the vandalism at Midway Presbyterian Church. The photo shows three covered-over windows that are 125 years old, police said. They appear to have been broken.
The post added that a reward will be offered ""for information that leads to the arrest of the individual(s) who vandalized this church.""
The Facebook post has garnered over 750 comments, with some blaming Muslims for the graffiti. It's worth noting, however, that following the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, a gay choir director admitted to spray-painting his Indiana church with anti-gay slurs, the phrase ""Heil Trump,"" and a swastika . That incident was among a number of similar hoaxes made to look like Trump supporters perpetrated hateful acts .
And coupled with the botching of the commonly recognized spelling of Muhammad, it's quite possible the Midway Presbyterian Church vandalism was not committed by a Muslim or Muslims."
Billionaires pledge more than $450 million to rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral after devastating fire,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/billionairs-pledge-more-than-450-million-to-rebuild-notre-dame,"French billionaires and large companies have been offering hundreds of millions of dollars to repair the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, after a fire caused severe damage to the iconic church on Monday.
Here's what we know On Monday , a fire destroyed the roof and spire of the cathedral. Firefighters managed to put out the blaze before it destroyed the building's two towers. Artifacts inside, including what is believed by Catholics to be Jesus' Crown of Thorns, a piece of the True Cross, and a nail from the Crucifixion, were all saved . Pieces of artwork from inside the building were also rescued. No one was injured in the fire.
While the exact cause of the fire is still unknown, French authorities have speculated that it may have been related to the restoration work that had been going on at the time. It is not yet clear what the cost of repairs will be. The interior of the building had largely been saved due to a stone vault ceiling underneath the now-destroyed wooden roof.
""We will rebuild. All together,"" French President Emmanuel Macron promised in a tweet from Monday. ""It's part of the fate, the destiny of France, and our common project over the coming years. And I am committed to it.""
Those committed to helping pay for the restoration include actress Salma Hayek's husband, François-Henri Pinault, the head of luxury conglomerate Kering, and his father who together pledged 100 million euros, or $113 million . In a statement posted on Twitter, Pinault said, ""Faced with this tragedy, my father and I have decided to contribute to the funds needed to fully rebuild Notre Dame de Paris, in order to bring this jewel of our heritage back to life as soon as possible.""
Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH group (Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Sephora, Marc Jacobs, and Givenchy) announced a 200 million euro ($226 million) donation of his own, French oil and gas company Total promised 100 million euros ($113 million), and consulting and technology firm Capgemini offered 1 million euros ($1.13 million)."
"The 2020 Democrats want to take more of your money to help the less fortunate, but how much have they given to charity?",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-how-much-have-2020-dems-given-to-charity,"2020 Democrats have floated plenty of ideas involving the use of government force to take taxpayer money for the less-fortunate, but how much have they given to charity personally?
Not a whole lot, according to analysis of released tax returns from the Washington Post's James Hohmann.
The analysis contained in one of the newspaper's daily email newsletter shows that, out of the current crop of candidates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her husband have been the most fiscally charitable, giving 5.5 percent of their income last year to charity.
The rest of the candidates follow in descending order by percentage of total income:
Washington governor Jay Inslee and his wife gave 4.1 percent.
Freshly-outed one-percenter Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and his wife gave 3.4 percent.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and her husband gave just south of 2 percent. So did Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) gave 1.4 percent of her income to charity last year, but didn't report a cent of giving during her first three years as California's attorney general.
Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke and his wife gave .3 percent.
The email notes that American voters still haven't seen tax returns from candidates Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
While the numbers are certain to generate criticism from Republican candidates, it won't be the first time that Democrats have have taken heat for how much they give to charity.
Prospective frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden hasn't yet said whether or not he'll run for president this time around, but he too has been criticized for his lower rates of charitable giving, both in 2008 and 2012 .
2018 New York Times analysis of voting and IRS data found that Republicans tend to give more to charity than Democrats across the country. A 2013 study from the Chronicle of Philanthropy saw similar finding in contrasting the giving levels of blue and red states.
President Donald Trump has not yet released his tax returns, though they have been demanded by House Democrats ."

""It's a French 9/11, you know? And it's a big shock,"" he told Smith. ""The church was there for more than 850 years. Even the Nazis didn't dare to destroy it.""
But then Karsenty noted in past years churches have been ""desecrated each and every week in France, all over France. So, of course, you will hear the story of ... political correctness which will tell you that it's probably an accident—""
Smith immediately stopped Karsenty: ""Sir, sir, sir, we're not going to speculate here of the cause of something which we don't know. If you have observations, or you know something, we would love to hear it.""
But Karsenty added a warning that people ""need to be ready,"" and Smith shut him down for good.
""No, sir, we're not doing that here, not now, not on my watch,"" Smith said before ending the interview. ""Philippe Karsenty, it's very good of you to be here.""
Here's the clip:
According to NewsBusters , Smith said 20 minutes later that ""there have been a number of attacks on Catholic churches in the Paris area. But [the Notre Dame fire and past incidents] we are not connecting at this moment.""
What happened in the Cavuto interview? Cavuto's guest was Catholic League President Bill Donohue who said if the Notre Dame fire ""is an accident, it's a monumental tragedy. But forgive me for being suspicious. Just last month, a 17th-century church was set on fire in Paris. We've seen tabernacles knocked down, crosses have been torn down, statues have been smashed.""
At that point Cavuto cut off Donohue: ""We don't know that. So if we can avoid what your suspicions might be. I do want to look at what happens now."" The host then asked Donohue if he believed the Catholic Church will want to determine the cause of the Notre Dame fire before it commits more money to what he said was a fully funded renovation project.
""Well, first, they have to get to the bottom of it, and they will rebuild it,"" Donohue replied. ""There's no question about that."" But then he switched gears: ""I'm sorry, I mean, when I find out that the Eucharist is being destroyed and excrement is being smeared on crosses. This is going on now!""
Then Cavuto cut off Donohue permanently.
""I love you, Bill, but we cannot make conjectures about this,"" Cavuto said before ending the phone call amid Donohue's protests. ""So, thank you. Bill, I'm sorry. Thank you very, very much. I do want to let people know — and again we're not trying to be rude to our guests here — there is so much here we don't know about what happened here. We do know that about four hours ago something started here."" Cavuto added that while there have been attacks in Paris, it's ""another leap"" to say an attack caused the Notre Dame fire.
Here's the clip:
What about the spate of church attacks? Newsweek last month reported that vandalism, including arson and desecration, have been hitting Catholic churches across France since the start of the year.
More from the magazine:
Vandals have smashed statues, knocked down tabernacles, scattered or destroyed the Eucharist and torn down crosses, sparking fears of a rise in anti-Catholic sentiment in the country.
Last Sunday, the historic Church of St. Sulpice in Paris was set on fire just after midday mass on Sunday, Le Parisien reported, although no one was injured. Police are still investigating the attack, which firefighters have confidently attributed to arson.
In addition, a statue of the Virgin Mary was found smashed and the altar cross was thrown on the ground at the St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Houilles in February, Newsweek said, citing Catholic publication La Croix International.
An altar cloth was burned and crosses and statues of saints were smashed in February at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur, the magazine added.
And the altar was looted and a cross was smeared with human excrement at Notre-Dame des Enfants church in Nimes, Newsweek said."
"West Africa immigrant says two men assaulted, robbed him because of his MAGA hat",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/west-africa-immigrant-attacked-maga-hat,"Police arrested 27-year-old Jovan Crawford and 25-year-old Scott Duncan Roberson after they reportedly assaulted and robbed a West African immigrant for wearing his ""Make America Great Again"" hat in public.
Authorities charged the two men with assault and robbery for the incident, which took place in Germantown, Maryland, over the weekend.
What are the details? Atsu Nable, who emigrated from West Africa in 2007 and became an American citizen, said that he supported the Republican Party since he moved to the U.S., and became a fan of President Donald Trump when he announced his presidential campaign.
Nable told WTTG-TV that he was walking on a city street when Crawford and Roberson approached him and began berating him for wearing the trademark red cap. He added that one of the suspects hit him from behind.
""I was like, 'Why are you doing that?' You know? We don't have to do this,"" Nable explained. He said the two men responded by telling him that the hat is ""not any good.""
""And then they started punching me on my head,"" Nable added. Unafraid, Nable said he told the suspects that he was permitted to have his own opinions and express them in a manner in which he sees fit. Nable explained that he attempted to walk away from the suspects but that they wouldn't let up on him until he fell to the ground.
Nable said that in addition to berating him, following him, and striking him, they also destroyed his headphones and attempted to grab his cell phone.
According to the outlet, eyewitnesses to the attack phoned authorities. Two police officers discovered the suspects at a nearby basketball court attempting to hide.
WJZ-TV reported that authorities charged Crawford with robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, attempt theft $100 to under $1,500, second-degree assault, and malicious destruction of property with a value less than $1,000.
Authorities charged Roberson with robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, attempt theft $100 to under $1,500, and second-degree assault.
Despite the scare, Nable remains firm in his beliefs, and told the station that he attended Trump's campaign events and offered to help when the president was inaugurated in Jan. 2017. He said that he wears his hat all the time.
""I came [to the U.S.] for freedom,"" he told WTTG."
Three more veterans commit suicide at VA facilities in five-day span,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/3-vets-commit-suicide-at-va-facilities,"Three veterans took their own lives at separate Veterans Affairs facilities within a five-day span earlier this month, putting a renewed spotlight on the high suicide rates among former service members.
What are the details? On April 5, 29-year-old Gary Pressley fatally shot himself in the chest while in a vehicle parked outside the Carl Vinson VA Medical Center in Dublin, Georgia, WMAZ-TV reported. Pressley's mother said her son was tormented by all of the devastation he saw while helping with search and rescue in Haiti, after a 2010 earthquake killed roughly 250,000 people.
Pressley was medically discharged from the Navy in 2012 following a bad car accident, and thereafter, his mother said, ""It was just a battle with the medication, the doctors, and just, I watched him cry, because he couldn't get the help he needed.""
Pressley reportedly told his girlfriend he planned to take his own life in the parking lot of the Dublin VA ""so somebody can pay attention to what's happening, so other vets do not have to go through this."" But by the time his sister found out his intentions and alerted authorities, it was too late.
The next day, just 140 miles away, 68-year-old Olen Hancock shot himself outside the main entrance of Atlanta VA Medical Center in Decatur, Georgia. According to WSB-TV , Hancock had been seen pacing in the lobby of the facility right before he walked out and took his own life.
A third veteran committed suicide at a clinic in Austin, Texas, on April 9. The unidentified victim shot himself in front of hundreds of people in the first-floor waiting room, KXAN-TV reported.
Anything else? Chairman of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs Mark Takano (D-Calif.) released a statement in response to the recent deaths, saying in part, ""Every new instance of veteran suicide showcases a barrier to access, but with three incidents on VA property in just five days, and six this year alone, it's critical we do more to stop this epidemic.""
Takano added, ""All Americans have a role to play in reducing veteran suicide, and the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs is going to make this issue a top priority.""
According to Fox News , the rate of suicide among veterans is 1.5 times higher than Americans who have not served. We lose roughly 20 veterans each day to self-inflicted death."
Beagles once force-fed pesticides are now going to new homes,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/beagles-once-force-fed-pesticides-are-now-going-to-new-homes,"Thirty-two beagles will be adopted out to new homes after being rescued from a laboratory where they were being fed pesticides.
Wait...what happened? Charles River Laboratories in Michigan admitted to force feeding a new fungicide to three dozen beagles. The fungicide was being developed by Dow DuPont's Corteva Agriscience division. The lab planned to euthanize the dogs at the end of the test.
In March, the Humane Society of the United States posted a video exposing the testing. According to the Humane Society, half a million people protested the treatment of the beagles. A few days later, Corteva announced that it would be turning the beagles over to the Humane Society.
In a statement, Corteva said that the ""dogs are healthy, under the care of veterinarians,"" and that the company would ""work as quickly as possible with the Michigan Humane Society to find safe and caring homes.""
The Humane Society has since received 32 beagles from Corteva. The Humane Society said that it is currently accepting applications to get each of these dogs adopted and will make a decision on the best home for each beagle after 8 p.m. on Sunday.
The dogs will undergo training before they can go to their new homes, and the Humane Society warned that since the dogs had experienced trauma, ""activities enjoyed by other dogs may not be options for them.""
It is not clear at this point why only 32 dogs were available for adoption when 36 were used for the study.
""And, of course, we want to see all 36 beagles who were assigned to this study released to the Michigan Humane Society,"" Vice President of animal research issues at the Humane Society Kathleen Conlee told CNN . ""It is up to Dow/Corteva to explain why there are only 32 dogs being released."" Conlee said that in her organization's discussions regarding the dogs, the laboratory repeatedly agreed that there were 36.
The original video from the Human Society that led to the release of the beagles is posted below. The content may be disturbing for some viewers."
Principal apologizes to student after telling her to cover up her pro-Trump T-shirt,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/principal-apologizes-for-making-student-cover-trump-shirt,"A New Hampshire principal has apologized to a female student after first telling her to cover up her pro-President Donald Trump T-shirt.
What's a brief history on the issue? The student, high school freshman Ciretta MacKenzie, wore the shirt last week for the school's America pride day. Principal Brian Ernest, however, took issue with the pro-Trump gear and told her that she would have to cover it up because it violated dress code.
Ciretta revealed that Ernest told her Trump is a controversial president, and Ernest didn't want to alienate students throughout the day or make it a political point of contention.
Ciretta said that she asked the principal what would happen if she couldn't find a different shirt to put on, and he purportedly told her that she would have to be separated from the rest of the students. The teen was able to borrow a sweatshirt from a friend, and ended up taking off her hat, but felt that Ernest's request violated her First Amendment rights.
Epping School District Superintendent Valerie McKenney said that an investigation into the incident was ongoing, noting that the district ""will take steps to remedy this situation for all parties involved and ensure that this type of situation never happens again.""

So what is Ernest saying now?
Ernest issued an apology in letter Friday, according to WBZ-TV .
A portion of the letter stated, ""I want our students to be free thinkers and be able to express their opinions in a respectful manner.""
He also explained that he'd met with the teen and her family to issue a formal apology.
""We have begun to draft a plan to move forward to promote civil discourse and diversity in our schools,"" the letter continued. ""In retrospect, I want to fully acknowledge my error in judgment and sincerely apologize if my actions were misinterpreted and offended anyone. That was never my intention.""
McKenney issued a follow-up letter of her own on the incident.
She wrote, ""The Epping School Board and Epping District's position is that this event should not have ever taken place, and we are committed to the creation of a school environment that promotes open and free thought and dialogue.""
The outlet also reported that the MacKenzie family believes Ernest's apology is genuine, and they bear no hard feelings toward the principal."
A white man tried to have his black neighbor killed. The 'hit man' he called was actually an FBI agent. - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-man-tried-to-have-black-neighbor-killed,"A South Carolina man has pled guilty to trying to hire a hitman to kill his black neighbor. Luckily for the neighbor, the hit man turned out to be an undercover FBI agent.
Here's what we know According to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina, 26-year-old Brandon Cory Lecroy reached out to a white supremacist organization in order to murder his black neighbor, who has not been identified. The FBI found out what Lecroy had planned and intercepted with an agent who posed as a hitman.
On March 28, 2018, Lecroy reportedly offered the undercover FBI $500 to make his neighbor ""a ghost."" He also asked the agent to put a ""flaming cross"" in his neighbor's front yard and requested that his neighbor be hung from a tree.
The entire conversation was recorded. According to the New York Times , Lecroy sent pictures of the man he wanted killed and a second unidentified potential target to the agent. He also wanted an untraceable 9-millimeter gun. It is not clear what he was going to use the gun for if he intended to have the FBI agent commit the murders.
In addition to his racist motivations, Lecroy also said that he hoped to take his neighbor's property.
After this, Lecroy met with the agent in person and talked about additional targets he wanted killed. He also gave the agent $100 in cash as a down payment for the first murder. As soon as the money changed hands, the FBI had all it needed to arrest him.
Lecroy was sentenced to 10 years in prison, with three additional years of court-ordered supervision. He pled guilty to one count of murder for hire."
