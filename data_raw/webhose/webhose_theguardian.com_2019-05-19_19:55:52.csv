'I want you to linger': how Janet Laurence's art compels you to save the earth | Art and design | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Stephanie Convery,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/20/i-want-you-to-linger-how-janet-laurences-art-compels-you-to-save-the-earth,"Three decades ago, the Australian artist was told her focus on nature was too feminine. Today, it’s a matter of urgency. J anet Laurence is wearing a living plant in a glass vial around her neck. The bright pop of green stands out against her flowing white dress. It’s as if she’s just stepped out of one of her own artworks – perhaps the one in which endangered rainforest plants are grown in beakers of laboratory glass, with lines of transparent tubing connecting the plants’ roots.
“All my life I’ve been very empathetic with other species,” she says. “I have incredibly vivid memories of always being very caring of things in nature, of plants and other animals.”

Meeting Laurence feels startlingly serendipitous. The Australian artist’s work has been exhibited in Paris, London, Berlin and is held by museums the world over. Her career spans more than three decades, yet the concerns at the centre of her art have never been more urgent – climate change, environmental destruction, humanity’s failure to adequately reassess its relationship with nature.
Laurence’s art feels like a project that’s more important than ever, especially for those of us who have desperately tried to make sense of the catastrophe we’re facing – extreme weather events becoming alarmingly more frequent, pollution infiltrating the deepest oceans and highest mountains , governmental failure to address any of it – and fretted about how to reconcile that with our daily lives.
But her work hasn’t always been well received.

“When I first started making art and wanting to work with nature, I was really criticised a lot for it,” she tells Guardian Australia. “In the feminist era I was told, you shouldn’t work with nature.” To do so would be to reiterate reductive ideas about women as nurturers – as opposed to men, who were, well, everything else. “It was very odd.”
After Nature, now showing at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art , is the first major survey of Laurence’s work. The title, a reference to the nature writer WG Sebald’s prose poem of the same name, evokes both the idea of a time post-nature, and an homage to it – threads that Laurence’s work deals with simultaneously. While she sees herself as part of the fight against the destruction of the natural world, she’s equally concerned with our ability to transcend the very concept – to do away with the artificial separation between humanity and the rest of the living earth.
The installation of endangered rainforest plants, Cellular Gardens (where breathing begins), forms part of the retrospective. In a room nearby is Deep Breathing: Resuscitation for the Reef: coral and fish skeletons are tagged, wrapped in brightly coloured thread, sewn into translucent pouches and held in glass vials inside stacked perspex boxes, while footage of the living – for now – Great Barrier Reef is projected onto the surrounding walls. It was Laurence’s – and Australia’s – contribution to the Artists 4 Paris Climate Exhibition that was held alongside the 2015 climate change conference.

In the Theatre of Trees, a new installation created for MCA, a flowing fabric structure of concentric rings, like the growth rings of a tree, fills the centre of the room. Walking through it in the dappled, moving light, you can hear birds, the breeze, leaves falling. Outside the tree in the corners of the room are three smaller installations: Knowledge, Wonder and Desire.
The first is a partly interactive reading room full of works that Laurence says have inspired her. (She cites the writing of Luce Irigaray, Deborah Bird Rose, Judith Wright as influences; she singles out Amitav Ghosh’s “beautifully explicit” book The Great Derangement in particular.) The second is a herbarium; the third an “elixir lab” in which audiences can book tasting sessions to sample liquid infusions of different Australian trees: ginger, a native mint, Davidson plum, lemon myrtle and pine pollen.
Laurence’s work is, before everything, very beautiful. The beauty of it is partly to entice an audience. “I am very aware in my practice of creating an attraction to enter a space,” she says. “I want you to linger.”

This aesthetic is tightly coupled with politics; hers is an activist practice. Yet her work feels less like a polemic than a way of angling the light to catch the filmy webs that connect, say, the breath of a sleeping tiger to human vulnerability; blood vessels to the seedling of an endangered plant; and things as disparate as a taxidermied owl, a fallen tree, test tubes and bandages.
If all this seems to border on the mystical, that’s not entirely an accident. In the 90s, Laurence’s work focused on alchemy and the transformation of matter; over the last decade, she has interrogated the potential of medicinal and psychotropic plants as a way to overturn archaic modes of understanding the world. We’re so accustomed to associating nature with the unknowable, the “other”; to thinking about civilisation and the natural world as two opposing concepts, rather than interconnecting parts of the same whole. That division, Laurence says, has been “culturally enforced and religiously enforced for so long, it’s the biggest obstacle we have”.
“We have to get back in touch with nature in order to care for it. We’ll all be lost if we don’t do that,” she says. “There’s an amazing groundswell of activity happening, of caring for the planet happening, but how can we deal with this enormous global capitalist force that’s still so powerful? And it’s almost incomprehensible how it’s still so powerful. So I do believe it’s going to take probably something almost disastrous to break that.”

It would be easy to give in to despair in the face of that, but Laurence says her resilience comes, in part, from her art. “Because I’m involved in what I think of as an activist practice and because by acting we get hope, I don’t feel overwhelmed by those forces myself,” she says. “But I know they’re there.”
There is an inspiring honesty about the blur between Laurence’s work and how she tries to live her life. During our conversation, she tells me that she gardens a piece of public land on Sydney Harbour. It now includes two enormous bay trees that began life in a hospital for native plants she created for the 2010 Sydney biennale, called Waiting: A Medicinal Garden for Ailing Plants, full of damaged or impaired seedlings and saplings covered in bandages and gauze. The plants that died were preserved and used as part of a subsequent artwork; those that survived, she planted.

“I want to bring you into an intimacy with nature. I feel the most important thing we have to do today on the planet is care for it and recognise our interconnection with it. And of course, what are we fighting against? We know the weight of our civilisation.”

'Breaking down the myths': blue-ribbon Liberal seats on unions' long target list | Australia news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Paul Karp,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/20/breaking-down-the-myths-blue-ribbon-liberal-seats-on-unions-long-target-list,"The Victorian Trades Hall Council is trying to capitalise on double-digit swings in eastern Melbourne seats at the state election. Deep within enemy terrain at the federal election, a pair of retired teachers are lending a hand to Victorian unions to door-knock gentrified suburbs and hand out campaign material at train stations.
The couple, Lesley Hardcastle and Rod Charles, have been deployed to the seat of Higgins, which was vacated by Liberal Kelly O’Dwyer, as part of an aggressive campaign by the Victorian Trades Hall Council to capitalise on double-digit swings in eastern Melbourne seats at the November state election.
“Lesley and I decided to go along to a meeting proposing that unions get involved in campaigns in traditional blue-ribbon Liberal seats,” Charles tells Guardian Australia.

“We thought this is exciting – it’s something that’s never been done before. We were impressed by the ambition.”
That’s how the pair find themselves walking the streets of suburbs such as Carnegie and Glen Iris, and talking to busy professionals about the Liberals cutting public schools funding and aged care.
Union hit list in Victoria and Queensland Before Scott Morrison became Liberal leader the union battle plan was mainly to target Queensland marginals but since the switch of prime ministers there is a greater focus on Victoria .
While Liberal MPs think the party’s brand has recovered to an extent in Australia’s most progressive state, the list of Trades Hall target seats shows unions’ ambition to expand the electoral map.

Kooyong (Liberal held by 12.8%), Higgins (10.1%), Flinders (7%) and even Menzies (7.8%) and Deakin (6.4%) are targets alongside the more low-hanging fruit of Chisholm (2.9%) and La Trobe (3.2%).
When the polls close and votes are counted from 18 May that list will either represent an important electoral buffer for Bill Shorten or an embarrassing overreach in a tight campaign.
The largest union push is the Australian Council of Trade Union’s Change the Rules campaign, urging voters to change the government in order to rewrite industrial relations laws to fight insecure work and low wage growth.
That campaign is being deployed a little bit further down the electoral pendulum at marginal seats in Queensland (Forde, Capricornia, Flynn, Petrie, Leichhardt and Herbert), Western Australia (Swan, Pearce), New South Wales (Banks, Gilmore, Reid and Robertson), Victoria (Dunkley and Corangamite), Boothby in South Australia, and a bit of defence in Labor-held Bass in Tasmania.
The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, says that unions “maintained all of our targets that were planned under [Malcolm] Turnbull and added to them under [Scott] Morrison”. They added five extra target seats in Victoria, one in Western Australia and one in South Australia.
In all, there are 16 ACTU target seats and a total of 28 targeted by unions, including peak bodies in each state and ACTU affiliates.
Cashed-up ACTU campaign The most high-profile affiliates’ campaigns are the Australian Education Union’s Fair Funding Now, the United Voice campaign around weekend penalty rates, and the nurses’ campaign for aged care staff-to-patient ratios. The Construction Forestry Maritime Mining Energy Union has also raised millions but is bolstering the ACTU campaign rather than drawing attention to itself.
The ACTU is cashed up after changes made in 2015, when it added a permanent $2 annual campaign levy on the cost of affiliation for its member unions, which represent 1.8m Australians.

Raising revenue from a total affiliation fee of more than $6 per union member per year, the ACTU spent a total of $13m on its 2016 Build a Better Future campaign and the 2019 Change the Rules campaign will top this effort.
We have plenty of surprises left before election day
ACTU's Sally McManus After helping to kick out the Howard government in 2007 with the Your Rights at Work campaign, Australian unions say they have learned their lesson not to pack up the tent and go home after a win.
Before the 2016 campaign the then ACTU secretary, Dave Oliver, promised it would build a “permanent campaigning capacity”, with organisers employed in marginal seats throughout the term of the 45th parliament.
As a result, the ACTU says it is embedded in the communities of the 16 target seats it has chosen for the 2019 campaign.
Secular lobby advocates equality as religious leaders weigh in on election Read more
“Campaigns that truly come from the ground up take time to put in place, and the work that our organisers have been doing since before the last election is showing through now with the massive amount of community participation that we are seeing in our campaign,” McManus says.
“You can’t parachute in at the last minute and expect a community to get onside – we’ve been working with community leaders to bring their concerns to the national stage for years.”
McManus points to half a million Australians mobilised for street protests against low wages and insecure work in three nationwide actions in the last 18 months and high turnout at launches in 26 seats.
“We have plenty of surprises left before election day,” she says.
The art of persuasion: from the union base to undecideds While the rallies make for good TV, the bread and butter of the campaign is phone banking, particularly to persuade undecided union members; door-knocking and television, print, digital and radio ads, which tend to reach more non-union voters.
Mark Morey, the secretary of Unions NSW, which is campaigning in Robertson and Reid, says the strength of unions using their own lists for campaigning is voters hearing directly from people like them.
“If someone you don’t know rings you it’s not as powerful – that’s the strength of the persuasion calls – someone from your union ringing you.”
Morey says the unions also want a strong Senate campaign, so Labor promises such as getting rid of union-specific regulators the Australian Building and Construction Commission and Registered Organisation Commission are not blocked.
“The main thing is to get people to commit to vote the current government out,” he says. “But we also want to remind members that some parties such as One Nation have a voting record that has been with the government and very anti-worker.”
Correna Haythorpe, the federal president of the Australian Education Union, says its Fair Funding Now campaign is targeted at parents and communities of public schools, who it reaches through community forums, advertisements and “conversations outside of schools”.
“One thing we’re doing very clearly is emphasising school by school comparisons to show the extra funding commitments [of progressive parties],” she says.
“People get the unfairness angle. If you watch our ads one of the things we’re talking about is prime minister Scott Morrison’s concept of a fair go – we’ve got a whole heap of students not getting a fair go on schools funding.”
From Labor’s perspective the union campaigns are helping their cause. Although they are not coordinated, they have a shared purpose to elect progressives and the sense is in this campaign there is less competition for activists.
The Greens have attempted to one-up Labor by signing up to Change the Rules in full and promising to outspend Labor on education.
But the Labor offering to restore penalty rates , regulate labour hire, change the rules for setting the minimum wage , pay equity for women , abolish union-specific regulators and to give $14bn more to public schools lines up nicely with the campaigns run by the ACTU and affiliates.

Lesley Hardcastle says when she’s talking to voters they start “suspicious” that volunteers are telling them how to vote but focusing on the issues helps get a foot in the door.
“We say you can vote any way you like but please put the Liberals last because of their policies … Don’t reward them for years of cuts and inaction.”
Rod Charles says persuasion can be hard because volunteers strike not anger but disillusionment. “Their attitude is ‘what’s the point, you can’t trust them, they get elected and don’t abide by promises’.”
But people are “generally sympathetic to principles like fairness and equality of opportunity”, he says. Volunteers ask voters to sign a pledge to vote on a particular issue, then will get a follow-up call before election day.
The conservative side of politics has long fretted about the Labor and union ground game , which is one of the reasons they’ve been in search of a “conservative GetUp” to do grassroots campaigning.
On Tuesday Morrison was asked what he made of the union campaigns, and he said they, Labor and GetUp are “out doing their normal thing”.
“They’ll be looking to tell lies about the government,” he said. “They’ll be looking to try and hoodwink people, like they did at the last election – particularly making threats around Medicare.
“They’ll be ringing up pensioners in the night, as they were last time.”
Lesley Hardcastle says the reason she signed up to the union campaign is precisely because she wanted to “break down the myths and stereotypes of union members”.
“When people see someone who looks like I do – an elderly, middle class lady – then hopefully they will think ‘well, if she believes in unions maybe I don’t understand what a union is about’.”
That is the basis of the union push: to get the voter to identify the issues that affect their lives – low pay, insecure work, aged care quality, or schools funding – with the progressive moment.
Whether it’s a call from a member of the same union or a knock from a neighbour, the strategy is to start with the base and build towards an electoral majority by using the voices of people like themselves.

Marcus Hutchins: UK ransomware ‘hero’ pleads guilty to US hacking charges | Technology | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,msn.com,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/20/marcus-hutchins-uk-ransomware-hero-pleads-guilty-to-us-hacking-charges,"Hutchins says he regrets his actions and will continue ‘keeping people safe from malware attacks’. A British computer security researcher once hailed as a “hero” for helping stem a ransomware outbreak and later accused of creating malware to attack the banking system said on Friday he had pleaded guilty to US criminal charges.
Marcus Hutchins, whose arrest in 2017 stunned the computer security community , acknowledged in a statement pleading guilty to criminal charges linked to his activity in 2014 and 2015.
“I regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes,” the 24-year-old Hutchins, known by his alias MalwareTech, wrote, noting that the charges related to his activity prior to his work in security.
“Having grown up, I’ve since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes. I will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks.”

Hutchins in 2017 found a “kill switch” to stem the spread of the devastating WannaCry ransomware outbreak, prompting widespread news reports calling him a hero.
Months later he was arrested after attending the Def Con gathering of computer hackers in Las Vegas.
The case drew fire from critics who argued that researchers often work with computer code that can be deployed for malicious purposes.
A federal indictment unsealed in Wisconsin accused Hutchins and another individual of making and distributing the Kronos “banking Trojan”, a reference to malicious software designed to steal user names and passwords used on online banking sites.
According to the indictment, Hutchins was part of a conspiracy to distribute the hacking tool on so-called dark markets.
He was released on bail while awaiting trial, allowing him to continue working for a security firm. He had maintained his innocence and won support from many others in his profession.
US prosecutors did not immediately respond to aquery about the case. But court documents published by the news site ZDNet showed Hutchins could face up to one year in jail on each of the criminal counts along with financial penalties.
Other counts in the indictment were dismissed, according to the court papers.

Things seem to be on the up at the moment, and great for them, so naturally they don't want to go into decline, but you could make that comparison with many teams, and Arsenal's isn't even that bad - one year out of the top for and several FA cups in the ten years following isn't really terrible. It also ignores the fact that Abramovich had arrived at Chelsea while Highbury was being built and changed everything regarding how the money worked in football, something they couldn't have seen coming and were suddenly left without the many, many millions that were needed to buy the top players. Admittedly Levy is notoriously careful with his money, but even so, they have been able to plan for their stadium with a clear understanding of the way the playing field looks. There are circumstantial similarities - pointed out in the piece - as can be expected between two clubs at that level, but it's just not a good narrative comparison in the way that Ronay is trying to portray."

Lol compare that to Kalank directed by Kjo who is a very experienced director yet he created a dud despite having multi star well known stars plus unlimited budget. Kangana had not much to work with but created a masterpiece!
She was flawless onscreen and her action scenes were best I have ever seen !! She shot the war scenes to perfection which can be really be difficult even for a highly experienced director!! Itâs a shame that the writer of this article HAD to drag Manikarnika down to look good for Kjo !!
Kangana was right when she said look at the movies I make and what kind Kjo does!!! Lol
Kjo will have to wear the Kalank teeka on his forehead for the rest of his life.

First would be some kind of carbon credit scheme. You could bring in air miles first, everyone gets an allocation for free, if you need more you either be them from friends and family or buy them from others who don't need them and can trade them on a market. Price will be dictated by the market. You could then move that into transport, every 10 litres of petrol/diesel reduces your credit account the same way, then much less for public transport. This would require some investment in public transport but there are some obvious solutions there too. Finally gas and electric, a basic needs allocation for each person and top ups at market rate. Same with water, get what you need for basic needs, pay through the nose if you have a pool or constantly wash your car. Probably not going to go down well in the Tory shires but it would be a quick way of addressing inequality and rewarding those (usually the poorer end of society) who have the least polluting lifestyle simply by dint of buying less stuff and not going on foreign holidays. The technology is basic - similar to credit cards so wouldn't be a massively difficult project to roll out. I know its been tried with limited success at corporate level but personal accounts make more sense. Any ajor flaws I've missed here?"

Hi all,
I thought I’d share a prediction competition we’ve been doing offline over the last week or so.
If you want to join in, just cut & paste the list below and type alive or dead next to the character – i.e. whether you think they will make it to the end of series 8.
The Night King and Viserion are still included despite already being part of the army of the dead. So in their cases its more a question of whether they’ll be killed in their current form or not.
Happy predicting!! :-)

Yes, Tottenham would be mad to undervalue Levy, but they don't, so I'm not sure where your thesis would be going, even if it were well researched and written. Furthermore, Arsenal aren't really doing too badly lately either, so Tottenham might actually be well advised to continue to try to emulate Arsenal.

Perhaps it's an age thing? Post-premiership supporters often seem to consider only Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool to be big clubs, along with Chels and Manchester City as jumped up Johnny-come- latelies. One of these was giving me a hard time on here the other day for suggesting that Newcastle were a ´big´ club on the basis that they hadn't won any trophies since the 1950's."

There's a third string, which is the one the government is plucking furiously right now, and that is more or less to accept that climate change is real, but say that the costs of addressing it are unaffordable. None of these three positions represent reality, but they sap the energy out of society and hamper the positivity that comes from combining a real acceptance of the damage being done with hope and a genuine willingness to make changes to improve things."

I have spent the last week reading and re-reading Catherine Ingrams essay ""Facing Extinction"". http://www.catherineingram.com/facingextinction/ . and ""Deep Adaptation; A Map for negotiating climate tragedy"" by Prof. Jem Bendell. https://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf
I agree with everything you have written but our government is doing pretty much what most Governments are doing and that is nowhere near enough. Meanwhile oil majors are vying for drilling rights in the Arctic, and buying each other up, and also buying renewable companies to gradually take over that industry.
The mainstream media is also complicit with climate denial getting about 50% of the newsfeed in most countries.
There is a very interesting suggestion in the papers linked above called the filter theory. Scientist suggest that there are many solar systems where similar conditions to our planet would have existed and similar life would have existed. But they would have suffered a similar ending as we seem to be on trajectory for, due to their development also causing runaway climate change.
Food for thought, as there may not be much food for eating for much longer."

It was incredible, it was exhilarating, it was the ultimate kaleidoscope of emotions... but it went to script. Right up until a final, bewildering twist.
Come on! This was Tottenham. Tottenham, who lost a CL place to their bitter rivals because of a dodgy lasagna. Tottenham, who managed to finish 4th in a three-horse race, then lose their cherished CL spot because of the most unlikely, plain fluky European Cup triumph there's ever been... by their second most hated rivals. Tottenham, who reached a new level of consistency under AVB, only to finish 5th. Tottenham, who having led Arsenal all season long, somehow contrived to lose 5-1 at already relegated Newcastle and clutch 3rd from the jaws of 2nd.
Tottenham could play bravely, gloriously... but you knew how it'd ultimately turn out. And deep down, there'll have been thousands of Spurs fans who knew this all too well. Meaning Sterling's apparent winner was both the most monumental, devastating kick in the guts... but something so many will have expected all along. Cue goodness only knows how many TV sets being turned off in despair all over the world; cue, quite likely, the end of this squad, maybe even the end of Poch's time there. Except...
... It was disallowed! What a twist. This sort of thing just does not happen to Spurs. It just doesn't. For the first time I can ever recall, they were on the right side of the bounce of the ball; the right end of key decisions; Lady Luck actually smiled at them for once. At Tottenham! So my question is: much as Spain finally got that never-ending quarter-final boulder off their shoulders at Euro 2008, and cantered joyfully into an incredibly successful new era, will Spurs now throw off the burden of history, and make the most of this opportunity?
When sporting teams end long, excruciating droughts, there's something truly magical about it. Hearts in 1998. Hibs in 2016. The Boston Red Sox in 2004. The Chicago Cubs in 2016. Inter in 2010. Liverpool this year... or maybe not. That is how Tottenham Hotspur could truly redefine themselves. If, somehow, they pulled it off, all those players and their fantastic manager would be legends. Immortal, as far as their long-suffering fans are concerned. And of course, if it happened, it'd be something they'd have over Arsenal forever and ever and ever.
Will it happen? They've barely got 11 fit players to choose from, and this is the business end of the world's highest quality sporting event. So logic says it can't possibly. But sport often isn't about logic. It's also about passion, desire, will, spirit, luck, dragging yourselves inch by inch towards what you believe is your destiny. Over the next few weeks, Spurs - snakebitten Spurs, the club you can always rely on to mess it all up when it most matters - could, just maybe, make destiny beckon."

Adele and her husband Simon Konecki have separated.
The pop singer’s representatives Benny Tarantini and Carl Fysh confirmed the news on Friday in a statement.

“Adele and her partner have separated,” the emailed statement said. “They are committed to raising their son together lovingly. As always they ask for privacy. There will be no further comment.”
Adele gave birth to her son, Angelo, in 2012.
The award-winning British superstar has been private about her relationship, but confirmed she married Konecki when she won album of the year at the 2017 Grammys.
In her acceptance speech, she said: “Grammys, I appreciate it. The Academy, I love you. My manager, my husband and my son you’re the only reason I do it.”

London-born Adele released her debut album, 19, in 2008 , which contained the songs Chasing Pavements and Hometown Glory and reached No 1 in the UK.
Her eagerly anticipated follow-up, 2011’s 21, brought even more success thanks to the singles Someone Like You, Rolling In The Deep and Rumour Has It.
The record topped the charts in 30 countries, including the US and UK, and cemented Adele’s status as one of the world’s most successful artists.
She released her most recent album, 25, in 2015 , which contained the single Hello. It proved to be another critical and commercial success.
In March, Adele was pictured entering a recording studio in New York City, sparking rumours she was working on new music.
Konecki cofounded Life Water, an eco-friendly brand of bottled water in the UK. Funds from the company assists the charity that Konecki runs, Drop4Drop, which provides clean water to countries in need.
A representative for Konecki could not be reached.

Why? Because those papers are pro LNP, pro denialist election material. We HAVE to curb the influence of Murdoch.
Also, religious groups. Evangelicals are denialists and they preach it from their pulpits (sorry their stage for demented muzak). They are supporters of Trump in the US, and they are preaching to their flock in Australia saying Morrison must be re-elected. These churches are despicable and are an affront to thinking people. They need to be deregistered as churches, because they are political players, and of course they prey on young people for money.
Not only the fringe churches like Hillsong and Morrison's Pentecostal cult, but Catholics as well. Google George Pell's speech to The Heartland Institute. The mentor for former PM and climate denier Abbott was given a platform from an astroturf lobby group founded by rich vested interests such as the Koch brothers.

He should NOT be allowed a platform. This is tolerance gone crazy.

Mankind is so locked in to the ideologies of religion and capitalism that we are hamstrung and unable to act as if we were sane and conscious. We have to act, we have to break the stranglehold of orthodoxy that is preventing action.
We need to:
Diversify the media landscape, so we can have reporting on the science.
Get rid of the insidious influence of religion in educating our children. Religion in churches, not in schools.
But those things take time. Right now we have to vote out this LNP failure of a government. We need to give Labor a chance when they hold power, and stop the lie that they are just as bad as the LNP. They are not. Australia under the LNP actually lobbied for lower targets at international gatherings. This is a disgrace.

The Murray Darling is a disaster waiting to happen with the wrong choice of crops; cotton and rice are not crops for the Australian context. Absurd to go against Nature!
Apply the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act, the Murray Darling Basin is endangered under the Act."

They never asked that question of Frydenberg and Turnbull when they introduced the NEG which Labor is now adopting. In fact they don't get it at all and never bother with asking Morrison for the costs of doing nothing, Not only do we have the Liberals, the Nationals, One Nation to blame for sabotaging action on climate change, but many in the media as well. We should never forget the role of the media in this. They are as culpable in promoting the Morrison line."

Thanks.
Unfortunately, despite giving lipservice to environmental treaties, Australia has devolved its obligations to industry & its fascist agenda to control & exploit all natural resources & the workforce.
This abrogation of the public trust is an inherent risk within a political institution that permits the corruption of the public interest by industry lobbyists & revolving door benefits for public servants acquiescent to their requirements.
Unfortunately this corruption is accepted globally, from within all international intergovernmental bodies & subsidiaries, affecting the basic sovereignty of all nations.
Having participated in efforts to regulate some if the worst offenders of environmental degradation of planetary systems & experienced the blatant skullduggery & thuggery of these institutions I don’t believe it is possible for them to change from within, as they’re not at “the point of criminal negligence.” - they are absolutely criminally negligent; to the point of actually being wilful participants in crimes against humanity.
Their acquiescence to the industrial destruction of planetary earth systems - oceans, all biota, terrestrial ecosystems are all proof of their guilt.
The mirrored international nation state paramilitary enhancement of laws against private citizen protest & surveillance are proof of their extant angst, which likely exceeds that of those if us intent on changing this criminal destruction of life on Earth."
