Trump administration questions why a single judge can block policies nationwide - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,"Ben Geldon, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/politics/inside-politics-forecast-may-26-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast.
1. Border wall loses another round in court A federal judge in California is blocking President Donald Trump's plan to use Pentagon funds to build his border wall. New York Times reporter Michael Shear says it's the 38th time a federal court has blocked one of Trump's policies. Shear said what's particularly galling to the President is that a single district court judge has the power to block his plans everywhere, through a nationwide injunction. ""Attorney General Bill Barr complained about it last week, saying that this practice is a violation of Constitutional principles,"" Shear said. ""So the Trump Administration will be going to the Supreme Court to ask the justices to stop this practice. Legal scholars say that's highly unlikely, but there's more than a little bit of irony here -- during eight years of Barack Obama's administration, a favorite tool of Republicans was, you guessed it, going to federal judges asking them to block policies they didn't like."" Read More 2. Democrats gear up for election-year fight over abortion Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws last week, barring the procedure beyond the eighth week of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest. Missouri joins a growing list of red states seeking to all but ban the vast majority of abortions. Time's Molly Ball says Democrats want to make the future of Roe v. Wade a signature 2020 issue. ""Thousands of women and others all over the country came out to protest these laws, and you have all of the 2020 Democratic candidates coming out against them,"" Ball said. ""Even some Republicans say some of these laws go too far. So this is an issue that's going to continue to simmer. You can expect it to still be going on when we get to next year, and you'll hear the candidates talking about this a lot."" 3. Saudi weapons sales fight President Trump said on Friday he's bypassing Congress to sell more than $8 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia -- an announcement that drew condemnation from lawmakers in both parties who want to punish the Saudis for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and other human rights abuses. ""This is something Congress had been blocking for months, and now they have gone around Congress to complete the sales,"" CNN's Phil Mattingly said, and that's something lawmakers never like. ""Saudi Arabia's support on Capitol Hill has really wilted over the course of the last 10 or 11 months, and that is bipartisan,"" Mattingly said. ""You're going to see lawmakers consider a number of ways to try and stop this from happening in the future."" 4. Congress & Iran And that's not the only foreign policy flashpoint on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are also concerned about the President's plan for Iran -- last week he approved sending an additional 1,500 troops to the region. ""You've seen steps be taken in the last week where the administration finally came down to Capitol Hill to explain the escalation and the movement of a combat strike group and everything else that's been going on in the Persian Gulf,"" Washington Post reporter Karoun Demirjian said. One question, Demirjian said, is whether some lawmakers will push for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force -- known as an AUMF -- rather than relying on the one passed soon after 9/11 that's been used as the legal justification for military action in the region ever since. 5. Recession worries in 2020 And from CNN Chief National Correspondent John King: This weekend's presidential trip to Japan is more style than substance . The next one will be far more important -- for the global economy and for Trump's reelection hopes. The Dow was down last week, and it was the fifth losing week in a row. That hasn't happened since 2011. Trade tensions are the biggest factor, and specifically trade tensions with China. It is easy to find analysts who say the market selloff would be even worse were it not for the anticipation that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will strike a deal -- or at least the outlines of an agreement -- when they meet next month at the annual G-20 summit in Osaka. But there are also a growing number of market watchers, or US-China relations experts, who look back at the last week and see steps by both countries that suggest longer-term nationalist instincts are trumping shorter-term economic concerns. Here in the states, the Trump administration's new restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei complicate any effort to resolve major trade differences. And those watching President Xi this past week as he traveled and focused on economic issues at home also see a leader digging in for a longer-term showdown. ""Huawei is very iconic to the Chinese, kind of like Apple to us, so putting them on the entity list is a real slap in the face and threatens to take the trade war from economics to war over nationalistic pride,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""It makes it very difficult to stand down."" Trump says standing up to China's unfair trade and other economic policies is long overdue, and he continually voices the belief that the American economy is strong enough to absorb the pain of a trade war. But he also wants that humming economy as his re-election calling card, and a prolonged trade war could put that at risk. Zandi pegs the odds of 2020 recession at 30 percent if nothing changes in the current economic climate. And Zandi says, in his view, the odds of a pre-election recession jump to 50 percent or more if the US-China feud escalates and additional tariffs are added."

""A clutch player who led his team to five NFL titles, Bart could still fill Lambeau Field with electricity decades later during his many visits. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cherry and the entire Starr family."""
"Rolling Thunder ride to make final trip to DC this weekend, Trump says it'll return - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Devan Cole,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/politics/rolling-thunder-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) As hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists arrive in the nation's capital Sunday to participate in the final Rolling Thunder , where they pay tribute to service members killed in action or taken as prisoners of war, President Donald Trump says the event will continue next year -- even as the group's president says the annual event is set to end.
""The Great Patriots of Rolling Thunder WILL be coming back to Washington, D.C. next year, & hopefully for many years to come. It is where they want to be, & where they should be. Have a wonderful time today. Thank you to our great men & women of the Pentagon for working it out!"" Trump tweeted Sunday morning.

Have a wonderful time today. Thank you to our great men & women of the Pentagon for working it out!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019 Rolling Thunder President Joe Bean told CNN later Sunday that as of right now, the group was still planning to have this year's ride be their last in Washington. ""This is our final ride in Washington, DC. Until we can get into the White House and talk to President Trump and see what he can do for us -- this is our final ride in Washington,"" Bean said, after being read Trump's tweet by CNN's Kirsten Holmes. In December, the group said it would be hosting its last event in Washington during Memorial Day weekend in 2019. Organizers said the costs of putting on the national ride have become prohibitive, with last year's event costing about $200,000 in various related expenses. Read More The event, which was first held in Washington in 1988, involves bikers embarking on a ride that starts at the Pentagon parking lot, continues over a bridge into DC, and then circles the National Mall before ending by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The President, who spoke at the gathering in 2016 during his campaign , bemoaned the end of the event in a tweet on Saturday, writing: ""Can't believe that Rolling Thunder would be given a hard time with permits in Washington, D.C. They are great Patriots who I have gotten to know and see in action. They love our Country and love our Flag. If I can help, I will!"" The Pentagon, which works with Rolling Thunder to to help plan the event, said last week that the group ""pays only a portion"" of the costs associated with reserving space outside the building. ""All outside events pay fees to use the Pentagon Reservation. The fee includes costs for overtime for security and reimbursement for clean up after an event. Rolling Thunder, Inc. pays only a portion of the total costs incurred by the Pentagon to support the event,"" Sue Gough, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense, said in a statement to CNN. ""We are proud of our history of providing a safe operating area for events on the Pentagon Reservation, to include Rolling Thunder every year,"" Gough said. ""The Pentagon civilian workforce, including PFPA, have a large veteran presence, and we especially appreciate the opportunity to support events that honor those who've served and sacrificed."" Instead of the gathering in the nation's capital, there will now be regional events organized by various chapters to honor those killed in action or who were prisoners of war, according to the group's organizers."

Venezuela's gas shortages create days-long lines,us.cnn.com,Stefano Pozzebon,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/americas/gas-shortages-venezuela-intl/index.html,"(CNN) For many Venezuelans, oil is a birthright in the country blessed with the largest crude reserves in the world. Despite wild hyperinflation, Venezuela's government has never increased the price of gasoline. Today, amid a crushing economic crisis, filling up a tank in Venezuela is still basically free -- but only if you can afford to wait for days in line.
Over the last two weeks, people from several states in Venezuela have described severe gas shortages. It's not the first time that the country has suffered gas shortages, but previous crises were blamed on bad distribution and logistical inefficiency. This time, as citizens find themselves queuing for days at the gas stations, many are starting to fear there simply is not enough oil for all. Caracas is still fueled by a steady supply, which critics of the embattled President Nicolas Maduro describe as politically motivated favoritism: Keeping the capital well supplied helps prevent further anti-government protests, after months of violent unrest. But in the western city of San Cristobal del Tachira, Lorena Amaya, 42, spent three days sleeping in her car with her sister, as they waited in line to fill the tank with gas. The two sisters parked their vehicles one in front of the other and placed a mattress in the first one to create a bed. ""Today, it's my son's birthday, and look where am I,"" she told CNN. She only briefly left the gas queue to visit her 10-year-old son that morning, while her sister held the spot. Read More ""I ask the neighbor to keep an eye for him while I am here, but he's home by himself,"" she said. Her sister Ymara, 40, describes the fuel as ""the most expensive gasoline we ever bought"" because of the three days of lost work and life that she has spent waiting in line. How this happened In 1989, large riots hit Caracas after the government of then-president Carlos Andres Perez announced the end of a gasoline subsidy which had maintained the prices well beneath market level. Since then, increasing the price of oil has become taboo for Venezuelan politicians. Thirty years later, and after five years of deep economic crisis under Maduro, oil is still cheap, but production has dropped to levels unseen since the 1940s. In April 2019, Venezuela only produced 830,000 barrels per day, down from 1.2 million at the beginning of the year, according to new data from the United States' Energy Information Administration. State oil company PDVSA is struggling to keep production afloat. Most of its machinery is obsolete and its production facilities under-resourced. Since March, waves of blackouts have only made the situation worse. PDVSA does not publish production figures, so it is impossible to know exactly how much oil the country actually produces. However, shipments from key international allies such as Russia have increased this year, suggesting that the oil company is supplementing its dwindling production with foreign supply. Maduro's government has blamed the production crisis on corruption by former managers and the increasingly painful sanctions from the United States. Since the US sanctioned PDVSA in January 2019, the company has been unable to plug into the international oil market, where it buys ingredients needed to refine its thick, heavy crude into gasoline. Venezuela's Ombusdman, Alfredo Ruiz Angulo, has said that he intends to denounce US sanctions as human rights violations , saying ""All these unilateral coercive measures led by the United States are causing real trouble for the health of Venezuelans."" For the opposition, however, the shortages are proof of Maduro's inability to run the country sustainably. On social media, the hashtag campaign #VenezuelaSinGasolina has attacked the government for failing to maintain the country's most prized industry. ""The solution to get out of this mess is for Maduro to go,"" said Miguel Pizarro, a leading opposition congressman in a statement to CNN. The shortages are also compounding Venezuela's already dire food insecurity. Venezuela doesn't have a rail system, and most of its largest cities are far away from the coast; without petrol, food supplies cannot be moved from city to city. On May 20, the country's Federation of Cattle Ranchers issued a public plea for fuel to the government, citing their difficulty in moving the cattle across the country."
"Sophie Toscan du Plantier trial: More than two decades after a woman was killed in an Irish village, French prosecutors hope to close the case",us.cnn.com,"Kara Fox and Antoine Crouin, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/sophie-toscan-du-plantier-trial-ian-bailey-france-intl/index.html,"Schull, Ireland (CNN) Perched on a bench in the quiet courtyard of a pub, Ian Bailey is signing a copy of his self-published book of poetry for a young American woman. He then opens a folded paper printout of his latest work.
It best describes his current state of mind, he says. The poem, ""I'm feeling like John Wayne"" describes a man aggrieved. The prose is pained and indignant -- a mood that's worlds away from the roar of laughter that flows from inside the packed pub. Schull, a picturesque fishing village nestled along the craggy coastline of Ireland's southernmost peninsula, sees a very short tourist season. But today, the rural community of 700 people is enjoying the atmosphere as hundreds flood the streets for its annual international film festival. The area of West Cork however, is no stranger to foreigners. It's long served as an outpost for artists from across the globe seeking solace and space, with its holiday homes and winding roads well traversed by wealthy travelers looking to disconnect from the daily grind. Read More Bailey is one of those ""blow-ins,"" a local term to describe a person not born in the locality. The Manchester, UK-born former journalist moved to the area in 1991 with a plan to focus on his writing and poetry, enticed by the lure of the area. So had Sophie Toscan du Plantier, a 39-year-old French television producer who found refuge from her busy Parisian life at her isolated farmhouse on the northern side of the Mizen peninsula, a 25-minute drive from Schull. It was an area where people would leave their keys in the doors in case a visitor got stuck in the rain but there was no one at home to receive them; a place where children were safe to run errands on their own because everyone knew who ""belonged to who,"" according to a dozen locals that CNN spoke with. But all that changed on December 23, 1996, when Toscan du Plantier was found bludgeoned to death near the gate of her holiday home with some 50 wounds found on her slight frame. Sophie Toscan du Plantier is seen in this undated handout photo. Days after her murder, local police began questioning Bailey, who lived nearby and had been tasked with reporting on the murder for a national paper. He was arrested twice: first in February 1997 alongside his partner Jules Thomas and then again in January 1998. No forensic evidence linked Bailey -- or Thomas -- to the scene of the crime, and they were released without charge. Both have denied any involvement in Toscan du Plantier's death. Bailey's actions throughout the ordeal however, created a cloud of suspicion, according to many locals, one that has continued to follow him around West Cork in the two decades since. Weeks after the murder, Bailey's editor at the now defunct Sunday Tribune told police that he told her that he killed Toscan du Plantier to resurrect his career. According to police documents Bailey admitted it but said it was a joke. A 44-page file from the Irish Office of the Director of the Public Prosecution also reveals other alleged informal admissions by Bailey, but also notes that some of those statements were unreliable and that Bailey has always held a public position of innocence. In the years following his arrests, Bailey alleged he was wrongfully arrested and a victim of police corruption. In 2015, Bailey lost a civil action in the High Court on those claims. A subsequent review by the Irish policing watchdog found problems in the way that Bailey's arrest was handled, but concluded in 2018 that there was no evidence of police corruption. No one else has been charged for Toscan du Plantier's death as the years have passed. A memorial marks the spot where Sophie Toscan du Plantier was killed outside her holiday home in County Cork, Ireland. 'Don't be surprised if you get arrested' In Goleen, a tiny village between Toscan du Plantier's farmhouse and Schull, one woman who asked not to be identified out of concern of potentially being recognized in the small town community, said that after two decades of thinking about it, she still wasn't sure how she felt -- other than uneasy. ""If he didn't do it, his life has been a nightmare for 20-odd years,"" she said. ""But if he did do it, he's gotten away with murder."" Pete Beleski, a former neighbor and friend of Bailey's told CNN that Bailey often loved being the center of attention, saying that ""there's a sort of a notoriety he possible enjoys to a degree."" Beleski added that Bailey shouldn't have been surprised that he was arrested, saying that he knew of a number of occasions in which Bailey had professed -- whether serious or not -- to having done the crime. Beleski's relationship with Bailey was crafted around their mutual love for traditional music. Beleski said it came to an abrupt halt after he bore witness to the aftermath of a brutal domestic violence incident. Six months before Toscan du Plantier's death, Beleski said that he drove Thomas, Bailey's partner, to the hospital after Bailey violently assaulted her. The assault Beleski detailed to CNN is one Bailey has publicly admitted to in court proceedings, saying that the domestic violence he had committed against her was to ""my eternal shame ,"" and one that Beleski recounted as a witness. Beleski says that he hasn't come to any conclusion about Bailey's alleged involvement in Toscan du Plantier's death. ""If we can't prove it, how can anyone else?"" Beleski asked. Ian Bailey, and his solicitor, Frank Buttimer, leave Dublin High Court after he won the right to appeal his extradition order to France. But the French feel differently. Under France's Napoleonic law, authorities can investigate crimes against French citizens committed outside of its French borders, although they cannot insist that witnesses travel for questioning. In 2010, France first tried to bring Bailey before a French court by issuing a European arrest warrant. An Irish High Court ordered that Bailey surrender to France, but Bailey won the right to stay on appeal in 2012, a decision again upheld by the Supreme Court in 2017 . Now, the French prosecution is going a step further. On Monday, Bailey will be tried for murder in absentia in Paris. Toscan du Plantier's family has long pushed for Bailey to be brought to trial in France. A judiciary source at the French public prosecutor's office told CNN that they are basing their case on the testimony of 30 Quote: d witnesses, five Quote: d experts and information from a French fact-finding mission. The source would not confirm if any witnesses would be attending in person. Beleski, who had provided testimony to Irish police, said that he had not been contacted by the French authorities, nor had other former witnesses that he has recently spoken to. 'An exceptional case' While trials in absentia are not unusual in France, the Bailey case is quite rare, according to legal expert and criminal defense attorney Stephane Babonneau, who is not affiliated with the case. ""It is an exceptional case to have two countries, two justices, two laws, who have (come to) such a different conclusion,"" Babonneau told CNN, noting that cases like this happen only once in every four or five years. Bailey's Irish solicitor, Frank Buttimer, and his French lawyer, Dominique Tricaud, said they will not being attending the trial, which Buttimer characterized as a ""paper exercise."" Speaking to CNN, Buttimer said that the French system has ""no respect"" for the Irish judiciary, who has twice dropped charges against Bailey. He believes the French prosecution has already made a decision and a ruling will be made in the time it takes for the ""rubber stamp to hit the page."" The judiciary source at the French public prosecutor's office said, ""It isn't a show trial, it is a trial that needs to happen because it is part of French law."" ""Justice does not stop in France,"" he added. The strategy on the part of the local Irish police to have Bailey ostracized was a device used back in 1996 and 1997, when they targeted him as the killer, Buttimer said. Part of the ostracizing process was to make people afraid of him, fearful that he might commit the same type of offense so they might say things that might be beneficially to the prosecution, he added. But that line failed, Buttimer said, noting that the director of public prosecution at the time described evidence gathered by Irish police as ""thoroughly flawed and prejudiced."" ""That's 22 years ago. Yet the French are coming around now using the exact same evidence -- nothing new, nothing different,"" Buttimer said. If Bailey is found guilty, France will once again demand his extradition, according to a judicial source at the Paris prosecutor's office. The Church of Our Lady, Star of the Sea, and St. Patrick in Goleen, where Pierre Louis Baudey Vignaud, appealed to local witnesses to travel to Paris to testify at the trial. Toscan du Plantier's son, Pierre Louis Baudey Vignaud, who was 15 at the time of his mother's killing, told CNN that he ""cannot imagine Ireland not moving if there is a condemnation is France."" ""Little by little, the noose is tightening. The French justice will be an important guide,"" he added. Last week, Vignaud attended a memorial mass in Goleen, where he urged local witnesses to travel to Paris to testify at the upcoming trial. A woman from Goleen who asked to remain anonymous, said while she understood Vignaud's pain, the ""pulpit is not a place for this,"" a sentiment expressed by a handful of other locals CNN spoke to in Schull. And while securing a conviction in France might provide some closure for Toscan du Plantier's family, many people in West Cork say that it wouldn't change their feelings either way. Inside O'Sullivan's bar in Crookhaven, believed to be one of the last places Sophie Toscan du Plantier was seen before she was murdered. At O' Sullivans Bar in Crookhaven, a 15-minute drive from Toscan du Plantier's holiday home, and one of the last places she was seen before her murder, owner Billy O'Sullivan says there's nothing left to say. ""Even if they try and prove him guilty, how does that change anything if they can't get at him?"" O'Sullivan asked. Another local, who declined to give his name, said that ""an unsolved murder is an open sore in a small community,"" but that a conviction in France would not close that wound. ""It's a fig leaf for the French,"" he added. Back in the pub in Schull, Bailey says he doesn't want to talk about Monday, noting that he's focusing on his poetry and ways to stay calm. For more than 22 years he's been in the public eye, and he knows that next week's trial will turn the spotlight on him once again. ""I'm going to get buried,"" he said."

"Ex-GOP congressman calls for impeachment, says Trump an 'illegitimate president' - CNNPolitics",www.cnn.com,,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/24/politics/tom-coleman-trump-impeachment-cnntv/index.html,"Ex-GOP congressman calls for impeachment, says Trump an 'illegitimate president' By Devan Cole, CNN Updated 10:01 PM EDT, Fri May 24, 2019
Washington (CNN) A former longtime Republican congressman called Friday for the impeachment of President Donald Trump, who he said is an ""illegitimate president.""
""I'm calling for impeachment now because the Mueller report is out, and in it (special counsel Robert Mueller) describes 10 obstruction of justice charges that he could not bring because of a Department of Justice rule and regulation that says you can't indict a sitting president -- that's (reason) number one,"" former Rep. Tom Coleman, who represented Missouri for nearly two decades, told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront.""
""Number two, I believe this is an illegitimate President because he welcomed help and influence from the Russians in his campaign,"" he said. ""For example, his (campaign) chairman Paul Manafort met with a Russian intelligence asset in New York and shared with him their polling information and a strategy on how to win the Midwestern states.""
Coleman continued: ""It's wrong and it needs to be handled and looked at by the Congress because I believe it's an impeachable offense.""
The former congressman, who also made the impeachment case Wednesday in a Kansas City Star op-ed, told Burnett he believes Trump is ""dismantling our democracy every day brick-by-brick (through) his actions, his lies, his abuse of power."" GOP Rep. Amash becomes first Republican to say Trump 'engaged in impeachable conduct'
Although Democrats control the House, the chances of a conviction vote in the GOP-controlled Senate to remove Trump from office are remote, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far resisted Democratic calls to pursue impeachment against Trump.
In calling for Trump's impeachment, Coleman followed remarks on impeachment last weekend by GOP Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan , who also cited Mueller's report.
Amash's comments recommending Congress pursue obstruction of justice charges against Trump were the first instance of a sitting Republican in Congress saying the President's conduct meets the ""threshold for impeachment.""
Amash, a rare GOP critic of Trump, had previously said the President's conduct in pressuring then-FBI Director James Comey could merit impeachment. In a Twitter thread on Saturday, Amash said he believed ""few members of Congress even read"" special counsel Robert Mueller's report and that the report itself established ""multiple examples"" of Trump committing obstruction of justice. CNN's Eli Watkins and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report. "

Mother of 10-year-old who died in US custody says daughter was born with a heart murmur But there's potentially an even more appalling cover-up by Trump -- or by some in his administration -- that concerns the death of a 10-year-old migrant girl just five weeks before the November 2018 midterm elections that the Trump administration didn't reveal at the time to the American public. In fact, we only learned about the death of 10-year-old Darlyn Cristabel Cordova-Valle , a migrant from El Salvador, this past week thanks to an investigation by CBS News. As CBS reported, and the Trump administration has now confirmed, this young girl died on September 29, 2018, of ""a fever and respiratory distress"" after complications from surgery that left her in a coma. A Health and Human Services spokesperson said that she had a history of congenital heart defects and was in a ""medically fragile"" state when she came into US custody. Six migrant children have died in US custody, or soon after being released, since September 2018. In contrast, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement that the Department of Homeland Security, Darlyn was the first migrant child to die in federal custody since 2010. Her death poses a few vitally important questions: Has the Trump administration failed to inform us of other migrant children who have died in US custody? How do we prevent these deaths in the future? And why did Trump and his officials not reveal Darlyn's death to the American public for nearly eight months? This last question is not just about politics but potentially about life and death as well. HHS has said that reporting requirements don't mandate they tell the media of such deaths, as reasoning for why it was not reported sooner. But there's no doubt that if we learned about Darlyn's death in September 2018, it would've made headlines as the first migrant child death in US custody in years. Would that media coverage have resulted in US Border Patrol, and others caring for these children, to change their procedures for the better, possibly saving the lives of the two young migrant children, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal and 8-year-old Felipe Gómez Alonzo, who died just two months later? We will never know that. Read More CBP identifies 10-year-old girl who died in US custody in September And we need to know if Darlyn's death was intentionally kept from us in September by Trump or his administration because they knew such news only five weeks before the midterm elections could have adversely impacted the GOP. Keep in mind Trump's closing sales pitch in the last months of the 2018 campaign was that the migrants posed a threat to America and only the GOP could keep us safe. For example, Trump dubbed the people in the caravan of people approaching our southern border an "" invasion "" that included "" some very bad thugs and gang members ."" And Trump's October 22, 2018 tweet shortly before the midterms said point blank to ""blame the Democrats"" for the caravans of migrants trying to enter the country ""illegally,"" adding, ""Remember the Midterms!"" Just imagine if in the closing weeks of the midterm election we learned about the death of a 10-year-old, innocent girl. It would've required Trump and his regime to answer questions about this child's death, likely undermining or at least distracting from Trump's mantra that migrants are a grave threat to our country. Could this have tipped some more House seats -- or even control of the Senate -- in the direction of the Democrats? Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro was absolutely right when, upon hearing the news of Darlyn's death on Wednesday , he declared , ""It's outrageous that another child has died in government custody and that the Trump administration didn't tell anybody."" Castro, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, added, ""They covered up her death for eight months, even though we were actively asking the question about whether any child had died or been seriously injured."" It's now time for House Democrats to hold hearings to determine if the Trump administration has failed to inform us about other migrant children who died in US custody and come up with ways to ensure it never happens again. And, secondly, they must look into whether Trump or his administration ordered the information of Darlyn's death to be concealed from the American people. If that turns out to be the case, this very well could end up being a cover-up far worse than anything we've seen from Trump before."
Trump and the right-wing gang up on Pelosi (opinion),edition.cnn.com,Joe Lockhart,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/opinions/trump-pelosi-smear-lockhart/index.html,"Joe Lockhart, a CNN political analyst, was White House press secretary from 1998-2000 in President Bill Clinton's administration. He co-hosts the podcast ""Words Matter."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) To the casual observer, two seemingly unrelated political stories broke Thursday in Washington. First, The Washington Post reported that doctored videos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in which she appears intoxicated at a political event, had spread across the internet and social media platforms. (It should be noted that Pelosi doesn't drink, but facts sometimes take a back seat to smears from opponents.) Later, at the White House, President Trump opened a new line of attack on Speaker Pelosi, saying , ""She's a mess. ... She's lost it. ... I think she's got a lot of problems."" He called her ""crazy Nancy.""
Joe Lockhart To veteran watchers of the right-wing media food chain, the two events immediately raised alarm bells. Having been through the coordinated attacks on President Bill Clinton and his family, when I saw the Trump remarks, I immediately tweeted to a reporter , ""Any connection between that (Trump's) remark and the phony videos on the net?"" It was a rhetorical tweet and my instinct seemed to prove exactly right as the rest of the day's events played out. For context, the previous day, Speaker Pelosi scored a direct shot on the President when she detailed Trump storming out of a meeting moments after it started because she had said earlier he was engaging in a cover-up . President Trump's Rose Garden news conference did little to help his cause as he implied that no work would be done with Congress until the Democrats stop investigating him. Simply put, it was a no good, terrible, political day for President Trump. The next morning, the attack on Pelosi began when multiple videos making it appear that the speaker was slurring her words began spreading like wildfire on social media. Trump's remarks about ""crazy Nancy"" being ""a mess"" hit the exact same theme as the doctored video -- that Pelosi was out of control with some sort of problem -- and helped turn what could have remained a petty internet attack on the speaker into a major news story. Then the machine kicked in. With the predicate set, a Fox Business News program aired a doctored clip of Pelosi sounding drunk. Team Trump then took the attack and ran with it, trying to substantiate the claims that Pelosi isn't all there. The President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, tweeted an edited clip , saying, ""The last couple of weeks, she's been talking funny. I've noticed it, and a lot of other people have noticed it."" Giuliani's tweet was later deleted. And the President got in the game for himself, tweeting out the Fox video . Read More SE Cupp: On Pelosi, Kellyanne Conway takes her sexist cues from Trump Now, there is no direct evidence that the attack on Pelosi was a coordinated effort, and it's hard to know the President's level of involvement in the spreading of conspiracies and misinformation, but the precision and the sequencing of the videos and tweets strongly suggest active coordination. We should pause here just to underline one major point. The President of the United States made a statement and posted a tweet that helped spread completely false information against one of his political opponents. That alone is major news, but the bigger story is this has been going on within the right wing of American politics for decades. Working for President Clinton, I lived through the days of the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" as First Lady Hillary Clinton famously dubbed it. There were phony stories about the President ordering the murder of White House lawyer Vince Foster and the shooting down of a government plane to kill Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown . That evolved with the Trump-led birther campaign designed to show that President Obama was not an American citizen and was born in Kenya. However, the claims being leveled now against Pelosi are much more common -- and much more dangerous for several reasons. First, these smear campaigns have the active participation of the President of the United States. By sharing a phony video to his over 60 million Twitter followers, he is leading the vast right-wing conspiracy in plain sight and using the most powerful platform in the world, the Presidency, to spread nutty and damaging misinformation. It demeans the presidency and the United States at the same time. Second, the tools to spread information are much more powerful and pervasive today. The internet and social media, in particular, allow for the rapid, viral distribution of information -- including misinformation -- to all corners of the world. Finally, those who engage in and promote these campaigns don't seem at all deterred anymore by fear of getting caught. It stands to reason when the President of the United States is a participant in an activity, there is an unspoken understanding that it is acceptable. Stay up to date...

The most important question is: Do these possible coordinated campaigns work to discredit those being attacked? The answer is unambiguous. They do. They are often aimed at shoring up support for a candidate or elected official of the right-wing media machine. Remember, Pelosi put Trump on his heels Wednesday, so it was almost expected the machine would launch Thursday in order to keep the Make America Great Again crowd on the offensive. News organizations did a good job discrediting the videos and the overall smear effort, but only after countless page views and shares that delivered the reassurance to Trump supporters that their team was winning the fight. The bottom line is that by Thursday night, a new narrative had been created out of lies and deception. There are very few coincidences in politics. This effort was likely not some random series of events that independently played out. The worst part? While Fox has acknowledged that the videos were fake , the President has not, which indicates that if he had to do it over again, he would. Well, maybe this time he'd tack on to the end of his tweet: ""SAD."""
A 2-year-old boy was having trouble getting around. So employees at a Home Depot built him a walker,edition.cnn.com,Lauren M. Johnson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/home-depot-gives-child-a-walker-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Imagine your child having a disorder that impacts his motor skills, such as walking. And imagine not knowing if your insurance would cover a basic item he needs to help him walk.
That's what Christian and Justin Moore were experiencing when they walked into a Home Depot in Cedartown, Georgia, on May 24. Their son Logan is 2 and has hypotonia, a syndrome that impacts his muscle tone and makes stability a struggle. His mom told CNN that Logan's physical therapist suggested a gait trainer to help him with walking, but they did not think insurance would cover it and wondered whether it would arrive in a reasonable time. So she and her husband turned to YouTube, where they found a tutorial to make one out of PVC pipe. Logan looks happy with his new walker. ""I found a video that looked pretty easy and got the list and took it to Home Depot to see if they had everything we needed,"" Christian Moore said. Read More When they arrived, she asked a store employee she knew if anyone could help them with the supply list. Christian said what happened next shocked her. She was met by a store manager and another employee who came to help. ""They started getting the parts together and told us they would put it together and would not charge us for it,"" she said. ""They told us to go get ice cream and come back in an hour."" When they returned the walker was finished and even included Logan's name. The store employees even put Logan's name on it. ""I couldn't believe they were willing to do that. It took everything I had not to cry because it hasn't been an easy road for my son. He has had a hard time doing things that would be easy for most children his age,"" Moore said. One of the men who helped make the walker, Jeff Anderson, posted about the experience on his Facebook page and said, ""Everyone was crying to see Logan walk around with the biggest smile on his face...Thank to all that help and for being a blessing to this family and to this little guy."" ""There are so many children out there with hypotonia, more than you would think,"" Christian Moore added. ""I am grateful to be able to share that there are still good people around to help."""
Teva - CNN,www.cnn.com,Theresa Waldrop and Wayne Drash,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/health/drugmaker-teva-to-pay-85-million-to-settle-oklahoma-opioid-lawsuit/index.html,"Drugmaker Teva to pay $85 million to settle Oklahoma opioid lawsuit By Theresa Waldrop and Wayne Drash, CNN Updated 2:47 PM EDT, Sun May 26, 2019
(CNN) Teva Pharmaceuticals, one of the biggest makers of generic drugs, has agreed to pay $85 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the Oklahoma attorney general over allegations that the company contributed to the state's opioid painkiller epidemic.
The settlement comes two months after Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, agreed to pay a $270 million settlement in the historic lawsuit, and just days before the scheduled start of a trial.
The case against Johnson & Johnson, the only remaining defendant, will be heard by a district judge this week. ""Nearly all Oklahomans have been negatively impacted by this deadly crisis and we look forward to Tuesday, where we will prove our case against Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries,"" Hunter said in a news release announcing the settlement.
The money from the Teva settlement will be ""used to abate the opioid crisis in Oklahoma,"" the release said. The terms of the agreement may take two weeks to finalize.
Israeli-based Teva denies any wrongdoing.
The agreement ""does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company;"" Teva said in a statement . ""Teva has not contributed to the abuse of opioids in Oklahoma in any way.""
In announcing the March agreement with Purdue, Hunter said $102.5 million of the settlement would be used to help establish a national addiction treatment and research center at Oklahoma State University, with additional payments of $15 million each year for the next five years beginning in 2020. The company will also provide $20 million of addiction treatment and opioid rescue medications to the center over the same five-year time frame.
A remaining $12.5 million from the settlement will be used directly to help cities and counties with the opioid crisis.
The Sackler family, who founded and owns Purdue Pharma, will also contribute $75 million over the next five years to the treatment and research center.
Sunday's announcement is a testament to the state's legal team's ""dedication and resolve to hold the defendants in this case accountable for the ongoing opioid overdose and addiction epidemic that continues to claim thousands of lives each year,"" Hunter said in the release.
The agreement resolves claims against Teva Pharmaceuticals, USA, Cephalon, Inc. Watson Laboratories, Inc., Actavis, LLC, and Actavis Pharma, Inc., the attorney general's office said. "
China is not the source of our problems -- corporate greed is (opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Jeffrey Sachs,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/opinions/china-is-not-the-enemy-sachs/index.html,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University . The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) China is not an enemy. It is a nation trying to raise its living standards through education, international trade, infrastructure investment, and improved technologies. In short, it is doing what any country should do when confronted with the historical reality of being poor and far behind more powerful countries. Yet the Trump administration is now aiming to stop China's development, which could prove to be disastrous for both the United States and the entire world.
Jeffrey Sachs China is being made a scapegoat for rising inequality in the United States. While US trade relations with China have been mutually beneficial over the years, some US workers have been left behind, notably Midwestern factory workers facing competition due to rising productivity and comparatively low (though rising) labor costs in China. Instead of blaming China for this normal phenomenon of market competition, we should be taxing the soaring corporate profits of our own multinational corporations and using the revenues to help working-class households, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, promote new job skills and invest in cutting-edge science and technology. We should understand that China is merely trying to make up for lost time after a very long period of geopolitical setbacks and related economic failures. Here is important historical background that is useful to understand China's economic development in the past 40 years. In 1839, Britain attacked China because it refused to allow British traders to continue providing Chinese people with addictive opium. Britain prevailed, and the humiliation of China's defeat in the First Opium War, ending in 1842, contributed in part to a mass uprising against the Qing Dynasty called the Taiping Rebellion that ended up causing more than 20 million deaths . A Second Opium War against Britain and France ultimately led to the continued erosion of China's power and internal stability. Toward the end of the 19th century , China lost a war to the newly industrializing Japan, and was subjected to yet more one-sided demands by Europe and the United States for trade. These humiliations led to another rebellion, followed by yet another defeat, at the hands of foreign powers. Read More China's Qing Dynasty fell in 1911, after which China quickly succumbed to warlords , internal strife and Japan's invasion of China beginning in 1931. The end of World War II was followed by civil war , the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and then the upheavals of Maoism, including millions of deaths from famine in the Great Leap Forward , which ended in the early 1960s, and the mass destabilization of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath until 1977. Donald Trump shows why he's a stunningly bad deal maker China's rapid development on a market basis therefore started only in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping came to power and launched sweeping economic reforms. While China has seen incredible growth in the past four decades, the legacy of more than a century of poverty, instability, invasion and foreign threats still looms large. Chinese leaders would like to get things right this time, and that means they are unwilling to bow to the United States or other Western powers again. China is now the second-largest economy in the world, when GDP is measured at market prices. Yet it is a country still in the process of catching up from poverty. In 1980, according to IMF data , China's GDP per capita was a mere 2.5% of the United States, and by 2018 had reached only 15.3% of the US level. When GDP is measured in purchasing-power-parity terms, by using a common set of ""international prices"" to value GDP in all countries, China's income per capita in 2018 was a bit higher at 28.9% of the United States. China has roughly followed the same development strategy as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore before it. From an economic standpoint, it is not doing anything particularly unusual for a country that is playing catch up.The constant US refrain that China ""steals"" technologies is highly simplistic. Countries that are lagging behind upgrade their technologies in many ways, through study, imitation, purchases, mergers, foreign investments, extensive use of off-patent knowledge and, yes, copying. And with any fast-changing technologies, there are always running battles over intellectual property. That's true even among US companies today -- this kind of competition is simply a part of the global economic system. Technology leaders know they shouldn't count on keeping their lead through protection, but through continued innovation. Democrats have an advantage in 2020, but it may not win them the White House The United States relentlessly adopted British technologies in the early 19th century. And when any country wants to close a technology gap, it recruits know-how from abroad. The US ballistic missile program , as it is well known, was built with the help of former Nazi rocket scientists recruited to the United States after World War II. If China were a less populous Asian country, say like South Korea, with a little more than 50 million people , it would simply be hailed by the United States as a great development success story -- which it is. But because it is so big, China refutes America's pretensions to run the world. The United States, after all, is a mere 4.2% of the world's population, less than a fourth of China's. The truth is that neither country is in a position to dominate the world today, as technologies and know-how are spreading more quickly across the globe than ever before. Trade with China provides the United States with low-cost consumer goods and increasingly high-quality products. It also causes job losses in sectors such as manufacturing that compete directly with China. That is how trade works. To accuse China of unfairness in this is wrong -- plenty of American companies have reaped the benefits of manufacturing in China or exporting goods there. And US consumers enjoy higher living standards as a result of China's low-cost goods. The US and China should continue to negotiate and develop improved rules for bilateral and multilateral trade instead of stoking a trade war with one-sided threats and over-the-top accusations. The most basic lesson of trade theory, practice and policy is not to stop trade -- which would lead to falling living standards, economic crisis and conflict. Instead, we should share the benefits of economic growth so that the winners who benefit compensate the losers. Yet under American capitalism, which has long strayed from the cooperative spirit of the New Deal era, today's winners flat-out reject sharing their winnings. As a result of this lack of sharing, American politics are fraught with conflicts over trade. Greed comprehensively dominates Washington policies. The real battle is not with China but with America's own giant companies, many of which are raking in fortunes while failing to pay their own workers decent wages. America's business leaders and the mega-rich push for tax cuts, more monopoly power and offshoring -- anything to make a bigger profit -- while rejecting any policies to make American society fairer.

Trump is lashing out against China, ostensibly believing that it will once again bow to a Western power. It is willfully trying to crush successful companies like Huawei by changing the rules of international trade abruptly and unilaterally. China has been playing by Western rules for the past 40 years, gradually catching up the way that America's Asian allies did in the past. Now the United States is trying to pull the rug out from under China by launching a new Cold War. Unless some greater wisdom prevails, we could spin toward conflict with China, first economically, then geopolitically and militarily, with utter disaster for all. There will be no winners in such a conflict. Yet such is the profound shallowness and corruption of US politics today that we are on such a path. A trade war with China won't solve our economic problems. Instead we need homegrown solutions: affordable health care, better schools, modernized infrastructure, higher minimum wages and a crackdown on corporate greed. In the process, we would also learn that we have far more to gain through cooperation with China rather than reckless and unfair provocation."

A Utah judge was suspended after he made anti-Trump comments in court and online - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/utah-judge-suspended-trump-comments/index.html,"(CNN) A judge in Utah has been suspended without pay for six months after he made critical comments about President Donald Trump in court and on his Facebook page.
According to the ruling by the Utah Supreme Court, Judge Michael Kwan's Facebook posts were ""laden with blunt, and sometimes indelicate, criticism"" of Trump. The comments were made over the last several years, during both Trump's 2016 campaign and after he became President. They included a reference to the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump made crude comments about women and in one instance referred to his presidency as a ""fascist takeover."" Utah's Supreme Court concluded Kwan's remarks violated the state's Code of Judicial Conduct and could potentially undermine the judiciary's integrity and impartiality. ""Judge Kwan's behavior denigrates his reputation as an impartial, independent, dignified, and courteous jurist who takes no advantage of the office in which he serves,"" said the ruling, authored by Utah Supreme Court Justice John A. Pearce. ""And it diminishes the reputation of our entire judiciary."" Read More Kwan's attorney, Gregory Skordas, told CNN he and his client ""were disappointed with the ruling but not necessarily surprised."" Skordas said Kwan acknowledges he made comments about political candidates and elected officials, ""but felt that his overriding message was on policies and not candidates."" ""He is a beloved man and his passion for his culture is what got him in trouble,"" Skordas said of his client, the son of Chinese immigrants who fled persecution. ""We probably have no recourse but to sit out the six months and hope that he still has a court to preside over when that period has lapsed."" Judge Michael Kwan has sat on the justice court in Taylorsville, Utah, for two decades. Judge in 2017: Welcome to 'the fascist takeover' Kwan has served the Salt Lake City suburb of Taylorsville, Utah, as a justice court judge for the past 20 years, according to the Utah courts website . Other states refer to these as municipal or traffic courts that have ""very limited"" jurisdiction, Skordas said. The court's judges typically preside over misdemeanors and small-claims cases . Kwan will likely return to the bench once his suspension is over, Taylorsville spokeswoman Kim Horiuchi told CNN. Although Taylorsville is under no obligation to rehire Kwan, Horiuchi said that ""as far as we know"" the city will hire him back after the suspension. The city has hired an interim judge who starts work Tuesday and will leave after Judge Kwan returns, she said. The city has no concerns about Kwan's impartiality, Horiuchi said. Kwan has been reprimanded twice in the past for apparent violations of the code of conduct, the ruling noted. One case dealt with a ""crass in-court reference"" to the sexual conduct of a former president, and the other with Kwan's political activities as president of a nonprofit. This time he faced several allegations of misconduct, including comments made on his Facebook page and on LinkedIn, comments made in court, and the improper handling of a personnel matter. Several days after the 2016 election, the ruling said, Kwan wrote, ""Think I'll go to the shelter to adopt a cat before the President-Elect grabs them all"" -- a thinly-veiled reference to the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump was heard using vulgar language to refer to grabbing women's genitals. On the day of Trump's inauguration, Kwan made a comment directed at the President that said, ""Will you dig your heels in and spend the next four years undermining our country's reputation and standing in the world? ... Will you continue to demonstrate your inability to govern and political incompetence?"" On February 13, 2017, several weeks after Trump's inauguration, Kwan made another post, the ruling said. ""Welcome to the beginning of the fascist takeover,"" it read, questioning whether Republicans in Congress would ""be the American Reichstag and refuse to stand up for the Constitution,"" referring to the parliamentary body of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. The ruling said these examples ""are illustrative"" but ""not a comprehensive recitation"" of comments the judge made and articles he shared online that referred to Trump. He questioned Trump's tax, immigration policies Besides his political commentary on Facebook, the judge also made a remark to a defendant in his courtroom ""that appeared to demean the defendant and included political commentary regarding President Trump's immigration and tax policies,"" the ruling said. According to the ruling, the defendant indicated they were waiting for a tax return to pay off court fines, to which Kwan expressed doubt as to whether the defendant was getting money back due to Trump. ""Prayer might be the answer,"" Kwan said, according to the ruling. ""'Cause, he just signed an order to start building the wall and he has no money to do that, and so if you think you are going to get taxes back this year, uh, yeah, maybe, maybe not."" Kwan then referred to a tax cut for people who make over $500,000, and questioned whether the defendant made that much money. Kwan had argued the comment was meant to be funny, but the ruling said ""It is an immutable and universal rule that judges are not as funny as they think they are."" There is a ""decent chance,"" the ruling said, that someone in a courtroom would laugh at a judge's joke due to the ""courtroom's power dynamic and not by a genuine belief that the joke was funny."" Supreme Court: Kwan's comments threatened his impartiality Kwan had argued that the comments he made were constitutionally protected by the First Amendment, a claim the Utah Supreme Court didn't directly address in its ruling. But it said a more important issue was that Kwan ""implicitly used the esteem associated with his judicial office as a platform"" to criticize a candidate. Judges, the ruling noted, must make sacrifices in their line of work. ""Fulfillment of judicial duties does not come without personal sacrifice of some opportunities and privileges available to the public at large,"" it said, adding that a judge must sometimes ""set aside the power of his or her voice ... as a tool to publicly influence the results of a local, regional, or national election."" While Kwan's remarks addressed political issues on a national level, the ruling said, those issues could factor into questions that come up in court. Additionally, they could ""cause those who disagree with Judge Kwan's politics to believe that they will not receive a fair shake when they appear before him."" Skordas, Kwan's lawyer, said he and his client had hoped the state Supreme Court ""would be more sympathetic"" to Kwan's situation as a child of immigrants. He also said he believes that the harsh punishment was perhaps driven by the fact Kwan was reprimanded in the past. Ultimately, Skordas said, he and Kwan feel "" the sanction is grossly disproportionate to the conduct."""
Maui shark attack kills man swimming - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/maui-shark-attack/index.html,"(CNN) A shark attack killed a 65-year-old man as he was swimming off the coast of Maui Saturday morning, according to authorities.
The man, who was from California, encountered the shark about 60 yards off of Kaanapali Beach at around 8:30 a.m. local time, Dan Dennison, a spokesman for Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources, told CNN. A close friend identified the victim as optometrist Dr. Thomas Smiley. As a matter of protocol, authorities posted signs along a half-mile stretch beach warning people of a shark, Dennison said. ""Tom should be remembered for his zest for life. He enjoyed being around people and I don't think he liked being alone.

3. A majority say they wouldn't vote for Trump : There's a number buried in a Quinnipiac University poll that you should keep an eye on as the November 2020 election gets closer. Asked whether they would definitely vote for Trump or definitely not vote for him if he is the Republican presidential nominee in 2020, a majority -- 54% said they would definitely not choose the President. Three in 10 (31%) said they would definitely support Trump while 12% said they would ""consider"" voting for him. Breaking down that definitely-won't-vote-for-Trump, uh, vote by party: 94% of Democrats said they will not vote for him while 54% of independents and 10% of Republicans said the same. Obviously that looks like a major warning sign for the sitting President. And it is! You never want a majority of Americans saying they absolutely won't vote for you. But remember this: The 2020 election will be a choice between Trump and the Democratic nominee. And the President has to hope that he can convince some of those 54% who say that they won't vote for him that he is the devil they know and, therefore, a safer choice. 2. Debate season is a month away: One month from today, the first Democratic debate will commence -- the informal kickoff to the long sprint to the February 3, 2020, Iowa caucuses. The debate will unfold over two nights -- June 26 and 27 -- and could feature as many as 20 of the 23 announced Democratic candidates. (At the moment, 19 of the 23 have qualified for the debates -- either by averaging 1% in three national polls or cresting 65,000 individual donors to their campaign.) Here's how who gets in which debate will be decided: All candidates polling 2% or higher -- that's Joe Biden, Sanders, Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke and Booker, according to the Real Clear Politics average -- will be randomly split between the two nights. Then the same will be done for the candidates at more than 1%. The goal? Make sure there isn't a JV debate and a varsity debate -- which is what happened for Republicans in 2016. Using this random system, it virtually ensures the biggest names are split relatively evenly between the nights. 1. Biden vs. Trump, already: It's months before a single vote is cast in the Democratic primary race, but it already feels a bit like the general election is underway thanks to President Trump's near-constant attacks against Biden. While in Japan over the weekend, Trump singled out Biden, again, for criticism. Tweeteth Trump : ""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that's sending me a signal?"" Trump's own aides have tried to dissuade him from direct attacks on Biden for fear of elevating the former VP. That mission has clearly failed. The challenge for Democrats not named ""Biden"" is trying to ensure voters knows they have lots more options out there. Easier said than done with Trump's fingers on the button (the ""tweet"" button)."

Maui shark attack kills man swimming - CNN,us.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/maui-shark-attack/index.html,"(CNN) A shark attack killed a 65-year-old man as he was swimming off the coast of Maui Saturday morning, according to authorities.
The man, who was from California, encountered the shark about 60 yards off of Kaanapali Beach at around 8:30 a.m. local time, Dan Dennison, a spokesman for Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources, told CNN. A close friend identified the victim as optometrist Dr. Thomas Smiley. As a matter of protocol, authorities posted signs along a half-mile stretch beach warning people of a shark, Dennison said. ""Tom should be remembered for his zest for life. He enjoyed being around people and I don't think he liked being alone. He loved being around family and friends,"" Smiley's friend Gary Taxera told CNN. An incident report from the County of Maui Department of Fire and Public Safety -- obtained by CNN affiliate KHON -- says Smiley's family told authorities he had gone for a swim.

A 2-year-old boy was having trouble getting around. So employees at a Home Depot built him a walker - CNN,us.cnn.com,Lauren M. Johnson,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/home-depot-gives-child-a-walker-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Imagine your child having a disorder that impacts his motor skills, such as walking. And imagine not knowing if your insurance would cover a basic item he needs to help him walk.
That's what Christian and Justin Moore were experiencing when they walked into a Home Depot in Cedartown, Georgia, on May 24. Their son Logan is 2 and has hypotonia, a syndrome that impacts his muscle tone and makes stability a struggle. His mom told CNN that Logan's physical therapist suggested a gait trainer to help him with walking, but they did not think insurance would cover it and wondered whether it would arrive in a reasonable time. So she and her husband turned to YouTube, where they found a tutorial to make one out of PVC pipe. Logan looks happy with his new walker. ""I found a video that looked pretty easy and got the list and took it to Home Depot to see if they had everything we needed,"" Christian Moore said. Read More When they arrived, she asked a store employee she knew if anyone could help them with the supply list. Christian said what happened next shocked her. She was met by a store manager and another employee who came to help. ""They started getting the parts together and told us they would put it together and would not charge us for it,"" she said. ""They told us to go get ice cream and come back in an hour."" When they returned the walker was finished and even included Logan's name. The store employees even put Logan's name on it. ""I couldn't believe they were willing to do that. It took everything I had not to cry because it hasn't been an easy road for my son. He has had a hard time doing things that would be easy for most children his age,"" Moore said. One of the men who helped make the walker, Jeff Anderson, posted about the experience on his Facebook page and said, ""Everyone was crying to see Logan walk around with the biggest smile on his face...Thank to all that help and for being a blessing to this family and to this little guy."" ""There are so many children out there with hypotonia, more than you would think,"" Christian Moore added. ""I am grateful to be able to share that there are still good people around to help."""
A Utah judge was suspended after he made anti-Trump comments in court and online - CNN,us.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/utah-judge-suspended-trump-comments/index.html,"(CNN) A judge in Utah has been suspended without pay for six months after he made critical comments about President Donald Trump in court and on his Facebook page.
According to the ruling by the Utah Supreme Court, Judge Michael Kwan's Facebook posts were ""laden with blunt, and sometimes indelicate, criticism"" of Trump. The comments were made over the last several years, during both Trump's 2016 campaign and after he became President. They included a reference to the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump made crude comments about women and in one instance referred to his presidency as a ""fascist takeover."" Utah's Supreme Court concluded Kwan's remarks violated the state's Code of Judicial Conduct and could potentially undermine the judiciary's integrity and impartiality. ""Judge Kwan's behavior denigrates his reputation as an impartial, independent, dignified, and courteous jurist who takes no advantage of the office in which he serves,"" said the ruling, authored by Utah Supreme Court Justice John A. Pearce. ""And it diminishes the reputation of our entire judiciary."" Read More Kwan's attorney, Gregory Skordas, told CNN he and his client ""were disappointed with the ruling but not necessarily surprised."" Skordas said Kwan acknowledges he made comments about political candidates and elected officials, ""but felt that his overriding message was on policies and not candidates."" ""He is a beloved man and his passion for his culture is what got him in trouble,"" Skordas said of his client, the son of Chinese immigrants who fled persecution. ""We probably have no recourse but to sit out the six months and hope that he still has a court to preside over when that period has lapsed."" Judge Michael Kwan has sat on the justice court in Taylorsville, Utah, for two decades. Judge in 2017: Welcome to 'the fascist takeover' Kwan has served the Salt Lake City suburb of Taylorsville, Utah, as a justice court judge for the past 20 years, according to the Utah courts website . Other states refer to these as municipal or traffic courts that have ""very limited"" jurisdiction, Skordas said. The court's judges typically preside over misdemeanors and small-claims cases . Kwan will likely return to the bench once his suspension is over, Taylorsville spokeswoman Kim Horiuchi told CNN. Although Taylorsville is under no obligation to rehire Kwan, Horiuchi said that ""as far as we know"" the city will hire him back after the suspension. The city has hired an interim judge who starts work Tuesday and will leave after Judge Kwan returns, she said. The city has no concerns about Kwan's impartiality, Horiuchi said. Kwan has been reprimanded twice in the past for apparent violations of the code of conduct, the ruling noted. One case dealt with a ""crass in-court reference"" to the sexual conduct of a former president, and the other with Kwan's political activities as president of a nonprofit. This time he faced several allegations of misconduct, including comments made on his Facebook page and on LinkedIn, comments made in court, and the improper handling of a personnel matter. Several days after the 2016 election, the ruling said, Kwan wrote, ""Think I'll go to the shelter to adopt a cat before the President-Elect grabs them all"" -- a thinly-veiled reference to the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump was heard using vulgar language to refer to grabbing women's genitals. On the day of Trump's inauguration, Kwan made a comment directed at the President that said, ""Will you dig your heels in and spend the next four years undermining our country's reputation and standing in the world? ... Will you continue to demonstrate your inability to govern and political incompetence?"" On February 13, 2017, several weeks after Trump's inauguration, Kwan made another post, the ruling said. ""Welcome to the beginning of the fascist takeover,"" it read, questioning whether Republicans in Congress would ""be the American Reichstag and refuse to stand up for the Constitution,"" referring to the parliamentary body of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. The ruling said these examples ""are illustrative"" but ""not a comprehensive recitation"" of comments the judge made and articles he shared online that referred to Trump. He questioned Trump's tax, immigration policies Besides his political commentary on Facebook, the judge also made a remark to a defendant in his courtroom ""that appeared to demean the defendant and included political commentary regarding President Trump's immigration and tax policies,"" the ruling said. According to the ruling, the defendant indicated they were waiting for a tax return to pay off court fines, to which Kwan expressed doubt as to whether the defendant was getting money back due to Trump. ""Prayer might be the answer,"" Kwan said, according to the ruling. ""'Cause, he just signed an order to start building the wall and he has no money to do that, and so if you think you are going to get taxes back this year, uh, yeah, maybe, maybe not."" Kwan then referred to a tax cut for people who make over $500,000, and questioned whether the defendant made that much money. Kwan had argued the comment was meant to be funny, but the ruling said ""It is an immutable and universal rule that judges are not as funny as they think they are."" There is a ""decent chance,"" the ruling said, that someone in a courtroom would laugh at a judge's joke due to the ""courtroom's power dynamic and not by a genuine belief that the joke was funny."" Supreme Court: Kwan's comments threatened his impartiality Kwan had argued that the comments he made were constitutionally protected by the First Amendment, a claim the Utah Supreme Court didn't directly address in its ruling. But it said a more important issue was that Kwan ""implicitly used the esteem associated with his judicial office as a platform"" to criticize a candidate. Judges, the ruling noted, must make sacrifices in their line of work. ""Fulfillment of judicial duties does not come without personal sacrifice of some opportunities and privileges available to the public at large,"" it said, adding that a judge must sometimes ""set aside the power of his or her voice ... as a tool to publicly influence the results of a local, regional, or national election."" While Kwan's remarks addressed political issues on a national level, the ruling said, those issues could factor into questions that come up in court. Additionally, they could ""cause those who disagree with Judge Kwan's politics to believe that they will not receive a fair shake when they appear before him."" Skordas, Kwan's lawyer, said he and his client had hoped the state Supreme Court ""would be more sympathetic"" to Kwan's situation as a child of immigrants. He also said he believes that the harsh punishment was perhaps driven by the fact Kwan was reprimanded in the past. Ultimately, Skordas said, he and Kwan feel "" the sanction is grossly disproportionate to the conduct."""

"Naomi Osaka can win 10 grand slams, says Li Na",us.cnn.com,Danielle Rossingh,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/sport/li-na-naomi-osaka-french-open-open-court-spt-intl/index.html,"Beijing, China (CNN) Two-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka could dominate the women's game for years to come and win as many as 10 major titles, says Chinese great Li Na.
Osaka became the first Japanese player to clinch a singles slam when she won the US Open last year, and she followed it up by winning the Australian Open title in January. At 21, the US-based Osaka has the tennis world at her feet and Li, the first Asian player to win a grand slam singles title, said she is capable of great things. ""When she was playing tennis in Melbourne, I said to Dennis [her husband], 'She's very good. I think if she wants, 10 grand slams, easy to win,'"" Li, who won the French Open in 2011 and the 2014 Australian Open, told CNN Sport in an exclusive interview in Beijing. 'Pokerface' Read More Only seven women have won 10 grand slam titles or more, but Li said Osaka has the combination of power and mental strength all champions possess. ""(It is) because she is pretty strong, and also, and for her age, she has a lot of experience on the court,"" Li said after attending the Road to Wimbledon China event, the All England Lawn Tennis Club's junior tournament, in Beijing. ""She knows what she has to do, she is smart."" The top-ranked Osaka showed her resilience during a tumultuous US Open final , which was overshadowed by a row between the umpire and her opponent Serena Williams, the 23-time grand slam champion. In the end, Osaka defeated Williams, her idol growing up, 6-2 6-4. Naomi Osaka beat Serena Williams to clinch the US Open title in September 2018. Although Osaka had been in tears at the trophy ceremony as parts of the New York crowd booed the match officials, she followed up her maiden slam with a second major title, beating two-time Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic in three close sets at the Australian Open in Melbourne to rise to the top of the women's rankings. Osaka's strength of character on court has impressed Li. ""I like she has like a pokerface, doesn't matter what happened on the court, she has same face,"" Li said. READ: Why Li Na wants the movie about her life to inspire women 'Can she slide?' So far Osaka has yet to win a tournament on the slower red clay, and hasn't gone beyond the third round of Roland-Garros in Paris in three appearances. When asked if she thought the top-seeded Osaka could win the French Open, Li said: ""Does she know how to slide?"" Shortly after her Australian Open victory, Osaka parted ways with coach Sascha Bajin, the man who had guided her to two major titles and the No. 1 ranking. Having lost some momentum in the months after Melbourne, with early exits in Dubai, Indian Wells and Miami, Osaka has had an injury-marred clay-court season in Europe this spring. 😊 @RafaelNadal + @Naomi_Osaka_ = 😍 VAMOS!! Welcome to the #RafaNadalAcademy ! 🔝📸 pic.twitter.com/5yIZroAP04
— Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar (@rnadalacademy) May 1, 2019 Guided by a new coach, Jermaine Jenkins, Osaka reached the quarterfinals at last month's Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany, battling back from 5-1 down in the deciding set to beat Croatia's Donna Vekic, before an abdominal injury forced her to withdraw from the Stuttgart semifinals. Having spent the next week honing her clay-court skills at the academy of none other than 11-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal in Manacor, on the Spanish island of Mallorca, Osaka had a strong run in Madrid, where she reached the quarterfinals. Then injury struck again in Rome the week after, as Osaka withdrew with a right-hand injury ahead of a highly anticipated quarterfinal clash with Madrid champion Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands. ""My hand is better now, it's gets better every day,"" Osaka told reporters at Roland-Garros. Talking in Rome, the Japanese described her clay-court season as ""rocky,"" but she added in Paris that she has improved with every match. ""I feel I should be an all-court player,"" she said Friday. ""But it's been a bit of a ride trying to figure out how to play better on clay all these years, but this year I've been playing well so I'm really excited to see what happens here."" Big in Japan Born in Osaka, Japan, to a Haitian father and Japanese mother, Osaka has lived in the US since the age of three and is now based in Florida. Her success on the court has turned her into a superstar in Japan, and one of the world's most bankable female athletes. Living in the US may be an advantage, Li said. ""Her luck is, she doesn't live in Japan,"" said Li, who was based in Germany for long stretches during her tennis career. ""She is in America, and I think this is good for her. If she lived in Japan, I think it would be 100 times tougher."""
Women's World Cup: US soccer star says FIFA isn't 'doing nearly enough' for women - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/sport/womens-world-cup-megan-rapinoe-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) With the Women's World Cup around the corner, American soccer star Megan Rapinoe called out the sport's leadership for not doing enough to level the pitch for men and women players.
Rapinoe and the US women's national team are vying for their fourth World Cup win in France, host of the tournament starting June 7.The team beat Mexico, 3-0, Sunday in their World Cup sendoff game. Rapinoe, one of the team's co-captains, acknowledged ""strides"" toward better treatment of women in response to a reporter's question about gender parity during a media event Friday. France 2019: What you need to know about the Women's World Cup However, she added, ""the incremental change that we've seen is just not enough."" ""For the resources and for the ability that I feel like FIFA has to implement that change, I think they're not doing nearly enough,"" she said. Read More FIFA has played up its increase of the women's prize to $30 million from $15 million in 2015. This year's winners will bring home $4 million compared to the $2 million that Rapinoe and the US women's national team, Team USA, won in 2015. Yet the overall pot for the 2018 men's World Cup was $400 million, with France taking home $38 million as the winners. Megan Rapinoe: 'America needs to confront its issues more honestly' Considering what Rapinoe described as FIFA's ""essentially unlimited resources,"" and a historic lack of investment in women's games, ""I would like to see a major paradigm shift,"" she said. It's not just about prize money, Rapinoe said. It's about investing in women's sports in a way that doesn't simply replicate how things are done on the men's side, she said. ""To replicate a system that kept women down for a long time is not best way to go about it,"" she said. Rapinoe has long been involved in the fight for equality in sports. She was one of five players to accuse US soccer's governing body of wage discrimination , which led to a new collective bargaining agreement in 2017. She is one of 28 players suing the United States Soccer Federation, alleging the men's national team earns more than they do even though they play more games than the men's team and win more matches. Rapinoe also criticized FIFA for scheduling two regional tournaments on the same day as the Women's World Cup finals, potentially detracting attention from the women. ""It's ridiculous and disappointing, to be honest,"" she said."

According to the ruling by the Utah Supreme Court, Judge Michael Kwan's Facebook posts were ""laden with blunt, and sometimes indelicate, criticism"" of Trump. The comments were made over the last several years, during both Trump's 2016 campaign and after he became President. They included a reference to the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump made crude comments about women and in one instance referred to his presidency as a ""fascist takeover."" Utah's Supreme Court concluded Kwan's remarks violated the state's Code of Judicial Conduct and could potentially undermine the judiciary's integrity and impartiality. ""Judge Kwan's behavior denigrates his reputation as an impartial, independent, dignified, and courteous jurist who takes no advantage of the office in which he serves,"" said the ruling, authored by Utah Supreme Court Justice John A.

Kwan has been reprimanded twice in the past for apparent violations of the code of conduct, the ruling noted. One case dealt with a ""crass in-court reference"" to the sexual conduct of a former president, and the other with Kwan's political activities as president of a nonprofit. This time he faced several allegations of misconduct, including comments made on his Facebook page and on LinkedIn, comments made in court, and the improper handling of a personnel matter.

Trump and the right-wing gang up on Pelosi (opinion),us.cnn.com,Joe Lockhart,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/opinions/trump-pelosi-smear-lockhart/index.html,"Joe Lockhart, a CNN political analyst, was White House press secretary from 1998-2000 in President Bill Clinton's administration. He co-hosts the podcast ""Words Matter."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) To the casual observer, two seemingly unrelated political stories broke Thursday in Washington. First, The Washington Post reported that doctored videos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in which she appears intoxicated at a political event, had spread across the internet and social media platforms. (It should be noted that Pelosi doesn't drink, but facts sometimes take a back seat to smears from opponents.) Later, at the White House, President Trump opened a new line of attack on Speaker Pelosi, saying , ""She's a mess. ... She's lost it. ... I think she's got a lot of problems."" He called her ""crazy Nancy.""
Joe Lockhart To veteran watchers of the right-wing media food chain, the two events immediately raised alarm bells. Having been through the coordinated attacks on President Bill Clinton and his family, when I saw the Trump remarks, I immediately tweeted to a reporter , ""Any connection between that (Trump's) remark and the phony videos on the net?"" It was a rhetorical tweet and my instinct seemed to prove exactly right as the rest of the day's events played out. For context, the previous day, Speaker Pelosi scored a direct shot on the President when she detailed Trump storming out of a meeting moments after it started because she had said earlier he was engaging in a cover-up . President Trump's Rose Garden news conference did little to help his cause as he implied that no work would be done with Congress until the Democrats stop investigating him. Simply put, it was a no good, terrible, political day for President Trump. The next morning, the attack on Pelosi began when multiple videos making it appear that the speaker was slurring her words began spreading like wildfire on social media. Trump's remarks about ""crazy Nancy"" being ""a mess"" hit the exact same theme as the doctored video -- that Pelosi was out of control with some sort of problem -- and helped turn what could have remained a petty internet attack on the speaker into a major news story. Then the machine kicked in. With the predicate set, a Fox Business News program aired a doctored clip of Pelosi sounding drunk. Team Trump then took the attack and ran with it, trying to substantiate the claims that Pelosi isn't all there. The President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, tweeted an edited clip , saying, ""The last couple of weeks, she's been talking funny. I've noticed it, and a lot of other people have noticed it."" Giuliani's tweet was later deleted. And the President got in the game for himself, tweeting out the Fox video . Read More SE Cupp: On Pelosi, Kellyanne Conway takes her sexist cues from Trump Now, there is no direct evidence that the attack on Pelosi was a coordinated effort, and it's hard to know the President's level of involvement in the spreading of conspiracies and misinformation, but the precision and the sequencing of the videos and tweets strongly suggest active coordination. We should pause here just to underline one major point. The President of the United States made a statement and posted a tweet that helped spread completely false information against one of his political opponents. That alone is major news, but the bigger story is this has been going on within the right wing of American politics for decades. Working for President Clinton, I lived through the days of the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" as First Lady Hillary Clinton famously dubbed it. There were phony stories about the President ordering the murder of White House lawyer Vince Foster and the shooting down of a government plane to kill Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown . That evolved with the Trump-led birther campaign designed to show that President Obama was not an American citizen and was born in Kenya. However, the claims being leveled now against Pelosi are much more common -- and much more dangerous for several reasons. First, these smear campaigns have the active participation of the President of the United States. By sharing a phony video to his over 60 million Twitter followers, he is leading the vast right-wing conspiracy in plain sight and using the most powerful platform in the world, the Presidency, to spread nutty and damaging misinformation. It demeans the presidency and the United States at the same time. Second, the tools to spread information are much more powerful and pervasive today. The internet and social media, in particular, allow for the rapid, viral distribution of information -- including misinformation -- to all corners of the world. Finally, those who engage in and promote these campaigns don't seem at all deterred anymore by fear of getting caught. It stands to reason when the President of the United States is a participant in an activity, there is an unspoken understanding that it is acceptable. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .
The most important question is: Do these possible coordinated campaigns work to discredit those being attacked? The answer is unambiguous. They do. They are often aimed at shoring up support for a candidate or elected official of the right-wing media machine. Remember, Pelosi put Trump on his heels Wednesday, so it was almost expected the machine would launch Thursday in order to keep the Make America Great Again crowd on the offensive. News organizations did a good job discrediting the videos and the overall smear effort, but only after countless page views and shares that delivered the reassurance to Trump supporters that their team was winning the fight. The bottom line is that by Thursday night, a new narrative had been created out of lies and deception. There are very few coincidences in politics. This effort was likely not some random series of events that independently played out. The worst part? While Fox has acknowledged that the videos were fake , the President has not, which indicates that if he had to do it over again, he would. Well, maybe this time he'd tack on to the end of his tweet: ""SAD."""
China is not the source of our problems -- corporate greed is (opinion),us.cnn.com,Jeffrey Sachs,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/opinions/china-is-not-the-enemy-sachs/index.html,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University .

(CNN) China is not an enemy. It is a nation trying to raise its living standards through education, international trade, infrastructure investment, and improved technologies. In short, it is doing what any country should do when confronted with the historical reality of being poor and far behind more powerful countries. Yet the Trump administration is now aiming to stop China's development, which could prove to be disastrous for both the United States and the entire world.
Jeffrey Sachs China is being made a scapegoat for rising inequality in the United States. While US trade relations with China have been mutually beneficial over the years, some US workers have been left behind, notably Midwestern factory workers facing competition due to rising productivity and comparatively low (though rising) labor costs in China. Instead of blaming China for this normal phenomenon of market competition, we should be taxing the soaring corporate profits of our own multinational corporations and using the revenues to help working-class households, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, promote new job skills and invest in cutting-edge science and technology. We should understand that China is merely trying to make up for lost time after a very long period of geopolitical setbacks and related economic failures. Here is important historical background that is useful to understand China's economic development in the past 40 years. In 1839, Britain attacked China because it refused to allow British traders to continue providing Chinese people with addictive opium. Britain prevailed, and the humiliation of China's defeat in the First Opium War, ending in 1842, contributed in part to a mass uprising against the Qing Dynasty called the Taiping Rebellion that ended up causing more than 20 million deaths . A Second Opium War against Britain and France ultimately led to the continued erosion of China's power and internal stability. Toward the end of the 19th century , China lost a war to the newly industrializing Japan, and was subjected to yet more one-sided demands by Europe and the United States for trade. These humiliations led to another rebellion, followed by yet another defeat, at the hands of foreign powers. Read More China's Qing Dynasty fell in 1911, after which China quickly succumbed to warlords , internal strife and Japan's invasion of China beginning in 1931. The end of World War II was followed by civil war , the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and then the upheavals of Maoism, including millions of deaths from famine in the Great Leap Forward , which ended in the early 1960s, and the mass destabilization of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath until 1977. Donald Trump shows why he's a stunningly bad deal maker China's rapid development on a market basis therefore started only in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping came to power and launched sweeping economic reforms. While China has seen incredible growth in the past four decades, the legacy of more than a century of poverty, instability, invasion and foreign threats still looms large. Chinese leaders would like to get things right this time, and that means they are unwilling to bow to the United States or other Western powers again. China is now the second-largest economy in the world, when GDP is measured at market prices. Yet it is a country still in the process of catching up from poverty. In 1980, according to IMF data , China's GDP per capita was a mere 2.5% of the United States, and by 2018 had reached only 15.3% of the US level. When GDP is measured in purchasing-power-parity terms, by using a common set of ""international prices"" to value GDP in all countries, China's income per capita in 2018 was a bit higher at 28.9% of the United States. China has roughly followed the same development strategy as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore before it. From an economic standpoint, it is not doing anything particularly unusual for a country that is playing catch up.The constant US refrain that China ""steals"" technologies is highly simplistic. Countries that are lagging behind upgrade their technologies in many ways, through study, imitation, purchases, mergers, foreign investments, extensive use of off-patent knowledge and, yes, copying. And with any fast-changing technologies, there are always running battles over intellectual property. That's true even among US companies today -- this kind of competition is simply a part of the global economic system. Technology leaders know they shouldn't count on keeping their lead through protection, but through continued innovation. Democrats have an advantage in 2020, but it may not win them the White House The United States relentlessly adopted British technologies in the early 19th century. And when any country wants to close a technology gap, it recruits know-how from abroad. The US ballistic missile program , as it is well known, was built with the help of former Nazi rocket scientists recruited to the United States after World War II. If China were a less populous Asian country, say like South Korea, with a little more than 50 million people , it would simply be hailed by the United States as a great development success story -- which it is. But because it is so big, China refutes America's pretensions to run the world. The United States, after all, is a mere 4.2% of the world's population, less than a fourth of China's. The truth is that neither country is in a position to dominate the world today, as technologies and know-how are spreading more quickly across the globe than ever before. Trade with China provides the United States with low-cost consumer goods and increasingly high-quality products. It also causes job losses in sectors such as manufacturing that compete directly with China. That is how trade works. To accuse China of unfairness in this is wrong -- plenty of American companies have reaped the benefits of manufacturing in China or exporting goods there. And US consumers enjoy higher living standards as a result of China's low-cost goods. The US and China should continue to negotiate and develop improved rules for bilateral and multilateral trade instead of stoking a trade war with one-sided threats and over-the-top accusations. The most basic lesson of trade theory, practice and policy is not to stop trade -- which would lead to falling living standards, economic crisis and conflict. Instead, we should share the benefits of economic growth so that the winners who benefit compensate the losers. Yet under American capitalism, which has long strayed from the cooperative spirit of the New Deal era, today's winners flat-out reject sharing their winnings. As a result of this lack of sharing, American politics are fraught with conflicts over trade. Greed comprehensively dominates Washington policies. The real battle is not with China but with America's own giant companies, many of which are raking in fortunes while failing to pay their own workers decent wages. America's business leaders and the mega-rich push for tax cuts, more monopoly power and offshoring -- anything to make a bigger profit -- while rejecting any policies to make American society fairer.
Trump is lashing out against China, ostensibly believing that it will once again bow to a Western power. It is willfully trying to crush successful companies like Huawei by changing the rules of international trade abruptly and unilaterally. China has been playing by Western rules for the past 40 years, gradually catching up the way that America's Asian allies did in the past. Now the United States is trying to pull the rug out from under China by launching a new Cold War. Unless some greater wisdom prevails, we could spin toward conflict with China, first economically, then geopolitically and militarily, with utter disaster for all. There will be no winners in such a conflict. Yet such is the profound shallowness and corruption of US politics today that we are on such a path. A trade war with China won't solve our economic problems. Instead we need homegrown solutions: affordable health care, better schools, modernized infrastructure, higher minimum wages and a crackdown on corporate greed. In the process, we would also learn that we have far more to gain through cooperation with China rather than reckless and unfair provocation."

(CNN) Speaker Nancy Pelosi made headlines -- and outraged Donald Trump -- this week by declaring that, ""We believe that the President of The United States is engaged in a cover-up."" In this case, Pelosi was speaking of Trump's stonewalling of requests by House Democrats for information, such as his tax returns.
Mother of 10-year-old who died in US custody says daughter was born with a heart murmur But there's potentially an even more appalling cover-up by Trump -- or by some in his administration -- that concerns the death of a 10-year-old migrant girl just five weeks before the November 2018 midterm elections that the Trump administration didn't reveal at the time to the American public. In fact, we only learned about the death of 10-year-old Darlyn Cristabel Cordova-Valle , a migrant from El Salvador, this past week thanks to an investigation by CBS News. As CBS reported, and the Trump administration has now confirmed, this young girl died on September 29, 2018, of ""a fever and respiratory distress"" after complications from surgery that left her in a coma. A Health and Human Services spokesperson said that she had a history of congenital heart defects and was in a ""medically fragile"" state when she came into US custody. Six migrant children have died in US custody, or soon after being released, since September 2018. In contrast, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement that the Department of Homeland Security, Darlyn was the first migrant child to die in federal custody since 2010. Her death poses a few vitally important questions: Has the Trump administration failed to inform us of other migrant children who have died in US custody? How do we prevent these deaths in the future? And why did Trump and his officials not reveal Darlyn's death to the American public for nearly eight months? This last question is not just about politics but potentially about life and death as well. HHS has said that reporting requirements don't mandate they tell the media of such deaths, as reasoning for why it was not reported sooner. But there's no doubt that if we learned about Darlyn's death in September 2018, it would've made headlines as the first migrant child death in US custody in years. Would that media coverage have resulted in US Border Patrol, and others caring for these children, to change their procedures for the better, possibly saving the lives of the two young migrant children, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal and 8-year-old Felipe Gómez Alonzo, who died just two months later? We will never know that. Read More CBP identifies 10-year-old girl who died in US custody in September And we need to know if Darlyn's death was intentionally kept from us in September by Trump or his administration because they knew such news only five weeks before the midterm elections could have adversely impacted the GOP. Keep in mind Trump's closing sales pitch in the last months of the 2018 campaign was that the migrants posed a threat to America and only the GOP could keep us safe. For example, Trump dubbed the people in the caravan of people approaching our southern border an "" invasion "" that included "" some very bad thugs and gang members ."" And Trump's October 22, 2018 tweet shortly before the midterms said point blank to ""blame the Democrats"" for the caravans of migrants trying to enter the country ""illegally,"" adding, ""Remember the Midterms!"" Just imagine if in the closing weeks of the midterm election we learned about the death of a 10-year-old, innocent girl. It would've required Trump and his regime to answer questions about this child's death, likely undermining or at least distracting from Trump's mantra that migrants are a grave threat to our country. Could this have tipped some more House seats -- or even control of the Senate -- in the direction of the Democrats? Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .
Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro was absolutely right when, upon hearing the news of Darlyn's death on Wednesday , he declared , ""It's outrageous that another child has died in government custody and that the Trump administration didn't tell anybody."" Castro, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, added, ""They covered up her death for eight months, even though we were actively asking the question about whether any child had died or been seriously injured."" It's now time for House Democrats to hold hearings to determine if the Trump administration has failed to inform us about other migrant children who died in US custody and come up with ways to ensure it never happens again. And, secondly, they must look into whether Trump or his administration ordered the information of Darlyn's death to be concealed from the American people. If that turns out to be the case, this very well could end up being a cover-up far worse than anything we've seen from Trump before."

(CNN) If Washington politics were a movie, this week might be the time you turn to your companion and say, ""Who writes this stuff?"":
A President and ""world-class deal maker,"" marveled Frida Ghitis , who demonstrates with a ""temper tantrum,"" that he can't make deals. Who storms out of meetings with congressional leaders while insisting he's calm (and lines up his top aides to confirm it for the cameras). Who says, ""I don't do cover-ups,"" with his administration on information lockdown -- offering justifications "" that wouldn't pass muster in an episode of 'The Simpsons,' "" remarked Julian Zelizer. And who launches into a tirade -- in the middle of an event about aid to farmers -- to say I'm not crazy, she's crazy . ""She"" being House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who offered Trump her thoughts and prayers, and wished aloud that someone would get him an intervention. There was no need, I'm an ""extremely stable genius,"" Trump told reporters, adding that he'll talk to Democrats when they stop investigating him. He's right, suggested Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post: "" Nancy Pelosi can't accuse him of engaging in a coverup in the morning and expect him to negotiate with her on a $2 trillion infrastructure package in the afternoon."" By week's end, Trump and supporters were previewing what critics believed his re-election campaign would look like. He retweeted a Fox Business Network video mashup of Pelosi stammering during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday. ""It's pathetic,"" protested SE Cupp , adding ""childish"" and ""impotent."" "" But it's disgusting and disturbing to watch the president and leader of the free world do it time and time again. "" Read More Nancy Pelosi: queen of shade? The war of words began Wednesday, said Ghitis . Trump was ""hurt because earlier in the day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, 'We believe the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.'"" Nia-Malika Henderson explained: "" In Pelosi, Trump has something he has never had. A person -- a woman, at that -- who challenges, frustrates and frequently doles out plenty of strategic shade ."" Pelosi ""reminds him that his power isn't limitless. With every briefing and White House meeting, she flexes her own considerable power."" But not toward impeachment, complained Zelizer --and that's a big mistake. Pelosi and her allies are trying to protect ""their partisan prospects in 2020"" rather than ensure that ""our constitutional checks and balances are working to restrain Trump right now, "" he said. Courage, valor, humility ""The old man said he didn't do anything. I only half believed him,"" began retired Rear Adm. John Kirby . He was writing about Charles Nease, an Army private who survived the Battle of Anzio in Italy during World War II -- and like many in his generation didn't want to take credit for his valor. Kirby visited him in a hospital when Nease was dying, and they talked about his love for his wife and his children. "" He did everything, everything a man could hope to do with his life and still call himself a man."" Memorial Day honors America's war dead, but Richard Morgan wrote that there also needs to be an occasion to "" honor our forgotten fallen — the appalling number of children who have died and continue to die because our way of life ."" Quote: : ""There is no Tomb of the Unknown Child,"" but thankfully, we have student advocates ""leading the movement for our fallen children...Our prayer should be that these students succeed in schooling us."" To infinity and beyond Graduates were tossing mortarboards last week and rushing to meet their futures. But it's hard to imagine a more joyous nudge than the one Robert F. Smith, a billionaire philanthropist, gave to Morehouse College's class of 2019. He said he'd pay off their student loans. ""Incredible generosity,"" wrote I ssac Bailey , but "" a lone billionaire -- or a gaggle of billionaires -- will never be enough to solve our growing student loan debt crisis ."" As LZ Granderson watched his son graduate -- debt free -- from New York University last week, he reflected that ""the hardest decision I ever made as a father was leaving the city where my then-5-year-old son lived with his mother (my ex-wife) so I could take a better-paying job. I did so with one singular goal in mind: to be in a better position to pay for his college tuition."" His happiness at his son's achievement was wound up with a certain regret: ""Presence over presents,"" he pondered. "" Was I second-guessing the strategy with which I accomplished my mission? "" Elbie Seibert , 2019 valedictorian at Columbia High School in Nampa, Idaho, lost his father to cancer a week before graduation. He wrote his commencement speech anyway: ""My body aches from missing him so much,"" Seibert said. ""I can feel him in my bones, hear him in my dreams, see him in my shadows -- and I find some small comfort in all of that."" The last year brought many lessons, he said, among them, "" never take anyone or anything for granted. "" For Evan Mandery , this weekend marks his 30th Harvard reunion. He's boycotting it over legacy admissions, which favor the already-privileged and furthers inequality, he wrote. "" The influence of money is sanitized in the admissions process through the concept of legacy ."" What Justin Amash did Michigan Congressman -- and Tea Party Republican -- Justin Amash took a giant step, all alone, away from his colleagues last weekend: ""President Trump has engaged in impeachable conduct,"" he tweeted. Republican lawmakers lined up to scorn him. Trump tweeted "" loser ."" But Dean Obeidallah cheered: "" Finally, a deeply conservative member of Congress ... has put the US Constitution before partisan loyalty to President Donald Trump."" Mitt Romney disagreed, telling told Jake Tapper he'd ""reached a different conclusion"": the report does not establish that Trump obstructed justice. "" The business of government can move on ,"" he tweeted. Please explain, wrote Teri Kanefield . Mueller himself clearly laid out the evidence of obstruction (though declined to charge), she wrote; Romney and others should show the public ""which particular parts of Mueller's analysis clear Trump and why. Otherwise, we really have no choice but to conclude that they are telling a politically expedient lie. "" Trump vowed to fight every subpoena Congress delivers as it digs into the details of the Mueller probe. One called for his former White House counsel, Don McGahn, to appear before the Judiciary Committee Tuesday. The White House told him to skip it and he did. Trump is winning here, insisted former federal prosecutor Elie Honig : "" The White House, fighting for its survival, is willing to bite, eye gouge and kidney punch , while Congress -- torn between pursuing justice and political expediency -- isn't even sure if it wants to fight at all."" Another smart take: Michael D'Antonio : Don McGahn, the White House official who stood up to Trump . Don't get cocky, candidates Meanwhile, the 2020 Democratic candidates for president (all 23) continued to wave their arms. Hey, America: Look at us. Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke took the stage at a CNN Town Hall Tuesday intent on rebooting his flagging campaign. But first, in an op-ed for CNN, he turned his attention to America's rural communities, suffering both from President Trump's trade wars and massive flooding across the Midwest, he wrote. "" We need to go to forgotten places ... and not only pay lip service to their problems , but listen to their ideas and welcome them to be a part of the solution."" Granderson was appalled to hear during a recent big-ticket, Democratic fundraiser, that donors were reluctant to throw in for a gay presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg, even though they really like the guy. "" I couldn't ignore the irony of hearing so many blue-state-living/rainbow-flag-adjacent /'love-is-love' liberals in one room dismiss Buttigieg's bid for the White House largely because he's gay ."" He added: ""There is a legitimate question about whether Democrats -- for all their talk -- believe it's worth fighting for a gay candidate."" And Jill Filipovic warned Democrats not to get cocky after a Quinnipiac poll this week showed Joe Biden far in the lead among Democrats, with Trump failing to get much credit for the flourishing economy. Voters are ""hungry for an alternative to Trump"" but they need a forward-looking ""dual message of integrity and opportunity,"" she wrote. ""2020 could very easily be a big win for Democrats. But complacency, and even reliance on the perceived safest choice, could mean another four years of Trump ."" San Francisco's raid on a reporter Carrying a sledge hammer and with guns drawn, San Francisco police recently raided the home of freelance reporter Bryan Carmody, handcuffing him for six hours and taking away thousands of dollars of equipment, photos and work materials. "" A stunning intrusion on press freedom, similar to what we see in autocratic regimes ,"" observed journalist Yashar Ali . ""If there isn't more outrage and accountability...other local law enforcement agencies will feel free to engage in the same dangerous conduct."" To the moon, everybody! Long before he was a billionaire and philanthropist, Richard Branson was a little kid watching the 1969 moon landing on a black-and-white TV, marveling at ""the courage it must have taken -- to turn something seemingly impossible into a reality. This fascination with flying, breaking boundaries and exploring the great unknown has never left me ."" Virgin Galactic's spaceship, VSS Unity -- eventually to be used for private paying passengers --reached space for the first time in December and the second in February. ""One of the most important and exciting things about exploring space is how it can bring us all together."" A looming problem for anti-abortion politicians? Back in 2016, before Trump was President, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd asked him: ""When he was a swinging bachelor in Manhattan, was he ever involved with anyone who had an abortion?"" Trump's response? ""Such an interesting question. So what's your next question?"" ""Imagine this for a moment,"" Joe Lockhart mused: President Trump ""standing next to a world leader at a joint news conference while an aggressive reporter asks, Mr. Trump, have you ever paid for an abortion, impregnated a woman and encouraged her to get one, or in any other way supported the termination of a pregnancy?'"" The legacy of restrictive laws on abortion in a slew of states may be a new, aggressive debate about the role men -- including politicians -- may have played in their sexual partners' abortion and how they might have benefited from it , Lockhart contends. It's later than you think Tornadoes and floods are strafing the Midwest, sea level is rising, croplands are swamped, atmospheric carbon dioxide has spiked and animal species are vanishing. Is it too late to save the earth? It's not, but heads of state, ministers, mayors and business leaders better get serious quick , entreated Helen Mountford . ""Global greenhouse gas emissions must peak no later than next year and rapidly decline thereafter"" for humans to stall the worst effects of climate crisis. When world leaders gather next year -- five years after the Paris Agreement of 2015 -- their ""revised plans will point humanity to a future that is either bright or bleak."" Two recent studies that showed both extinctions and sea-level rise accelerating ought to slap humans awake, wrote Carl Safina . Instead, the ""brutalizing affect"" of humans -- the tons of plastics found in the bodies of dead whales, the pesticide slaughter of pollinating insects, the disappearance of more than 80% of mammals -- continues. "" What then would you call something that is wiping out everything besides itself? Here's a short thesaurus of synonyms: disaster, cancer, Armageddon,"" he wrote. A life full of treasure ""Buried at the heart of all great children's literature, even the loveliest and most innocent, is a thread of darkness,"" noted Holly Thomas . And Judith Kerr, beloved author of The Tiger Who Came To Tea, the Mog the Cat stories, and When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, knew just where to find it. Kerr died last week at 95. Her family had fled Nazi Germany when she was a child, Thomas wrote, and her parents worked to shield her and her brother from the horrors swirling around them. ""Her attitude about her early experience seems almost preposterously optimistic -- she described life on the run as a child as 'wonderful,' and in her final years she said that given the chance, she'd not change a thing about her youth."" Her books imagined a better world but were shaded by loss, wrote Thomas. "" Kerr knew the possibilities and the perils life entailed, and chose to treasure every gift it offered. "" Don't miss these: Michael Slepian : Trump backers who were afraid to tell their loved ones . David Andelman : Secretly recorded video casts harsh light on Europe's far right . Grenada Prime Minister Keith C. Mitchell : Climate change is an existential threat for us in the islands . Yuliya Panfil and Tim Robustelli : The devastating storm recovery problem hiding in plain sight. Mark Hertling : Pardoning soldiers accused of war crimes would be immoral. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Fox News aired a video of Nancy Pelosi. The network is Fox Business Network. The video, which President Trump retweeted, was a compilation of Pelosi stammering. In a statement last week, a Fox Business Network spokesperson said ""The Fox Business segment featuring clips from Speaker Pelosi's speech today did not slow down any aspect of her address."""

Researchers can now use AI and a photo to make fake videos of anyone - CNN,www.cnn.com,Rachel Metz,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/24/tech/deepfake-ai-one-photo/index.html,"San Francisco (CNN) Researchers have come up with a method for creating realistic-looking — but fake — videos of anyone by using just a single image of them with a trained artificial intelligence system. It's a potentially worrisome capability in the runup to the 2020 United States presidential election, as falsified videos of candidates are expected to spread.
Researchers at the Samsung AI Center in Moscow and the Moscow-based Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology explained the feat in a paper published this week to the arXiv, an online academic pre-print service. They said they were able to animate one or several photos of people by first training an AI system on a dataset of videos including many celebrities, so it could learn about key points on the face. After that, the AI system was able to combine that familiarity with one or more images of a person to come up with a convincing ""talking head""-style video of them. Lawmakers warn of 'deepfake' videos ahead of 2020 election A video the researchers posted to YouTube this week showed multiple examples of how convincing it can look, as well as how much work is yet to be done. Impressively animated versions of physicist Albert Einstein, actress Marilyn Monroe and surrealist painter Salvador Dali were generated from iconic images of them. But each was missing something: Einstein's voluminous hairdo didn't quite move with his head, Dali's matchstick-thin mustache was cut short, and Monroe's famous mole was absent from her cheek. In this still from a YouTube video, researchers illustrate how they trained an AI system to create videos of people (in this case, actor Joe Manganiello) from just one or a handful of still images. The work is quite similar to deepfakes — a combination of the terms ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" — which are convincing fake videos and audio made using cutting-edge and relatively accessible AI technology. The research uses the same AI technique behind deepfakes, which is a machine-learning method known as GANs, or generative adversarial networks. But it's different, as deepfakes are generated by using video of a target person along with video of someone else acting the way the target will in the video, such as this one featuring actor and comedian Jordan Peele putting words in former President Barack Obama's mouth. Read More The spread of doctored videos is raising concerns for everyone from political leaders to the US intelligence community, which worries they may be used to mislead voters . These videos don't need to be altered with the latest technology to be effective: A manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that went viral this week was simply slowed down to make it appear she was slurring her words following a meeting with President Donald Trump. The fight to stay ahead of deepfake videos before the 2020 US election The researchers' work is still in the early stages: The AI system was only trained to create a person's head, neck and some of the shoulders. And while a clip created with a single reference photo of a woman looked plausible (though somewhat low-resolution), other clips that were made with eight and 32 images of her looked increasingly realistic. Siwei Lyu, who studies deepfakes and is director of the computer vision and machine learning lab at University at Albany, SUNY, told CNN Business that the research could make it easier to create deepfakes with less data than they currently require. These days, that tends to be more than 30 seconds worth of video of both of the person you want to manipulate and another person who must also be filmed doing the desired motions. ""The downside is, without sufficient data, the quality of the synthesis is limited,"" he said. Which is to say that he, too, noticed Monroe's missing mole. "
Lewis Hamilton dedicates Monaco Grand Prix win to Niki Lauda,rss.cnn.com,"Ben Church, CNN",05-26-2019,2019,5,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/ZzqFDciDRAs/index.html,"(CNN) Lewis Hamilton led from start to finish at the Monaco Grand Prix to win his fourth race of the season after an emotional week for the world of Formula 1.
The Mercedes driver dedicated the victory to his hero Niki Lauda, the three-time world champion who died aged 70 earlier this month. ""That was definitely the hardest race I've had but nonetheless I really was fighting with the spirit of Niki [Lauda],"" said an emotional Hamilton after the race. After recovering from a near-fatal accident to become one of motor racing's greatest drivers, Lauda served as a non-executive chairman of Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix and was influential in bringing Hamilton to the team. The Brit continued: ""He's been such an influence in our team and I know he will be looking down and taking his hat off.

READ: My way or the highway -- Niki Lauda's Formula One creed It was yet another dramatic afternoon on the track in the principality, where drivers hurtle around the winding streets of Monaco. Race leader Hamilton was chased relentlessly by Red Bull racer Max Verstappen and dug deep to defend his lead amid issues with his tires. However, it was the first time this season that a Mercedes one-two was disturbed, with Hamilton's teammate Bottas falling to third after starting the race second on the grid. Much of that was down to a controversial pit stop that saw Verstappen make contact with Bottas as they both exited the pit lanes, causing the Finnish driver to fall behind both the Dutchman and Sebastian Vettel. ""It was small margins yesterday and that made today difficult. Max got me in the pit lane and left me with no room and then I was stuck behind, it was like a Sunday drive,"" said a frustrated Bottas, after finishing the race behind Ferrari's Vettel.

A 53-year-old woman also died in Payne County and a 58-year-old man died in Stephens County, according to officials. In El Reno, officials were going door to door to find victims and assess the damage after the tornado touched down in the city late Saturday.

(CNN) Speaker Nancy Pelosi made headlines -- and outraged Donald Trump -- this week by declaring that, ""We believe that the President of The United States is engaged in a cover-up."" In this case, Pelosi was speaking of Trump's stonewalling of requests by House Democrats for information, such as his tax returns.
Mother of 10-year-old who died in US custody says daughter was born with a heart murmur But there's potentially an even more appalling cover-up by Trump -- or by some in his administration -- that concerns the death of a 10-year-old migrant girl just five weeks before the November 2018 midterm elections that the Trump administration didn't reveal at the time to the American public. In fact, we only learned about the death of 10-year-old Darlyn Cristabel Cordova-Valle , a migrant from El Salvador, this past week thanks to an investigation by CBS News. As CBS reported, and the Trump administration has now confirmed, this young girl died on September 29, 2018, of ""a fever and respiratory distress"" after complications from surgery that left her in a coma. A Health and Human Services spokesperson said that she had a history of congenital heart defects and was in a ""medically fragile"" state when she came into US custody. Six migrant children have died in US custody, or soon after being released, since September 2018. In contrast, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement that the Department of Homeland Security, Darlyn was the first migrant child to die in federal custody since 2010. Her death poses a few vitally important questions: Has the Trump administration failed to inform us of other migrant children who have died in US custody? How do we prevent these deaths in the future? And why did Trump and his officials not reveal Darlyn's death to the American public for nearly eight months? This last question is not just about politics but potentially about life and death as well. HHS has said that reporting requirements don't mandate they tell the media of such deaths, as reasoning for why it was not reported sooner. But there's no doubt that if we learned about Darlyn's death in September 2018, it would've made headlines as the first migrant child death in US custody in years. Would that media coverage have resulted in US Border Patrol, and others caring for these children, to change their procedures for the better, possibly saving the lives of the two young migrant children, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal and 8-year-old Felipe Gómez Alonzo, who died just two months later? We will never know that. Read More CBP identifies 10-year-old girl who died in US custody in September And we need to know if Darlyn's death was intentionally kept from us in September by Trump or his administration because they knew such news only five weeks before the midterm elections could have adversely impacted the GOP. Keep in mind Trump's closing sales pitch in the last months of the 2018 campaign was that the migrants posed a threat to America and only the GOP could keep us safe. For example, Trump dubbed the people in the caravan of people approaching our southern border an "" invasion "" that included "" some very bad thugs and gang members ."" And Trump's October 22, 2018 tweet shortly before the midterms said point blank to ""blame the Democrats"" for the caravans of migrants trying to enter the country ""illegally,"" adding, ""Remember the Midterms!"" Just imagine if in the closing weeks of the midterm election we learned about the death of a 10-year-old, innocent girl. It would've required Trump and his regime to answer questions about this child's death, likely undermining or at least distracting from Trump's mantra that migrants are a grave threat to our country. Could this have tipped some more House seats -- or even control of the Senate -- in the direction of the Democrats? Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro was absolutely right when, upon hearing the news of Darlyn's death on Wednesday , he declared , ""It's outrageous that another child has died in government custody and that the Trump administration didn't tell anybody."" Castro, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, added, ""They covered up her death for eight months, even though we were actively asking the question about whether any child had died or been seriously injured."" It's now time for House Democrats to hold hearings to determine if the Trump administration has failed to inform us about other migrant children who died in US custody and come up with ways to ensure it never happens again. And, secondly, they must look into whether Trump or his administration ordered the information of Darlyn's death to be concealed from the American people. If that turns out to be the case, this very well could end up being a cover-up far worse than anything we've seen from Trump before. "
China is not the source of our problems -- corporate greed is (opinion) - CNN,rss.cnn.com,Jeffrey Sachs,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_asia/~3/X6m6ygv-OrE/index.html,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University .

(CNN) China is not an enemy. It is a nation trying to raise its living standards through education, international trade, infrastructure investment, and improved technologies. In short, it is doing what any country should do when confronted with the historical reality of being poor and far behind more powerful countries. Yet the Trump administration is now aiming to stop China's development, which could prove to be disastrous for both the United States and the entire world.
Jeffrey Sachs China is being made a scapegoat for rising inequality in the United States. While US trade relations with China have been mutually beneficial over the years, some US workers have been left behind, notably Midwestern factory workers facing competition due to rising productivity and comparatively low (though rising) labor costs in China. Instead of blaming China for this normal phenomenon of market competition, we should be taxing the soaring corporate profits of our own multinational corporations and using the revenues to help working-class households, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, promote new job skills and invest in cutting-edge science and technology. We should understand that China is merely trying to make up for lost time after a very long period of geopolitical setbacks and related economic failures. Here is important historical background that is useful to understand China's economic development in the past 40 years. In 1839, Britain attacked China because it refused to allow British traders to continue providing Chinese people with addictive opium. Britain prevailed, and the humiliation of China's defeat in the First Opium War, ending in 1842, contributed in part to a mass uprising against the Qing Dynasty called the Taiping Rebellion that ended up causing more than 20 million deaths . A Second Opium War against Britain and France ultimately led to the continued erosion of China's power and internal stability. Toward the end of the 19th century , China lost a war to the newly industrializing Japan, and was subjected to yet more one-sided demands by Europe and the United States for trade. These humiliations led to another rebellion, followed by yet another defeat, at the hands of foreign powers. Read More China's Qing Dynasty fell in 1911, after which China quickly succumbed to warlords , internal strife and Japan's invasion of China beginning in 1931. The end of World War II was followed by civil war , the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and then the upheavals of Maoism, including millions of deaths from famine in the Great Leap Forward , which ended in the early 1960s, and the mass destabilization of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath until 1977. Donald Trump shows why he's a stunningly bad deal maker China's rapid development on a market basis therefore started only in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping came to power and launched sweeping economic reforms. While China has seen incredible growth in the past four decades, the legacy of more than a century of poverty, instability, invasion and foreign threats still looms large. Chinese leaders would like to get things right this time, and that means they are unwilling to bow to the United States or other Western powers again. China is now the second-largest economy in the world, when GDP is measured at market prices. Yet it is a country still in the process of catching up from poverty. In 1980, according to IMF data , China's GDP per capita was a mere 2.5% of the United States, and by 2018 had reached only 15.3% of the US level. When GDP is measured in purchasing-power-parity terms, by using a common set of ""international prices"" to value GDP in all countries, China's income per capita in 2018 was a bit higher at 28.9% of the United States. China has roughly followed the same development strategy as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore before it. From an economic standpoint, it is not doing anything particularly unusual for a country that is playing catch up.The constant US refrain that China ""steals"" technologies is highly simplistic. Countries that are lagging behind upgrade their technologies in many ways, through study, imitation, purchases, mergers, foreign investments, extensive use of off-patent knowledge and, yes, copying. And with any fast-changing technologies, there are always running battles over intellectual property. That's true even among US companies today -- this kind of competition is simply a part of the global economic system. Technology leaders know they shouldn't count on keeping their lead through protection, but through continued innovation. Democrats have an advantage in 2020, but it may not win them the White House The United States relentlessly adopted British technologies in the early 19th century. And when any country wants to close a technology gap, it recruits know-how from abroad. The US ballistic missile program , as it is well known, was built with the help of former Nazi rocket scientists recruited to the United States after World War II. If China were a less populous Asian country, say like South Korea, with a little more than 50 million people , it would simply be hailed by the United States as a great development success story -- which it is. But because it is so big, China refutes America's pretensions to run the world. The United States, after all, is a mere 4.2% of the world's population, less than a fourth of China's. The truth is that neither country is in a position to dominate the world today, as technologies and know-how are spreading more quickly across the globe than ever before. Trade with China provides the United States with low-cost consumer goods and increasingly high-quality products. It also causes job losses in sectors such as manufacturing that compete directly with China. That is how trade works. To accuse China of unfairness in this is wrong -- plenty of American companies have reaped the benefits of manufacturing in China or exporting goods there. And US consumers enjoy higher living standards as a result of China's low-cost goods. The US and China should continue to negotiate and develop improved rules for bilateral and multilateral trade instead of stoking a trade war with one-sided threats and over-the-top accusations. The most basic lesson of trade theory, practice and policy is not to stop trade -- which would lead to falling living standards, economic crisis and conflict. Instead, we should share the benefits of economic growth so that the winners who benefit compensate the losers. Yet under American capitalism, which has long strayed from the cooperative spirit of the New Deal era, today's winners flat-out reject sharing their winnings. As a result of this lack of sharing, American politics are fraught with conflicts over trade. Greed comprehensively dominates Washington policies. The real battle is not with China but with America's own giant companies, many of which are raking in fortunes while failing to pay their own workers decent wages. America's business leaders and the mega-rich push for tax cuts, more monopoly power and offshoring -- anything to make a bigger profit -- while rejecting any policies to make American society fairer.

Trump is lashing out against China, ostensibly believing that it will once again bow to a Western power. It is willfully trying to crush successful companies like Huawei by changing the rules of international trade abruptly and unilaterally. China has been playing by Western rules for the past 40 years, gradually catching up the way that America's Asian allies did in the past. Now the United States is trying to pull the rug out from under China by launching a new Cold War. Unless some greater wisdom prevails, we could spin toward conflict with China, first economically, then geopolitically and militarily, with utter disaster for all. There will be no winners in such a conflict. Yet such is the profound shallowness and corruption of US politics today that we are on such a path. A trade war with China won't solve our economic problems. Instead we need homegrown solutions: affordable health care, better schools, modernized infrastructure, higher minimum wages and a crackdown on corporate greed. In the process, we would also learn that we have far more to gain through cooperation with China rather than reckless and unfair provocation."
A 26th race horse dies at Santa Anita Park,edition.cnn.com,Hollie Silverman,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/santa-anita-park-horse-deaths/index.html,"(CNN) A horse died Sunday at Santa Anita Park in California after sustaining an injury in a race, a racetrack spokesman said.
The horse, named Kochees, is the 26th horse to die at Santa Anita since December. Kochees was injured during his sixth race on Saturday, according to the spokesman, Mike Willman. He declined to say what injury the horse suffered. Kochees' trainer and owner, Jerry Hollendorfer, declined to comment when reached by CNN on Sunday. In a statement, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said, ""Santa Anita and all California tracks must suspend racing until the ongoing investigation by the district attorney is complete and the new rules have been strengthened."" Read More PETA and the non-profit Social Compassion in Legislation are working with the Stronach Group, owners of the racetrack in Arcadia, to enact laws and regulations to stop the deaths, PETA said. In mid-March, the park implemented stringent protocols after the deaths of the first 22 horses and suspended racing and training for a time. Two days after racing resumed in late March, a 23rd horse died. More than two dozen horses have died at Santa Anita Park since December. An injured 3-year-old was euthanized The previous death at Santa Anita came last Monday. A 3-year-old thoroughbred named Spectacular Music was euthanized a day after suffering a rare pelvis injury during a race, according to the park. People connected with the park have said they believe rain from Southern California's wettest winter in almost a decade has been a factor in the deaths. In March, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office assigned investigators to look into the horse deaths. Santa Anita's racing season ends June 23."
Amy Klobuchar says John McCain 'kept reciting' dictator names during Donald Trump's inauguration - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,"Paul LeBlanc, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/politics/john-mccain-dictators-klobuchar-trump-inauguration/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar on Saturday told a crowd of voters in Iowa that late Arizona Sen. John McCain ""kept reciting"" the names of dictators to her during President Donald Trump's inauguration speech in January 2017.
""John McCain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech,"" the Minnesota senator said, ""because he knew more than any of what we were facing as a nation, he understood it.""

China and the United States face off in Djibouti,edition.cnn.com,Arwa Damon,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/africa/china-belt-road-initiative-djibouti-intl/index.html,"Djibouti (CNN) A dirt track at Djibouti's Doraleh Port leads to a series of unassuming single-story buildings that, earlier this year, hosted the world's two superpowers.
The Chinese contingent took their seats to the far right of the podium where US Rear Adm. Heidi Berg formally launched the US-led military exercise, Cutlass Express. Cutlass, and the handful of other annual US-led drills held throughout the African continent, are a low-risk and relatively low-cost way for US Africa Command (AFRICOM) to gain and keep regional allies. But in Djibouti -- a tiny nation of just 884,000 people that is a key Red Sea ally of the US -- and throughout Africa, there's new competition for local loyalties from China's military, which is increasingly asserting its influence on the continent. In 2017, China's People Liberation Army (PLA) opened its first overseas base in Djibouti. The sprawling, gray concrete complex sits on a prime location next to one of Djibouti's main ports -- and is just a 15-minute drive from the US military's only permanent base on the continent, Camp Lemonnier. The Chinese contingent takes their seats as US Rear Adm. Heidi Berg takes to the podium to formally launch the US-led military exercise, Cutlass Express. Read More Lemonnier is a strategic asset for US missions abroad, used as a staging area for America's intelligence and counterterrorism operations on the African continent and beyond. One AFRICOM official, who was authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity, says the physical PLA presence in Africa is becoming a long-term strategic concern for America. ""They (China) have upped their game, in plain language, and ultimately they are offering things that our partners want, that our partners need,"" said the AFRICOM official. ""In places, we have concerns we are being out-competed."" On the ground, however, both sides are engaged in respectful diplomacy. The night before the Cutlass Express, Chinese military officials invited Adm. Berg and her contingent on board a Chinese destroyer docked at the nearby harbor. And, for the first time, Berg welcomed PLA commander Liang Yang to the exercise's opening ceremony. When Berg was asked to comment on the ""us or them"" narrative, she was quick to refocus attention on what the US can do for its allies. ""I think we want to ensure that we don't frame it ... that Africa is a backdrop and an arena for us to score points off China,"" Berg said. ""We are here and our investment and focus is on building our African partners."" The Chinese contingent at the Cutlass Express launch declined to comment to CNN, but President Xi Jinping made it clear at a high-level summit in Beijing last September that he's pursuing a ""comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership"" with Africa, which includes a $60 billion package of aid, investment and loans to Africa. ""We are about to set out on a new journey in history,"" he said. Expanding in Africa China has been expanding its military ties in Africa for years, through extended peacekeeping missions, military personnel training and the China-Africa Peace and Security Initiative forum. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in 2017 that the Djibouti base was part of ongoing efforts to help bring peace and security to the region. ""The completion and operation of the base will help China better fulfill its international obligations in conducting escorting missions and humanitarian assistance ... It will also help promote economic and social development in Djibouti,"" he said. The US, naturally, viewed the base with unease, given its proximity to Camp Lemonnier and Djibouti's main container port, which is the primary source of supplies to sustain a force of around 4,000 US personnel on the base. ""It's no secret that roughly 98% of the logistics support for Djibouti, as well as Somalia and East Africa, come through that port,"" AFRICOM's commanding Gen. Thomas Waldhauser told a recent Senate committee briefing. ""That port is one of five entities in the overall Djiboutian port. And so, our access there is necessary and required."" The USS Chung-Hoon leaves Djibouti on its way back to its home port. The destroyer took part in this year's Cutlass Express exercise. The loss of that access would be a devastating blow to American interests and operations. One way that could happen would be if China were to leverage its control over Djibouti's debt into control over Djibouti's ports. China holds around 80% of the country's debt. ""Perhaps the (Chinese) base would look hawkish or something suspicious or (like it is) something to fear, but Turkey has bases in the region, UAE has bases, Saudi Arabia wants a base, Japan has a base,"" said Wake Forest University assistant professor Lina Benabdallah, whose research focuses on China-Africa relations. She said the Chinese base has riled the US because of a growing rhetoric of ""fear."" ""The lack of trust between Washington and Beijing is really spreading, and it's taken a global dimension,"" added Benabdallah. Debt fears In recent years, China has increased its decades-long military ties with African countries by expanding training programs and increasing weapon sales. It's now the number two arms supplier to sub-Saharan Africa after Russia and the number three supplier to North Africa, behind Russia and the US, according to research from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But at the heart of the US concern is China's lending practices on the continent. Since 2000, African countries have borrowed about $130 billion from China, according to a Johns Hopkins analysis. And the amount of loans has tripled since 2012, largely through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). A legacy of lunacy haunts Kenya's old railway. Will China's $3.6B line be different? ""This is a central preset to Chinese strategy. When you look through history you preemptively shape the environment, shape the potential battlefield, so that your adversaries decide to not even come out on to the field to begin with. There's real potential for the debt to do that,"" said Gabriel Collins, co-founder of research group, China SignPost. Last year, US national security advisor John Bolton was blunt. During a Heritage Foundation speech that laid out the Trump administration's Africa policy, he claimed ""China uses bribes, opaque agreements, and strategic use of debt to hold African states captive to Beijing's demands."" But Bolton's rhetoric only makes combating the perceived threat more difficult, said Collins. ""When your whole premise is America first, I think it's too narrow of a view,"" he said. ""We need to realize that both the biggest challenges and the biggest opportunities in Africa occur in much more of a non-traditional security and development space."" 'We're going to decide our destiny' The US fears about losing access to the port could be rooted in history. In 2017, Sri Lanka surrendered a major port to China after defaulting on the Chinese loan. In that instance, the Sri Lankan government, then led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, took on $1.5 billion of Chinese debt to develop the Hambantota Port, which ultimately failed. To ease its debt burden, Sri Lanka agreed to hand it over on a 99-year lease. Djibouti's container port is key for US operations at Camp Lemonier. The base has no direct access to water. Proponents of China's BRI point out that the scheme often funds much-needed projects that other investors would balk at supporting, and that its focus on infrastructure, with a target investment of $1 trillion in construction is having an immediate impact on the continent. China's Foreign Ministry has stated repeatedly that its investments in Africa come with no political strings attached and it has repeatedly denied China is engaging in what's been referred to as ""debt-trap diplomacy."" Djiboutian officials insist the country will maintain control over its ports and that, so far, the government has a solid track record of paying off its loans. With Sri Lankan port acquisition, China adds another 'pearl' to its 'string' ""The funding is coming from China mainly, but we own the investments, we own the assets. It's a port, it's a railway, it's a free zone, we own two thirds of our investments,"" said the chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, Aboubaker Omar Hadi. But Hadi is also well aware of the risks of -- literally -- banking on China. He just returned from a trip to Asia and Europe to try to drum up investment. ""We don't want to depend only on one side, one continent, one country,"" he said. Hadi bristles at the notion that his country and others on the continent are caught in a superpower tug of war. ""The world needs to understand whether it's east or west or north or south, that we are going to decide our destiny ... Everyone is welcome,"" he said. The future The official position of the Djibouti government may do little to reassure skeptics who believe China's investment program is a front for a more sinister motive of establishing a military footprint worldwide. ""The theory is that if China continues unmitigated expansion, both militarily and economically, and we don't compete to protect our influence, the consequence could be that we are edged out of those areas and we lose the ability to address what we perceive as counterterrorism national interests in Africa,"" the AFRICOM official said. Countering China's economic might is hardly something that should fall on AFRICOM, said Wake Forest professor Benabdallah. ""China has been operating (in Africa) for the better part of two decades now and has been doing so in a very smart way, with really close networks and connections that have been in the work for several years,"" she said. Camp Lemonier is home to around 4,000 US military personnel. The base is a strategic asset for US missions abroad, used as a staging area for America's intelligence and counter terrorism operations on the African continent and beyond. Benabdallah added that much of China's expansion in Africa is the result of strategic dedication led by Xi. The Chinese President has made six trips to the continent, and since January 1990, the Chinese foreign minister's first trip every year has been to a country in Africa. Collins, founder of China SignPost, said soft power has long been a distinguishing feature of US foreign policy, and the current administration would be best served by taking a multilateral approach to relations in Africa. ""For the price of a single drone or fighter jet you could establish multiple university branches, and you would still have the funds to support those over the long haul,"" he said. ""It's not an instant payoff for someone who has the impatience of some of our current administration, but if we took a root cause strategy, 10 years from now there would be enormous dividends from that."" But until the US can figure out an ""all of government"" approach, some believe that much of the responsibility continues to land on AFRICOM's shoulders. ""We have gone from a unipolar world to realizing at best it's bipolar, at worst it's multipolar,"" the AFRICOM official said. ""I would have a stark perspective. I think we are losing -- in Africa we are losing."""
Inspiring photo shows college grad standing in the fruit fields where her immigrant parents work,edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/graduation-photo-honors-immigrant-parents-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Erica Alfaro says she never forgot the advice her mom gave her when the two worked long hours together in California's Central Valley tomato fields.
""One day, I was very tired and told my mom and she said to me, 'This is how life is going to be from now on. The only people who don't have to go through this get an education.' Those words stuck with me,"" Alfaro, 29, told CNN on Saturday. Those wise words inspired Alfaro, who dropped out of high school when she got pregnant at 15, to dive back into education. On May 19, Alfaro graduated from San Diego State University with a master's degree in education, with a concentration in counseling. She decided to honor her parents in her graduation photos, standing in her cap and gown with her parents, in work clothes, in the middle of the fruit fields where her mother still works. ""With love I dedicate my master's to my parents. Their sacrifice to come to this country to give us a better future was well worth it,"" Alfaro said when she shared her graduation photos on her Facebook and Instagram accounts this month. Read More Growing up, Alfaro crossed the US-Mexico border for school Alfaro said her parents are farmers who were never able to go to school. Her mother, Teresa Herrera, 51, and father, Claudio Alfaro, 50, are from Oaxaca, Mexico, and speak Mixtec, an indigenous language of Mexico. Both migrated to the United States separately and met later. Erica Alfaro poses with her father, Claudio Alfaro. Erica Alfaro was born in Fresno, California, but raised in Tijuana as her parents moved back to Mexico in order for her mother to obtain a US residency. During her time in Tijuana, Alfaro would cross the border every day to go to school. When she turned 13, the family moved to Oceanside, California, with another family and 11 people shared a one-bedroom apartment. Alfaro said she, her brother and sister used to work with her parents in the fruit fields during their summer vacations. Alfaro overcame obstacles to earn her two degrees When she got pregnant at 15, she moved in with her boyfriend, who she says made her sleep outside with the baby months after giving birth. She moved back in with her parents. Alfaro credits her mother's advice on education as her inspiration for going back to school. At 17, she enrolled in a homeschool program in Fresno. Erica Alfaro poses with her mother, Teresa Herrera. She was accepted at California State University San Marcos, but during her first semester, in 2012, her son was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Alfaro's grades suffered, but she kept going, determined to give her and her son a better life -- the life her parents worked hard to give her. ""It took me almost six years to get my bachelor's degree,"" Alfaro said. Alfaro earned her degree in psychology from the university in 2017. She was selected to be the commencement speaker at the graduation ceremony. ""The reason I share my story is because I want to encourage undocumented single mothers, and people who suffer from domestic violence, to get an education and achieve their goals,"" Alfaro said. She said she hopes posting her graduation photos in the fruit fields will inspire others in the Latino community who are facing similar struggles. ""These photos represent many of us,"" she said. ""Our parents came to this country to give us a better life and we wouldn't be here without them."" Alfaro said her main goal now is to be a school counselor. She said she hopes to encourage underrepresented students to continue their education. She also wants to work with domestic violence victims and teenage mothers."
Maui shark attack kills man swimming - CNN,www.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/maui-shark-attack/index.html,"(CNN) A shark attack killed a 65-year-old man as he was swimming off the coast of Maui Saturday morning, according to authorities.
The man, who was from California, encountered the shark about 60 yards off of Kaanapali Beach at around 8:30 a.m. local time, Dan Dennison, a spokesman for Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources, told CNN. As a matter of protocol, authorities have posted signs along a half-mile stretch beach warning people of a shark, Dennison said. The man's identity has not been released. An incident report from the County of Maui Department of Fire and Public Safety -- obtained by CNN affiliate KHON -- says his family told authorities he had gone for a swim. The report indicates the man was unresponsive and that first responders performed CPR after bringing him ashore. Signs have been posted along the beach warning people to be wary of sharks. Read More Dennison told CNN it was the first shark attack off of Maui this year. But it's at least the third attack in the state in 2019. In April, another 65-year-old tourist from California was attacked off the island of Hawaii, and authorities had to close Hanalei Bay on the north shore of Kaua'i after a shark attacked a surfer in February.

"As populists falter, Europe is sent a mixed message",edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Luke McGee,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/european-elections-a-mixed-message-for-europe-analysis-luke-mcgee-intl/index.html,"Luke McGee is a senior producer at CNN, based in London.
London (CNN) If nothing else, Europe's fractured voters have made one thing clear -- they want things to change.
On Monday morning, as results for the European parliamentary elections rolled in , it emerged that millions of voters had abandoned the traditional parties which have dominated Europe's institutions for decades. Instead, they flocked to smaller groups like the Greens, the nationalists and the liberals. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition was soundly beaten, with the Greens scoring an astonishing second place. In France, Emmanuel Macron -- a leader who has repeatedly pitched himself as the man to take Europe forward -- was edged into second place by the nationalist Marine Le Pen. In the UK, support for the big two traditional parties, the Conservative Party and Labour, collapsed in favor of Nigel Farage's pro-Brexit party on one side, and a variety of anti-Brexit parties on the other. In Italy and Hungary, hardline populists triumphed. Across Europe, turnout was projected to be above 50% -- a 25-year record. Macron's pro-EU centrists will join a bloc of liberals -- set to be the third largest group in the Parliament -- that will soon wield enough power to dictate its vision of Europe to others. Predictions that nationalist politicians would become a dominant force inside the European Union have faded. Read More However, while these results are good news for those wanting to keep the EU alive, they are bad news for the political groups currently dominating Brussels. The Greens and liberals do not sing from the same hymn sheet as the two parties that have dominated European politics for so long -- the center-right European People's Party (EPP) and center-left European Socialists (S&D). Like many Euroskeptics, Green and liberal parties also want to reform and renew Europe. As Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal group in the European Parliament recently told CNN : ""We need a different union because this union will not survive the 21st century."" And although the nationalists and populists didn't perform as well as expected, their success is significant enough that it cannot be ignored. In Italy and France, two nations considered to be central to the EU's history, nationalists won. Far-right National Party leader Marine le Pen speaks to supporters at the party's campaign headquarters in Paris on Sunday, May 26. In Italy, the far-right League, which is led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, finished a comfortable first. His success was matched in France, with Le Pen's National Rally estimated to have picked up 23.53% of the vote. And in Hungary, the populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban is celebrating a resounding victory, projected to be as high as 52%. In the run up to the election, Salvini had publicly talked of his plan to build a pan-European right-wing alliance with the aim of reforming the EU on his terms, rather than copying the Brits and leaving. It remains unclear exactly how many MEPs he will be able to attract, but as things stand, Salvini's fellow travelers have not performed well enough for his dream to come true. Europe has spent the best part of a decade dealing with populist surges on the radical left and the radical right. It has been a headache for EPP and S&D, who have gone toe-to-toe with populists with varying success. That headache reached its apex on Sunday, as the EPP and S&D's grand coalition fell apart. Europe's voters have spoken, but not with a single voice. The turnout of 50.95% across the EU was the highest since 1994, but the only clear message for Brussels is that Europe must reform if it is to survive. What that reform looks like is the next big battle to come. The Parliament works by MEPs from different countries sitting in like-minded groups. Over the coming weeks, that horse-trading for power, as MEPs decide with whom they will sit, becomes crucial to the continent's future. It's no secret that European politics is badly fragmented. These election results -- and the challenge they pose to building any kind of consensus -- accurately reflect the extreme divisions not only between the 28 EU member states, but the divisions within those nations. So, it's a mixed message for Europe. How the leaders choose to interpret these results will have an immediate impact on key decisions that need to be made. The European Commission needs a new president, as does the European Parliament. The new makeup of Europe and the decisions that are made off the back of these confusing results will have an enormous influence on both.

Here's what you need to know about Brexit 03:09 And although Brexit has been off the agenda for a little while now, Europe could have another big decision to make on October 31, the date that the UK's current Brexit extension runs out. In the UK, where turnout was 37%, Brexit backlash finally whacked the two main parties. The governing Conservatives have taken a hammering from Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party, while opposition Labour has been punished for not backing a second referendum. Both parties will have to make hard choices and consider shifting to either extreme end of the Brexit debate. ""There's a huge message here. Massive message here. The Labour and Conservative parties could learn a huge lesson tonight but I don't suppose they actually will,"" Farage said from Southampton, shortly after the vote. Europe is stuck at a crossroads. The path forward seems foggier than ever, as European citizens seem unable to agree on very much of anything. The leaders of Europe can no longer afford to be complacent. What these results show is that there is a leadership vacuum to be filled. The fight to do so will not be pretty."
Championship play-off final: World's most lucrative match worth at least $215 million,edition.cnn.com,"Ben Church, CNN Sport",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/football/championship-playoff-final-richest-match-aston-villa-derby-deloitte-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) It may not be the most famous nor the most prestigious, but the English Championship play-off final is the world's most lucrative soccer match to win.
With a place in the English Premier League at stake, both Derby County and Aston Villa are set for a nervy meeting at London's Wembley Stadium on Monday -- with the winner cashing in on an eye-watering jackpot. According to analysis from Deloitte's Sports Business Group , the winner will enjoy a financial boost of at least $215 million (£170m) through a combination of broadcasting and commercial revenue across the next three seasons. That figure will rise to a minimum of $381 million (£300m) if whichever team is promoted avoids instant relegation in its first season. Aston Villa lost the play-off final to Fulham last year, but the London club has since been relegated after just one season in the top flight. Read More Meanwhile Derby, managed by former Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, is targeting a first return to the EPL after suffering relegation in 2008. Fulham won last season's Championship play-off final but was relegated after one season in the EPL. READ: 'Should we provide F16s?' Azerbaijan says it has done everything to protect Mkhitaryan High stakes The Championship play-off final is a match held at the end of every season and decides the third team to be promoted into the EPL. The two teams that finish top of the Championship, English soccer's second division, are promoted automatically, but the teams that finish between third and sixth in the table battle it out for the final place. The winner is promoted and enjoys a share of the lucrative Premier League spoils, whilst the loser must play another season in the second division. ""Promotion to the Premier League provides clubs with the financial resources to make strategic investments both on and off the pitch,"" said Sam Boor, senior manager at Deloitte's Sports Business Group. ""And given the relatively equal distribution of revenue amongst Premier League clubs, it provides promoted clubs with a chance to avoid relegation when they get there."" However, even if Monday's winner is relegated after one season in the EPL, it will still receive parachute payments worth $95 million (£75m) over the following two years.

However, given four of the last five play-off champions have been relegated after just one season, there is certainly no magic formula. Marcelo Bielsa: From spying scandal to earning plaudits for sportsmanship Sports lawyer Daniel Geey says splashing cash on new players, whilst tempting, is not necessarily the best investment. ""It's a lot more nuanced than that. Some will spend on youth infrastructure because they believe in the longer term that it may be of benefit,"" he told CNN Sport's Alex Thomas. ""Some will spend more on players, some are spending huge amounts on data analytic teams to find those hidden gems."" ""In order to excel in the Premier League, because of the standard and purchasing strength of the higher EPL teams, you need to be able to compete on and off the pitch.""

READ: FIFA Secretary General -- Players should 'step out of the field' if racially abused Bigger than the UCL final Whilst the UEFA Champions League is arguably the ultimate prize in club soccer, it cannot compete with the Championship play-off final in terms of guaranteed financial gain, according to Deloitte. Both teams in this year's UCL final, Tottenham and Liverpool, have already qualified for next season's prestigious tournament and will only receive a relatively small bonus of $8.3 million (£6.6m) if it wins. Former Chelsea teammates Frank Lampard and John Terry will be on opposing sides Monday. Made in Chelsea As well as the huge windfall awaiting the winner, this year's play-off final involves an interesting subplot. Derby manager Lampard will go head-to-head with former teammate and fellow Chelsea great John Terry. The retired center-back has been Aston Villa's assistant head coach since October 2018, after playing a solitary season for the Villans following his departure from Chelsea. The two former England internationals were fundamental in the meteoric rise of Chelsea during the Roman Abramovich era.

Trump meets Japanese Emperor as he begins business portion of state visit - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kevin Liptak,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/politics/trump-japan-visit/index.html,"Tokyo (CNN) President Donald Trump refused to back away from his positive assessment of North Korea on Monday, saying he wasn't ""personally bothered"" by the regime's recent short-range missile tests despite the contradictory views of his Japanese hosts and his own national security adviser.
It was a notable break in the aggressive display of camaraderie that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe orchestrated for Trump during his state visit in Tokyo, which began with golf and a sumo tournament and continued Monday with a formal visit to Japan's new Emperor and empress. The show of unity was meant to solidify the US-Japan alliance -- and at a press conference Monday, Abe insisted he and Trump were exactly aligned on the threat from Pyongyang. Donald Trump greets Shinzo Abe at Tokyo's Akasake Palace on Monday. Yet moments later, Trump's answer to a question about the missile tests revealed a different reality. He said he did not believe the short-range launches violated United Nations resolutions -- the view held by Japan. ""My people think it could have been a violation, as you know. I view it differently,"" Trump said. ""I view it as a man, perhaps he wants to get attention, and perhaps not. Who knows? It doesn't matter."" Read More By ""his people,"" Trump was referring to his national security adviser John Bolton, who told reporters in a briefing over the weekend that the missile tests did violate UN resolutions . Trump has grown agitated with his hawkish adviser in recent weeks, chafing at the impression he's being led toward war in Iran and Venezuela by an underling. Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Saturday that North Korea's weapons tests this month violated UN resolutions Still, when asked by CNN's Pamela Brown as he departed the press conference, Trump said he had confidence in Bolton. The President said he was willing to give Kim more opportunities to strike an agreement on abandoning his country's nuclear program. And he did not back away from his assessment, made earlier on Twitter, that North Korea was correct in questioning former vice president Joe Biden's intelligence. ""Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low IQ individual . He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that,"" Trump said, another startling example of the US President siding with the violent authoritarian and swiping at his political rivals -- this time on foreign soil. His answers on North Korea came minutes after hearing from family members of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea decades ago. Abe has promised to press their case with Kim during his own summit meeting, and said Trump vowed to help arrange that encounter during their talks. Trade tensions Part of the reason Abe is so intent on securing a friend in Trump is Japan's reliance on the US in security matters -- particularly North Korea. Japan views any missile test as a threat, and Abe has made that case in more than 40 phone calls and meetings over the past two years. Yet on North Korea and trade issues, the payoff for Abe's efforts has sometimes been difficult to discern. Trump this week maintained a bullish stance on reorienting the US trade relationship with Japan, insisting the $68 billion trade deficit be reduced. He's ignored Abe's pleas to remove tariffs on steel and aluminum, though he did delay new auto tariffs for six months while a deal is worked out. He said this week that real work on a new trade agreement would not begin until after Japanese parliamentary elections in July, and added on Monday that an announcement would likely be made in August. He sounded less optimistic on a trade accord with China, which remains in a tit-for-tat tariff war with the US after talks broke down earlier this month. ""We're not ready to make a deal,"" Trump said in Tokyo, before casting an optimistic view of an eventual resolution. ""I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future,"" Trump said Royal Pageantry This week's state visit was meant as an extension of Trump and Abe's friendship, coming with the trappings of ceremony that Trump is known to relish. After a day of casual diplomatic male bonding -- which including golf, sumo and a hibachi dinner -- Monday's events were more stately and formal. Sumo, golf and barbeque: Trump and Abe bond after a tweet underscored divides In a sunny outdoor ceremony at the Imperial Palace, Trump shook hands with Emperor Naruhito and his wife, engaging warmly as he became the first foreign leader to meet the new monarch . ""How are you? Thank you very much,"" Trump mouthed as he approached the Emperor and empress, who were both educated at Western universities and speak English. Later, Trump stood alone on a podium to review a cordon of Japanese troops and greeted yellow-hatted children waving flags -- an honor in keeping with the royal family's traditions. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are escorted by Emperor Naruhito and empress Masako during a welcome ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on Monday. The White House said the two couples exchanged gifts: a viola and sheet music from Trump to the Emperor, who plays the instrument, and a desk set carved from a tree in Harvard Yard for the empress, who went to school there. Emperor Naruhito assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier this month. Oxford-educated with an academic interest in waterways, the 59-year-old is ushering in the Reiwa era in Japan, a historic moment for the world's oldest monarchy. The US-drafted Japanese constitution stripped the Japanese emperor of any political power after World War II. But the monarch holds a powerful symbolic role in a country deeply rooted in tradition. Japan's new Emperor Naruhito ascends throne as Reiwa era begins President Barack Obama drew criticism when he performed a deep bow to Emperor Akihito, a show of deference his political opponents decried as unseemly for a US leader. When Trump met Akihito in 2017, he offered a nod and a handshake instead -- and he repeated that Monday as he greeted Akihito's son. It's customary for Japanese guests not to touch the royal couple, but the practice is common for visiting foreign leaders. Unlike other royal families, the Japanese emperor can only be a man. When female members of the royal family get married, they are forced to give up their titles and become commoners. Naruhito's wife, Empress Masako, began a career as a diplomat before marrying into the royal family. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump participate in a welcome ceremony with Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on Monday."

He sounded less optimistic on a trade accord with China, which remains in a tit-for-tat tariff war with the US after talks broke down earlier this month. ""We're not ready to make a deal,"" Trump said in Tokyo, before casting an optimistic view of an eventual resolution. ""I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future,"" Trump said Royal Pageantry This week's state visit was meant as an extension of Trump and Abe's friendship, coming with the trappings of ceremony that Trump is known to relish. After a day of casual diplomatic male bonding -- which including golf, sumo and a hibachi dinner -- Monday's events were more stately and formal. Sumo, golf and barbeque: Trump and Abe bond after a tweet underscored divides In a sunny outdoor ceremony at the Imperial Palace, Trump shook hands with Emperor Naruhito and his wife, engaging warmly as he became the first foreign leader to meet the new monarch . ""How are you? Thank you very much,"" Trump mouthed as he approached the Emperor and empress, who were both educated at Western universities and speak English. Later, Trump stood alone on a podium to review a cordon of Japanese troops and greeted yellow-hatted children waving flags -- an honor in keeping with the royal family's traditions. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are escorted by Emperor Naruhito and empress Masako during a welcome ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on Monday. The White House said the two couples exchanged gifts: a viola and sheet music from Trump to the Emperor, who plays the instrument, and a desk set carved from a tree in Harvard Yard for the empress, who went to school there. Emperor Naruhito assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier this month. Oxford-educated with an academic interest in waterways, the 59-year-old is ushering in the Reiwa era in Japan, a historic moment for the world's oldest monarchy. The US-drafted Japanese constitution stripped the Japanese emperor of any political power after World War II. But the monarch holds a powerful symbolic role in a country deeply rooted in tradition. Japan's new Emperor Naruhito ascends throne as Reiwa era begins President Barack Obama drew criticism when he performed a deep bow to Emperor Akihito, a show of deference his political opponents decried as unseemly for a US leader. When Trump met Akihito in 2017, he offered a nod and a handshake instead -- and he repeated that Monday as he greeted Akihito's son. It's customary for Japanese guests not to touch the royal couple, but the practice is common for visiting foreign leaders. Unlike other royal families, the Japanese emperor can only be a man. When female members of the royal family get married, they are forced to give up their titles and become commoners. Naruhito's wife, Empress Masako, began a career as a diplomat before marrying into the royal family.

A 26th race horse dies at Santa Anita Park - CNN,us.cnn.com,Hollie Silverman,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/santa-anita-park-horse-deaths/index.html,"(CNN) A horse died Sunday at Santa Anita Park in California after sustaining an injury in a race, a racetrack spokesman said.
The horse, named Kochees, is the 26th horse to die at Santa Anita since December. Kochees was injured during his sixth race on Saturday, according to the spokesman, Mike Willman. He declined to say what injury the horse suffered. Kochees' trainer and owner, Jerry Hollendorfer, declined to comment when reached by CNN on Sunday. In a statement, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said, ""Santa Anita and all California tracks must suspend racing until the ongoing investigation by the district attorney is complete and the new rules have been strengthened."" Read More PETA and the non-profit Social Compassion in Legislation are working with the Stronach Group, owners of the racetrack in Arcadia, to enact laws and regulations to stop the deaths, PETA said. In mid-March, the park implemented stringent protocols after the deaths of the first 22 horses and suspended racing and training for a time. Two days after racing resumed in late March, a 23rd horse died. More than two dozen horses have died at Santa Anita Park since December. An injured 3-year-old was euthanized The previous death at Santa Anita came last Monday. A 3-year-old thoroughbred named Spectacular Music was euthanized a day after suffering a rare pelvis injury during a race, according to the park. People connected with the park have said they believe rain from Southern California's wettest winter in almost a decade has been a factor in the deaths. In March, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office assigned investigators to look into the horse deaths. Santa Anita's racing season ends June 23."
Inspiring photo shows college grad standing in the fruit fields where her immigrant parents work - CNN,us.cnn.com,Amir Vera,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/graduation-photo-honors-immigrant-parents-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Erica Alfaro says she never forgot the advice her mom gave her when the two worked long hours together in California's Central Valley tomato fields.
""One day, I was very tired and told my mom and she said to me, 'This is how life is going to be from now on. The only people who don't have to go through this get an education.' Those words stuck with me,"" Alfaro, 29, told CNN on Saturday. Those wise words inspired Alfaro, who dropped out of high school when she got pregnant at 15, to dive back into education. On May 19, Alfaro graduated from San Diego State University with a master's degree in education, with a concentration in counseling. She decided to honor her parents in her graduation photos, standing in her cap and gown with her parents, in work clothes, in the middle of the fruit fields where her mother still works. ""With love I dedicate my master's to my parents. Their sacrifice to come to this country to give us a better future was well worth it,"" Alfaro said when she shared her graduation photos on her Facebook and Instagram accounts this month. Read More Growing up, Alfaro crossed the US-Mexico border for school Alfaro said her parents are farmers who were never able to go to school. Her mother, Teresa Herrera, 51, and father, Claudio Alfaro, 50, are from Oaxaca, Mexico, and speak Mixtec, an indigenous language of Mexico. Both migrated to the United States separately and met later. Erica Alfaro poses with her father, Claudio Alfaro. Erica Alfaro was born in Fresno, California, but raised in Tijuana as her parents moved back to Mexico in order for her mother to obtain a US residency. During her time in Tijuana, Alfaro would cross the border every day to go to school. When she turned 13, the family moved to Oceanside, California, with another family and 11 people shared a one-bedroom apartment. Alfaro said she, her brother and sister used to work with her parents in the fruit fields during their summer vacations. Alfaro overcame obstacles to earn her two degrees When she got pregnant at 15, she moved in with her boyfriend, who she says made her sleep outside with the baby months after giving birth. She moved back in with her parents. Alfaro credits her mother's advice on education as her inspiration for going back to school. At 17, she enrolled in a homeschool program in Fresno. Erica Alfaro poses with her mother, Teresa Herrera. She was accepted at California State University San Marcos, but during her first semester, in 2012, her son was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Alfaro's grades suffered, but she kept going, determined to give her and her son a better life -- the life her parents worked hard to give her. ""It took me almost six years to get my bachelor's degree,"" Alfaro said. Alfaro earned her degree in psychology from the university in 2017. She was selected to be the commencement speaker at the graduation ceremony. ""The reason I share my story is because I want to encourage undocumented single mothers, and people who suffer from domestic violence, to get an education and achieve their goals,"" Alfaro said. She said she hopes posting her graduation photos in the fruit fields will inspire others in the Latino community who are facing similar struggles. ""These photos represent many of us,"" she said. ""Our parents came to this country to give us a better life and we wouldn't be here without them."" Alfaro said her main goal now is to be a school counselor. She said she hopes to encourage underrepresented students to continue their education. She also wants to work with domestic violence victims and teenage mothers."
China and the United States face off in Djibouti,us.cnn.com,Arwa Damon,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/africa/china-belt-road-initiative-djibouti-intl/index.html,"Djibouti (CNN) A dirt track at Djibouti's Doraleh Port leads to a series of unassuming single-story buildings that, earlier this year, hosted the world's two superpowers.
The Chinese contingent took their seats to the far right of the podium where US Rear Adm. Heidi Berg formally launched the US-led military exercise, Cutlass Express. Cutlass, and the handful of other annual US-led drills held throughout the African continent, are a low-risk and relatively low-cost way for US Africa Command (AFRICOM) to gain and keep regional allies. But in Djibouti -- a tiny nation of just 884,000 people that is a key Red Sea ally of the US -- and throughout Africa, there's new competition for local loyalties from China's military, which is increasingly asserting its influence on the continent. In 2017, China's People Liberation Army (PLA) opened its first overseas base in Djibouti. The sprawling, gray concrete complex sits on a prime location next to one of Djibouti's main ports -- and is just a 15-minute drive from the US military's only permanent base on the continent, Camp Lemonnier. The Chinese contingent takes their seats as US Rear Adm. Heidi Berg takes to the podium to formally launch the US-led military exercise, Cutlass Express. Read More Lemonnier is a strategic asset for US missions abroad, used as a staging area for America's intelligence and counterterrorism operations on the African continent and beyond. One AFRICOM official, who was authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity, says the physical PLA presence in Africa is becoming a long-term strategic concern for America. ""They (China) have upped their game, in plain language, and ultimately they are offering things that our partners want, that our partners need,"" said the AFRICOM official. ""In places, we have concerns we are being out-competed."" On the ground, however, both sides are engaged in respectful diplomacy. The night before the Cutlass Express, Chinese military officials invited Adm. Berg and her contingent on board a Chinese destroyer docked at the nearby harbor. And, for the first time, Berg welcomed PLA commander Liang Yang to the exercise's opening ceremony. When Berg was asked to comment on the ""us or them"" narrative, she was quick to refocus attention on what the US can do for its allies. ""I think we want to ensure that we don't frame it ... that Africa is a backdrop and an arena for us to score points off China,"" Berg said. ""We are here and our investment and focus is on building our African partners."" The Chinese contingent at the Cutlass Express launch declined to comment to CNN, but President Xi Jinping made it clear at a high-level summit in Beijing last September that he's pursuing a ""comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership"" with Africa, which includes a $60 billion package of aid, investment and loans to Africa. ""We are about to set out on a new journey in history,"" he said. Expanding in Africa China has been expanding its military ties in Africa for years, through extended peacekeeping missions, military personnel training and the China-Africa Peace and Security Initiative forum. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in 2017 that the Djibouti base was part of ongoing efforts to help bring peace and security to the region. ""The completion and operation of the base will help China better fulfill its international obligations in conducting escorting missions and humanitarian assistance ... It will also help promote economic and social development in Djibouti,"" he said. The US, naturally, viewed the base with unease, given its proximity to Camp Lemonnier and Djibouti's main container port, which is the primary source of supplies to sustain a force of around 4,000 US personnel on the base. ""It's no secret that roughly 98% of the logistics support for Djibouti, as well as Somalia and East Africa, come through that port,"" AFRICOM's commanding Gen. Thomas Waldhauser told a recent Senate committee briefing. ""That port is one of five entities in the overall Djiboutian port. And so, our access there is necessary and required."" The USS Chung-Hoon leaves Djibouti on its way back to its home port. The destroyer took part in this year's Cutlass Express exercise. The loss of that access would be a devastating blow to American interests and operations. One way that could happen would be if China were to leverage its control over Djibouti's debt into control over Djibouti's ports. China holds around 80% of the country's debt. ""Perhaps the (Chinese) base would look hawkish or something suspicious or (like it is) something to fear, but Turkey has bases in the region, UAE has bases, Saudi Arabia wants a base, Japan has a base,"" said Wake Forest University assistant professor Lina Benabdallah, whose research focuses on China-Africa relations. She said the Chinese base has riled the US because of a growing rhetoric of ""fear."" ""The lack of trust between Washington and Beijing is really spreading, and it's taken a global dimension,"" added Benabdallah. Debt fears In recent years, China has increased its decades-long military ties with African countries by expanding training programs and increasing weapon sales. It's now the number two arms supplier to sub-Saharan Africa after Russia and the number three supplier to North Africa, behind Russia and the US, according to research from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But at the heart of the US concern is China's lending practices on the continent. Since 2000, African countries have borrowed about $130 billion from China, according to a Johns Hopkins analysis. And the amount of loans has tripled since 2012, largely through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). A legacy of lunacy haunts Kenya's old railway. Will China's $3.6B line be different? ""This is a central preset to Chinese strategy. When you look through history you preemptively shape the environment, shape the potential battlefield, so that your adversaries decide to not even come out on to the field to begin with. There's real potential for the debt to do that,"" said Gabriel Collins, co-founder of research group, China SignPost. Last year, US national security advisor John Bolton was blunt. During a Heritage Foundation speech that laid out the Trump administration's Africa policy, he claimed ""China uses bribes, opaque agreements, and strategic use of debt to hold African states captive to Beijing's demands."" But Bolton's rhetoric only makes combating the perceived threat more difficult, said Collins. ""When your whole premise is America first, I think it's too narrow of a view,"" he said. ""We need to realize that both the biggest challenges and the biggest opportunities in Africa occur in much more of a non-traditional security and development space."" 'We're going to decide our destiny' The US fears about losing access to the port could be rooted in history. In 2017, Sri Lanka surrendered a major port to China after defaulting on the Chinese loan. In that instance, the Sri Lankan government, then led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, took on $1.5 billion of Chinese debt to develop the Hambantota Port, which ultimately failed. To ease its debt burden, Sri Lanka agreed to hand it over on a 99-year lease. Djibouti's container port is key for US operations at Camp Lemonier. The base has no direct access to water. Proponents of China's BRI point out that the scheme often funds much-needed projects that other investors would balk at supporting, and that its focus on infrastructure, with a target investment of $1 trillion in construction is having an immediate impact on the continent. China's Foreign Ministry has stated repeatedly that its investments in Africa come with no political strings attached and it has repeatedly denied China is engaging in what's been referred to as ""debt-trap diplomacy."" Djiboutian officials insist the country will maintain control over its ports and that, so far, the government has a solid track record of paying off its loans. With Sri Lankan port acquisition, China adds another 'pearl' to its 'string' ""The funding is coming from China mainly, but we own the investments, we own the assets. It's a port, it's a railway, it's a free zone, we own two thirds of our investments,"" said the chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, Aboubaker Omar Hadi. But Hadi is also well aware of the risks of -- literally -- banking on China. He just returned from a trip to Asia and Europe to try to drum up investment. ""We don't want to depend only on one side, one continent, one country,"" he said. Hadi bristles at the notion that his country and others on the continent are caught in a superpower tug of war. ""The world needs to understand whether it's east or west or north or south, that we are going to decide our destiny ... Everyone is welcome,"" he said. The future The official position of the Djibouti government may do little to reassure skeptics who believe China's investment program is a front for a more sinister motive of establishing a military footprint worldwide. ""The theory is that if China continues unmitigated expansion, both militarily and economically, and we don't compete to protect our influence, the consequence could be that we are edged out of those areas and we lose the ability to address what we perceive as counterterrorism national interests in Africa,"" the AFRICOM official said. Countering China's economic might is hardly something that should fall on AFRICOM, said Wake Forest professor Benabdallah. ""China has been operating (in Africa) for the better part of two decades now and has been doing so in a very smart way, with really close networks and connections that have been in the work for several years,"" she said. Camp Lemonier is home to around 4,000 US military personnel. The base is a strategic asset for US missions abroad, used as a staging area for America's intelligence and counter terrorism operations on the African continent and beyond. Benabdallah added that much of China's expansion in Africa is the result of strategic dedication led by Xi. The Chinese President has made six trips to the continent, and since January 1990, the Chinese foreign minister's first trip every year has been to a country in Africa. Collins, founder of China SignPost, said soft power has long been a distinguishing feature of US foreign policy, and the current administration would be best served by taking a multilateral approach to relations in Africa. ""For the price of a single drone or fighter jet you could establish multiple university branches, and you would still have the funds to support those over the long haul,"" he said. ""It's not an instant payoff for someone who has the impatience of some of our current administration, but if we took a root cause strategy, 10 years from now there would be enormous dividends from that."" But until the US can figure out an ""all of government"" approach, some believe that much of the responsibility continues to land on AFRICOM's shoulders. ""We have gone from a unipolar world to realizing at best it's bipolar, at worst it's multipolar,"" the AFRICOM official said. ""I would have a stark perspective. I think we are losing -- in Africa we are losing."""

"As populists falter, Europe is sent a mixed message",us.cnn.com,Analysis by Luke McGee,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/european-elections-a-mixed-message-for-europe-analysis-luke-mcgee-intl/index.html,"Luke McGee is a senior producer at CNN, based in London.
London (CNN) If nothing else, Europe's fractured voters have made one thing clear -- they want things to change.
On Monday morning, as results for the European parliamentary elections rolled in , it emerged that millions of voters had abandoned the traditional parties which have dominated Europe's institutions for decades. Instead, they flocked to smaller groups like the Greens, the nationalists and the liberals. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition was soundly beaten, with the Greens scoring an astonishing second place. In France, Emmanuel Macron -- a leader who has repeatedly pitched himself as the man to take Europe forward -- was edged into second place by the nationalist Marine Le Pen. In the UK, support for the big two traditional parties, the Conservative Party and Labour, collapsed in favor of Nigel Farage's pro-Brexit party on one side, and a variety of anti-Brexit parties on the other. In Italy and Hungary, hardline populists triumphed. Across Europe, turnout was projected to be above 50% -- a 25-year record. Macron's pro-EU centrists will join a bloc of liberals -- set to be the third largest group in the Parliament -- that will soon wield enough power to dictate its vision of Europe to others. Predictions that nationalist politicians would become a dominant force inside the European Union have faded. Read More However, while these results are good news for those wanting to keep the EU alive, they are bad news for the political groups currently dominating Brussels. The Greens and liberals do not sing from the same hymn sheet as the two parties that have dominated European politics for so long -- the center-right European People's Party (EPP) and center-left European Socialists (S&D). Like many Euroskeptics, Green and liberal parties also want to reform and renew Europe. As Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal group in the European Parliament recently told CNN : ""We need a different union because this union will not survive the 21st century."" And although the nationalists and populists didn't perform as well as expected, their success is significant enough that it cannot be ignored. In Italy and France, two nations considered to be central to the EU's history, nationalists won. Far-right National Party leader Marine le Pen speaks to supporters at the party's campaign headquarters in Paris on Sunday, May 26. In Italy, the far-right League, which is led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, finished a comfortable first. His success was matched in France, with Le Pen's National Rally estimated to have picked up 23.53% of the vote. And in Hungary, the populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban is celebrating a resounding victory, projected to be as high as 52%. In the run up to the election, Salvini had publicly talked of his plan to build a pan-European right-wing alliance with the aim of reforming the EU on his terms, rather than copying the Brits and leaving. It remains unclear exactly how many MEPs he will be able to attract, but as things stand, Salvini's fellow travelers have not performed well enough for his dream to come true. Europe has spent the best part of a decade dealing with populist surges on the radical left and the radical right. It has been a headache for EPP and S&D, who have gone toe-to-toe with populists with varying success. That headache reached its apex on Sunday, as the EPP and S&D's grand coalition fell apart. Europe's voters have spoken, but not with a single voice. The turnout of 50.95% across the EU was the highest since 1994, but the only clear message for Brussels is that Europe must reform if it is to survive. What that reform looks like is the next big battle to come. The Parliament works by MEPs from different countries sitting in like-minded groups. Over the coming weeks, that horse-trading for power, as MEPs decide with whom they will sit, becomes crucial to the continent's future. It's no secret that European politics is badly fragmented. These election results -- and the challenge they pose to building any kind of consensus -- accurately reflect the extreme divisions not only between the 28 EU member states, but the divisions within those nations. So, it's a mixed message for Europe. How the leaders choose to interpret these results will have an immediate impact on key decisions that need to be made. The European Commission needs a new president, as does the European Parliament. The new makeup of Europe and the decisions that are made off the back of these confusing results will have an enormous influence on both.

Here's what you need to know about Brexit 03:09 And although Brexit has been off the agenda for a little while now, Europe could have another big decision to make on October 31, the date that the UK's current Brexit extension runs out. In the UK, where turnout was 37%, Brexit backlash finally whacked the two main parties. The governing Conservatives have taken a hammering from Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party, while opposition Labour has been punished for not backing a second referendum. Both parties will have to make hard choices and consider shifting to either extreme end of the Brexit debate. ""There's a huge message here. Massive message here. The Labour and Conservative parties could learn a huge lesson tonight but I don't suppose they actually will,"" Farage said from Southampton, shortly after the vote. Europe is stuck at a crossroads. The path forward seems foggier than ever, as European citizens seem unable to agree on very much of anything. The leaders of Europe can no longer afford to be complacent. What these results show is that there is a leadership vacuum to be filled. The fight to do so will not be pretty."
A Korean War vet's family couldn't attend his funeral. So thousands of strangers turned up - CNN,www.cnn.com,Lauren M.

So thousands of strangers turned up By Lauren M. Johnson, CNN Updated 1:57 PM EDT, Sun May 26, 2019
(CNN) Thousands of people, some of whom drove hundreds of miles, packed the funeral of a Korean War veteran they'd never met when they heard his family couldn't come.
Hezekiah Perkins had prepared for the funeral more than 20 years ago. He'd prepaid for the ceremony and the burial, the funeral home said on its Facebook page.
But when the day finally came this week, Perkins' relatives couldn't make the trip to Cincinnati, Ohio, because of health issues. Thousands from the community came to pay their respects.
So, Spring Grove Funeral Home put out a plea to the community. The funeral home asked them to come fill the chairs to honor the legacy of a man who fought for the US Army in the Korean War in the 1950's.
""We had no idea what the response was going to be,"" said the funeral home's Director of Operations Skip Phelps.

"Food recall: If you're firing up the grill for the holiday weekend, avoid all these recalled items",us.cnn.com,AJ Willingham,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/health/memorial-day-recall-meat-hotdogs-flour/index.html,"(CNN) If you're planning on firing up the grill this Memorial Day weekend, you may want to double check your fridge and pantry before you get a very un-festive surprise.
Several items have been recalled for reasons ranging from possible E. coli contamination to metal fragments. Here are the recalled items: Flour The discount supermarket chain Aldi recalled 5-pound bags of its Baker's Corner All-Purpose Flour on Thursday because they may be contaminated with E. coli. Read More Seventeen people have been reported sick in eight states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Three of those people have been hospitalized. There have been no deaths. Flour sold at Aldi recalled Those who got sick ate, licked or tasted raw, homemade dough or batter. The CDC states that eating or tasting raw dough or batter can make a person sick. The illnesses began December 11, 2018 and the latest began April 18, the CDC said. The recalled flour was sold at Aldi locations in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. Steak, ribs and brisket The US Department of Agriculture issued a recall for more than 62,000 pounds of raw beef Wednesday due to E. coli concerns. The meat was shipped nationwide for distribution, and the products being recalled have the establishment number ""EST. 788"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. 62,000 pounds of raw meat are being recalled The recall includes more than 40 products, most of which are cuts of steak, like ribeyes, as well as ribs and brisket cuts. Read the full list of products being recalled. People sometimes like to freeze cuts of meat for future use, so if you've socked away some beef in your backup freezer recently, you may want to check that as well. The possible E. coli contamination was discovered after a random sampling, and the USDA says there have been no reported cases of illness related to this recall. People usually get sick two to eight days after ingesting the germ, the CDC says. Symptoms of E.coli infections include stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Some infections are mild, but others can be life-threatening. Hot dogs This follows an earlier recall this month of more than 2,000 pounds of Vienna Beef hot dogs over concerns they may contain metal fragments. Vienna Beef recalls hot dogs that might contain metal fragments In the latest recall, Chicago-style dogs were shipped to food service locations in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, according to the US Department of Agriculture. They were packaged in 10-pound cases of Skinless Beef Frankfurters with ""EST. 1"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. Produced May 2, the potentially contaminated products have been identified by the USDA online. The recall was limited to restaurants and had ""nothing to do with grocery store product,"" said Tom McGlade, vice president of marketing for the Chicago-based company. So far, there have been no reports of a health problem caused by eating these products. Anyone concerned about a possible injury or illness should contact a health care provider."

Poland rocked by documentary exposing church abuse - CNN,www.cnn.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/europe/poland-catholic-church-abuse-intl/index.html,"Polish priest blames 'devil' as he's confronted by alleged victim whose life was ruined By Antonia Mortensen, CNN Updated 8:02 PM EDT, Sun May 26, 2019
(CNN) ""Father, I wanted to look you in the eye ... I wanted to ask you why?"" demands Anna Misiewicz as she confronts the parish priest she says abused her when she was just 7 and 8 years old.
""You touched me where you were not supposed to, my private parts,"" Misiewicz says, matter-of-factly, telling him that his actions ""really scarred my adult life deeply.""
""I still have nightmares ... I am unable to sleep at night,"" she tells her alleged abuser. ""I still carry it inside me.""
The elderly man she is addressing exhales and shifts in his orange-and-brown-striped chair, as a religious service plays out on a TV nearby, in a home for retired priests in Kielce, central Poland.
The priest, identified only as Father Jan A., has never been charged with abuse. He pauses briefly, before saying: ""I should never have done it, I should not have touched or kissed you ... I know I shouldn't have.""
""I regret it profoundly,"" he says, insisting that he has reformed in the three decades since the alleged episode detailed by Misiewicz. ""It was the devil who took his toll.""
The pair's troubling meeting was captured on secretly filmed footage that is at the heart of ""Tell No One,"" a new documentary that has sent shockwaves through the Polish Catholic Church and wider society in the deeply religious nation.
Since its release on YouTube on May 11 the film, which details decades of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in Poland and shows victims confronting their alleged abusers, has been viewed more than 20 million times. 'Erosion' of Catholic Church
The Catholic Church -- and its priests -- enjoys a revered status and wields serious influence in Poland, where more than 90% of the country's population is registered as Catholic.
The Church has long held powerful ties to politics; together with the late Polish Pope John Paul II, it is widely hailed for its opposition to the Communist regime that collapsed in 1989.
Marcin Zaborowski, political analyst at Visegrad Insight, told CNN the Catholic Church has been ""fundamental"" to Polish society. ""The Church is part and parcel of Polish politics,"" he said.
""The current government will find it difficult to distance itself from the Catholic Church,"" Zaborowski added. Only a week before the film was released, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the conservative ruling Law and Justice Party, said: ""Anyone who raises his hand against the church, wants to destroy it, raises his hand against Poland."" After seeing the documentary, he clarified his remarks at a rally, saying: ""That does not mean that we support or tolerate pathology in the Church.""
But Zaborowski said the film ""could be a game changer,"" adding that it had ""started the erosion of the position of the Catholic Church in Poland.""
The case that's created the biggest outcry since the film's publication is that of Father Franciszek Cybula, the priest of Lech Walesa, leader of anti-Communist movement Solidarity in the 1980s.
Confronted on the doorstep of a small, white house in Gowidlino, a village in northern Poland, Cybula is accused of abusing a 12-year-old boy, decades earlier. Cybula, who is unaware he is being filmed, admits he touched the boy in a sexual manner but tries to downplay his actions.
""There was a moment of caressing and then we went back to our daily business,"" he says, arguing that ""it never exceeded any inappropriateness,"" and suggesting that the pair had ""fondled"" each other mutually. Cybula died before the documentary finished production.
Poland's prosecutor general has issued an investigation into the alleged crimes detailed in the film.
""Tell No One"" director Tomasz Sekielski told CNN he felt compelled to bring the sexual abuse to public attention after meeting several victims during his career as a journalist.
""The horror of their stories stayed with me, and I knew that I wanted to do something more on the subject; that's why my brother and I decided to make the film."" Alleged abuse carried out by the priest of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, pictured, has caused an outcry in Poland. Taboo subject in Poland
It was difficult to find traditional investors willing to back the film because of its polarizing subject, Sekielski said.
Ultimately, he and his brother raised more than $100,000 to shoot the documentary via crowdfunding websites.
Sekielski says the response to it has far exceeded their expectations: ""This film has been like a shock to Polish society and has managed to create real social awareness of a subject that has been very taboo in Poland.""
Sekielski says he does not know if Pope Francis has seen the film, which is available online with Spanish and English subtitles.
When CNN asked the Vatican if they had a comment on the film, they said they ""would look into it.""
In response to the film, the Vatican's ambassador to Poland, Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio, told CNN: ""The Pope is very concerned, and we express sympathy and solidarity.""
The Vatican has announced plans to send Malta's Archbishop Charles Scicluna, the Vatican's top sex crimes investigator, to Poland on June 13 to host a ""study day"" on abuse for Polish bishops on how to protect minors from abuse within the Church.
Archbishop Stanisław Gądecki, president of the Polish Bishops' Conference, said he had been ""deeply moved and saddened"" by the film.
""On behalf of the entire Bishops' Conference, I would like all the victims to accept my sincere apologies; I realize that nothing can compensate them for the harm they have suffered,"" he said in a statement, adding that the film would ""definitely contribute to an even more severe condemnation of pedophilia, for which there can be no place in the Church.""
Following the film's release, the Polish government proposed raising the maximum prison sentence for convicted pedophiles to 30 years.
But that's insufficient, says Polish foundation Have No Fear, which helps victims of child abuse committed by the Catholic Church. The organization worked with the Sekielski brothers, helping to find victims who were willing to participate in the film.
Anna Frankowska, a board member of the organization, told CNN it had been ""completely overwhelmed"" by the reaction to the film: ""It has generated a tsunami of calls from new victims to our charity.""
Since the film's release more than 100 new cases have come to light, according to the charity. ""On one hand it is wonderful, but on the other it is overwhelming as we do not have the resources to process all the cases,"" said Frankowska.
""The government increase in jail time is not an effective tool,"" she said, arguing that ""it is more symbolic than anything, the courts need to actually start implementing these harsh sentences."" Marek Lisinski as a teenager around the time he was allegedly abused by his local parish priest. 'Gesture gave me huge hope'
In February, representatives from Have No Fear delivered a report to Pope Francis in Rome, accusing 26 bishops in the Polish Catholic Church of concealing the perpetrators of sexual abuse of minors.
Marek Lisinski, a co-founder of Have No Fear, was one of those who met the Pontiff.
""The Pope took my hand in his hands and looked at me and ... grew sad. It had a huge impact on me. Then ... he kissed my hand. That gesture gave me huge hope,"" Lisinski said.
An abuse survivor himself, Lisinski told CNN how he had been groomed by a young vicar when he was a 13-year-old altar boy living in Poniatowo, in central Poland.
""It was in 1981 ... You must remember these were totally different times in Poland, there was a shortage of almost everything. But he had everything, sweets, food. It's important to understand what it meant in those days to get a sweet from someone,"" he said, explaining that ""times were tough.""
""He followed me into the toilet one day and started doing bad things to me,"" Lisinski said.
When he tried to tell his mother about the abuse -- on the same day that martial law was declared, in December 1981 -- he said she was ""more worried about the political situation in Poland rather than me.""
Lisinski said the sexual abuse ""really hurt my life"" and led him to become an alcoholic. Now sober, he now dedicates his time to helping other victims of abuse.
Have No Fear says it has yet to hear back from the Vatican about the report; its members are extremely frustrated at the way the Polish Catholic Church is dealing with what they see as a huge crisis in the country.
In March, Poland's Catholic Church released a long-awaited report on the numbers of sexual abuse cases there in the past 28 years -- the first time it has presented data on the scale of the problem.
According to data compiled by the church's statistics institute and child protection center, 382 clergymen were reported for sexual abuse involving 625 minors between January 1990 and June 2018. Of these 58.4% were male, while 41.6% were female; more than half of the victims were under the age of 15, the report said.
Have No Fear says the numbers do not tell the whole story; they want access to church documents detailing the nature of the abuse, and to find out what -- if any -- punishments the alleged abusers faced.
In the absence of those records, the accounts of victims like Anna Misiewicz, who are willing to speak up about the abuse they say they faced as children, are all-important in helping to raise awareness of the issue.
Standing outside the pretty wooden church she attended as a child, Misiewicz tells the filmmakers about the day of her first communion, pointing out where she stood alongside her alleged abuser for a photograph to mark the occasion.
Dressed all in white, with a lace headdress in her hair and a half-smile on her face, there is little trace of the turmoil she was going through but, she says, ""I was under great stress because ... as a little girl I feared the photo would show that there was 'something between us,' as teenagers say now.""
""He destroyed my life,"" Misiewicz says of her alleged abuser. ""For me he does not even deserve to be called a priest."" "
A 2-year-old boy was having trouble getting around. So employees at a Home Depot built him a walker - CNN,www.cnn.com,Lauren M. Johnson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/home-depot-gives-child-a-walker-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Imagine your child having a disorder that impacts his motor skills, such as walking. And imagine not knowing if your insurance would cover a basic item he needs to help him walk.
That's what Christian and Justin Moore were experiencing when they walked into a Home Depot in Cedartown, Georgia, on May 24. Their son Logan is 2 and has hypotonia, a syndrome that impacts his muscle tone and makes stability a struggle. His mom told CNN that Logan's physical therapist suggested a gait trainer to help him with walking, but they did not think insurance would cover it and wondered whether it would arrive in a reasonable time. So she and her husband turned to YouTube, where they found a tutorial to make one out of PVC pipe. Logan looks happy with his new walker. ""I found a video that looked pretty easy and got the list and took it to Home Depot to see if they had everything we needed,"" Christian Moore said. Read More When they arrived, she asked a store employee she knew if anyone could help them with the supply list. Christian said what happened next shocked her. She was met by a store manager and another employee who came to help. ""They started getting the parts together and told us they would put it together and would not charge us for it,"" she said. ""They told us to go get ice cream and come back in an hour."" When they returned the walker was finished and even included Logan's name. The store employees even put Logan's name on it. ""I couldn't believe they were willing to do that. It took everything I had not to cry because it hasn't been an easy road for my son. He has had a hard time doing things that would be easy for most children his age,"" Moore said. One of the men who helped make the walker, Jeff Anderson, posted about the experience on his Facebook page and said, ""Everyone was crying to see Logan walk around with the biggest smile on his face...Thank to all that help and for being a blessing to this family and to this little guy."" ""There are so many children out there with hypotonia, more than you would think,"" Christian Moore added. ""I am grateful to be able to share that there are still good people around to help."" "
Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill: Rubber stamp lets people put the abolitionist's face on currency,edition.cnn.com,"Taylor Romine and Mimi Hsin Hsuan Sun, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/tubman-money-stamp-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Supporters of an Obama-era plan to put abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill were disappointed last week by news that the Treasury Department has delayed the bill's redesign.
But artist Dano Wall decided not to wait for the Trump administration to honor the Underground Railroad hero. He has created a stamp that can be used to superimpose Tubman's image over President Andrew Jackson's portrait. Wall created the stamp in 2017 with the intent of getting Tubman on the bill as soon as possible. In February of that year, he gave about 100 stamps to his friends before opening an Etsy shop to sustain the costs. But the stamp has soared in popularity in the last week after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday during a House Financial Services Committee meeting that he hasn't made any decisions about the redesigning the bill. Mnuchin told the committee that decisions about the imagery on the $20 ""will not be an issue that comes up until most likely 2026."" Mnuchin's predecessor, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, announced in 2016 that the US would swap out Jackson, the slave-owning president whose legacy is synonymous with the Trail of Tears, with Tubman. Under Lew's plan, Tubman -- an escaped slave who would be the first black woman featured on official US currency -- would be on the face of the bill and Jackson moved from the front of the $20 to its back. Read More President Donald Trump previously slammed the move as ""pure political correctness."" And his administration has delayed plans to move forward with the redesign. ""My goal when I started making Tubman stamps was to get 5,000 made and into people's hands, as this seemed at the start like a goal of sufficient ambition as to put it almost out of reach, but not quite,"" Wall said. ""I now have over 6,000 people who've signed up to be notified when more stamps go into stock, so I will likely eventually pass that goal."" Wall has had more than 600 sales on Etsy , often with more than one stamp in each sale. He is currently out of stock but his instructions on how to make your own stamp have been downloaded more than 5,000 times. Two ""stamping stations"" in New York City are listed on his website. A video on the Tubman stamp website shows the stamped bills being accepted into a variety of different vending machines. ""I never thought it would take off in the way it has, but I'm very glad that so many people have responded to it with such passion,"" Wall said."
Gillette ad features transgender man shaving for the first time,edition.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/gillette-ad-transgender-man-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A man's first shave is a milestone no matter who you are. But for transgender man Samson Bonkeabantu Brown, it was memorable for several reasons.
Brown shared the experience with a man identified as his father in an advertisement for Gillette, the maker of razors and shaving supplies. The video, which Gillette shared on its Facebook page, shows the Toronto-based artist standing in front of a bathroom mirror as his father coaches him. ""Now, don't be scared,"" his father says. ""Shaving is about being confident."" ""Growing up, I was always trying to figure out what kind of man I wanted to become and I'm still trying to figure out what kind of man that I want to become,"" Brown said in the video, Read More ""I always knew I was different. I didn't know that there was a term for the type of person that I was."" CNN reached to Brown to find out if this was indeed his first shave, as the video implies. The video carries the caption, ""'Whenever, wherever, however it happens -- your first shave is special."" CNN also reached out to Gillette to confirm if this is the brand's first ad to feature a transgender man. Neither Brown nor Gillette responded immediately. Regardless of the details, many celebrated the ad as a meaningful gesture of inclusiveness to kick off pride celebrations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community in June. ""Oh wow, Gillette⁩, we are having all the feels here,"" LGBTQ family advocacy group PFLAG National said on Twitter. ""As the first and largest organization for parents of #LGBTQ people we thank you for seeing our #trans kids...and for honoring their affirming #dads!""

— PFLAG National (@PFLAG) May 25, 2019 In a Facebook post , Brown thanked Gillette for the opportunity to share the important milestone with his father. ""I shot this ad for Gillette and wanted to include my father, who has been one of my greatest supporters throughout my transition, encouraging me to be confident and live authentically as my best self,"" Brown said. As the news cycle brings a steady stream of negative headlines about violence and discrimination against the transgender community, the ad casts a rare positive light on a transgender man experiencing family support. ""I'm keenly aware of how blessed I am to be able to exist in this world being supported by my family in ways that all too often many of my trans brothers, sisters, and siblings who exist outside the binary are not always as fortunate,"" Brown said in his Facebook post. Brown says in the video that he's glad to be at a point where he's able to shave, a nod to the fact that for many transgender men, financial and medical barriers can impede access to medically necessary hormone treatment to align their appearance with their gender. In his Facebook post, Brown said he believes the ad will give other transgender people hope. ""I am confident that this ad will encourage many of my trans siblings and fill them with the knowledge that our existence in this world can be filled with the love and support we deserve."""

McLaughlin,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/teen-died-hospital-drug-charges-lawrence-massachusetts/index.html,"(CNN) A 47-year-old man who brought a 13-year-old to a Massachusetts hospital shortly before she died has been charged with giving the girl drugs, prosecutors said.
Carlos Rivera faces two counts of distribution of a Class B drug to a minor, two counts of indecent assault on a child younger than 14 and one count of indecent assault on a child older than 14, the Essex District Attorney's Office said in a Saturday news release. After police questioned him early Saturday, Rivera was arrested and is being held on a $750,000 bail. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Lawrence District Court on Tuesday, which CNN affiliate WHDH reports will take place hours before the girl's wake. The 13-year-old Amesbury girl, who was in the eighth grade, and another teenager, who prosecutors say is younger than 16, spent the evening of May 19 and most of the next day at Rivera's apartment in Lawrence. Accompanied by the other girl, Rivera brought the 13-year-old to Lawrence General Hospital on Monday around 4:47 p.m., and she died shortly afterward, prosecutors said. Read More The medical examiner has not yet determined a cause of death. It is not clear what drugs Rivera is accused of giving the teenagers, but Class B drugs include cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, methamphetamine and some powerful painkillers. Indecent assault in Massachusetts involves the touching of breasts, buttocks or genitals. Authorities did not say how or where Rivera met the girls. Amesbury is about 20 miles northeast of Lawrence. The girl's mother, Debi Goldsmith-Dolan, was desperate for answers. ""All you had to do if she was sick was call an ambulance. Do something to try to save her. You took away my world,"" she told CNN affiliate WBZ . Stepfather Brian Dolan told CNN affiliate WCVB that a hospital staffer told him that the girl had no pulse when she arrived at the emergency room. ""As soon as I heard that I was like, 'What? You got to be kidding,'"" he told the station. He told WCVB his stepdaughter was a ""great kid"" who had had some trouble coping with her father's death five years ago. ""She was pretty smart.

How a Utah assault case upended the website that caught the Golden State Killer,edition.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/genetic-genealogy-gedmatch-privacy/index.html,"(CNN) Curtis Rogers, the founder of the free DNA website GEDMatch, wanted to do all he could to help police solve a disturbing assault case out of Utah.
He knew his website, full of more than 1.2 million completed DNA kits, could help. After all, it had helped solve the so-called Golden State Killer case last April through a new forensic technique known as genetic genealogy. But there was one problem: GEDMatch's own terms of service didn't allow police to use the site for this Utah assault case. The terms assured users who submitted DNA kits that police would only use their information to solve violent crimes of murder and rape. But not assaults. Still, Rogers decided to make an exception in this case, given its severity, and help police. That exception led to an arrest in the case, yes, but it also sparked a fierce privacy backlash. And that criticism, in turn, led GEDMatch to make changes to the site that have sharply curtailed police ability to catch criminals. ""We can be sure there are hundreds of cases that would have been solved in the coming months or year that very well won't be now,"" CeCe Moore, a leading investigative genetic genealogist who worked on the Utah assault case, told CNN. Read More It started as a hobby. Now they're using DNA to help cops crack cold cases ""People will die,"" she added. ""It sounds dramatic but it's actually true."" The issue highlights the privacy concerns around home DNA technology and its use by police to solve cold cases, a field that has exploded since GEDMatch was used to catch the alleged Golden State Killer last year. With the technology, police work with genetic genealogists to put a suspect's DNA into GEDMatch in hopes of finding the suspect's family members. But that work will be more difficult on GEDMatch now. In the wake of the backlash, Rogers and his partner John Olson made it so that all GEDMatch users are automatically made to be unsearchable by law enforcement. Users can choose to opt-in to law enforcement searches if they consent, or they can remain unsearchable. Rogers, an 81-year-old genealogy hobbyist, said that was the best balance between helping police arrest criminals and protecting privacy rights. ""Certainly there was a short-term loss but I think this is going to make us stronger,"" he told CNN. ""Stronger ethically (and) stronger for support among people who put their information on our site. I think it's the right step to make."" The rise of GEDMatch in solving cases JUST WATCHED Tissue led to Golden State Killer case arrest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Tissue led to Golden State Killer case arrest 01:01 Led by companies like Ancestry and 23AndMe, direct-to-consumer DNA technology spread as a way to learn about one's family history by spitting into a tube. More than 1.2 million DNA kits have been uploaded to GEDMatch, a free website, by people who want to better learn about their genetics or connect with family members. The power of genetic genealogy in the hands of police was made clear when it was used to arrest Joseph James DeAngelo, an elderly ex-cop, as the Golden State Killer last April. Typically in these cases, police work with a trained genetic genealogist to put an unknown suspect's DNA into GEDMatch, which then produces a list of people related to the suspect. Genetic genealogists then build out a family tree from this information to try to identify possible people who fit the suspect profile, and police use those as leads. The technique has helped police identify serial killers, murderers and rapists from decades ago. Parabon NanoLabs, the DNA technology company leading the way in working with police, touted earlier this month that its genetic genealogy services have helped law enforcement solve 55 cases in the past year. Moore, chief genetic genealogist at Parabon, told CNN last year that GEDMatch was vital to this work. ""GEDMatch is absolutely the key, and had (the founders) decided that they didn't want law enforcement to use their database, we wouldn't have been able to do this,"" she told CNN at the time. A study released in October found that more than 60% of people with European ancestry can be identified by an anonymous DNA sample, simply by using data from consumer genetic databases. Utah assault case solved with milk container This fierce debate stems from an attack last November in Centerville, Utah. There, an unknown suspect broke into a locked church and strangled a 71-year-old woman who was alone practicing the organ, Centerville Police said . The woman survived but was left with a webbing of broken blood vessels in her neck, and her eyes were black and blue, according to an affidavit for a search warrant. The suspect had broken into the church by breaking a window, and detectives collected blood from the suspect left at the scene, the affidavit said. A cold case killing from 1972 was cracked with the help of genetic genealogy But that DNA had no matches in the FBI's national database, so the detectives contacted Parabon NanoLabs and Moore to take on the case, the warrant states. Moore said she initially declined to help because using GEDMatch to solve an assault case would violate the terms of service. The police detective then made a personal plea to Rogers to make an exception in this case because of its seriousness, and Rogers agreed. ""I felt people's lives were in danger,"" he explained. With Rogers' express permission, Moore and Parabon then carried out the genetic genealogy analysis through GEDMatch. The analysis found that a person's DNA kit on GEDMatch was likely a great uncle of the suspect, the affidavit said. That man had a nephew who lived in Centerville who had a 17-year-old son, so police began to investigate the teenager. On April 11, a high school resource officer collected the teen's used juice box and plastic milk container from the garbage, the affidavit said. DNA testing on the milk container proved to be an exact match for the suspect's DNA, the affidavit said. The 17-year-old, who was not named, was booked into Farmington Bay Juvenile Detention Center on first degree aggravated burglary and second degree aggravated assault, police said. Critics slam lack of informed consent When Judy G. Russell, a trained genealogist with a legal degree who writes on her website about legal issues in genealogy, learned that GEDMatch had broken the terms of service, she wrote a fiery post revoking her recommendation for GEDMatch. GEDMatch's founders ""made a decision, on their own, without consulting their users, to expose the data of those users to the police because the police made a compelling argument,"" she wrote . ""Now it may very well be that the vast majority of those users would have agreed with that decision — if they had been asked. But they weren't asked."" You might not be anonymous, thanks to genealogy databases She also said the site did not have the informed consent of its users to make an exception to the terms of service. ""Bottom line: nobody but nobody can give informed consent for someone else,"" Russell wrote . ""Nobody but nobody has the right to make decisions for DNA testers other than the DNA testers."" Blaine Bettinger, a professional genealogist specializing in DNA evidence and author of the book ""Genetic Genealogy in Practice,"" wrote that informed consent of the users was necessary for an ethical and trustworthy DNA database. ""We have a system in place that has spent the past 200-plus years in thousands of legal proceedings upholding the principal that the end does not justify the means if it exceeds the power of the government or erodes the privacy of the individual,"" Bettinger wrote on his blog ""The Genetic Genealogist."" However, Moore, who has appeared as an expert on the PBS show ""Finding Your Roots"" and is the chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, said this backlash was from a ""few very vocal influencers"" who blew this situation out of proportion. ""I know we can't trample on people's civil liberties, but I don't think this rose to this level of seriousness,"" said Moore. Users now must opt-in to law enforcement searches CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist who has appeared on PBS' ""Finding Your Roots,"" said the ability to solve new cases will be ""crippled"" by the changes to GEDMatch. Rogers said he was convinced he saved people's lives with the exception in the assault case. But in considering the thorny ethical issue -- and the possibility of a damaging lawsuit -- he decided to make it so that everyone would have to opt-in to being searched by police. ""We felt it was the right thing to do, the most ethical thing to do,"" he said. At the same time, GEDMatch updated its terms of service to say that police are now allowed to use its DNA database to solve all violent crimes, including non-negligent manslaughter, aggravated assault and robbery cases. ""We realized that our terms of service were too narrow. We have since expanded them so they basically are the same thing as FBI requirements for violent crimes,"" he said. ""We had to turn down other cases that were also violent crimes, but it was apparent that we really needed to expand somehow the terms of service."" GEDMatch was useful partly because so many people were already in the database. Moore said that the opt-in change has ""crippled"" her team's ability to use GEDMatch and catch these killers and rapists. ""This is shocking, it was so fast,"" Moore said. ""It was very much a rash decision in my opinion. (It was) not fully thought through."" For now, Parabon will continue to solve the cases in which they already completed the DNA analysis. But she said she was devastated for those families who might not get closure or who are still worried that a rapist or murderer won't be brought to justice. ""It's just incredibly sad for the victims, the families and society as a whole,"" she said. Rogers said he wishes he had given more warning before the sudden change to the terms of service. He said about 20,000 people have opted in to being searched by police, and he encouraged more people to do so. ""We're the good guys,"" he said. ""The bad guys are the murderers and rapists and other violent criminals out there. And hopefully we'll come back much stronger as a result of all this."""
China and the United States face off in Djibouti,www.cnn.com,"Arwa Damon and Brent Swails, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/africa/china-belt-road-initiative-djibouti-intl/index.html,"Djibouti (CNN) A dirt track at Djibouti's Doraleh Port leads to a series of unassuming single-story buildings that, earlier this year, hosted the world's two superpowers.
The Chinese contingent took their seats to the far right of the podium where US Rear Adm. Heidi Berg formally launched the US-led military exercise, Cutlass Express. Cutlass, and the handful of other annual US-led drills held throughout the African continent, are a low-risk and relatively low-cost way for US Africa Command (AFRICOM) to gain and keep regional allies. But in Djibouti -- a tiny nation of just 884,000 people that is a key Red Sea ally of the US -- and throughout Africa, there's new competition for local loyalties from China's military, which is increasingly asserting its influence on the continent. In 2017, China's People Liberation Army (PLA) opened its first overseas base in Djibouti. The sprawling, gray concrete complex sits on a prime location next to one of Djibouti's main ports -- and is just a 15-minute drive from the US military's only permanent base on the continent, Camp Lemonnier. The Chinese contingent takes their seats as US Rear Adm. Heidi Berg takes to the podium to formally launch the US-led military exercise, Cutlass Express. Read More Lemonnier is a strategic asset for US missions abroad, used as a staging area for America's intelligence and counterterrorism operations on the African continent and beyond. One AFRICOM official, who was authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity, says the physical PLA presence in Africa is becoming a long-term strategic concern for America. ""They (China) have upped their game, in plain language, and ultimately they are offering things that our partners want, that our partners need,"" said the AFRICOM official. ""In places, we have concerns we are being out-competed."" On the ground, however, both sides are engaged in respectful diplomacy. The night before the Cutlass Express, Chinese military officials invited Adm. Berg and her contingent on board a Chinese destroyer docked at the nearby harbor. And, for the first time, Berg welcomed PLA commander Liang Yang to the exercise's opening ceremony. When Berg was asked to comment on the ""us or them"" narrative, she was quick to refocus attention on what the US can do for its allies. ""I think we want to ensure that we don't frame it ... that Africa is a backdrop and an arena for us to score points off China,"" Berg said. ""We are here and our investment and focus is on building our African partners."" The Chinese contingent at the Cutlass Express launch declined to comment to CNN, but President Xi Jinping made it clear at a high-level summit in Beijing last September that he's pursuing a ""comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership"" with Africa, which includes a $60 billion package of aid, investment and loans to Africa. ""We are about to set out on a new journey in history,"" he said. Expanding in Africa China has been expanding its military ties in Africa for years, through extended peacekeeping missions, military personnel training and the China-Africa Peace and Security Initiative forum. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in 2017 that the Djibouti base was part of ongoing efforts to help bring peace and security to the region. ""The completion and operation of the base will help China better fulfill its international obligations in conducting escorting missions and humanitarian assistance ... It will also help promote economic and social development in Djibouti,"" he said. The US, naturally, viewed the base with unease, given its proximity to Camp Lemonnier and Djibouti's main container port, which is the primary source of supplies to sustain a force of around 4,000 US personnel on the base. ""It's no secret that roughly 98% of the logistics support for Djibouti, as well as Somalia and East Africa, come through that port,"" AFRICOM's commanding Gen. Thomas Waldhauser told a recent Senate committee briefing. ""That port is one of five entities in the overall Djiboutian port. And so, our access there is necessary and required."" The USS Chung-Hoon leaves Djibouti on its way back to its home port. The destroyer took part in this year's Cutlass Express exercise. The loss of that access would be a devastating blow to American interests and operations. One way that could happen would be if China were to leverage its control over Djibouti's debt into control over Djibouti's ports. China holds around 80% of the country's debt. ""Perhaps the (Chinese) base would look hawkish or something suspicious or (like it is) something to fear, but Turkey has bases in the region, UAE has bases, Saudi Arabia wants a base, Japan has a base,"" said Wake Forest University assistant professor Lina Benabdallah, whose research focuses on China-Africa relations. She said the Chinese base has riled the US because of a growing rhetoric of ""fear."" ""The lack of trust between Washington and Beijing is really spreading, and it's taken a global dimension,"" added Benabdallah. Debt fears In recent years, China has increased its decades-long military ties with African countries by expanding training programs and increasing weapon sales. It's now the number two arms supplier to sub-Saharan Africa after Russia and the number three supplier to North Africa, behind Russia and the US, according to research from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But at the heart of the US concern is China's lending practices on the continent. Since 2000, African countries have borrowed about $130 billion from China, according to a Johns Hopkins analysis. And the amount of loans has tripled since 2012, largely through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). A legacy of lunacy haunts Kenya's old railway. Will China's $3.6B line be different? ""This is a central preset to Chinese strategy. When you look through history you preemptively shape the environment, shape the potential battlefield, so that your adversaries decide to not even come out on to the field to begin with. There's real potential for the debt to do that,"" said Gabriel Collins, co-founder of research group, China SignPost. Last year, US national security advisor John Bolton was blunt. During a Heritage Foundation speech that laid out the Trump administration's Africa policy, he claimed ""China uses bribes, opaque agreements, and strategic use of debt to hold African states captive to Beijing's demands."" But Bolton's rhetoric only makes combating the perceived threat more difficult, said Collins. ""When your whole premise is America first, I think it's too narrow of a view,"" he said. ""We need to realize that both the biggest challenges and the biggest opportunities in Africa occur in much more of a non-traditional security and development space."" 'We're going to decide our destiny' The US fears about losing access to the port could be rooted in history. In 2017, Sri Lanka surrendered a major port to China after defaulting on the Chinese loan. In that instance, the Sri Lankan government, then led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, took on $1.5 billion of Chinese debt to develop the Hambantota Port, which ultimately failed. To ease its debt burden, Sri Lanka agreed to hand it over on a 99-year lease. Djibouti's container port is key for US operations at Camp Lemonier. The base has no direct access to water. Proponents of China's BRI point out that the scheme often funds much-needed projects that other investors would balk at supporting, and that its focus on infrastructure, with a target investment of $1 trillion in construction is having an immediate impact on the continent. China's Foreign Ministry has stated repeatedly that its investments in Africa come with no political strings attached and it has repeatedly denied China is engaging in what's been referred to as ""debt-trap diplomacy."" Djiboutian officials insist the country will maintain control over its ports and that, so far, the government has a solid track record of paying off its loans. With Sri Lankan port acquisition, China adds another 'pearl' to its 'string' ""The funding is coming from China mainly, but we own the investments, we own the assets. It's a port, it's a railway, it's a free zone, we own two thirds of our investments,"" said the chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, Aboubaker Omar Hadi. But Hadi is also well aware of the risks of -- literally -- banking on China. He just returned from a trip to Asia and Europe to try to drum up investment. ""We don't want to depend only on one side, one continent, one country,"" he said. Hadi bristles at the notion that his country and others on the continent are caught in a superpower tug of war. ""The world needs to understand whether it's east or west or north or south, that we are going to decide our destiny ... Everyone is welcome,"" he said. The future The official position of the Djibouti government may do little to reassure skeptics who believe China's investment program is a front for a more sinister motive of establishing a military footprint worldwide. ""The theory is that if China continues unmitigated expansion, both militarily and economically, and we don't compete to protect our influence, the consequence could be that we are edged out of those areas and we lose the ability to address what we perceive as counterterrorism national interests in Africa,"" the AFRICOM official said. Countering China's economic might is hardly something that should fall on AFRICOM, said Wake Forest professor Benabdallah. ""China has been operating (in Africa) for the better part of two decades now and has been doing so in a very smart way, with really close networks and connections that have been in the work for several years,"" she said. Camp Lemonier is home to around 4,000 US military personnel. The base is a strategic asset for US missions abroad, used as a staging area for America's intelligence and counter terrorism operations on the African continent and beyond. Benabdallah added that much of China's expansion in Africa is the result of strategic dedication led by Xi. The Chinese President has made six trips to the continent, and since January 1990, the Chinese foreign minister's first trip every year has been to a country in Africa. Collins, founder of China SignPost, said soft power has long been a distinguishing feature of US foreign policy, and the current administration would be best served by taking a multilateral approach to relations in Africa. ""For the price of a single drone or fighter jet you could establish multiple university branches, and you would still have the funds to support those over the long haul,"" he said. ""It's not an instant payoff for someone who has the impatience of some of our current administration, but if we took a root cause strategy, 10 years from now there would be enormous dividends from that."" But until the US can figure out an ""all of government"" approach, some believe that much of the responsibility continues to land on AFRICOM's shoulders. ""We have gone from a unipolar world to realizing at best it's bipolar, at worst it's multipolar,"" the AFRICOM official said. ""I would have a stark perspective. I think we are losing -- in Africa we are losing."" "

The world's two largest democracies just tilted further toward populists,edition.cnn.com,James Griffiths,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/india/european-union-india-populism-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The voters in two of the world's largest democracies have spoken -- and their message is clear.
Elections in India and the European Union in recent days have resulted in gains for politicians with strident nationalist messages. In some EU countries the out-of-touch elites are savaged. The middle ground is crumbling. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi easily secured a second term , shrugging off a challenge from the Congress Party, which attempted to paint him as a threat to India's secular pluralism, as voters responded to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) doubling-down on Hindu nationalism and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Across parts of the European Union, some populist, euroskeptic and anti-immigrant parties benefited at the expense of the establishment over the weekend. In the UK -- where most voters never expected to be taking part in these elections -- the Brexit Party, led by arch EU critic Nigel Farage, swept the board. A similar result was seen in France and Italy, where Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National (RN) and Matteo Salvini's League came out on top. Nigel Farage attends a rally with the Brexit Party's European election candidates in Edinburgh, Scotland, on May 17, 2019. Those results come hot on the heels of an Australian election in which voters contradicted months of polling and chose to retain the right-wing government of Scott Morrison , an evangelical Christian climate change denier. Read More Across the world there has been a consistent shift to the political right, as voters abandon the center-left and centrist parties, which once held power in many democracies, after years of austerity and economic downturn. In Europe, the turn to the right -- with Britain perhaps being the best example -- has been fueled by a desire to recapture past glories. Pro-Brexit lawmakers often talk of their project as if they are revitalizing the British Empire, exaggerating not only the role Britain plays today, but the one it would likely have as a small country detached from the wider EU bloc. European elections results 2019 In India, Modi's continued success has not been about yesterday's successes, but tomorrow's. Indians see themselves on the verge of becoming the next superpower, with Modi and his stridently nationalist BJP the best people to lead them there. What these movements share, however, is an antipathy and even hatred for ""the other"" -- more often than not a poor, religious minority. There has been concern about the spread of violent Hindu nationalism since Modi came to power, while European countries have seen increased visibility for anti-Muslim and pro-Nazi groups , as well as mass protests against immigrants . Rise of 'populism' Much of the focus around the European elections, in particular, has been on the rise of so-called populism across the continent. Political scientist Cas Mudde has defined populism as a ""thin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogenous and antagonistic groups: 'the pure people' and 'the corrupt elite.'"" In general discourse, however, this often involves the suggestion that wildly disparate parties -- Jeremy Corbyn's Labour in the UK, say, with Salvini's far-right League -- are somehow connected by similar policies, which upon inspection often boil down to: appealing to broad swaths of people in a way that media elites disapprove of. As Anton Jager, an expert in political history at the University of Cambridge, wrote last year : ""Historians and journalists have been quibbling over the exact meaning of the term populism -- and who should and shouldn't qualify as one -- for at least 60 years."" ""Despite its ambiguous connotations, the word populism has always been more acceptable than labels like racist or extreme right,"" Jager added, meaning it can be easier for media concerned about the appearance of objectivity than equivalent terms which appear to carry with them value judgments. The general shift towards ""populist"" parties -- right-wing, anti-immigrant and anti-elite -- has been under way for several years. Time Magazine shortlisted "" The Populists "" as its person of the year for 2016. The grouping, which included Farage and Le Pen, eventually lost out to US President Donald Trump. While the trend has often been portrayed as the rise of the right, more often than not it is caused by a collapse in support for center-left parties, many of which were the traditional parties of government in their respective countries. ""The rise of the populist right has coincided with a catastrophe for the center-left,"" William Galston, a governance expert at the center-right Brookings Institute, wrote last year . He pointed to the decline of France's Socialists, Labour in the Netherlands, Italy's Democratic Party and the Czech Social Democrats. Who protects democracy when democrats won't? ""Even in Scandinavia, long a bulwark of social democracy, the once-dominant center-left parties are in decline, and nationalist parties with nativist tendencies are growing,"" Galston noted. ""Under pressure, center-right parties have felt compelled to adjust by shifting toward populist policies and rhetoric."" Modi's success in India has been largely at the expense of The Indian National Congress, the center-left party which governed the country for most of its post-independence history. Congress leader and political scion Rahul Gandhi failed to make any gains against the BJP juggernaut, even losing his own race. Irreversible trend? In seeking to capture an imagined greatness, Indian and European voters are reacting to societies struggling with economic disparity, inequality and issues of secularism. The risk for many in marginalized and minority communities however is that in doing so, voters double down on exclusionary, majoritarian politics that leads to societies that are more hostile and less open. Nor do these democratic giants exist within a bubble. The influence of their newly returned governments could have a major effect on the trend of global politics, and on reaching international consensus on issues with global ramifications such as climate change. Parties which traditionally pushed back against that trend have failed in recent years to make much headway. There are many reasons for this -- austerity policies, poor economic performance, foreign policy catastrophes -- what remains to be seen is whether they can reinvent and recover in time to stop their countries swinging further towards the populist right."

Trump meets Japanese Emperor as he begins business portion of state visit,www.cnn.com,admin,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/politics/trump-japan-visit/index.html/,"Home / WORLD NEWS / Trump meets Japanese Emperor as he begins business portion of state visit Trump meets Japanese Emperor as he begins business portion of state visit 46 mins ago WORLD NEWS
In a sunny outdoor ceremony at the Imperial Palace, Trump shook hands with Emperor Naruhito and his wife, engaging warmly as he became the first foreign leader to meet the new monarch.
“How are you? Thank you very much,” Trump mouthed as he approached the Emperor and empress, who were both educated at Western universities and speak English.
Later, Trump stood alone on a podium to review a cordon of Japanese troops and greeted yellow-hatted children waving flags — an honor in keeping with the royal family’s traditions.
From there it was into hours of sit-down talks with Abe, who hopes to cement his status as Trump’s top global friend.
“It’s a very important thing, not only in Japan, but all over the world they’re talking about it,” Trump said of his visit, which came a month after Emperor Naruhito’s formal enthronement.
Monday’s events were more buttoned-up occasions than the round of golf, sumo wrestling tournament and hibachi dinner the President enjoyed Sunday. In manners-conscious Japan, Trump’s interactions with the monarch and his wife were closely scrutinized. And his talks with Abe will come after a Sunday tweet from Trump threw into question the leaders’ alignment on North Korea.
Speaking ahead of his meeting with Abe, Trump again seemed to downplay Pyongyang’s recent provocations, suggesting his bid at diplomacy was working — and that North Korea had ceased its tests, despite recent firings of short-range missiles.
“I may be right, I may be wrong. But I feel that we’ve come a long way. There’s been no rocket testing, there’s been no nuclear testing,” he said.
“We’ll see what happens,” he added. “There’s a good respect built — maybe a great respect built — between certainly the United States and North Korea. We will see what happens.”
Trump has also sounded bullish in his bid to negotiate a new trade deal with Japan that reduces a $68 billion trade deficit. He’s ignored Abe’s pleas to remove tariffs on steel and aluminum, though he did delay new auto tariffs for six months while a deal is worked out.
He had said that real work on a new trade agreement would not begin until after Japanese parliamentary elections in July, and added on Monday that an announcement would likely be made in August.
The business portion of the visit will also include a news conference and an imperial banquet, all meant to underscore strong US-Japan ties that Abe hopes to reinforce through his close personal friendship with Trump. Whether his courtship efforts are paying off remains an open question, and Trump’s tweet downplaying the severity of North Korean short range missile tests on Sunday undercut Abe’s views on the matter.
There was no mention of the episode during Trump and Abe’s multiple joint outings Sunday, which included 16 holes at a golf course south of Tokyo, ringside seats at a sumo wrestling tournament and a dinner double date with their wives over grilled Wagyu beef and vanilla ice cream. The casual bonhomie between the men was captured in a selfie Abe posted from the golf course, Trump grinning underneath a red “USA” cap.
His interactions with the new royal couple were slightly more rigid. Trump is the first foreign leader to meet Emperor Naruhito since he assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier this month. Oxford-educated with an academic interest in waterways, the 59-year-old Naruhito is ushering in the Reiwa era in Japan, a historic moment for the world’s oldest monarchy.
The US-drafted Japanese constitution stripped the Japanese emperor of any political power after World War II. But the monarch holds a powerful symbolic role in a country deeply rooted in tradition.
President Barack Obama drew criticism when he performed a deep bow to Emperor Akihito, a show of deference his political opponents decried as unseemly for a US leader. When Trump met Akihito in 2017, he offered a nod and a handshake instead — and he repeated that Monday as he greeted Akihito’s son.
It’s customary for Japanese guests not to touch the royal couple, but the practice is common for visiting foreign leaders.
Unlike other royal families, the Japanese emperor can only be a man. When female members of the royal family get married, they are forced to give up their titles and become commoners. Naruhito’s wife, Empress Masako, went to college at Harvard and began a career as a diplomat before marrying into the royal family."
First fully albino giant panda filmed in Chinese forest - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Julia Hollingsworth,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/asia/albino-panda-intl/index.html,"(CNN) A fully albino giant panda has been filmed roaming bamboo forests in China -- the first ever recorded in the wild, an expert says.
The footage was taken on an infrared camera in April in Wolong National Nature Reserve, about 2,000 meters (6,562 feet) above sea level in southwestern China's Sichuan province, reserve management authorities said Saturday . Li Sheng, a researcher with Beijing's Peking University, told CNN that no fully albino giant panda had ever been recorded in the wild before. He was quoted by Chinese state media CCTV as saying it was likely to be only one or two years old. ""The panda looked strong and his steps were steady, a sign that the genetic mutation may not have quite impeded its life,"" Li said. Read More The nature reserve plans to set up more infrared cameras to observe its growth and how it interacts with other giant pandas in the area. Animals with albinism -- which results in a lack of melanin, or skin pigment -- are often at greater risk from predators in the wild as they can be spotted more easily and have poorer eyesight, according to the National Geographic . The giant panda is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to the World Wife Fund for Nature, there are 1,864 left in the wild."

Fiat Chrysler proposes merger with Renault to create carmaking powerhouse - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Rishi Iyengar,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/business/fiat-chrysler-renault-merger/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN Business) Renault is considering a merger with Fiat Chrysler, a deal that would reshape the global auto industry and help the carmakers compete in the race for electric and self-driving vehicles.
The French automaker said Monday that it would ""study with interest"" a proposal from Fiat Chrysler that would give its shareholders 50% ownership of a combined business with annual vehicle sales of 8.7 million. If completed, the merger would create the world's third largest carmaker behind Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) and Toyota ( TM ) . General Motors ( GM ) would fall to fourth in the global rankings. Renault ( RNLSY ) stock surged more than 15% in Paris on Monday, while Fiat Chrysler shares jumped around 11% in Milan. The companies had been discussing ways to cooperate on products and new technologies, but Fiat Chrysler said in a statement outlining its proposal that more could be gained from a merger. Read More ""These discussions made clear that broader collaboration through a combination would substantially improve capital efficiency and the speed of product development,"" the Italian-American company said. Fiat Chrysler owns brands including Jeep, Dodge, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. Among its top markets is North America, where Renault does not have a significant presence. The proposal is the latest example of established automakers seeking partnerships to share the costs of developing new technologies including electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems. Ford, VW alliance may create the cars of the future German carmakers BMW ( BMWYY ) and Daimler ( DDAIF ) have formed a joint venture that will develop ride-sharing and charging services. Ford ( F ) and Volkswagen are working together to develop some new vehicles. The trend toward cooperation has accelerated in recent months as carmakers are under increased pressure from electric-car upstarts like Tesla ( TSLA ) and tech companies including Uber ( UBER ) . Fiat Chrysler said a merger with Renault would produce annual cost savings of more than €5 billion ($5.6 billion). The company said no plants would be closed as a result of a merger. Fiat Chrysler was formed as a merger of two struggling automakers. Fiat bought a controlling stake in a Chrysler out of bankruptcy following the US government bailout of the company in 2009. They were formally merged in 2014. But Fiat Chrysler is a distant fourth in US sales and 8th globally. The company has also trailed its competitors in adopting electric vehicle and self-driving technology, which many deem the industry's inevitable future. Sergio Marchionne, its former CEO who passed away a year ago, had spoken openly of the need to merge Fiat Chrysler with a larger automaker to give it the scale and resources to compete. He had even sought a merger with General Motors, only to be rebuffed. He had been far more blunt than other auto executives about the threat to the industry that new entrants such as Google ( GOOGL ) posed to old-line automakers. Nissan hits 'rock bottom' as Renault pushes for a merger Renault is already a member of the world's biggest automotive alliance with Japanese carmakers Nissan ( NSANF ) and Mitsubishi Motors. It's not clear how a merger with Fiat Chrysler would affect that alliance, which was thrown into turmoil following the arrest last year of its former leader Carlos Ghosn . Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault. The French carmaker, which sells fewer cars than its Japanese partner, had been pushing for the companies to merge but was rebuffed. While the relationship between Nissan and Renault has been strained following Ghosn's arrest, adding Fiat Chrysler would increase the alliance's annual vehicle sales to 15 million. Renault and Fiat Chrysler both said Monday that a merger would benefit the alliance. Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors declined to comment. Regulators are likely to scrutinize any deal between Fiat Chrysler and Renault. The French government, which owns 15% of Renault, indicated that it would support a merger if the companies protect French jobs and auto plants. ""I want this deal to take place within the framework of the alliance between Renault and Nissan,"" French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said in a radio interview on Tuesday."

'Game of Thrones: The Last Watch' pays tribute to show's foot soldiers - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/entertainment/game-of-thrones-the-last-watch-documentary/index.html,"(CNN) ""Game of Thrones: The Last Watch"" could easily be dismissed as HBO's way of maximizing its ample investment in the series, a glorified electronic press kit to extend the program's run by one more week. Yet after many viewers spent the final season bashing the show, the two-hour documentary served a dual purpose, offering a reminder of all the grueling work that went into making it.
Director Jeanie Finlay spent a year chronicling the production, spanning locations from Belfast to Croatia to Spain. While the stars and producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss received a bit of screen time, the project went the extra mile to showcase those who don't walk red carpets, from background actors -- shown noshing on snacks during breaks, under hideous makeup -- to construction, the cheerful folks who fed this small army and even those responsible for all that fake snow. Among the unlikely stars of the documentary were Andrew McClay, an extroverted background actor who choked up when his watch finally ended; and Vladimir Furdik, the stunt coordinator who garnered an unexpected taste of stardom as the villainous Night King, who muttered ""Back to normal"" when his stretch under that guise finished. Finlay also spent considerable time presenting the weeks of night shoots -- prompting one crew member to mutter that he felt like a vampire -- amid inclement weather that pushed the production, and those working on it, to their limits. Daniel Portman, Rory McCann, Sophie Turner, Kit Harington. The stars did get their moments, from Kit Harington's tearful farewell on his final day of shooting to Emilia Clarke quietly musing in her makeup chair about what life will be like after the show, which both propelled her into the public consciousness and left a lot of people debating the wisdom of having named a daughter ""Daenerys."" Read More ""It's exciting to think, 'Who am I without this?'"" Clarke said. Perhaps foremost, ""The Last Watch"" served as a testament to the massive logistical hurdles that the final season of ""Thrones"" posed, delivering six episodes with the heft of feature films. Executive producer Bernie Caulfield seemed to sum up the mixed feelings that evoked, which oscillated between nostalgia and somewhat guilty relief as the finish line neared. The narrative choices that defined the closing run will be debated for some time, with the hoopla surrounding the series stoking smaller controversies -- from a battle sequence that many deemed too dark and murky to an errant coffee cup being left in a shot -- that will surely fade more quickly. Beyond giving the foot soldiers in the battle to produce ""Game of Thrones"" their moments in the spotlight, ""The Last Watch"" provided a clear sense of the toil that goes into such an enterprise. ""That new GoT doc is pretty incredible, one of the best portraits I've seen of what a huge production feels like from the POV of all the folks doing the day to day work,"" Rian Johnson, the director of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" tweeted on Sunday night. In that regard, wherever and however the series came up short, the message was that for those in the trenches, it wasn't for lack of trying."
Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill: Rubber stamp lets people put the abolitionist's face on currency - CNN,us.cnn.com,"Taylor Romine and Mimi Hsin Hsuan Sun, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/tubman-money-stamp-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Supporters of an Obama-era plan to put abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill were disappointed last week by news that the Treasury Department has delayed the bill's redesign.
But artist Dano Wall decided not to wait for the Trump administration to honor the Underground Railroad hero. He has created a stamp that can be used to superimpose Tubman's image over President Andrew Jackson's portrait. Wall created the stamp in 2017 with the intent of getting Tubman on the bill as soon as possible. In February of that year, he gave about 100 stamps to his friends before opening an Etsy shop to sustain the costs. But the stamp has soared in popularity in the last week after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday during a House Financial Services Committee meeting that he hasn't made any decisions about the redesigning the bill. Mnuchin told the committee that decisions about the imagery on the $20 ""will not be an issue that comes up until most likely 2026."" Mnuchin's predecessor, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, announced in 2016 that the US would swap out Jackson, the slave-owning president whose legacy is synonymous with the Trail of Tears, with Tubman. Under Lew's plan, Tubman -- an escaped slave who would be the first black woman featured on official US currency -- would be on the face of the bill and Jackson moved from the front of the $20 to its back. Read More President Donald Trump previously slammed the move as ""pure political correctness."" And his administration has delayed plans to move forward with the redesign. ""My goal when I started making Tubman stamps was to get 5,000 made and into people's hands, as this seemed at the start like a goal of sufficient ambition as to put it almost out of reach, but not quite,"" Wall said. ""I now have over 6,000 people who've signed up to be notified when more stamps go into stock, so I will likely eventually pass that goal."" Wall has had more than 600 sales on Etsy , often with more than one stamp in each sale. He is currently out of stock but his instructions on how to make your own stamp have been downloaded more than 5,000 times. Two ""stamping stations"" in New York City are listed on his website. A video on the Tubman stamp website shows the stamped bills being accepted into a variety of different vending machines. ""I never thought it would take off in the way it has, but I'm very glad that so many people have responded to it with such passion,"" Wall said."

How a Utah assault case upended the website that caught the Golden State Killer - CNN,us.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/genetic-genealogy-gedmatch-privacy/index.html,"(CNN) Curtis Rogers, the founder of the free DNA website GEDMatch, wanted to do all he could to help police solve a disturbing assault case out of Utah.
He knew his website, full of more than 1.2 million completed DNA kits, could help. After all, it had helped solve the so-called Golden State Killer case last April through a new forensic technique known as genetic genealogy. But there was one problem: GEDMatch's own terms of service didn't allow police to use the site for this Utah assault case. The terms assured users who submitted DNA kits that police would only use their information to solve violent crimes of murder and rape. But not assaults. Still, Rogers decided to make an exception in this case, given its severity, and help police. That exception led to an arrest in the case, yes, but it also sparked a fierce privacy backlash. And that criticism, in turn, led GEDMatch to make changes to the site that have sharply curtailed police ability to catch criminals. ""We can be sure there are hundreds of cases that would have been solved in the coming months or year that very well won't be now,"" CeCe Moore, a leading investigative genetic genealogist who worked on the Utah assault case, told CNN. Read More It started as a hobby. Now they're using DNA to help cops crack cold cases ""People will die,"" she added. ""It sounds dramatic but it's actually true."" The issue highlights the privacy concerns around home DNA technology and its use by police to solve cold cases, a field that has exploded since GEDMatch was used to catch the alleged Golden State Killer last year. With the technology, police work with genetic genealogists to put a suspect's DNA into GEDMatch in hopes of finding the suspect's family members. But that work will be more difficult on GEDMatch now. In the wake of the backlash, Rogers and his partner John Olson made it so that all GEDMatch users are automatically made to be unsearchable by law enforcement. Users can choose to opt-in to law enforcement searches if they consent, or they can remain unsearchable. Rogers, an 81-year-old genealogy hobbyist, said that was the best balance between helping police arrest criminals and protecting privacy rights. ""Certainly there was a short-term loss but I think this is going to make us stronger,"" he told CNN. ""Stronger ethically (and) stronger for support among people who put their information on our site. I think it's the right step to make."" The rise of GEDMatch in solving cases JUST WATCHED Tissue led to Golden State Killer case arrest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Tissue led to Golden State Killer case arrest 01:01 Led by companies like Ancestry and 23AndMe, direct-to-consumer DNA technology spread as a way to learn about one's family history by spitting into a tube. More than 1.2 million DNA kits have been uploaded to GEDMatch, a free website, by people who want to better learn about their genetics or connect with family members. The power of genetic genealogy in the hands of police was made clear when it was used to arrest Joseph James DeAngelo, an elderly ex-cop, as the Golden State Killer last April. Typically in these cases, police work with a trained genetic genealogist to put an unknown suspect's DNA into GEDMatch, which then produces a list of people related to the suspect. Genetic genealogists then build out a family tree from this information to try to identify possible people who fit the suspect profile, and police use those as leads. The technique has helped police identify serial killers, murderers and rapists from decades ago. Parabon NanoLabs, the DNA technology company leading the way in working with police, touted earlier this month that its genetic genealogy services have helped law enforcement solve 55 cases in the past year. Moore, chief genetic genealogist at Parabon, told CNN last year that GEDMatch was vital to this work. ""GEDMatch is absolutely the key, and had (the founders) decided that they didn't want law enforcement to use their database, we wouldn't have been able to do this,"" she told CNN at the time. A study released in October found that more than 60% of people with European ancestry can be identified by an anonymous DNA sample, simply by using data from consumer genetic databases. Utah assault case solved with milk container This fierce debate stems from an attack last November in Centerville, Utah. There, an unknown suspect broke into a locked church and strangled a 71-year-old woman who was alone practicing the organ, Centerville Police said . The woman survived but was left with a webbing of broken blood vessels in her neck, and her eyes were black and blue, according to an affidavit for a search warrant. The suspect had broken into the church by breaking a window, and detectives collected blood from the suspect left at the scene, the affidavit said. A cold case killing from 1972 was cracked with the help of genetic genealogy But that DNA had no matches in the FBI's national database, so the detectives contacted Parabon NanoLabs and Moore to take on the case, the warrant states. Moore said she initially declined to help because using GEDMatch to solve an assault case would violate the terms of service. The police detective then made a personal plea to Rogers to make an exception in this case because of its seriousness, and Rogers agreed. ""I felt people's lives were in danger,"" he explained. With Rogers' express permission, Moore and Parabon then carried out the genetic genealogy analysis through GEDMatch. The analysis found that a person's DNA kit on GEDMatch was likely a great uncle of the suspect, the affidavit said. That man had a nephew who lived in Centerville who had a 17-year-old son, so police began to investigate the teenager. On April 11, a high school resource officer collected the teen's used juice box and plastic milk container from the garbage, the affidavit said. DNA testing on the milk container proved to be an exact match for the suspect's DNA, the affidavit said. The 17-year-old, who was not named, was booked into Farmington Bay Juvenile Detention Center on first degree aggravated burglary and second degree aggravated assault, police said. Critics slam lack of informed consent When Judy G. Russell, a trained genealogist with a legal degree who writes on her website about legal issues in genealogy, learned that GEDMatch had broken the terms of service, she wrote a fiery post revoking her recommendation for GEDMatch. GEDMatch's founders ""made a decision, on their own, without consulting their users, to expose the data of those users to the police because the police made a compelling argument,"" she wrote . ""Now it may very well be that the vast majority of those users would have agreed with that decision — if they had been asked. But they weren't asked."" You might not be anonymous, thanks to genealogy databases She also said the site did not have the informed consent of its users to make an exception to the terms of service. ""Bottom line: nobody but nobody can give informed consent for someone else,"" Russell wrote . ""Nobody but nobody has the right to make decisions for DNA testers other than the DNA testers."" Blaine Bettinger, a professional genealogist specializing in DNA evidence and author of the book ""Genetic Genealogy in Practice,"" wrote that informed consent of the users was necessary for an ethical and trustworthy DNA database. ""We have a system in place that has spent the past 200-plus years in thousands of legal proceedings upholding the principal that the end does not justify the means if it exceeds the power of the government or erodes the privacy of the individual,"" Bettinger wrote on his blog ""The Genetic Genealogist."" However, Moore, who has appeared as an expert on the PBS show ""Finding Your Roots"" and is the chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, said this backlash was from a ""few very vocal influencers"" who blew this situation out of proportion. ""I know we can't trample on people's civil liberties, but I don't think this rose to this level of seriousness,"" said Moore. Users now must opt-in to law enforcement searches CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist who has appeared on PBS' ""Finding Your Roots,"" said the ability to solve new cases will be ""crippled"" by the changes to GEDMatch. Rogers said he was convinced he saved people's lives with the exception in the assault case. But in considering the thorny ethical issue -- and the possibility of a damaging lawsuit -- he decided to make it so that everyone would have to opt-in to being searched by police. ""We felt it was the right thing to do, the most ethical thing to do,"" he said. At the same time, GEDMatch updated its terms of service to say that police are now allowed to use its DNA database to solve all violent crimes, including non-negligent manslaughter, aggravated assault and robbery cases. ""We realized that our terms of service were too narrow. We have since expanded them so they basically are the same thing as FBI requirements for violent crimes,"" he said. ""We had to turn down other cases that were also violent crimes, but it was apparent that we really needed to expand somehow the terms of service."" GEDMatch was useful partly because so many people were already in the database. Moore said that the opt-in change has ""crippled"" her team's ability to use GEDMatch and catch these killers and rapists. ""This is shocking, it was so fast,"" Moore said. ""It was very much a rash decision in my opinion. (It was) not fully thought through."" For now, Parabon will continue to solve the cases in which they already completed the DNA analysis. But she said she was devastated for those families who might not get closure or who are still worried that a rapist or murderer won't be brought to justice. ""It's just incredibly sad for the victims, the families and society as a whole,"" she said. Rogers said he wishes he had given more warning before the sudden change to the terms of service. He said about 20,000 people have opted in to being searched by police, and he encouraged more people to do so. ""We're the good guys,"" he said. ""The bad guys are the murderers and rapists and other violent criminals out there. And hopefully we'll come back much stronger as a result of all this."""
Gillette ad features transgender man shaving for the first time - CNN,us.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/gillette-ad-transgender-man-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A man's first shave is a milestone no matter who you are. But for transgender man Samson Bonkeabantu Brown, it was memorable for several reasons.
Brown shared the experience with a man identified as his father in an advertisement for Gillette, the maker of razors and shaving supplies. The video, which Gillette shared on its Facebook page, shows the Toronto-based artist standing in front of a bathroom mirror as his father coaches him. ""Now, don't be scared,"" his father says. ""Shaving is about being confident."" ""Growing up, I was always trying to figure out what kind of man I wanted to become and I'm still trying to figure out what kind of man that I want to become,"" Brown said in the video, Read More ""I always knew I was different. I didn't know that there was a term for the type of person that I was."" CNN reached to Brown to find out if this was indeed his first shave, as the video implies. The video carries the caption, ""'Whenever, wherever, however it happens -- your first shave is special."" CNN also reached out to Gillette to confirm if this is the brand's first ad to feature a transgender man. Neither Brown nor Gillette responded immediately. Regardless of the details, many celebrated the ad as a meaningful gesture of inclusiveness to kick off pride celebrations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community in June. ""Oh wow, Gillette⁩, we are having all the feels here,"" LGBTQ family advocacy group PFLAG National said on Twitter. ""As the first and largest organization for parents of #LGBTQ people we thank you for seeing our #trans kids...and for honoring their affirming #dads!""

— PFLAG National (@PFLAG) May 25, 2019 In a Facebook post , Brown thanked Gillette for the opportunity to share the important milestone with his father. ""I shot this ad for Gillette and wanted to include my father, who has been one of my greatest supporters throughout my transition, encouraging me to be confident and live authentically as my best self,"" Brown said. As the news cycle brings a steady stream of negative headlines about violence and discrimination against the transgender community, the ad casts a rare positive light on a transgender man experiencing family support. ""I'm keenly aware of how blessed I am to be able to exist in this world being supported by my family in ways that all too often many of my trans brothers, sisters, and siblings who exist outside the binary are not always as fortunate,"" Brown said in his Facebook post. Brown says in the video that he's glad to be at a point where he's able to shave, a nod to the fact that for many transgender men, financial and medical barriers can impede access to medically necessary hormone treatment to align their appearance with their gender. In his Facebook post, Brown said he believes the ad will give other transgender people hope. ""I am confident that this ad will encourage many of my trans siblings and fill them with the knowledge that our existence in this world can be filled with the love and support we deserve."""

""Apple could be another victim of the US-China trade war and its market-share loss may accelerate in the Chinese market,"" they said. US President Donald Trump last week called Huawei ""very dangerous,"" but then said he could see the company being included in a broader trade deal with China. Ren told Bloomberg that using his company as a bargaining chip is ""a big joke.""' ""How are we related to China-US trade?"" he said."

From Wyoming to Ohio, more than 25 million people are at risk for severe weather Monday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. Central US reels from week of deadly weather The areas at greatest risk include parts of Nebraska, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois, where the Windy City of Chicago and parts of Colorado are at risk of tornadoes. And while the South bakes in record-setting heat, the Grand Canyon could get blanketed in snow. Here's what different parts of the country are facing this Memorial Day: Read More Torrential rain and flooding could hit the central US About 10 million people are spending the holiday under flood warnings. Many are in states already pummeled by last week's severe weather , which killed at least 12 people. ""Another round of heavy rain is on tap today for parts of the Midwest and Plains,"" Hennen said. ""Many rivers are already in major flood (stage) across the region, and the Arkansas River is expected to exceed record flooding over the coming days."" Residents in several Arkansas counties already started evacuating over the weekend, officials said. Parts of the Arkansas River could crest over 4 feet above the record, meaning ""catastrophic flooding is possible in the towns of Van Buren and Fort Smith,"" Hennen said. 6 Oklahomans killed in severe weather, including tornadoes In Oklahoma, where six people were killed in severe weather last week, the situation ""still could get worse,"" Gov. Kevin Stitt said Monday. ""We still have water still rising in the east,"" he said. ""We are not out of the woods yet."" A state of emergency was still in effect for all 77 counties on Monday. More than 100 injuries have been reported at local hospitals, the state health department said. The governor said he toured the destruction left by a tornado that struck El Reno on Saturday night, noting it was ""unbelievable how violent"" it was. Some of the mobile homes, he said, ""look like they were blown up."" Scorching heat bakes the South A Memorial Day heat wave is scorching the South It's still three weeks before summer, but Memorial Day temperatures in the South have soared past average summer temps. Cities such as Columbia, South Carolina, and Augusta, Georgia, are expected to hit triple-digit, record-breaking temperatures Monday. And dozens of other cities from Tennessee to Florida could shatter their records for high temperatures. The Grand Canyon could get blanketed with snow Out West, tourists hoping for a warm, sunny trip to the Grand Canyon will instead face brutal winds and unusually cold weather.

In fact, ""it's only happened 8 times since we've been keeping records"" back in 1898, the NWS Flagstaff office said. Flagstaff is about an hour south of Grand Canyon National Park, which about 5.9 million tourists visit every year. Across northern Arizona, ""unusually cold"" weather is paving the way for dangerous travel conditions, the NWS office said.

Storms and torrential rains have ravaged the Midwest, from Texas through Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois, in the past few days. (Mike Simons/Tulsa World via AP) The threat of record flooding has areas of the central United States on alert after more than a week of extreme weather that has brought with it tornadoes, fierce winds and heavy rains.
Spring storms have resulted in five deaths in Missouri, one in Iowa and six in Oklahoma. In Indiana, a 4-year-old boy is missing after strong currents from heavy rains swept him away.
CNN Meteorologist Robert Shackelford said 3.6 million people were under a flash flood watch, and 1.3 million under a severe thunderstorm watch overnight Sunday, with nearly 50 million at risk of severe weather impacts on Monday.
""Severe thunderstorms are continuing along the central High Plains, bringing damaging winds and the possibility for a few tornadoes, but these systems will weaken throughout the night,"" he said.
Shackelford said the Arkansas River is experiencing record flooding, with one site at Van Buren already over 38 feet -- the record set in 1945 -- and an expected crest at 42.5 feet late Tuesday into early Wednesday.
Tulsa levees under strain, record flooding expected
Oklahoma and other parts of the Midwest are still reeling from a deadly spring storm system that has resulted in more than 170 reported tornadoes plus strong winds, flash flooding and hail.
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Army Corps of Engineers said it was increasing the release of water at Keystone Dam to 265,000 cubic feet per second (CFS) Sunday evening and to 275,000 CFS Monday morning ""with the expectation to leave it at this level through Thursday.""
""Due to the additional release at Keystone Dam, flood water is expected to rise and residents and businesses along the Arkansas River must remain vigilant and take precautions based on the new data available,"" the city said in a release.
On Twitter, it said that emergency services had responded to reports of a man in the river Sunday evening. ""We are hopeful he somehow made his way safely to the bank. It's extremely important to avoid the river to ensure your safety,"" it said.
Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said the Oklahoma Guard was patrolling the city's levee system 24 hours a day.
""We continue to urge residents along the river to plan for the flood of record (the worst flood in Tulsa history), which was equivalent to 305,000 CFS,"" the mayor said on Facebook.
""The levees continue to operate as designed, but this will place an even greater load on them,"" he said, urging residents living behind Levees A and B to relocate.
Evacuations underway in Arkansas
Arkansas fully activated its State Emergency Operations Center on Sunday morning in response to rising water levels and anticipated continued flooding along the Arkansas River.
Governor Asa Hutchinson on Friday declared a state of emergency in relation to the storms and flooding that began May 21, saying that ""severe flooding of historic proportion will likely result.""
After a briefing on flooding along the Arkansas River Sunday morning, Hutchinson approved $100,000 in emergency funding to support sandbagging work.
""I appreciate all the neighbors and volunteers filling sandbags and assisting with evacuations. The state team is continuing to respond to assistance requests, and more funds will be allocated as the situation demands,"" the governor said in a statement.
Ten Arkansas counties had verbally declared Sunday morning -- meaning they can request disaster resources. Another two had submitted written declarations, the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management said in a statement.
As of 6 p.m. local time Sunday (7p.m. ET), areas of Crawford, Franklin, Jefferson and Perry counties had already been evacuated and officials were encouraging some residents of low lying areas to evacuate in Conway, Faulkner and Logan counties. Visitors to RV parks in low lying areas of Pope County were also being encouraged to leave, the department said.

A state of emergency has also been in place across all 77 counties of Oklahoma since Friday due to the severe weather.
Six people have died in the state after flooding, severe storms and tornadoes.
Two people were killed when a powerful EF-3 tornado touched down in El Reno, about 29 miles west of Oklahoma City, late Saturday.
A mobile home park was ""devastated"" after the twister made landfall, Mayor Matt White said. El Reno has a population of about 19,000.
""It's a lot of devastation here, it's leveled, it's just devastated,"" White said in a phone interview with CNN. ""It's tore all to pieces, it was terrible.""
Two people were killed earlier in Mayes County, according to a tally Sunday from the state medical examiner's office. A 53-year-old woman also died in Payne County and a 58-year-old man died in Stephens County, according to officials.
Area hospitals reported 92 injuries, the state health department said.

Darlyn Cristabel Cordova-Valle died in September in Nebraska after spending months in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, but her death was not announced until last week. The young girl's concrete tomb is on a hill surrounded by trees, with a turquoise cross that bears her name and the date she was laid to rest in silver letters. Her father was placing white and green paper flowers on the tomb the day CNN visited. He remembered the last time he saw his daughter alive: He was talking to her through video chat while she was in a hospital in Nebraska. Geovany Valle Darlyn was encountered by Border Patrol on March 1, 2018, a few miles west of Hidalgo, Texas. She complained of chest pain and three days later, was transferred to HHS custody where she remained for about seven months. Darlyn was treated for a congenital heart defect at various hospitals -- including in San Antonio, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona.

Mother of 10-year-old who died in US custody says daughter was born with a heart murmur As Valle was on the phone with his daughter back then, he was desperate for a sign of life. ""Give me a signal, I want to know that you can hear me. I want to know that you are seeing me,"" he said he told Darlyn. ""She made an effort four times and she tried to speak,"" he said. ""And that was it."" 'I could have asked her to stay' The young girl was traveling to the US to find her mom, who had migrated from El Salvador to work and provide for her three daughters. A US Customs and Border Protection official identified the 10-year-old El Salvadorian girl that died in the custody of HHS in September 2018 as Darlyn Cristabel Cordova-Valle. Darlyn stayed back with her aunt, but nine years later, Darlyn -- like so many Central American children who are currently flocking to the US southern border -- made the journey to reunite with her mother in the US. The girl traveled with acquaintances by car for four days from El Salvador to the border, her mother said. Her mother, who now lives in Omaha, Nebraska, told CNN Darlyn was just a year old when she left her behind with her aunt, Jesus Valle. The two live in a humble home on a lush hill -- in a town not far from the cemetery where the child was laid to rest. ""She was like a daughter to me,"" Jesus Valle said. ""I loved her so much."" Surrounded by Darlyn's clothing and toys, her aunt wonders what could have been if Darlyn had stayed in El Salvador. ""When she left I could have asked her to stay. But her mom was taking her back. And I didn't want to keep her from her right to be with her mom,"" Jesus Valle said."

Fiat Chrysler proposes merger with Renault to create carmaking powerhouse,us.cnn.com,Rishi Iyengar,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/business/fiat-chrysler-renault-merger/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN Business) Renault is considering a merger with Fiat Chrysler, a deal that would reshape the global auto industry and help the carmakers compete in the race for electric and self-driving vehicles.
The French automaker said Monday that it would ""study with interest"" a proposal from Fiat Chrysler that would give its shareholders 50% ownership of a combined business with annual vehicle sales of 8.7 million. If completed, the merger would create the world's third largest carmaker behind Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) and Toyota ( TM ) . General Motors ( GM ) would fall to fourth in the global rankings. Renault ( RNLSY ) stock surged more than 15% in Paris on Monday, while Fiat Chrysler shares jumped around 11% in Milan. The companies had been discussing ways to cooperate on products and new technologies, but Fiat Chrysler said in a statement outlining its proposal that more could be gained from a merger. Read More ""These discussions made clear that broader collaboration through a combination would substantially improve capital efficiency and the speed of product development,"" the Italian-American company said. Fiat Chrysler owns brands including Jeep, Dodge, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. Among its top markets is North America, where Renault does not have a significant presence. The proposal is the latest example of established automakers seeking partnerships to share the costs of developing new technologies including electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems. Ford, VW alliance may create the cars of the future German carmakers BMW ( BMWYY ) and Daimler ( DDAIF ) have formed a joint venture that will develop ride-sharing and charging services. Ford ( F ) and Volkswagen are working together to develop some new vehicles. The trend toward cooperation has accelerated in recent months as carmakers are under increased pressure from electric-car upstarts like Tesla ( TSLA ) and tech companies including Uber ( UBER ) . Fiat Chrysler said a merger with Renault would produce annual cost savings of more than €5 billion ($5.6 billion). The company said no plants would be closed as a result of a merger. Fiat Chrysler was formed as a merger of two struggling automakers. Fiat bought a controlling stake in a Chrysler out of bankruptcy following the US government bailout of the company in 2009. They were formally merged in 2014. But Fiat Chrysler is a distant fourth in US sales and 8th globally. The company has also trailed its competitors in adopting electric vehicle and self-driving technology, which many deem the industry's inevitable future. Sergio Marchionne, its former CEO who passed away a year ago, had spoken openly of the need to merge Fiat Chrysler with a larger automaker to give it the scale and resources to compete. He had even sought a merger with General Motors, only to be rebuffed. He had been far more blunt than other auto executives about the threat to the industry that new entrants such as Google ( GOOGL ) posed to old-line automakers. Nissan hits 'rock bottom' as Renault pushes for a merger Renault is already a member of the world's biggest automotive alliance with Japanese carmakers Nissan ( NSANF ) and Mitsubishi Motors. It's not clear how a merger with Fiat Chrysler would affect that alliance, which was thrown into turmoil following the arrest last year of its former leader Carlos Ghosn . Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault. The French carmaker, which sells fewer cars than its Japanese partner, had been pushing for the companies to merge but was rebuffed. While the relationship between Nissan and Renault has been strained following Ghosn's arrest, adding Fiat Chrysler would increase the alliance's annual vehicle sales to 15 million. Renault and Fiat Chrysler both said Monday that a merger would benefit the alliance. Nissan declined to comment. Representatives of Mitsubishi Motors were not immediately available. Regulators are likely to scrutinize any deal between Fiat Chrysler and Renault. Yet the French government, which owns 15% of Renault, indicated Monday that it would support a merger. ""We have large companies which have been built outside of Europe, and today we need big companies to be built within Europe,"" Sibeth Ndiaye, a spokesperson for the French government, told BFMTV."
8 key takeaways from the European election 2019 results,edition.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Helen Regan, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/europe/european-elections-takeaways-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The results of the European elections revealed some unexpected outcomes Monday as the full picture from the world's biggest multi-country vote became clearer.
Over four days last week voters across 28 countries delivered the highest turnout in a European election for 20 years as they selected new representatives to sit in the European Parliament. Here are some of the key takeaways from some of the provisional results so far: Traditional centrist parties took a drubbing , with the so-called Grand Coalition -- which consists of the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) bloc and the center-right European People's Party (EPP) -- losing more than 70 seats and its majority in the EU parliament. One of the key figures in the S&D is Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, while German chancellor Angela Merkel is part of the EPP. In contrast, liberal-centrist grouping the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE&R), which includes French President Emmanuel Macron, picked up 32 seats and will now play an important role in nominating officials for key EU positions. In the UK, the Brexit Party, led by arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, took home 31.71% of the vote . This is almost equivalent to the vote share of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats combined and reflects growing dissatisfaction with traditional UK parties. It's worth noting that the Brexit Party took most of its seats from the UK Independence Party, Farage's previous political vehicle. Read More Spain's Socialist party recorded another strong performance following a general election win in late April, winning 32.84% of the vote. Center-right parties the People's Party (20.13%) and Ciudadanos (12.17%) came second and third as Spain bucked the general European trend towards political extremes. Far-right party Vox won just 6.2% of the vote. Results in France provided further evidence that a predicted surge in support for far-right populist parties did not materialize . Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally won with 23.31% of the votes, according to the French Ministry of Interior, beating French president Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche alliance on 22.41%. However Le Pen's vote share was a slight decrease compared to 2014, when her Front National party gained 24.86% of the vote. In Italy, the right-wing Lega Party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, took victory with 34.33% of the vote. Euroskeptic Salvini said that he will try to form an anti-EU bloc with Marine Le Pen and Hungary's Viktor Orban. It's unclear if that will materialize. Salvini (L), Farage (center) and Le Pen (R) all won in their respective countries. Orban, Hungary's far-right nationalist prime minister, scored a huge win after his Fidesz party received 52.33% of the country's votes. That's more than three times the amount of the second most popular party, the left-wing Democratic Coalition, which received just 16.19%. The Green Party alliance posted its strongest ever performance in European elections , winning 69 seats according to provisional results -- a rise from 2014 when they took 50 seats. Much of the party's gains came from northern Europe, including the UK, Ireland, France and Germany, where young people have staged marches calling for political action over climate change. Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he would call a snap election after a poor performance for his party at European and local elections. The opposition conservative party ""New Democracy"" won 33.25% of the vote, with a lead over the governing Coalition of the Radical Left ""Syriza"", currently at 23.74%."

He also visited Sean DeHart and his parents at their Apex home. DeHart said during the shooting, he fled and was helped by a young woman who ""placed a tourniquet on him to help stop his bleeding,"" Dubois said, asking the public's help in finding the mystery woman -- who DeHart believes was a student. ""I enjoyed my time with (DeHart and his family) and was happy to see Sean doing so well,"" Dubois wrote.

What you need to know about the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Gabrielle Sorto, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is at Arlington National Cemetery. It stands on the top of a hill overlooking Washington DC. Congress approved the burial of an unidentified World War I soldier in the plaza of the then-new Memorial Amphitheater in 1921.
The white marble sarcophagus has three Greek figures sculpted on the side representing Peace, Victory, and Valor. There are also six wreaths, three sculpted on each side, that represent the six major campaigns of World War I. On the back on the tomb, there is an inscription that reads: Here rests in honored glory an American soldier known but to God. Who is buried there? Memorial Day marks the day in 1921 when four unknowns were exhumed from four World War I American cemeteries in France. Army Sgt. Edward F. Younger chose the Unknown Soldier of World War I, who now lies in the tomb. President Warren G. Harding officiated at the interment ceremonies at the Memorial Amphitheater on November 11, 1921. There are three other soldiers buried at the tomb. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a bill to select and pay tribute to the unknowns of World War II and Korea. The selection ceremonies and the interment of those unknowns took place in 1958. Read More The Unknown of Vietnam was only unknown for a short time. After being placed into the tomb in 1984, the Unknown was exhumed in 1988. Thanks to mitochondrial DNA testing, Department of Defense scientists were able to identify the remains as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie. It was decided that the crypt that contained the remains of the Vietnam Unknown will remain vacant. The crypt cover was replaced with a new inscription that now reads: Honoring and Keeping Faith with America's Missing Servicemen, 1958-1975. Who are the Tomb Guards? The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is guarded 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and in any weather by Tomb Guard sentinels. Tomb Guards are volunteers -- part of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as ""The Old Guard."" It is the oldest active-duty infantry unit in the Army, serving the US since 1784. The honor of Tomb Guard is incredibly rare. The badge is the least awarded in the Army. It takes a high level of dedication to be a Tomb Guard. They work in 24-hour shift and when they aren't walking the mat, they are living in the quarters beneath it. During that time, they complete training and prepare their uniforms, which can take up to eight hours. What is the Changing of the Guard? Changing of the Guard is an elaborate ritual that happens every hour on the hour October 1 to March 31 and every half hour from April 1 to September 30. Visitors are welcome to watch the ceremony, but must stand and remain silent. The ceremony starts with the relief commander announcing the Changing of the Guard on the plaza. The Tomb Guard marches 21 steps behind the Tomb, turns, faces east for 21 seconds, turns and faces north for 21 seconds, then takes 21 steps down the mat and repeats the process. After the turn, the sentinel executes a sharp ""shoulder-arms"" movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to visitors watching the ceremony. This signifies that the sentinel stands between the Tomb and any potential threat. Doing things in increments of 21 symbolizes the 21-gun salute, which is the highest military honor that can be bestowed."
