"Under Trump, has the US 'become a less reliable ally' on intelligence? | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-05-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/under-trump-has-the-us-become-less-reliable-ally-intelligence,"By Steve Benen At a press conference yesterday alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May, Donald Trump boasted about the “ incredible intelligence relationship ” between the U.S. and the U.K. May didn’t react, though it’s hard not to wonder whether some in her government might’ve quietly scoffed.
The Washington Post ’s David Ignatius explained in his latest column that the American president and his allies have been “straining the covert alliance to the point that some insiders on both sides worry that trust and cooperation could eventually begin to erode.”
Former British officials believe that MI6 has begun to worry about sharing its most sensitive secrets with the United States, for fear that they may be disclosed by the Trump White House for political reasons, or through simple carelessness. This British concern about the U.S. ability to keep secrets predates Trump, but it has increased.
“You never know what Trump will say or do or tell in a rage, and that’s something to worry about,” says a former British official. “The U.S. has become a less reliable ally.”
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) suggested to Ignatius that the relationship will likely improve once Trump leaves office. He added, however, “There’s nothing I can say that will disabuse [U.S. allies] of concern about what this president might do with information that could be damaging to them.”
I continue to think this is one of the more under-appreciated problems with the Trump presidency.
As regular readers will probably recall , it was in May 2017, for example, that the American president welcomed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak into the Oval Office – at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin – for a visit that was never fully explained.
It was in this meeting that Trump revealed highly classified information to his Russian guests for no apparent reason. The Washington Post reported at the time, “The information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said.”
The Wall Street Journal added , “According to one U.S. official, the information shared was highly sensitive and difficult to acquire and was considered extraordinarily valuable.”
In a normal White House, this story would’ve been an enormous scandal that haunted the president for the rest of his term, but in the Trump era, it was soon eclipsed by a dozen other evolving controversies. Regardless, the leak happened, and the public has never received an explanation for why the president did what he did.
Less than a year later, Trump ignored the pleas of many U.S. officials and recklessly declassified information in the hopes of advancing a partisan scheme. All the while, the president refused to give up his unsecured smart phones , which create additional security risks.
About a month after Trump’s inauguration, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. intelligence officials were worried about the new president’s “trustworthiness” and “discretion.”
When foreign officials have similar concerns, it’s tough to blame them.

Why it matters that Pelosi wants to see Trump 'in prison' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-06-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-it-matters-pelosi-wants-see-trump-prison,"By Steve Benen As the intra-party debate over Donald Trump’s possible impeachment continues to unfold in Democratic circles, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) met privately yesterday with five committee chairs, each of whom are investigating White House controversies. One of the leaders, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) reportedly pressured Pelosi about opening a possible impeachment inquiry.
The Speaker still hasn’t budged, though according to a Politico report , she did point to a different outcome she’d prefer.
“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” Pelosi said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. Instead of impeachment, Pelosi still prefers to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and then prosecuted for his alleged crimes, according to the sources.
They said she was expressing solidarity with pro-impeachment Democrats who want to hold the president accountable while disputing the idea that it is now time to take that step. Pelosi has long argued that certain conditions must be met before Democrats begin impeachment – public support and strong bipartisan backing, neither of which have so far materialized.
It’s worth emphasizing that the reported quote was made behind closed doors, and Pelosi hasn’t said anything similar in public. It may also have been a throwaway line – an exaggeration the Speaker used to remind her members they aren’t the only ones who have a problem with Trump’s alleged misdeeds.
But it’s possible there was a little more to this. What if Pelosi was pointing to an alternative approach to presidential accountability?
As we’ve discussed , Trump has been implicated in a variety of alleged crimes, though as far as the Justice Department is concerned, Trump is shielded from prosecution so long as he’s in office. If he were to lose in 2020, however, that shield would disappear, and the prospect of an indictment would become quite real .
Indeed, by most accounts, the only way for Trump to ensure he faces no criminal liability is for him to remain president for another four years, effectively running out the clock on the statute of limitations.
If Pelosi said, “I want to see him in prison,” she may have been doing more than just expressing contempt for the Republican in the Oval Office. She may have also been signaling a way to hold Trump responsible for his alleged crimes in a way that would be more severe than impeachment.
In effect, the Speaker may have told her members, “We could focus on impeaching him, but the Senate wouldn’t remove him from office and nothing would change. Or we could focus on defeating him in 2020, at which point he could be indicted.”
Indeed, there’s a reason a growing number of Democratic presidential candidates are vowing not to pardon Trump if he loses next year and faces charges soon after.
To be sure, I haven’t spoken to Pelosi or her staff about this, and I’m admittedly speculating about the rationale of a behind-closed-doors quote. But it wouldn’t surprise me if the Speaker, clearly resistant to an impeachment push, starts pushing the “prison” option as an alternative for Democratic members who aren’t satisfied doing nothing.
Update : In case this isn’t obvious, if I’m right about Pelosi’s thinking, her plan may very be flawed . For example, Trump might win a second term. And even if he doesn’t, there may be all kinds of challenges associated with prosecuting a former president.
What’s more, though the Speaker may be trying to buy some additional time, I imagine impeachment proponents in the House will make the case for impeaching Trump and hoping for his eventual indictment. That said, Pelosi seems to believe impeachment will strengthen Trump’s position vis a vis the election, making it easier for him to prevail and end his legal jeopardy.

GOP leader demands the wrong kind of Russia investigation | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-06-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-leader-demands-the-wrong-kind-russia-investigation,"By Steve Benen Confronted with uncontested facts about the Russia scandal – a foreign adversary attacked our political system in order to put a Republican in power – Donald Trump and his team have increasingly tried to blame Barack Obama. After all, the argument goes, if the attack happened while the Democratic president was in office, then it stands to reason he’s responsible.
Last month, the Trump campaign went a little further down this road, claiming that Obama’s cyber-security team was “told to ‘stand down’ from countering Russian meddling,” deliberately allowing the Russian attack. That’s bonkers, of course, but it’s what the Republican president’s base was told anyway.
It’s against this backdrop that House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), the #2 Republican in the chamber, delivered remarks yesterday recommending an investigation – not into Trump’s misdeeds, but into the Obama administration’s actions during the 2016 election.
“We know Russia interfered with the elections. Why did the Obama administration allow Russia to interfere in the elections? That’s a question we should be probing. Why? Not just to go back in time, but to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
“How much time is being spent going and looking and seeing just exactly what Russia did to interfere with out election while Barack Obama was president?”
I’m not sure the far-right Louisianan has fully thought this one through.
It’s true that the investigatory focus has been on Team Trump’s alleged cooperation with our Russian attackers, the attack itself, and the president’s alleged efforts to obstruct the investigation while it was ongoing.
But if Scalise wants a related probe into what Obama tried to do in response to Moscow’s efforts, the GOP congressman may not like where the investigation ends up.
As regular readers know , the Obama White House, swayed by the evidence compiled by U.S. intelligence agencies, wanted bipartisan support to push back against Russian intrusion, and in mid-September 2016, the then-president dispatched counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, then-FBI Director James Comey, and then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to brief top members of Congress.
Obama didn’t want to be seen as using intelligence for partisan or electoral ends, so he sought a “ show of solidarity and bipartisan unity ” against foreign manipulation of our democracy.
That didn’t happen – because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused.
As the Washington Post previously reported , when national security officials told congressional leaders about Russia’s interference, it was McConnell who not only didn’t want to alert the public, he also questioned the validity of the intelligence.
If Scalise wants some kind of official inquiry into who interfered with the Obama administration’s efforts to push back against Russian election meddling, I have a hunch some Democrats would welcome the scrutiny.

Trump sends troops to improve 'aesthetic appearances' at the border | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-06-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-sends-troops-improve-aesthetic-appearances-the-border,"By Steve Benen The Washington Post reported last month on Donald Trump micro-managing construction of barriers along the U.S./Mexico border – including the color of the steel slats.
The article added that the president has shared his views “on the barrier’s properties, demanding that the structure be physically imposing but also aesthetically pleasing.” An administration official was quoted saying, “He thinks it’s ugly.”
It’s against this backdrop that CBS News reported yesterday that some U.S. military personnel have been deployed to paint a mile-long stretch of barriers.
Lawmakers were notified of the action on Wednesday in an email message from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which has asked the Pentagon multiple times in recent months to deploy troops near the southern border to support the agency as it faces an unprecedented surge of Central American families and unaccompanied children heading to or in between ports of entry.
According to the email, the text of which was provided to CBS News by a congressional aide, an unspecified number of service members were set to paint barriers in the California border town of Calexico.
The painting project, in a part of California the president recently visited , will reportedly last 30 days.
According to the email, the “primary purpose” of the project is “to improve the aesthetic appearance of the wall.”
Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) was among the many congressional Democrats who weren’t pleased with the news, calling it a “disgraceful misuse” of resources. The Illinois Dem added that the military “has more important work to do.”
Highlighting the broader conditions at the border, New York ’s Matt Stieb added , “It appears as if the Trump administration has found a metaphor for its crisis management strategies: slap a thin coat of paint over a small piece of the problem and let other hemorrhaging crises go unchecked.”

* Under the Hyde Amendment, federal funding for abortion has been illegal for many years, though many leading Democratic presidential contenders want to change the law. Former Vice President Joe Biden (D), at least for now, supports leaving the status quo in place , and as a result, he’s under fire from his rivals.
* New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), another White House candidate, wrote on Twitter yesterday, “[W]hen it comes to supporting American women on issues like repealing the Hyde Amendment, [Biden] is Dr. Jekyll.” I’m guessing the mayor meant Mr. Hyde?
* Speaking of Biden, his campaign was caught this week including others’ work without citation in his new climate plan, but Politico reports that other Democratic candidates have run into the same problem.

"In response to North Korean missiles, creates his own reality | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-06-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/response-north-korean-missiles-trump-creates-his-own-reality,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un (R) walks with US President Donald Trump (L) during a break in talks at their historic US-North Korea summit, at the Capella... Saul Loeb In response to North Korean missiles, Trump creates his own reality 06/06/19 12:35 PM By Steve Benen After North Korea’s recent ballistic missile tests, Donald Trump said in his initial response that he was “ not happy .” That position has apparently been amended to mean “not noticing.”
In April, about a week after the missile tests, the president pretended nothing had actually happened, telling reporters , “There’s been no tests. There’s been no nothing.”
Last week in Tokyo, while standing along Japanese Prime Minister Abe, it happened again. The Republican argued , “There have been no ballistic missiles going out,” which is only true if one overlooks the ballistic missiles North Korea recently launched, and which the American president initially said he didn’t like.
Yesterday in Ireland, it happened once more. Alongside Irish Prime Minister Varadkar, Trump told reporters , in response to a question about North Korea:
“When I became president, and before that, as you know, it was all the time: nuclear testing, ballistic missile testing. And now there’s nothing.”
Nothing except the ballistic missile testing that we all saw – and which Trump is already on record mildly criticizing.
The president’s strange rhetoric comes against a backdrop in which John Bolton, his own White House national security adviser, concluded that there’s “ no doubt ” the North Korean missile launches violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. Soon after, Pat Shanahan, Trump’s handpicked acting Defense secretary, came to the same conclusion .
Their boss, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to care. It’s worth considering why.
At face value, this may seem like a clumsy attempt at diplomacy: Trump is so desperate to reach some kind of nuclear agreement with Kim Jong-un that he’s willing to defend North Korea’s antics, no matter how provocative.
But I also believe the Republican feels the need to create an alternate reality because to acknowledge the facts would be to concede that his policy isn’t working. The Washington Post ’s David Ignatius had a good column along these lines last week:
Watching the clown show that has been President Trump’s foreign policy lately, you wonder whether there’s any coherent logic embedded in his erratic, internally conflicting statements about Iran, North Korea and other issues. And of course, there is: It’s the politics, stupid.
Trump is already in full campaign mode. In his quest for reelection, he doesn’t want to be seen to fail in anything. He wants to sound tough (popular) so long as it doesn’t get him into a war (unpopular).
Trump is polishing his résumé, claiming success for North Korea diplomatic negotiations that have gone nowhere. If that means contradicting national security adviser John Bolton and pretending that Pyongyang’s recent ballistic tests didn’t violate U.N. Security Council resolutions, fine, no problem. Just don’t call it a failure.
Evidently, it also means pretending the recent ballistic tests didn’t occur at all.

Why Trump's new attack on Mueller's 'correction' makes so little sense | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-06-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-new-attack-muellers-correction-makes-so-little-sense,"By Steve Benen On Sunday afternoon, as Donald Trump was presumably preparing for his European visit, the president took the time to publish a tweet attacking, among others, Special Counsel Robert Mueller. According to Trump, Mueller “had to correct his ridiculous statement.”
When I saw this over the weekend, I’d been away from my desk for a while, so I started looking around, trying to figure out what the president was referring to. I came up empty.
And yet, there was Trump again yesterday, publishing another tweet that referenced a “corrective letter” from Mueller.
So, what’s this all about? The Republican sat down with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham this morning in Normandy, and with the graves of war heroes serving as a backdrop, Trump expanded on his new attack against Mueller.
President Trump, in an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, said former Special Counsel Robert Mueller made “such a fool” out of himself last week when he delivered his first and only public statement about the Russia investigation. [..]
“Let me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself … because what people don’t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong,” Trump told Ingraham.
For now, let’s also put aside how offensive it is to see a U.S. president – in Normandy for the 75 anniversary of D-Day – go after Americans on foreign soil, with a military cemetery in the background.
Let’s instead pause to consider what in the world Trump is talking about.
To hear the president tell it, Mueller had to do a “letter” in order to “straighten out” what he said “because his testimony was wrong.” While I’ll concede that translating Trump to English can be a frustrating and painful exercise, I think I know what he was trying to say.
On Wednesday, May 29, Mueller announced that he was stepping down from his Justice Department role and took the opportunity to emphasize a series of points : Russia attacked our elections; obstruction of justice is a serious matter; he did not exonerate the president; and he believed he lacked the legal authority to indict a sitting president.
It was, to put it mildly, a rather brutal assessment for the White House.
Later that day, the Justice Department and the special counsel’s office clarified, “The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice…. The Special Counsel’s report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination – one way or the other – about whether the President committed a crime.”
This clarification was intended to resolve any discrepancies between Attorney General Bill Barr’s earlier remarks on the subject and Mueller’s. It did nothing to detract from Mueller’s findings.
But in Trump’s mind, this clarification was some kind of humiliating “correction” the special counsel was forced to issue.
Reality tells a very different story. Trump’s claims in Normandy this morning notwithstanding, Mueller didn’t have to write a “letter”; he didn’t offer “testimony”; nothing he said was “wrong”; and he certainly didn’t make “a fool out of himself.”
This is just a desperate president grasping at straws.

Trump flubs question on how to bring Americans together (again) | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-07-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-flubs-question-how-bring-americans-together-again,"U.S. President Donald Trump casts shadows on the wall as he walks with Poland's President Andrzej Duda at the end of a joint press conference, in Warsaw,... Czarek Sokolowski Trump flubs question on how to bring Americans together (again) 06/07/19 08:00 AM By Steve Benen On the 75th anniversary of D-Day, Donald Trump sat down with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in Normandy, with the graves of war heroes serving as a backdrop. The two covered a fair amount of ground, though I was especially interested in the president’s response when the far-right host asked, “What could you do to unite the country at a time of great polarization?”
Trump’s response was amazing in its Trumpiness.
“So, I think success should unite the country. But I will tell you, the more successful we’ve come, the more angry people like Nancy Pelosi, who don’t have what it takes, they don’t know what’s going on, they get angry.
“They should – an example is Mexico. I said, ‘We’re going to put tariffs on because we want you to help us, because they won’t pass any legislation in Congress.’ And I have senators and others and Pelosi coming out saying, ‘Oh, how horrible.’
“What they’re doing is they’re hurting the deal. They should be saying, ‘We’re with the president, we’ll do whatever he wants to do,’ and Mexico would fold like an umbrella. Now, I have these people and I’m saying there’s some Republicans too, I think they should be ashamed of themselves.
“But we have Pelosi, we have crying Chuck Schumer – who’s a disaster by the way, he’s a total political, you know, jerk – but we have Schumer, we have all these people, they come out and they talk about ‘tariffs are bad,’ so they can, you know, they hurt my negotiation, because I go into the room with the Mexicans, I’m asking them for everything.”
Remember, the question was, “What could you do to unite the country at a time of great polarization?” The president responded by lashing out at his perceived political enemies and suggesting that the key to harmony is having everyone agree to “do whatever” Trump wants.
Making matters slightly worse, this isn’t the first time he flubbed the question.
Last summer, Trump sat down with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo, who concluded the interview by asking, “As the Commander in Chief, as the president of this great country, what can you do to bring us together?”
As we discussed at the time, Trump could’ve responded with vague platitudes about shared principles, but instead he heralded his rabid Republican base as “incredible,” while condemning his critics as “dangerous.”
Two months later, in September 2018, Trump spoke to a television station in Montana and was asked about how best to bridge the divide among Americans. The president responded that Democrats are “making fools out of themselves” by opposing him.
When the Republican is asked about bringing Americans together – or at least trying to – the president routinely seems confused about the underlying point of the question. Asked about unity, Trump instinctively divides.
As the Washington Post ’s E.J. Dionne explained in a column last fall, “For Trump and his enablers, national unity is not a noble goal but a dire threat to their political well-being.”

"Despite Trump's recent boasts, job growth cools unexpectedly | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-07-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/despite-trumps-recent-boasts-job-growth-cools-unexpectedly,"By Steve Benen Ahead of this morning’s jobs report, most projections pointed to growth in May between 175,000 and 180,000 jobs. Unfortunately, the results fell far short of those rosy expectations.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this morning that the economy added just 75,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6%. The revisions from the previous two months were also disappointing: job totals from March and April were both revised down, subtracting 75,000 from previous reporting.
What’s especially discouraging about this latest report is that many assumed it would be inflated in the opposite direction: as Census hiring picks up, a variety of observers believed the overall total would appear deceptively good. Now that we’re seeing the preliminary data, that obviously didn’t happen.
As for the political implications, Donald Trump has now been in office for 28 full months – February 2017 through May 2019 – and in that time, the economy has created 5.4 million jobs. In the 28 full months preceding Trump’s presidency – October 2014 to January 2017 – the economy created 6.1 million jobs.
The Republican continues to tell the world that he’s overseeing the strongest domestic job growth in American history, which is plainly false. What’s more, the White House has not yet offered an explanation for why job growth has slowed since Trump took office.
Above you’ll find the chart I run every month, showing monthly changes in total jobs since the start of the Great Recession. The image makes a distinction: red columns point to monthly changes under the Bush and Trump administrations, while blue columns point to monthly job changes under the Obama administration.

Pentagon contradicts Trump on transgender troop ban | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-07-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pentagon-contradicts-trump-transgender-troop-ban,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump was asked this week to defend his ban on allowing transgender Americans to serve in the military. The president responded by pointing to a policy that doesn’t exist .
“You’re in the military, you’re not allowed to take any drugs,” Trump said after insisting that transgender Americans have to “take massive amounts of drugs.” He added, “And they have to after the operation. They have to. They have no choice. And you would actually have to break rules and regulations in order to have that.”
None of this was true. In fact, most of it was nonsensical: plenty of active-duty servicemen and women take prescription medications, including hormone therapy. For that matter, Trump assumed that all transgender people undergo surgery and/or take prescription hormones, and that’s wrong, too.
What was surprising, however, was the Pentagon’s willingness to acknowledge the president’s mistake. In response to a question from the Washington Post , a Defense Department spokesperson contradicted Trump’s claims on the record.
“The Military Health System covers all approved medically necessary treatments and prescription medications,” DOD spokeswoman Jessica Maxwell said. “If a service member has a hormone deficiency for any reason (such as hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, menopause, etc.), he or she would be prescribed hormones.”
Maxwell also assured that existing troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria before the transgender ban went into place in April “will continue to receive all medically necessary treatment.”
In case it’s not obvious, the Department of Defense does not routinely contradict the president publicly, and I can only hope spokeswoman Jessica Maxwell doesn’t face any adverse consequences for having told the Post the truth.
As for the larger point, as we discussed the other day, Trump has had 23 months to come up with an argument to defend his discriminatory policy. If he still can’t think of one after all this time, perhaps he should end the ban?

"Ignoring scandals, Trump says he's assembled 'one of the finest cabinets' | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-07-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-scandals-trump-says-hes-assembled-one-the-finest-cabinets,"By Steve Benen For his book on Donald Trump’s cabinet, author Alexander Nazaryan spoke to the president about the team he’d assembled. Yahoo News ran an item yesterday adapted from “The Best People: Trump’s Cabinet and the Siege on Washington.”
“There are those that say we have one of the finest Cabinets,” Trump claimed. That is not a commonly held view. In fact, it is difficult to think of anyone even halfway credible – Republican or Democrat – who has said anything approaching that. Even some of Trump’s most ardent supporters have expressed dismay at the people he has hired.
Trump was willing to concede that some of his cabinet members were “ clunkers ,” though he apparently didn’t elaborate or name names. In a way, that’s unfortunate, because I’d love to know to whom he was referring. Did he see James Mattis as a “clunker” because the former Pentagon chief didn’t consistently play ball with the White House political agenda? Would he make the same assessment about former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the same reason?
Or was Trump referring to some members of his team who departed under a cloud of scandal and suspected corruption?
I have no idea whether the president genuinely believes there are some unnamed observers who claim his cabinet is “one of the finest,” but I’d love to hear from such a person. Because by most measures, Trump’s cabinet is actually one of the more embarrassing.
We recently learned, for example, that David Bernhardt, a former corporate lobbyist for the oil industry, became the subject of an ethics investigation immediately after becoming the nation’s new Interior secretary. Federal prosecutors recently presented evidence to a grand jury on Ryan Zinke, Bernhardt’s predecessor.
As regular readers may recall , it was around the same time that we learned new details about Alex Acosta, Trump’s Labor secretary, who allegedly broke the law while shielding a politically connected sex trafficker.
About a year ago, NBC News published a list of Trump administration figures accused of crossing ethical and/or legal lines, and the list wasn’t at all short. It included familiar controversies involving former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, former HHS Secretary Tom Price, former regulatory adviser Carl Icahn, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, former CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.
That wasn’t an exhaustive list. As we discussed at the time, there have been related controversies surrounding Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and former VA Secretary David Shulkin.
While we’re at it, let’s also not overlook controversies surrounding Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and former FEMA Director Brock Long .
Even acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan faced an ethics probe.
Who, exactly, is prepared to argue Trump’s cabinet is “one of the finest”?

"Friday's Campaign Round-Up, 6.7.19 | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-07-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fridays-campaign-round-6719,"By Steve Benen Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country.
* One day after Joe Biden’s campaign said the Democrat hadn’t changed his position on the Hyde Amendment, the former vice president announced last night that he now opposes the law that prevents federal funding for abortion.
* Common Cause, pointing to newly uncovered files from deceased Republican operative Thomas Hofeller, raised provocative allegations yesterday: Republicans in North Carolina, the group claimed, “misled a federal court in 2017 to extend the life of their state legislative district map.”
* As expected, Rep. Greg Gianforte (R) filed the paperwork yesterday to run for governor in Montana next year, following his defeat for the same office in 2016. Gianforte is perhaps best known for assaulting a journalist during a congressional campaign and misleading the police about the incident.
* Though it looked as if Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) had made the cut for the upcoming Democratic presidential debates, the DNC isn’t counting one of the polls that apparently made him eligible to participate. Barring some 11th-hour good news for his campaign, the governor won’t qualify.
* In Texas, former state Sen. Wendy Davis (D), whose gubernatorial campaign fell short in 2014, is now moving forward with plans to run against Rep. Chip Roy (R) next year. Roy currently represents Texas’ 21st congressional district, which is an R+10 district, suggesting Davis will face an uphill climb.
* Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) has pushed for Democratic presidential hopefuls to participate in a debate focused exclusively on the climate crisis. The DNC doesn’t want to depart from the agreed upon debate schedule, though Inslee is apparently prepared to defy the party and organize an unsanctioned event on his own.
* Last year, Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) faced progressive criticism when he remained neutral in Gina Ortiz Jones’s (D) race against Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas). This week, the congressman-turned-presidential-candidate said he’ll support Ortiz Jones in the 2020 rematch, his friendship with Hurd notwithstanding.
* And fans of former Sen. Lincoln Chafee will be interested to know he’s changed parties again. As an elected official in Rhode Island, Chafee was a Republican, then an independent, and then a Democrat. Now, however, Chafee has moved to Wyoming, where’s he’s registered as a Libertarian .

Auto industry to Trump: You're going the wrong way on emissions | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,06-07-2019,2019,6,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/auto-industry-trump-youre-going-the-wrong-way-emissions,"Traffic moves north along Interstate 270, Nov. 24, 2010, in Clarksburg, Md., the day before the Thanksgiving Holiday. Photo by Carolyn Kaster/AP Auto industry to Trump: You’re going the wrong way on emissions 06/07/19 12:59 PM By Steve Benen In Barack Obama’s first term, the administration came to a fairly obvious conclusion: to address the climate crisis, we’re going to need to reduce emissions, and in the United States, the #1 source of carbon pollution is transportation. With that in mind, the Democratic White House created tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, to be phased in gradually.
Manufacturers, not surprisingly, weren’t thrilled, but there was a broad realization that the policy, in conjunction with a series of related efforts, would make a positive difference.
Then Donald Trump got elected. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.
By way of a defense, the Trump administration said the new policy would improve auto safety – which as we discussed at the time, makes about as much sense as it sounds.
Nevertheless, the Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. But the New York Times reports today on an unexpected twist: auto manufacturers believe the White House’s anti-climate plans have gone too far.
The world’s largest automakers warned President Trump on Thursday that one of his most sweeping deregulatory efforts – his plan to weaken tailpipe pollution standards – threatens to cut their profits and produce “untenable” instability in a crucial manufacturing sector.
In a letter signed by 17 companies including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volvo, the automakers asked Mr. Trump to go back to the negotiating table on the planned rollback of one of President Barack Obama’s signature policies to fight climate change.
The problem for the industry has become a practical one: Trump intends to go so far in gutting pollution safeguards that many states intend to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.
That includes, naturally, California – home to the nation’s largest consumer base.
The result is an exceedingly messy economic dynamic, in which car manufacturers in the United States – which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era policy – will have to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.
Not surprisingly, no one sees that as a sustainable business model.
The industry seems to realize this is a mess it helped create: companies wanted Trump to roll back Obama-era standards, so he did. What manufacturers didn’t realize is (a) how far the Republican would go; and (b) what would happen if they got what they wanted.
Complicating matters, of course, there’s a decent chance a Democrat will win the presidency next year, at which point he or she will likely abandon Trump’s pro-pollution posture and go back to the auto industry with some thoughts about even more stringent emissions rules.
The industry wants the White House to negotiate some kind of deal with California, with the intention of creating a national standard that everyone can live with. That seems unlikely: Team Trump broke off talks with the Golden State months ago, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has rejected the idea of halfway measures.
