Joe Biden Leads Bernie Sanders By 24 Points In Polls | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/joe-biden-leads-bernie-sanders-by-24-points-in-first-poll-since-campaign-launch/,"April 30, 2019 10:06 AM Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigns in Pittsburgh, Pa., April 29, 2019 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
Former vice president Joe Biden took a double digit lead over Senator Bernie Sanders in one of the first polls conducted after Biden announced his bid for the presidency on Thursday.
Biden leads Sanders by 24 percentage points, an 11-point jump from the still sizable lead he held over the Vermont Democrat before making his presidential campaign official, according to a CNN poll released Tuesday. Advertisement Advertisement
About 39 percent of voters said they are leaning towards voting for Biden, compared to only 28 percent in March. Meanwhile, Sanders is at 15 percent among voters.
Of Democratic voters, almost half, 46 percent, said it is “extremely important” that the party’s nominee must be able to beat President Trump in 2020. Only 31 percent put that much emphasis on the candidate having the right experience to be president, and about 25 percent said it was very important that the nominee be willing to work on a bipartisan basis with his political opponents to accomplish his objectives.

Venezuela Coup: Operation Freedom | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/venezuela-coup-crisis-enters-new-phase/,"
It looks like the crisis is entering a new phase :
The leader of Venezuela’s opposition, Juan Guaido, on Tuesday declared he was “beginning the final phase of Operation Freedom” after a dawn address in which he was flanked by men in military fatigues and armored vehicles in the capital Caracas.
Venezuela’s Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez called Guaido’s action a “coup” on Twitter , adding that the government is “deactivating a small number of traitorous military personnel.”
“We call on the people to remain in maximum alert so that, together with the glorious Bolivian armed forces, we defeat this attempted coup and preserve peace. We will win,” he said.

Today, I have an Impromptus column , beginning with the question of national unity. I take off from Jonah Goldberg’s superb essay on this question, published on Friday. I move on to the Confederacy (speaking of national unity), trade, and other issues, several of them touchy.
If not here, where? We’re not snowflakes, right?
I thought we’d have a little mail. In yesterday’s column , I had an item about golf and honor. I mentioned one of my favorite pieces of journalism from the entire Clinton era: “ Bill’s Bad Lie ,” by Byron York. Its subheading was “The way he plays golf tells you more about his character than any special prosecutor ever will.” Rick Reilly, the veteran sportswriter, has just published a book about the incumbent president and golf.
A reader of ours writes,
I was a horrible golfer who loved the game and its character … Long ago I was working for GE and we did a great deal of business in plastics with Japanese companies. To my knowledge, we never worked with any company before we played golf with them. They would bring their clubs halfway around the world to play, and I am convinced that they used the round to determine if you were the kind of person that could be trusted.
The game was also the genesis of the most polite insult I ever received. We had just played the front nine and had stopped for a drink when the president of one of our customers turned to me and said, “You must work very, very hard.” It was said with a warm, kind smile. Alas, it was very, very true.
Marvelous. Advertisement
In an Impromptus on Monday , I had a long note on Tiger Woods, which included this passage: “At some level, the game takes place between the ears. (This is why golf is so hard to depict in movies. There has practically never been a good golf movie.) Tiger won the Masters, as he has other tournaments, with his mental game.”
A reader says, in essence, “What about Tin Cup (the Kevin Costner movie from 1996)? That is a movie that gets at the mental game.” I wrote about this movie at the time of its premiere: here . I was not particularly generous to it. Maybe I should see it again and be more generous? Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Yesterday, I had a note , or two , on applause: In a concert hall, when should you applaud? When should you not? A reader writes,
I have a great friend who, years ago, studied music and performance at university. He came from a somewhat impoverished background, with many brothers and sisters, and was the only one who attended college. He played a junior-year piano recital, and, of course, the family came to see him.
They burst into applause at the end of every section, and included some whistles and calls. More than a few professors looked shocked — but not my friend’s piano professor. He started jumping up and applauding as the family did. I think he did it to make the family feel welcome — the mark of a gentleman.
My friend is a teacher and performer today. He recounts this story and the mentorship of that caring professor as a great influence and blessing in his life.
Fantastic. Relatedly, I got a note from Kevin Williamson, who said,
You must know the story about Queen Victoria and the visiting foreign dignitary (the Maharani of Jaipur, in most versions) who doesn’t know what a finger bowl is for, and picks it up and drinks it. Nervous looks all around until the Queen picks up hers and drinks it, too. That’s having perfect manners.
Yes — perfect.
In one of my columns, I wrote about Stephen King, in relation to Game of Thrones . In an aside, I said, “One of my friends, when he was in college, or maybe before, read a Stephen King novel twice. That was The Stand . A very long novel, too. I remember thinking, ‘What high praise, for a book — to have read it twice, when there is so much else to read.’ Since that time, I have thought about reading The Stand . Maybe I will.”
A reader writes,
I do not read much fiction anymore as a matter of choice. I did, however, read a lot of fiction as a teenager. There were a few years when all I read was Stephen King. I will say, at nearly 1,200 pages, The Stand is daunting. But if you have the time and would like to be thoroughly entertained by a classic story of good men doing their best against evil, I would give it a try.
Later on, he says, “One final note on the 1,200 pages of The Stand : I’ve read the book three times and I’m due for a fourth.”
Wow. What a phenomenal tribute, to pay to a book.
In an “ England Journal ,” I wrote of an old friend, who had a memory of a teacher long ago. She (the teacher) did not like it when her students began a sentence with “Well …” (“Well” was the “Like” of its time.) She would say, “Well? What well? I don’t see a well, do you?” A reader now writes, “My wife says that when she was a kid and started a sentence with ‘Well …,’ her parents would say, ‘That is a deep subject!’” "

(Carlos Barria/REUTERS) Making the click-through worthwhile: An uprising in Venezuela, a reminder that fear has been a powerful force in shaping American politics and culture well before 9/11, Joe Biden gets a big polling boost against his Democratic rivals, and the NRA Board of Directors meets for nine hours but doesn’t want to tell anyone what was discussed. The Push to Topple Maduro Appears to Have Begun Heads up, the situation Venezuela could get even more volatile quickly : “Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó took to the streets with activist Leopoldo Lopez and a small contingent of heavily armed troops early Tuesday in a bold and risky call for the military to rise up and oust socialist leader Nicolas Maduro.” Sometimes when the people rise up against an autocratic and brutal regime, you get the end of Nicolae Ceaușescu in Romania; sometimes you get Tiananmen Square. Let’s pray for the former. Gordon Chang predicts , “Maduro will fall today if soldiers don’t follow orders.” Good luck, Venezuelans. You deserve better than the awful Socialist-kleptoracy you’ve had forced upon you; if this uprising works out, better days are ahead. Fear Showed Up at Our Doorstep a Long Time Ago David Brooks, writing this morning in The New York Times : I wonder if we’ve fully grasped how fear pervades our society and sets the emotional tone for our politics. When historians define this era they may well see it above all else as a time defined by fear. The era began on Sept. 11, 2001, a moment when a nation that had once seemed invulnerable suddenly felt tremendously unsafe. In the years since, the shootings have been a series of bloody strikes out of the blue. Really? Two years before 9/11 was the Columbine shootings. The same year, EgyptAir flight 990 out of New York City crashed into the Atlantic Ocean with a calm co-pilot at the controls. John F. Kennedy and his wife died in a plane crash the same year; the following year the U.S.S. Cole was bombed. I really dislike the interpretation of history that views the 1990s as the happy times interrupted by the 9/11 attacks on George W. Bush’s watch. As I discuss in my forthcoming book — ominous foreshadowing, watch this space — there was a real darkness to the zeitgeist of the 1990s. A lot of Clinton-aligned political and cultural voices like to paint that decade as a big national party, a rollicking cavalcade of dot-com profits, harmless presidential sex scandals and wildly embarrassing dance crazes. Look a little closer and you see plenty of ill omens, and it feels utterly bizarre to see a period you lived through get so edited and airbrushed in modern reinterpretations. In the early 1990s, we found out that some guy in Milwaukee had been eating people for more than a decade. In 1997, Heaven’s Gate cult committed mass suicide with the arrival of the Hale-Bopp Comet. Two years earlier, Aum Shinrikyo cult released sarin in the Tokyo subway system, killing 13 and injuring more than 1,000 people. Two years before that, David Koresh brought his Branch Davidian followers to a fiery end after a standoff with federal law enforcement. I know people think that the news environment is busy today, but think of the summer of 1996: On June 15, a massive bomb from the Irish Republican Army explodes in Manchester and injures 200 people. On June 25, 19 U.S. Air Force personnel were killed Khobar Towers and hundreds injured; on July 17, TWA Flight 800 crashed off Long Island, with a great deal of speculation about terrorism (the official investigation concluded an explosion of fuel vapors); on July 27, Centennial Park at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta was bombed. Around this time, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was investigating a series of suspicious church fires across the South . The sex scandals weren’t always the stuff of political farce; a murder-minded “Long Island Lolita” become a national anti-hero with three made-for-TV movies about her; the biggest stars in Hollywood feared the revelation of their names in the black book of an infamous madam; and Los Angeles crowds cheered a wife-beating double-murderer on the run. With the first World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing, mass-casualty terrorism arrived on American soil in the 1990s. Los Angeles burned from riots in April 1992. Whether you wanted to know about it or not, you were inundated with coverage of John Wayne Bobbitt, Tonya Harding, Woody Allen’s relationship with Soon-Yi Previn, Marv Albert, and the allegations against Michael Jackson. Something dark and twisted was working its way through the American psyche in those years. It’s not surprising that The X-Files was a hit; it tapped into this mood that while things may have seemed prosperous and peaceful, something much more dangerous and sinister was lurking underneath. Fear’s been here a long time. What if the Democratic Field Narrows Early? Because the Democratic field is going to be huge — 20 candidates — one of the big questions is, how do primary voters react when instead of the usual five-to-ten candidates, they’re faced with so many? Right now, they’re looking at the political equivalent of the menu from the Cheesecake Factory. One possibility is that just as you can be overwhelmed with choices in the cereal aisle of the supermarket and default to your standard old favorite of Cheerios, maybe the Democratic electorate never really engages with the lesser-known candidates. They stick to what they know they like, and most of the field never really gets a chance. "

Reproductive MD Association Okays Providing Care Doctors Know Won't Work | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J. Smith,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/reproductive-md-association-okays-providing-care-doctors-know-wont-work/,"April 30, 2019 11:03 AM (Unsplash)
“ Futile-care ” ethics controversies generally involve doctors who want to withdraw or refuse wanted life-extending treatment they deem “ inappropriate. ” In reality, these interventions aren’t opposed because they don’t work, but because they do — they keep the patient alive when the doctor thinks that the patient would be better off expiring. Thus, these disputes actually involve value judgments rather than bona fide medical determinations.
There is another kind of “ futile care ” — known as “ physiological futility ” — in which doctors provide interventions that they know won’t work , but they do it anyway because the patient wants it. Doctors aren’t supposed to do that, but they sometimes do — such as when prescribing antibiotics for a viral infection even though the drugs only work against bacteria.
Still, I have never seen any medical society actually approve members providing useless interventions — until now. From a newly published opinion of the Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (my emphases):
Situations may arise where the clinician fairly determines that treatment has little or no chance of resulting in pregnancy and live birth , but the patient nonetheless requests it in order only to receive a psychological beneﬁt or to fulﬁll a religious belief . Beneﬁts such as resolving questions about their fertility, being able to have hope, obtaining closure, acting in accord with their faith, and knowing they tried assiduously can be valid goals for limited treatment. Thus, an unsuccessful outcome, while disappointing, may still bring beneﬁt from the patient’s perspective, although the amount of beneﬁt should be weighed carefully against the physical risks and costs of treatment.
The opinion blesses doctors refusing to provide such interventions, and one would hope so! But it also approves providing treatments that — remember — won’t work, to make the patient feel better:
The Ethics Committee also ﬁnds that clinicians may ethically offer treatments they deem to be physiologically futile in circumstances where the risks are minimal, and the understood goal of the patient is to receive a psychological beneﬁt from proceeding. In such a case, the patient’s general welfare may be enhanced by a limited attempt at treatment , a goal still compatible with the duty of beneﬁcence understood in its psychosocial dimension.
No. This comes close to quackery. It is to sanction taking advantage of desperate people — and not coincidentally, for a large payday — knowing that the patient is pursuing a hopeless course. And we can’t forget that some fertility interventions can have potentially risky side effects.
Patients retain fertility doctors to help them have babies, not provide “ psychological benefits. ” If a patient demands expensive and potentially risky interventions just to feel better, a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist would seem to be the truly ethical approach. That’s called being a professional.
It also seems to me that it would be fraud if a doctor billed an insurance company or the government for providing what the doctor knows to be a physiologically futile intervention. Advertisement"

Less than a week after entering the Democratic presidential primary, former vice president Joe Biden is running substantially ahead of the other 19 primary candidates, according to a new poll from CNN out this morning. The poll shows Biden with a 24-point lead over his next-closest competitor, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, among Democratic voters or voters who lean Democrat, with 39 percent support to Sanders’s 15 percent.

Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren comes in third with just 8 percent of the vote, and South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been polling in third place behind Biden and Sanders for the last several weeks, sinks to fourth place at 7 percent.
Though Biden has been the frontrunner in most national surveys over the last couple of months — even before he officially announced his candidacy — his lead over Sanders is something of a surprise. In past polls, Biden had the edge over the rest of the field but usually by single digits, and one Emerson poll in mid April even showed Sanders with a five-point lead. Stay Updated with NR Daily

The detailed polling data from CNN’s new survey is also intriguing, showing Biden maintaining his substantial lead among voters in nearly every category. Among non-college grads, 46 percent support Biden while just 14 percent said they support Sanders. Among college grads, the split narrows, with Biden at 27 percent, Sanders at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 12 percent, and Warren at 11 percent. Advertisement"

The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a state law banning drug-induced abortions is unconstitutional, the Associated Press reported.
The Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice had challenged the 2014 law , which banned the “off label” use of the abortion-inducing drug mifepristone, on the grounds that it forced doctors to rely on a sub-optimal, antiquated drug regimen last approved by the FDA in 2000, rather than the more recent 2016 protocol.
By requiring doctors to adhere to the older protocol, the law effectively restricted the use of drug-induced abortions in women who have been pregnant for more than 49 days. The newer protocol allows women to take a smaller dose of mifepristone up to 70 days into gestation."

(Brian Snyder/Reuters) If they’ll let him, which is far from certain.
J oe Biden’s announcement of his candidacy for president must be seen as the last stand of forces trying to prevent the Democratic party from descending in a power dive into a mighty bonfire of the far Left. That party’s only plan of action since Election Day 2016 has been to attempt to destroy Trump, and that tactic survived even the complete dismissal of the Trump–Russia collusion canard and the declination of leaders of the Justice Department to accuse the president of obstruction of justice (for the reason that no ingredients for a prosecution existed). The replacement tactic was to invent the argument that Special Counsel Mueller had invited the House of Representatives to consider whether there was a case for obstruction, which was all they needed to fill the calendar from now to the next election with antagonistic hearings with Trump-administration and Trump-entourage witnesses who would be taunted and baited and harassed as if being turned on a spit. The administration has announced that none of the House subpoenas will be honored, and no more administration witnesses will be permitted to appear. Advertisement Advertisement
Few media commentators seem to notice the pattern that has developed, of Trump’s enemies taking very declarative positions in opposition to the administration and then being outmaneuvered. It was only a few months ago that the official Democratic position from Speaker Pelosi was that the illegal-immigration crisis was a “fake crisis made up by the president” and a border wall was “immoral.” There was a government shutdown over funding for the wall. The president declared an emergency and took all the money he said he needed to build the wall amid Democratic howls of impending vengeance in the courts. The consensus seems to be that the administration’s legal case is a strong one and the courts may not be so amenable to litigious Democratic congressmen. Advertisement
Attempted illegal entries across the southern border have soared; Obama’s homeland-security secretary, Jeh Johnson, has endorsed the President Trump’s view; and even Tom Friedman of the New York Times , one of the president’s harshest critics, agrees that there is a crisis. He continues to attack the president for not producing comprehensive reform, though Trump has advocated substantial improvements to the immigration “system” (the quotation marks are Friedman’s). This will presumably await the next election. In the meantime, the wall is being built. This was Trump’s most memorable election promise, and, according to polls, it’s the first priority of voters.
Now the promise, touted across the media for a febrile ten days following release of the Mueller report, for a profound examination of the virtues of impeachment of the president, while the scores or even hundreds of witnesses interviewed by the Mueller inquiry are recycled through the Schiff-Nadler baiting pits in the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, has also vanished. The initial, customary cry of recourse to the courts has subsided, as the president has a strong case there also. President Eisenhower took a similar position opposite Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, and his witnesses had not been vetted and examined, as this president’s have. Schiff and Nadler are in no higher category of legislative and judicial distinction than was McCarthy. Trump is pushing the Democrats’ impeachment threat back in their faces. They can impeach (if they are insane), make an unpromising trek to the courts, or move on to the next source of confected outrage. Advertisement
As is almost always the case, I was in some agreement with my esteemed friend Peggy Noonan when she wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday that Trump might have got half of Washington on his side if he had made any overtures to it and shown any deference or even interest in the retired Washington establishment, which does have a collective influence in establishing the ambiance of the capital’s political community, which in turn is somewhat reflected in the media. Peggy has the experience of President Reagan, who was dreaded and disparaged before he arrived, but who, as only he could do, charmed most of the Washington establishment. Something similar, in a much less hostile atmosphere, was achieved by President Eisenhower. But it never clicked for President Nixon, even when he dazzled Washington and the country with his achievements and made a conciliatory effort, all well before the Watergate debacle got any traction. Advertisement Advertisement
I am no authority on the inner workings of Washington, and I defer to those who are. But Donald Trump didn’t arrive in Washington as those others did, and he is the tip of the spear of much greater public discontent than those former presidents. President Eisenhower was a world historic figure before he took the oath. He had a mandate to end the Korean War and run a scandal-free government; he did that. Richard Nixon was inaugurated president of a very divided and angry country, and he addressed the sources of the unrest: He completed desegregation and avoided busing schoolchildren into remote neighborhoods for court-ordered racial balance, and he withdrew from Vietnam while preserving a non-Communist government in Saigon. President Reagan had a mandate to reduce taxes, rebuild defense, and end the perceived appeasement of the USSR, and he did so. Advertisement Advertisement
Donald Trump’s right to govern has never been conceded by the Democrats or much of the media, and for the first six months of his term, the Republican congressional leadership seemed to be waiting to see if he really was likely even to serve out his term. I certainly am one of those who wish that the president would be more emollient at times, and perhaps more fluent. But he is a more articulate speaker than Truman, Eisenhower (though Ike’s verbal confusion was frequently deliberate), Johnson, Ford, Carter, and the Bushes. My suspicion is that if he had made peace offerings to the old Washington hands, it would have been scorned as the inelegant self-ingratiation of a preemptively compromised president, not as an olive branch from the incoming rightful leader."

Harold Schaitberger, president of the AFL-CIO-affiliated International Association of Firefighters, declared at a campaign rally for Joe Biden today that “Joe Biden is genuine. There’s nothing phony or artificial about Joe Biden.”
This is a spectacularly audacious claim about one of Washington’s most notorious BS artists.
A few days ago, Biden declared on The View , “We were asked, what are you proudest of from your administration? You know what I said — he said the same thing as I did. No one single whisper of scandal. That’s because of Barack Obama.” Advertisement Advertisement
Perhaps Biden believes there was no whisper of scandal because there was so much shouting about veterans dying while waiting for care at the Department of Veterans Affairs; the “Fast and Furious” gunwalking operation at the ATF; the dysfunctional launch of Healthcare.gov; the Syrian “red line”; Benghazi; the hacking of Office of Personnel Management records ; the IRS targeting of conservative and Tea Party groups ; other government agencies harassing and targeting the president’s critics ; drunkenness and reckless behavior at the U.S. Secret Service . . .
In 2016, he said Trump’s policy in the Middle East would be “to go carpet bomb innocent people.” Whether or not you like Trump’s policies, that is not an accurate description of what Trump proposed on the campaign trail or enacted in office. He’s accused Trump of trying to cut nearly $1 trillion from the Medicare program — not true . Advertisement
Biden insists that he’s been “referred to for the last 35 years in Washington as Middle-Class Joe,” despite no record of anyone else ever calling him that . He proclaimed that he didn’t “own a single stock or bond . . . I have no savings accounts.” His wife Jill had plenty of stock and bond investments and the couple had five savings accounts in both their names. Advertisement
In the 2008 vice-presidential debate , he claimed that the U.S. had teamed up with France to kick Syria out of Lebanon, that the U.S. spends more in Iraq in one month than it had in Afghanistan in six or seven years, and cited recently visiting a restaurant that had been out of business for decades.
In the 2012 vice-presidential debate , he suggested that he had voted against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars when he had in voted for them, understated the income level for the Obama tax hikes by $800,000, claimed that no one had told the Obama administration that U.S. diplomatic posts in Libya wanted more security, and claimed that Obamacare had somehow created $716 billion in new funding that was now being applied to Medicare.

S tudents at Columbia College are upset that white students were cast in the roles of Latino and Palestinian characters in a play — even though no Palestinian students auditioned.
The play, called HOME/LAND , is about the “the stories of Latinx and Palestinian immigration to America” and is “based on interviews with Chicago-based immigrants,” according to an article in The Chronicle , the school’s student newspaper. Advertisement Advertisement
The news source reports that the play’s (black) director, Theater Department associate professor Catherine Slade, ignored students’ issues with white actors being cast in Latino and Palestinian roles, made insensitive racial statements during production, and tried to change the script in ways that some felt perpetuated stereotypes about immigrants.
“From the get-go, it felt disrespectful,” Assistant Stage Manager Amy Gerwert-Valdez told The Chronicl e. “It got to a place where nobody felt safe; no one was comfortable with her.”
“There was no trying to collaborate with us; there was no trying to see if [she was] doing the right thing. It almost felt like we were just being used as pawns,” another student and cast member, Sophia Alonzo, said. “It’s hard because these are real stories to our families and our background that were [not treated as] valid.” Advertisement
Gerwert-Valdez said that among the racially insensitive things that Slade had said was a comment that Palestinian people “are just white people,” adding that Slade also had allegedly spoken badly about the cast in general. Another student and cast member, Gabriel Chinchilla, said that he had perceived insensitivity when white actors read lines in Spanish.
Columbia’s News Office released the following statement about the controversy to The Chronicle :
The Theatre Department is committed to providing students with opportunities to perform in diverse theatre productions. The ‘HOME/LAND’ script called for Latinx, Palestinian and Caucasian characters. All students who auditioned were cast in the production. However, not all of the students who auditioned were of the same race and/or ethnicity as the characters identified in the script. Indeed, no Palestinian students auditioned for the play, and as such, non-Palestinian actors were assigned to those roles. Several Latinx students who initially auditioned for the production didn’t pursue participation.
Now, I can admit that I was not actually present at any of this play’s rehearsals or reads, so I have absolutely no way of knowing whether Slade had truly been offensive or rude apart from the comments that were specifically listed. I am also not condoning the comments that were reported, if it is true that Slade did actually say them.
At the same time though, I truly believe that at least one of these students’ complaints — that white actors were cast to play Palestinian characters — to be completely absurd. Yes, it would obviously be better to give Palestinian students the opportunity to play Palestinian characters, but seeing as no Palestinian students tried out , what was Slade supposed to do? Summon a genie and wish for some of them to try out? Cancel the production altogether? Honestly, I am very unclear about what exactly they would have wished for her to have done in this case.

Mike Pompeo: Russians Convinced Nicolas Maduro Not to Flee Venezuela | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/pompeo-claims-russians-convinced-maduro-not-to-flee-venezuela/,"April 30, 2019 5:57 PM Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro takes part in a ceremony in Caracas, April 13, 2019. (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claims that embattled Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro was planning to flee the country amid a violent coup attempt that began Tuesday morning, but was convinced to cling to power by Russian authorities, who continue to support his socialist regime.
“It’s been a long time since anyone has seen Maduro. He had an airplane on the tarmac, he was ready to leave this morning as we understand it and the Russians indicated he should stay,” Pompeo told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer . “We think the situation remains incredibly fluid. We know that there were senior leaders inside the Maduro government that were prepared to leave. They told us as much over the past few weeks and we’re convinced that the Venezuelan people are going to get their democracy back.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says it's time for Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro to ""leave,"" adding, ""He has no answers for the Venezuelan people and the United States is determined to assist the Venezuelan people in restoring democracy."" https://t.co/2HqNiWl5mI pic.twitter.com/ABKymlOarn

Pompeo, who expressed the Trump administration’s enthusiastic support for the anti-government protesters Tuesday morning, said Maduro initially planned to flee his home country to Cuba, where he enjoys support for the communist government.
“We’ve made clear all along, Wolf, that Maduro is surrounded by Cubans and has been supported by Russians there in Venezuela. And we’ve told the Russians and we’ve told the Cubans, ‘that’s unacceptable.’ It’s unacceptable to starve people, it’s unacceptable to not allow sick children to get their medicine,” he said.
White House national security adviser John Bolton also cautioned Russia against continuing to provide economic and military aid to Maduro’s forces in comments to reporters on Tuesday. “We’ve made it clear to Russia in both public and private statements . . . that we regard the actions they’ve taken in Venezuela as something we regard with the utmost seriousness” Bolton said. Bolton and Pompeo were joined in their condemnation by Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who said the U.S. would hold Russia and Cuba “accountable” if any harm comes to Guaido. “Anything that happens to Guaidó, by the Maduro government, we hold you accountable,” Graham told reporters Tuesday . “Maduro would be gone a long time ago if it weren’t for the Russians, and we need to make a very firm statement that Maduro is going to go, and that I’m glad we’re behind this uprising. But we need to put Cuba and Russia on notice that if any violence is directed toward Guaidó to try to arrest him or kill him, then we’re going to hold Russia and Cuba liable, and we will respond appropriately, and all options are on the table.” The Kremlin, meanwhile, has blamed the anti-government protesters led by Guaido for the violence and disorder that seized the country on Tuesday.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who was elected interim president by the country’s National Assembly earlier this year, called on his supporters to take to the streets Tuesday to protest the starvation and poverty that have taken root under Maduro’s socialist regime."

Representative Ro Khana (D., Calif.) chastised Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday for encouraging anti-government protesters in Venezuela in their efforts to overthrow socialist president Nicolás Maduro.
“The vice president shouldn’t be interfering or inciting violence with Guaidó,” Khana said during an interview on MSNBC, referring to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who called on his supporters to overthrow Maduro on Tuesday.
“What we should be doing is deferring to the Pope to have a negotiated settlement or Uruguay or Mexico,” he continued. “It looks like the United States is inching into yet another bloody conflict and this is not going to be easy. Venezuela is one of the most armed nations in the world, 1.6 millions militias [ sic ] . The military appears divided between Maduro and Guaido and the question is: Is this the United States’s role to get involved in yet another war overseas?” The Vice President has no place inciting violence in Venezuela.

As Khana noted, the loyalty of the Venezuelan military appears to be divided between Maduro and Guaido, leaving the fate of the nation uncertain.
Pro-government forces have used mostly non-lethal means, including tear gas and rubber bullets, to put down the protests, but they have resorted to lethal violence in some circumstances. One video of the protests shows an armored vehicle accelerating into a crowd of anti-government protesters who breached a barrier near the La Carlota air-force base, where soldiers rebelled to join the opposition Tuesday morning."
'Game of Thrones': Notes on the Battle of Winterfell | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/game-of-thrones-battle-of-winterfell-magic-mysticism/,"April 30, 2019 6:13 PM The Night King in Game of Thrones (HBO) I don’t mind that David is more a fan than a critic. The world is a big place. And, frankly, it needs more people with the capacity to take joy in things and fewer who start from the assumption that the joy should be dissected for close and clinical examination or who believe that the smartest interpretation is the one that says the intended message is the wrongest one. There’s room for Sonny Bunch and there’s room for David’s bunches of sunniness. David should have a pop culture Twitter handle called @ComfortablyUpbeat. Still, one of the areas where our tastes differ is on the value of spectacle for spectacle’s sake. For instance, David loved the underwater battle scene in Aquaman with the laser sharks and the things with the stuff all over the place. I didn’t. But I did like the battle for Winterfell. But not entirely for the reasons David did. Spoilers ahead my friends. Before I get to that, I was vexed by how dark it was. Some are blaming the cable companies . On one very narrow and petty level, I welcome any opportunity to vilify the cable companies. But if it was not the producers’ intention to have the first half be downright opaque — and apparently it wasn’t — they should have anticipated the problem given that it was undoubtedly the most expensive — and most anticipated — battle scene in the history of television. Someone might have said, “Hey, let’s look at this the way millions of our biggest fans are going to experience it and make sure it checks out.” Some other minor notes. Let it be remembered that I was right in my predictions that the Dothraki were going to get wiped out and that the crypt was going to become an abattoir once the Night King deployed his necromancy. I was surprised Brienne and Grey Worm survived because I was pretty confident that the knighting of Brienne and Grey Worm’s “I’m gonna take you to the Bahamas when this is all over” promise were dead give-aways they were going to end up fighting for the dead. In general, I think the producers chickened out by letting so many survive. But maybe they have sufficiently cool plans in store for the remaining episodes that it’ll make sense. I suspected Jaime would survive because there was that almost gratuitous scene enlisting Braun to dispatch her brothers if they should survive. Why have that scene unless they plan on it leading to something? I agree with David that Arya’s role as the killer of the Night King was long foreshadowed and it didn’t bother me very much (On the other hand, I thought the way they developed Arya’s character over the previous seasons was not well executed for reasons I’ll explain another time). I was a bit shocked when the Night King grabbed Arya’s throat and she didn’t instantly die, which I thought was one of his powers, but maybe I’m missing something there. One last criticism of this battle — and several others — before I get to why I liked it. As we’ve discussed before, the show has a problem with time and space. Last season, the battle north of the wall seemed to take a few hours. But in that same time period, Gendry ran all the way back to the wall (presumably without getting lost, despite the fact he had never seen snow before and would probably have a hard time retracing his steps). He then told the wildlings watching the wall to send a raven across most of Westeros to Dragonstone, which apparently made it there in record time. Dany took only seconds to decide to fly all the way back to the exact spot to save the day. Even giving every benefit of the doubt, that strained credulity. All the writers needed to do was include a tiny bit of dialogue — “We’ve been here for days,” “we only have a day’s worth of food left,” whatever — to signal to the viewer that it had been a while. I’m not a great military expert, but it’s simply not the case that great battles only last a couple hours. The Battle of Verdun lasted ten months. The Battle of Petersburg in the Civil War went on for nine and a half. The Battle of Sevastopol took eight months. I understand that ancient battles were often quicker. Thermopylae took a couple days. But still, the Battle of the Bastards, Hardhome, etc. all started and finished in a few hours — or seemed to. By no means am I saying that I wish the battle had been dragged out longer in terms of screen time, but I don’t understand why the invasion of Winterfell had to commence almost instantaneously after the ring of fire was lit. If they only signaled that this battle took days or even weeks, there would have been some excellent opportunities for actual dialogue and character development — some of which could have been plucked from the first two episodes — that could have heightened the drama and fixed the pacing of all three episodes. It would have made this battle, which in many ways is the climactic moment of the whole series, seem more epic and made the payoff with Arya seem less convenient. Okay, now, here’s why I liked it. One of the greatest charms of the show, from the very first episode forward, was the way it treated the issue of magic and mysticism. Despite being set in a fantasy world, the characters served as “moderns” in the sense that they believed the age of magic and dragons were over. This made the political intrigue so much more compelling. The Red Woman was constantly dismissed as a fraud and charlatan because magic isn’t real. Tyrion mocks the idea of White Walkers as if they belonged alongside “grumkins and snarks” and other folktale creatures only children believe in. Numerous characters belittle the brothers of the Night’s Watch as fools and fear of the Night King as ridiculous because all of that stuff was just superstition. The Maesters of the Citadel, who actually have written records proving it all happened, were overcome with cynicism and weltschmerz. Even Jon Snow was stunned to discover giants are real. Of course, the show also made it clear that this was the wrong take on the situation. Dragons were back, after all. The Red Woman birthed a smoke monster. We knew the Walkers were real. But there was a wonderful tension between these two conflicting understandings of the world the characters — and viewers — lived in. The reason I liked the battle scene wasn’t for the spectacle per se. Though I definitely dug a lot of it. No, what I liked was how it was the big reveal. The stories of Old Valyria, of magic and myth, dragons and White Walkers, that served as an ancient backdrop for the characters in “this” time, were in effect made real by this confrontation that will be sung about 1,000 years hence in Westeros. In a sense I’ll be a little disappointed if it turns out that I will be able to watch every detail in perfect clarity if I merely toggle the brightness and contrast knobs on my TV. Because I kind of liked how, even though the battle was taking place right before our eyes, the whole thing felt like the stuff of legend and mystical memory. The Dothraki, the fiercest warriors in the world, bravely ride out only to disappear, their flaming swords snuffed out by the cold hand(s) of death, their bravery only half glimpsed, lending it poetic tragedy. The warriors battled through the night — though it should have been nights — felling the undead by the thousands. The mist conjured by the night king, blinding the dragons seemed metaphorical to me, like the mists of the past had been for the characters who couldn’t entirely believe that dragons had ever existed in the first place. The whole battle seemed deliberately choreographed to send the message: the age of myth and folktale, monsters and magic, isn’t in the shrouded, half-imagined, past we tell our children about. It’s right now. That’s the kind of spectacle I can get behind."

If you have an appetite for schadenfreude, one of the pleasures of the ongoing 2020 Democratic primary will be watching once-highly-touted politicians realize just how limited their appeal is, as they struggle to reach 5 percent in a crowded field.
Julian Castro, frequently called “the Latino Obama” back when he was mayor of San Antonio , is scraping along the bottom in the RealClearPolitics average at 1.2 percent. Tulsi Gabbard, who stands out as one of the youngest and the only surfer in the field, and who was touted in Vogue as “ the next Democratic Party star ,” currently is at eight-tenths of one percent. Advertisement Advertisement
But perhaps the most delicious is New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Back in 2017, Vogue ’s cover declared, “2020 Vision: All Eyes on Kirsten Gillibrand.” ( Back then I laid out how the glowing profile left a very misleading impression that Gillbrand was an economic centrist, an iconoclast, and a campaigning powerhouse with cross-party appeal.) All eyes may be upon her, but she’s at four-tenths of one percent in the RCP average.
Yes, it’s early. Yes, we haven’t had any debates yet. But it doesn’t get any easier for the candidates at the bottom as they compete for attention, donors, and early support.
Gillbrand is now in the “Throw everything against the wall and see what sticks” stage, unveiling a cockamamie plan “to give every voter up to $600 in what she calls ‘Democracy Dollars’ that they can donate to federal candidates for office.” Yes, she wants to take your tax dollars, give you $600 back, and then allow you to donate that money to political candidates like her.

Three is a trend: Joe Biden is polling at 38 percent in a Quinnipiac poll that was released on Tuesday afternoon, hours after CNN and Morning Consult , respectively, found Biden polling at 39 percent and 36 percent. Quinnipiac finds a 9-point jump for Biden since its last poll was conducted in March, while CNN shows an 11-point jump for Biden since then, and Morning Consult shows a 6-point improvement for Biden since the previous week.

Nate Silver notes that, while Biden’s bump will likely fade, “[w]ell-known candidates polling in the mid-30s in the early going are about even money to win the nomination, historically. Well-known candidates polling in the mid-to-high 20s have roughly a 1 in 4 shot, conversely.”
Typically, the press overestimates the likelihood that the early frontrunner will be a party’s presidential nominee, but when it comes to Biden the debate had been between those who think he has a reasonable chance of winning the nomination and those who think he has “ almost no chance ” or no chance at all . I’ve been in the former camp , and the latest round of polling should at least help put to rest the notion that Biden is just as weak of a frontrunner as Jeb Bush was in 2016 GOP primaries."
Free Speech Bill Passed As Smoke Bomb Disrupts Speech | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Stanley Kurtz,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/smoke-bomb-disrupts-university-of-texas-austin-a-strong-speech-bill-is-passed/,"May 1, 2019 10:39 AM University of Texas campus in Austin, Texas (Jon Herskovitz/Reuters)
Earlier this week, just around the time a smoke bomb and fire alarm disrupted a pro-life talk to a group of student conservatives at University of Texas Austin, the Texas State House approved HB 2100 , a comprehensive campus free-speech bill that could become one of the strongest such laws in the nation. The legislative story has an unusual twist. The sponsor of HB 2100 is Representative Briscoe Cain, himself the victim of a simultaneous shout-down and disinvitation at Texas Southern University in 2017. On Monday, Cain masterfully held off repeated attempts by Democratic legislators to weaken his campus free-speech bill with amendments. At the same time Cain joined with a Democrat to substantially strengthen the bill. Advertisement Advertisement
The Texas case shows that the campus free-speech crisis is simultaneously spinning out of control and kicking off serious efforts to restore this fundamental liberty. We’ve already gotten too blasé about campus-speech disruptions. Only two years ago, a professor at Middlebury College was left in a neck brace and with a concussion by the shout-down of Charles Murray. No one was hurt by the smoke bomb and fire alarm at UT Austin this week, but it’s easy to see how injuries could have occurred had there been a panic to escape the scene. It’s only a matter of time before disruptions like this yield injuries. Yet they’re already coming to seem semi-normal.
Having gone through one of the most egregious shout-down-turned-disinvitation incidents I’ve ever seen, no one is better placed than Representative Briscoe Cain to take the measure of the problem and do something about it. Cain was invited to address the Federalist Society at Texas Southern University (TSU) in 2017. When disruptors interfered with his talk, they were promptly removed by campus police. Then, incredibly, Texas State University president Austin Lane called the disruptors back in and shut down Cain’s talk on the bogus excuse that it hadn’t gotten the proper bureaucratic approvals. It was an ultimate example of administrators caving to student disruptors, and it happened in real time and on video. Advertisement
You can bet Cain’s bill has strong protections against both shout-downs and disinvitations. In fact the disinvitation provision is one of the most detailed and specific I’ve seen. Cain has lent his own touch to a comprehensive bill that draws heavily on the model published by Arizona’s Goldwater Institute (a model I co-authored along with Jim Manley and Jonathan Butcher). And working with Democratic Representative Terry Canales, Cain managed to waive “sovereign immunity” in order to allow individuals whose rights have been violated to bring suit against the university and recover reasonable court costs and attorney’s fees.
In these and other ways, Cain’s House bill is significantly stronger than the campus free-speech bill that earlier passed the Texas Senate. At the same time, Cain’s bill adopts and adapts the strongest provisions of the Senate bill, of which there are several. I hope Cain can preserve as much of the House bill as possible in the House-Senate conference to come. His bill is already a blend of the best provisions from both bodies. Advertisement Advertisement
The oversight provision in HB 2100 is particularly desirable in comparison to the Senate bill. The Senate bill has no enforcement mechanism and simply asks university administrators to report on themselves. That’s meaningless. Obviously, they’re going to give themselves a pat on the back.

NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
We already rely on college administrators at public universities to protect the First Amendment. The problem is, they don’t. Instead they actually promulgate unconstitutional speech codes, speech zones, and bias-reporting systems. So why would you pass a campus free-speech bill that offers no enforcement mechanisms — no teeth?
I’ll bet TSU President Austin Lane would have thought twice about letting the disruptors off and shutting down Cain’s talk if he knew that his governing board was going to be issuing an annual report on his successes or failures at upholding free speech. A bad report could easily be seized on by trustees to replace a university president, or by the legislature to cut appropriations. With its oversight system and much else, Cain’s bill has the kind of teeth required to solve the problems we’re facing in Texas. Advertisement"

Representative Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) called on Attorney General William Barr to resign on Wednesday in response to reports that Special Counsel Robert Mueller privately expressed frustration at the way in which Barr represented the findings of his investigation.
“I was one of those making the case he never should have been confirmed and certainly not confirmed unless he committed to recusing himself from an investigation where he had an obvious bias. And now we’re seeing that bias playing out time and time again,” Schiff said during an interview with CNN’s New Day .
“He should have never been given the job under these circumstances. Now I think in the interest of the department, he should step down, but I have no expectation that he will,” Schiff continued. “What we are seeing is anyone who gets close to Donald Trump becomes tainted by that experience, and the fundamental conundrum is how do you ethically serve a deeply unethical president? And as we are seeing with Bill Barr and I think as we saw with Rod Rosenstein, you can’t.”

Published under the headline “ Mighty Mouth ” in the September 1, 1986, issue, Hume’s piece expresses the strengths and weaknesses of Biden’s, shall we say, unique personality. The future vice president was 43 years old at the time. “ The rhetorical fervor of his stump speeches and debating style, ” Hume wrote, “ have earned him the reputation of a man whose mouth often runs — and runs, and runs — well ahead of his mind. ” Advertisement Advertisement

Masculinity & Poway Synagogue Shooting: Understanding Men's Inescapable Reality | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/understanding-the-inescapable-reality-of-masculinity/,"May 1, 2019 3:16 PM (Gary Cameron/Reuters) The Poway synagogue shooter and the Poway synagogue hero show the two sides of aggression and violence.
Y esterday I had the privilege of appearing as the lone conservative on a panel at the Milken Global Institute Conference called “What Happened to American Masculinity.” The conversation was excellent, my co-panelists were interesting and gracious, and I left the event more convinced than ever that the great American dispute about masculinity is rooted in differences in starting presumptions and first principles. Advertisement Advertisement
First, do you believe “masculinity” as we currently understand it is largely a social construct or rather a culturally influenced response to the very real and profound biological differences between men and women? Second, do you believe that the characteristics of masculinity that are most contentious — characteristics such as “achievement . . . adventure, risk, and violence” — are positive, negative, or neutral?
In my opening remarks, I defined my position rather simply — due to the self-reinforcing and inevitable biological and cultural distinctions between men and women, there are general differences between men and women, and the fact that some men and some women don’t conform to these generalities does not render the generalities invalid.
Thus, in general, boys and young men are more physical than girls, more aggressive than girls, and more violent than girls, and they take greater risks than girls. This is neither good nor bad; it just is . Aggression isn’t a vice or a virtue. It’s simply a characteristic, one to be molded to virtuous ends by a healthy family and a healthy culture. Even violence isn’t inherently and always wrong, and molding a young man to be effective in the lawful application of force can be of immense value to society. Advertisement
Yet, increasingly boys and young men are being taught that there is something wrong with their essential nature. That it is their task to deny it and suppress it. That their nature is incompatible with modern life, and that it’s dangerous, especially to women and girls. And that, since not everyone is the same, arguing that there’s even such a thing as a male norm is inherently oppressive. It creates a “man box.” Advertisement
Combine this ideology (which is often prevalent in progressive-dominated schools and colleges) with the sad fact of widespread fatherlessness, and tens of millions of young men are raised without effective male mentors in an environment that fails to accommodate or even denigrates their very nature. Is it any wonder that boys are flailing in school? Is it any wonder that so many young men are in crisis? Is it any wonder that boys turn to male peers as their models? But boys were not intended to be raised by peers, but by dads. Advertisement
In some quarters, this frustration with the denial of inherent masculinity has led to an opposite error — indulgence. Aggression, for example, isn’t an inherent vice, but neither is it an inherent virtue. Channeled improperly it leads to abuse and exploitation. It leads to the grotesque behavior we’ve seen time and again in the Me Too era. Powerful men who indulge in their aggression and appetites can become truly monstrous, and the fact that some of those aggressive, powerful men also happen to oppose feminists or “own the libs” does not make them any more acceptable.
The proper response to the reality of general masculine characteristics isn’t denial or indulgence. It’s development. Last Friday, a lone gunman walked into a synagogue in Poway, Calif., and attempted to massacre the congregants. He opened fire when he entered, and a courageous woman named Lori Kaye lost her life shielding the rabbi from the incoming bullets. As the congregation fled, a man named Oscar Stewart (we should report and remember the names of heroes) ran directly towards the gunfire . He yelled at the shooter, threatening to kill him. Advertisement Advertisement
The shooter was so startled that he fled, and Stewart pursued him to his car and pounded on his window until an off-duty Border Patrol officer named Jonathan Morales fired into the car.
Think about that moment. Both Stewart and the shooter were aggressive. Both Stewart and the shooter were violent. But one man’s aggression was courageous. One man’s violence was necessary.
We speak often of instilling men and women with purpose. We know that a sense of purpose can be a firewall against despair and hopelessness. But with young men, our task is more specific. It’s to instill him with a sense of virtuous masculine purpose. How does he cultivate his essential nature to virtuous ends — especially in the face of the twin challenges of ideologies that will say that there’s something fundamentally wrong with the pursuit itself and with a developing, high-tech economy that deprives many millions of men of the opportunity to cultivate and use their inherent physical strength and sense of adventure of their work.

Let’s face it. It’s hard to feel like there’s a distinctive masculine way to inhabit a cubicle. Advertisement"
President Trump & Nancy Pelosi -- Infrastructure Debate Is a Bipartisan Mess | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-mess/,"About The Editors May 1, 2019 3:52 PM President Donald Trump at the State of the Union shakes hands with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in Washington, D.C., February 5, 2019. (Doug Mills/The New York Times/Pool via Reuters) S ome time ago, President Trump’s team produced a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan, which was really a $200 billion infrastructure plan with some wishful thinking attached. The president now says he never supported any such thing — “Gary’s thing,” he calls it, referring to Gary Cohn, the Democrat and Goldman Sachs veteran who once served as Trump’s principal economic adviser — and now the president has joined forced with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on something new: a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which also is composed mainly of wishful thinking. Call us bipartisan, but when Trump, Pelosi, and Schumer all agree to spend $2 trillion — without quite deciding what they’re going to spend it on or where the money’s coming from — we start to hear from our inner Patrick Henry. Instead of “Gary’s thing,” we have Gary’s thing with 33 percent more loot. What could possibly go wrong? You can tell this is backward by the fact that the triumvirate has settled on a price tag — an incomprehensibly large one — but is remarkably fuzzy on what’s to be bought with that $2 trillion. Imagine taking your car to the mechanic and hearing, “That’ll be $10,000” — without ever being told what’s actually being repaired. You might begin to suspect that something is not entirely on the up-and-up. We have been here before, with Barack Obama and his “shovel-ready” projects. The lesson of Obama’s failed stimulus bill — which was in considerable part an infrastructure program — is that doing things backwards does not work. Appropriations first, projects second, is as backwards as it can be. That’s apparent in both the specific successes and general failure of the Obama stimulus. For example, Michael Grabell of the New York Times cites the decommissioning of the nuclear plant at the Savannah River Site at Aiken, S.C., as a model of how these projects should work. The cleanup was, in fact, ready to go: All that was needed was $1.6 billion to make it happen. “As soon as the money arrived in the summer of 2009, the retired cold war nuclear plant hired thousands of workers to decommission reactors . . . . The county’s unemployment dropped to 8.5 percent from 10.2 percent in a matter of months.” The local economic improvement was a happy side effect of the federal government doing a job that needed doing and that was ready to be done. Compare that with vague programs calling for “weatherization” or other ill-defined improvements. “Infrastructure” is not an undifferentiated commodity, a lump of all-purpose putty that we can just order up more or less of as circumstances dictate. Infrastructure instead consists of many thousands of discrete projects, some of which are mainly federal responsibilities, some of which are primarily state and local jobs that may or may not merit federal assistance. And that is how “infrastructure” should be dealt with: on a case-by-case basis. That is why we have this splendidly specialized array of committees and subcommittees and bureaucracies and congressional procedure. And that, not a once-in-a-generation all-in multitrillion-dollar “fix,” is how responsible adults deal with roads and bridges and the like. We note that figuring out how to pay for this is at the bottom of the current agenda. To the extent that it’s being talked about at all, there already is fundamental and probably unbridgeable disagreement: Some of the Democrats want to undo the 2017 tax cuts, others want to raise the federal gasoline tax. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) insisted: “It is up to President Trump to work with us by identifying new revenue to support that investment.” But revenue bills originate in the House of Representatives, not in the Oval Office. This is not a sane way to proceed. If you aren’t willing to spend the money for particulars on a case-by-case basis, then you shouldn’t be spending the money as a generality in one big heap. Congressional Republicans already have made known some reservations about this plan. In particular, they have preemptively said no to rolling back the 2017 tax cuts, which Senator Schumer insists is a precondition for exploring other options, such as raising the gasoline tax. The thing is already a mess before it has got started. It is not going to get any better. The infrastructure scheme deserves to die an early and unlamented legislative death. It’s just another variation on Gary’s thing."
Venezuela Crisis: Collective Ownership and the 'True Socialism' Argument | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/venezuela-true-socialism-argument-collective-ownership/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter May 1, 2019 5:21 PM Opposition protesters react to tear gas as they face government security forces in Caracas, Venezuela, April 30, 2019. (Manaure Quintero/Reuters)
The Socialist party of Great Britain asks , “When did the people of Venezuela get collective ownership of the means of production?” This is part of that perpetual argument, “True socialism has never been tried.”
If the argument of the Socialist party is that many who claim to be acting in the name of economic equality get into power, focus their efforts on securing their grip on power, and then act in their own interest and only their own interest . . . yeah, no kidding. Thanks for noticing, guys. Advertisement Advertisement
If the argument for socialism is that it’s a noble theory that delivers economic and social equality on paper, but that every single time it gets tried, the leaders succumb to temptation and start accumulating wealth for themselves and stifling dissent and building a secret police and gulags . . . then as a theory, it’s worthless. It would work when it’s run by human beings who can resist the temptation to take what they want through force, and those humans don’t exist. As Alexander Hamilton wrote, “If men were angels, no government would be necessary.” Lord Acton said, “Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.”
Socialism requires a government with far-reaching authority to set the rules for every little nook and cranny of the economy — which inevitably gives it a lot of power, and the human beings running the system inevitably start abusing that power. Advertisement
Some might argue that Venezuela did attempt to enact “collective ownership of the means of production,” as Hugo Chavez’s regime nationalized large swathes or all of the oil industry, the agriculture sector, the finance sector and banks, manufacturing, gold mining, steel production, telecommunications and power production, a ferry company, and some private homes.

But the government and the people are different entities, no matter how much socialists may insist that they are acting on behalf of “the people.” The Venezuelan government took over those companies, industries, and properties, not the Venezuelan people ."

William Barr's Testimony & the Russian Collusion Narrative Hoax | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/bill-barr-didnt-lie-or-mislead/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter May 1, 2019 4:22 PM Attorney General William Barr testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., May 1, 2019. (Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters)
The alleged Russia collusion scandal has become the alleged Bill Barr scandal. There are now calls for him to resign or be impeached because he supposedly mislead Congress about Robert Mueller’s discontent, expressed in a letter first reported by the Washington Post last night, over his letter making his summary of conclusions from the probe. But this is nonsense.
Read the supposedly damning exchange with Sen Chris Van Hollen . Barr is never asked whether Mueller is unhappy with his letter, just whether he’s unhappy with his conclusions, meaning his decision not to charge the president with obstruction:
VAN HOLLEN: Mr. Attorney General, the thing is you put this out there. I mean the President went out and tweeted the next day that he was exonerated. That wasn’t based on anything in the Mueller report, with respect to obstruction of justice. That was based on your assessment. That was on March 24th. And now you won’t elaborate – at all, as to how you reached that conclusion. Because I’m not asking you what is in the Mueller report, I’m asking you about your conclusion. Let me ask you this–
BARR: It was the conclusion of a number of people, including me and I obviously am the Attorney General. It was also the conclusion of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
VAN HOLLEN: I understand. I’ve read your letters–
BARR: And I will discuss that decision after the report is out–
VAN HOLLEN: Did Bob Mueller support your conclusion?
BARR: I don’t know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion.
There’s another exchange with Rep . Charlie Crist that people are also focusing on. Barr is asked about anonymous officials from the Mueller probe telling the press they are unhappy with his summary letter. Barr, correctly, says he doesn’t know their discontents (he presumably didn’t talk to any of them about this, and wouldn’t know anyway since they were anonymous), but then adds they are probably about more information not being released:
During a House Appropriations Committee, the St. Petersburg Democrat asked: “Reports have emerged recently, general, that members of the Special Counsel’s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24th letter, that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report’s findings. Do you know what they’re referencing with that?”
Barr said: “No, I don’t.”
“I suspect that they probably wanted more put out, but in my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize,” he added.

Attorney General William Barr Will Not Testify Before House Judiciary As Planned | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/william-barr-will-not-testify-before-house-judiciary-committee/,"May 1, 2019 6:26 PM Attorney General William Barr returns to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, May 1, 2019. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)
Attorney General William Barr will not appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday to answer questions about special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation as previously planned, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday evening.
Citing the “unprecedented and unnecessary” conditions placed on Barr’s planned testimony by Congressional Democrats, a Department of Justice spokeswoman announced the attorney general would not return to Capitol Hill on Thursday to further explain his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings.
“Unfortunately, even after the attorney general volunteered to testify, Chairman Nadler placed conditions on the House Judiciary Committee hearing that are unprecedented and unnecessary,” DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. “Congress and the Executive Branch are co-equal branches of government and each have a constitutional obligation to respect and accommodate one another’s legitimate interests. Chairman Nadler’s insistence on having staff question the Attorney General…is inappropriate.”
The announcement comes after the Judiciary Committee voted to allow staff attorneys to question Barr during the Thursday hearing. Barr, who testified for nearly five hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, objected on the grounds that he should only be required to answer questions from lawmakers, as is typically the case when cabinet members testify before Congress.
After new broke that Barr would not attend the hearing, Chairman Nadler said he and his colleagues would gather at the scheduled time in hopes that Barr changes his mind.
“I hope and expect that the Attorney General will think overnight and will be there,” said Nadler, who previously accused Barr of trying to “blackmail the committee” by threatening to cancel his appearance if his demands were not met. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“He’s trying to blackmail the committee into not following the most effective means of eliciting the information we need,” Nadler said on Wednesday. “He is terrified of having to face a skilled attorney.”
Representative Doug Collins (R., Ga.) joined the Department of Justice in blaming Judiciary Democrats for Barr’s cancellation.
“It’s a shame members of the House Judiciary Committee won’t get the opportunity to hear from Attorney General Barr this Thursday, because Chairman Nadler chose to torpedo our hearing. The attorney general gave clear, informative testimony in the Senate Wednesday, as he offered to do more than a month ago in the House tomorrow,” Collins said in the statement. “The attorney general gave clear, informative testimony in the Senate Wednesday, as he offered to do more than a month ago in the House tomorrow.”"
Kansas Supreme Court Ruling on Dismemberment Abortions | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Carrie Severino,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/kansas-supreme-court-ruling-dismemberment-abortions/,"About Carrie Severino May 1, 2019 5:41 PM
On Friday, in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt , a 6-1 majority of the Kansas Supreme Court struck down S.B. 95, a law that prohibits the use of dilation and evacuation (D & E) abortions except where necessary to preserve the mother’s life or to prevent a “substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.” Advertisement Advertisement
D & E abortions entail dismemberment of a fetus. They are a common form of abortion during the second trimester and later. Partial-birth abortion is a variation on this procedure, and the federal prohibition on it was upheld by the Supreme Court in Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), in a decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.
In this case, the court grounded its decision in the Kansas Constitution rather than the U.S. Constitution, so no ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court reaching a different conclusion under the Fourteenth Amendment would limit the new abortion regime in Kansas.
Does the Kansas Constitution have any more to say about abortion than the U.S. Constitution? The Hodes & Nauser majority notes that Section 1 of the Kansas Bill of Rights’ declaration that “All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights” contains a phrase not found in the U.S. Constitution: “inalienable natural rights.” In other words, no. Advertisement
But that was enough to convince the court it was on to something. Its 118-page per curiam (unsigned) judicial opinion meandered from the historical and “philosophical underpinnings of natural rights” to an exploration of bodily integrity to how “liberty and the pursuit of happiness” must include “decisions about parenting and procreation” to how natural rights extend to women in general and pregnant women in particular, before straining to downplay the one aspect of Kansas legal history that actually addresses abortion: Kansas’ longstanding statutes, dating back to the earliest years of statehood, that prohibited the practice. Advertisement
The reality is that during the 19th century, abortion had been substantially proscribed under the common law, and at the time the Kansas Bill of Rights was adopted in 1859, the growing trend in that and other states was to strengthen criminal statutory abortion prohibitions. Those laws went much farther in restricting abortion than S.B. 95. The question presented to the court is not what policy should be, but what the law actually says. There can be no doubt as to what the drafters of Kansas’ constitution would have thought of extending their broad language about natural rights to include a right to conduct dismemberment abortions. Advertisement
Yet the majority lacked enough self-awareness to invoke authorities from Locke to Lincoln as if they somehow supported their conclusion while dismissing the explicit historical evidence against them as “tethered to prejudices from two centuries ago.” “In this imagined world,” retorted Justice Caleb Stegall, the court’s lone dissenter, “the Liberty Bell rings every time a baby in utero loses her arm.”
The outcome-seeking nature of the court’s flimsy analysis is transparent, and its attempt to invoke history is an embarrassment. One member of the majority even penned a concurrence that distanced himself from what he called the “historical back-and-forth” between the majority and the dissent, preferring the supposed clarity of admitted living constitutionalism. (Well, he sort of admitted it, preferring to use the euphemism “contemporary context.”) That only one justice on that seven-member tribunal had the good sense to dissent from this jurisprudential travesty should be a red flag for any observer of American courts. Advertisement
What’s the matter with the Kansas Supreme Court? The answer is to be found beyond the content of the court’s opinion. To understand the problem requires understanding the system of judicial selection that prevails in that and regrettably many other states. More on that in part 2. Carrie Severino is chief counsel and policy director to the Judicial Crisis Network."

(Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters)
The controversy over Robert Mueller’s letter to Bill Barr strikes me as much ado about not much at all. Here are my quick thoughts:
1. Mueller’s frustration is understandable. Yes, I totally understand Mueller’s argument that Barr’s short memo “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of Mueller’s report — especially when the report itself contained easily producible summaries that did provide abundant additional details. These details are material to the overall analysis of Trump’s conduct and material to any impeachment inquiry. Yet Mueller is a prosecutor employed by the Department of Justice to investigate actual and potential criminal activity and not an investigator employed by Congress to consider the case for impeachment. It was entirely fair for Barr to focus on the top-line legal conclusions in his initial statement. Advertisement Advertisement
2. Mueller’s frustration quickly became moot. Within days, Barr released the entire report, with minimal material redactions. The American people have the opportunity to read every word, and so do members of Congress who may seek impeachment. Barr’s initial memo does not change one syllable of the Mueller report, and it should be entirely irrelevant to Congress’s response. Congress has a political role to play here, not a legal role, and while the law informs the politics, Barr is not a judge. Congress is free to reach its own conclusions. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
3. Media outrage places too much emphasis on Barr’s ability to influence the public. I detect in some quarters a belief that different initial framing could have changed the tenor of early coverage and materially impacted Trump’s standing with the public. I think this is wrong. The only conclusion that could have potentially tanked Trump was a finding that his campaign actively conspired with the Russian government to sway the election. Mueller clearly and unequivocally found that did not occur. Advertisement"
The Upstate (New York) Blues | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Nordlinger,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/upstate-new-york-blues/,"May 2, 2019 6:30 AM Sign at the mostly unused Kodak factory in Rochester, N.Y., in 2013 (Carlo Allegri / Reuters) On a Simpsons parody, anti-Semitism, inequalities, and more
I recently spent a few days in upstate New York — at Nazareth College, outside Rochester. Wonderful experience. I jotted a few lines about it in an Impromptus, here .
Last Sunday night, The Simpsons aired an episode called “D’oh, Canada.” The family took a trip to Niagara Falls, going through upstate New York. Homer sang a hilarious song — a parody song — about the region: its economic woes, its culture, its depopulation. A video is embedded in this article . Advertisement Advertisement
I shared the video with a friend of mine from upstate: He laughed his hiney off. We both agreed that an upstater, or more than one, on the staff of The Simpsons must have composed the parody. It has that kind of knowingness — a wicked, yet affectionate, knowingness.
Officials in the region acted in various Chamber of Commerce ways — how could they not? “Come to the fair!” said organizers of the New York State Fair.
That is a splendid experience, by the way. I went last September. Wrote about it here . At the same time, I did a “Syracuse Journal,” here . Let me quote one item from that journal, please.
On Saturday, late in the morning, I have a walk downtown. So many beautiful places. There’s no one but me and assorted vagrants. Most of them squint, glower, and smoke. Almost all of them have smartphones. There is everything but tumbleweed here.
Some neighborhoods in the city are now dilapidated, but you can tell that they were once something — handsome and prosperous.
The sight of Syracuse is a bit sad to me — because Syracuse seems like a city that was , rather than a city that is. I am familiar with such cities. We have a lot of them in my native Midwest. What can you do?
That is the subject of papers and books and prayers …
Yup.
For eons, there have been jesters, pointing out uncomfortable truths. (Sometimes the jesters are unfair and wrong, to be sure.) The Simpsons has performed the function of jester.
• Reading about Robert Caro, I thought of Richard Wagner. Hear me out. In order to set up my point, I’d like to quote from a Wall Street Journal article , published in February. Here we go:
Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Caro will publish a book in April looking back at his life’s work.
Some of his fans would rather that, at age 83, he finished his life’s work.
Mr. Caro has written four volumes about President Lyndon Johnson, and his devotees have been waiting since 2012 for the next and final installment. So the coming release of “Working,” a memoir of his professional life, has been greeted with raised eyebrows.
“Jesus, Bob, you’ve left your fans hanging,” says Joe Kolman, a 64-year-old writer and documentary filmmaker in Queens, N.Y. “Have mercy on us! Reminisce all you want after you finish!”
Jim Sather, a retiree and former attorney who lives in a Chicago suburb, says he isn’t sure “Working” was a wise use of Mr. Caro’s time. “What the hell is he writing that book for?” says Mr. Sather, 71. “I’m not getting any younger and neither is he.”
Now to Wagner. Some years ago, I gave a speech about him, saying that he had, among other things, great confidence in his longevity. In his ability to finish his work. There was a sense of destiny about him. (Of course, he was an egomaniac.) Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
He started The Ring of the Nibelung , his great tetralogy (four-parter), in 1848. He finished the first two parts, “The Rhine Gold” and “The Valkyrie,” fairly rapidly — by 1856. He started on the third part, “Siegfried” — but then took a break. What? Yes — a long break.
He wrote Tristan und Isolde and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg . Those two masterpieces took him about ten years. And then he resumed The Ring , finishing “Siegfried” and moving on to “The Twilight of the Gods.” He completed his project in 1874, 26 years after he had begun.
That’s confidence, baby. Advertisement
• Wagner makes a good transition to anti-Semitism. In its international print edition, the New York Times published an anti-Semitic cartoon. Bret Stephens wrote about it: “ A Despicable Cartoon in the Times .” The subtitle: “The paper of record needs to reflect deeply on how it came to publish anti-Semitic propaganda.”
This column was published in the Times itself, mind you — it is Stephens’s employer. How many other publications would allow one of their own to wallop them in their own pages?
Later, in an editorial, the Times walloped itself: here . Advertisement
After the publication of the cartoon, a lot of us Times -bashers had a field day. (Though no one bashed the Times more effectively than the Times itself.) Are we as alacritous when something comes up on the right, however?
When I say “we,” I mean conservatives.
At the end of last year, The Weekly Standard was killed off by its owner. American Greatness magazine rejoiced. Referring to the Standard ’s founding editor, William Kristol, the editor and publisher of American Greatness wrote , “Now, Kristol and others have moved on in search of a new host organism.”
That, of course, is language straight out of the ’30s. But did anyone on our side — anyone on the right — object? There was hardly a peep. Advertisement
It could be that the offending writer knew not what he was doing. Sometimes that happens. I have written about it a fair amount. In 2008, a Republican congressman from Georgia said that Candidate Obama and his wife were “uppity.” After a reaction, he said he had no idea. A lot of people found this hard to believe. When I wrote about the issue, some readers e-mailed me to say, “I don’t generally think I live under a rock, but I had no idea either.”
Let me give you a memory. A long time ago — 2005 or so? — we at National Review were publishing a piece blasting George Soros. We commissioned an illustration that showed Soros as a spider, crouching on a map of Europe, spreading his web. Some of us were a bit uneasy about this illustration. But we didn’t want to be overly sensitive either.
I showed the cartoon to Mike Potemra. He said, “You know who else drew Jews as insects, don’t you?” (He meant the Nazis, of course.) We ditched the cartoon in favor of a boring old photo. Advertisement
The Hungarian government, among others, is not so punctilious.
• Lately, I have seen a spate of articles on income inequality. This is a perennial issue, of course, but it has come up a lot in recent days. I myself am fairly relaxed about income inequality — if society at large is doing well. If all boats are rising, so to speak. But many people can’t abide the “gap”: the gap between the richer and the poorer. It is a mental thing, mainly.
Say I make $20,000 and you make $30,000. Someone comes along and doubles our wages. Now I make $40,000 and you make $60,000. The gap between us is twice as great. I don’t care. A lot of people do, trust me
I like to quote Daniel J. Hannan, who once wrote,
Would you rather live in a 1000 square foot house where everyone else’s was 800, or a 1200 square foot house where everyone else’s was 1400? I sometimes think it’s the most elemental question in politics. Where we stand on equality versus prosperity depends, more than we usually admit, on personality traits rather than logic. We start with an intuitive feel for what makes sense, and we elevate that instinct into a principle.
Margaret Thatcher gave an unforgettable performance regarding the “gap.” She was taking questions in Parliament. In reference to her socialist opponents, she said, “They would rather the poor were poorer, provided the rich were less rich.” She had some hand gestures to go with it.
To have a look, go here .
People often speak of “the wealth” — as in “control of the wealth” and “fair share of the wealth.” As though there were a bag of money or pot of gold somewhere. Fort Knox? “The wealth” is a cousin of “the pie.” These words betray a fundamental economic misunderstanding, from which a world of trouble comes. Advertisement
You remember the Jeffersons theme song, right? It is a minor masterpiece . The ending lyric is, “We finally got a piece of the pie.” Wonderful lyric — but an economy is not a pie. If your slice is big, mine is not necessarily small. We’re not fighting over crumbs. An economy is as big and varied and flexible as people are allowed — by the rules of a free society — to make it.
End of sermon (for now). Advertisement
No, one more word! In a free society, the rich will get richer and the poor will get richer and inequalities will be vast. Again, some people can’t abide this — and this is why a liberal economy, a free economy, will always be under attack from the ignorant, the malicious, the demagogic, and the power-seeking.
Beware, chillen. Beware of those demagogues, left and right.
• Earlier this week, I had the privilege of seeing Arthur Brooks’s new film, The Pursuit . Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute. His film is about capitalism, and its relationship to human dignity and progress. It is a beautiful, wise film — traveling to India, Denmark, Appalachia, and elsewhere. Arthur is an evangelist for a free economy and freedom at large. He is especially good at explaining the moral aspect of capitalism — something poorly understood.
The Pursuit is a real service, to all of us.

Hillary Clinton Fears Indictment | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Victor Davis Hanson,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/hillary-clinton-fears-indictment/,"May 2, 2019 6:30 AM Hillary Clinton speaks in Las Vegas, Nev., in 2016. (Steve Marcus/Reuters) Her political power is waning, and her attempts to suggest indictment of Trump show her personal fears.
H illary Clinton recently editorialized about the second volume of special counsel Robert Mueller’s massive report. She concluded of the report’s assorted testimonies and inside White House gossip concerning President Trump’s words and actions that “any other person engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted.”
Psychologists might call her claims “projection.” That is the well-known psychological malady of attributing bad behavior to others as a means of exonerating one’s own similar, if not often even worse, sins. Advertisement Advertisement
After 22 months of investigation and $34 million spent, the Mueller report concluded that there was no Trump–Russia collusion — the main focus of the investigation — even though that unfounded allegation dominated print and televised media’s speculative headlines for the last two years.
While Mueller’s report addressed various allegations of Trump’s other roguery, the special counsel did not recommend that the president be indicted for obstruction of justice in what Mueller had just concluded was not a crime of collusion.
What Mueller strangely did do — and what most federal prosecutors do not do — was cite all the allegedly questionable behavior of a target who has just been de facto exonerated by not being indicted. Advertisement
What Mueller did not do was explain that much of the evidence he found useful was clearly a product of unethical and illegal behavior. In the case of the false charge of “collusion,” the irony was rich.
Russians likely fed salacious but untrue allegations about Trump to ex-British spy Christopher Steele, who was being paid in part by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to find dirt on Trump. Advertisement
The Russians rightly assumed that Steele would lap up their fantasies, seed them among Trump-hating officials in the Barack Obama administration and thereby cause hysteria during the election, the transition, and, eventually, the Trump presidency.
Russia succeeded in sowing such chaos, thanks ultimately to Clinton, who likely had broken federal laws by using a British national and, by extension, Russian sources to warp an election. Without the fallacious Steele dossier, the entire Russian collusion hoax never would have taken off.
Without Steele’s skullduggery, there probably would have been no Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court–approved surveillance of Trump aide Carter Page. There might have been no FBI plants inserted into the Trump campaign. There might have been no subsequent leaking to the press of classified documents to prompt a Trump collusion investigation. Advertisement
Given the Steele travesty and other past scandals, it is inexplicable that Clinton has not been indicted. Advertisement
Her lawlessness first made headlines 25 years ago, when she admitted that her cattle-futures broker had defied odds of one in 31 trillion by investing $1,000 from her trading account and returning a profit of nearly $100,000. Clinton failed to report about $6,500 in profits to the IRS. She initially lied about her investment windfall by claiming she made the wagers herself. She even fantastically alleged that she mastered cattle-futures trading by reading financial newspapers.
To paraphrase Clinton herself, anyone else would have been indicted for far less.
The reason that foreign oligarchs are no longer donating millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, and that Bill Clinton is not being offered $500,000 for speaking appearances in Moscow, is simply that Hillary Clinton is not secretary of state. She is no longer in a public position to hector her colleagues into approving pro-Russian commercial deals, such as the one that gave Russian interests access to North American uranium.
As secretary of state, Clinton also sidestepped the law by setting up a home-brewed email server. She transmitted classified documents over this insecure route and lied about it. And she destroyed some 30,000 emails that were in effect under subpoena. Anyone else would have been indicted for far less. Advertisement
In truth, Clinton was at the heart of the entire Russian-collusion hoax. Even after the election, she kept fueling it in order to blame Trump–Russia conspiracies for her stunning defeat in 2016. Unable to acknowledge her own culpability as a weak and uninspiring candidate, Clinton formally joined the post-election “resistance” and began whining about collusion. That excuse seemed preferable to explaining why she had blown a huge lead and lost despite favorable media coverage and superior funding.
For much of her professional life, Hillary Clinton had acted above and beyond the law on the assumption that as the wife of a governor, as first lady of the United States, as a senator from New York, as secretary of state, and as a two-time candidate for the presidency, she could ignore the law without worring over the consequences."
James Buckley on Federal Government and the Role of Congress | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/james-buckley-federal-government-congress-states/,"May 2, 2019 6:30 AM (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) An omnipresent, micromanaging federal government will necessarily be presidential government, with the chief executive’s discretion unbound.
A t 96, James Buckley still is, like good cheddar, sharp and savory. Buckley, whose life has been no less accomplished than his brother Bill’s, recently said at a National Review Institute gathering that his speech there would be his last public appearance. Let us hope not.
He adorned all the government’s branches — senator; undersecretary of state for international security affairs; judge on the nation’s second-most important court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Shortly after his 1970 election to the Senate (as a member of New York’s Conservative party; the age of miracles had not yet passed) he was handed a recent study showing that “the work of the average congressional office had doubled every five years since 1936.” He explains:
Given the fact that, in simpler times, Congress worked at a leisurely pace and was in session for only five or six months a year, its members could take the initial increases in stride simply by devoting more hours per day and more months per year to their work. Over time, however, the available hours and months had been exhausted, and the doubling could only be accommodated by squeezing deliberation out of the legislative process.
In 1934, after 145 years of congressional activity, the U.S. Code consisted of one volume of federal statutes. Buckley says when he came to Congress 36 years later, there were eleven volumes. Today, 49 more years on, there are 41 volumes — supplemented by 242 volumes of regulations having the force of law. This, says Buckley, is the result of a Congress “that largely substitutes political reflex for reflection,” and that is so averse to “messy details” that it delegates “essentially legislative authority to executive agencies.” All this stems, however, from “abandonment of the Constitution’s limits on federal authority.”
Buckley says that the mischief erupted after a 1937 Supreme Court ruling that Congress, in promoting the “general welfare,” can supply states with money to implement programs that Congress has no enumerated power to write into law. When Buckley entered the Senate, such programs distributed $24 billion. Today, he says, the sum, properly computed, is in “mid-$700 billions.” The idea of enumerated powers having been erased, so has the Tenth Amendment (“the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people”).
Buckley has hitherto proposed converting all such programs into block grants to states. He now proposes a presidential tweet vowing to veto “any bill that tells the states how to run their own affairs.” He proposes, and believes “there is a chance,” that the Supreme Court might reverse its 1937 ruling on the ground that federal grants to states “have proven to be inherently coercive.” These proposals are equally sensible, and — the age of miracles has now passed — equally unlikely.

The problem, as Yuval Levin says, is Congress’s “willful underactivity.” But the growing problem that will continue to exacerbate this problem is this: Having marginalized itself, with judicial encouragement, Congress now attracts members who either disdain it or think members of the president’s party exist to tug their forelock when the president issues orders. Advertisement
Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), who has been campaigning to escape from the Senate into the White House since arriving there 28 months ago, considers the legislative branch a constitutional superfluity: “Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their [ sic ] act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun-safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.” The 100 days are granted by the grace of Queen Kamala I. In January, Senator Richard Burr (R., N.C.) explained why Republicans would not consider a bill funding the government without money for a border wall: “The president won’t sign it. Why would we work on it?” Perhaps because there is value in Congress expressing its independent view of the public good?"
Presidents Should Not Investigate Themselves | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Suranjan Sen,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/congress-should-police-president-executive-branch/,"May 2, 2019 6:30 AM (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Congress and the people should police the executive.
H ow, exactly, does a man investigate himself?
This is the question that met President Trump from the moment he took office. As the FBI, the attorney general, and the special counsel all serve under the president’s authority, President Trump effectively held ultimate control over investigations into his own behavior. Then, while the Mueller report largely cleared President Trump of colluding with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election, it declined to reach any conclusion regarding whether Trump used his presidential power to obstruct the investigation. Hence, the discussion has moved from possible interference in the election, to possible interference in the investigation into possible interference in the election. Advertisement Advertisement
Forgive me for finding this entire scenario rather absurd.
The federal government’s tripartite structure imbues the president with the executive power, which includes prosecution. Neither the courts nor Congress may force an individual prosecution. Furthermore, any officer with prosecutorial discretion must, ultimately, be subject to the president’s supervision and removal. In turn, Congress and the people —through impeachment or the ballot box, respectively — may hold the president accountable for the abuse of this prosecutorial power.
We learned long ago that efforts to undermine this structure are dangerous. After the Watergate scandal, the Democratic Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act, creating the Office of Independent Counsel. Under this regime, either party in Congress could effectively require the judiciary to appoint an independent counsel to investigate and potentially prosecute any given matter. At the same time, the president (through the attorney general) could not remove the independent counsel absent “good cause.” This all but ensured an endless parade of unchecked, unaccountable independent counsels essentially harassing succeeding administrations. Following a series of expensive, disastrous investigations — most famously the Kenneth Starr investigation, which lead to the impeachment of President Clinton — both Republicans and Democrats agreed to let the act expire in 1999. Advertisement Advertisement
Yet, 20 years later, here we are. To be fair, the special counsel does not, on its face, pose the same constitutional issues presented by the independent counsels of yesteryear — Special Counsel Mueller was both appointed by the president (through Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein) and subject to the president’s at-will removal. As the president retains ultimate executive authority, the basic constitutional structure is preserved. However, this creates a new conceptual challenge: The special counsel effectively grants the president control over an investigation into himself.
This is the strange situation in which a president may act manifestly within his constitutional authority, yet be accused of obstructing justice. As a matter of constitutional law, President Trump could have removed Robert Mueller; he also had the power to fire James Comey and Jeff Sessions and was under no obligation to provide any reason whatsoever. These are all executive officers. But the issue of obstruction requires that we inquire into the president’s mental state, asking whether the president took an otherwise-lawful action with the intent of impeding the investigation. It’s a Rorschach test: Was Trump trying to “obstruct,” or was he simply making administrative decisions within his executive authority? Advertisement
Whether or not this is constitutional, it is certainly not ideal. A president under investigation by his own branch of government may innocently make staffing changes, only to face impeachment or, more disturbingly, indictment under a subsequent administration. Or perhaps he might end an investigation he considers to be an expensive, unwieldy, partisan distraction, given that he knows he is innocent: Is that obstruction? Conversely, a guilty president may intentionally obstruct an investigation, yet plausibly deny such intent. In any case, the specter of future obstruction charges may, in practice, be just as constraining as the “good cause” requirement for removal of the independent counsels of old. Advertisement
There are better ways to fight potential presidential corruption. First and foremost, we are fortunate to have a robust First Amendment that allows for vigorous criticism and truly independent, investigative journalism. This allows the American people to decide for themselves whether a presidential candidate or incumbent is corrupt or incompetent. Popular accountability is, ultimately, the cleanest and most natural protection against corruption within the elected branches. Advertisement
Second, the Constitution grants Congress the power to conduct its own investigations. Congress may hold hearings and issue subpoenas, enforceable through contempt. Congress may then use the results of its investigations — or any unwillingness of the president or his subordinates to cooperate with such investigations — to justify impeachment, to pressure the executive into taking prosecutorial action, or to inform the voting public of possible executive corruption. Thus, executive corruption may be discovered and remedied without violating the formal, structural separation between the legislative and executive branches.
That said, the manner in which Congress currently exercises its oversight authority is in dire need of reform. Note that congressional investigations into the Trump administration’s alleged ties with Russia did occur, and to a large extent the results of these investigations fell on deaf ears. With good reason, onlookers are suspicious of congressional investigations into the president as being little more than either partisan witch hunts or rubber stamps, depending on whether the president’s party controls the relevant chamber. Advertisement Advertisement
But Congress itself can work to obviate these concerns. Either chamber may facilitate investigation into the president by, for example, creating a bipartisan standing committee whose members are selected by opposing parties, or whose chair must belong to the party in opposition to the president. Further, Congress may delegate its investigatory authority to another body, which then reports its findings to committee or to the chamber as a whole. In fact, Congress could even have appointed Robert Mueller to investigate the Trump administration, and while Mueller would not have had prosecutorial authority, he could have enjoyed Congress’s delegated authority to issue enforceable subpoenas. Had this been the case, we would be exactly where we are now, but without the trail of process crimes and, more important, without having to discuss whether the president attempted to obstruct the investigation."
"Five Decades’ Stagnation, Two Decades’ Weak Growth | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/20/five-decades-stagnation-two-decades-weak-growth/,"May 2, 2019 1:02 PM (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Looking at the economy over the decades
S omething feels off in the timing of our debate over the economy. A loss of faith in free markets, among intellectuals and the public alike, was only natural in the 1930s. But today? Intellectuals on the left and the right are more convinced than ever that our economic policies are deeply misguided, at the same moment that unemployment rates and wage growth are the best they have been in decades. When Americans answer polls, they express less and less confidence in free-market capitalism — even as they express more and more satisfaction about economic conditions. Advertisement
Perhaps people are evaluating these questions against different time horizons. They may, that is, think that the economy is performing well at the moment but has become less capable of delivering broad-based prosperity over the course of a generation. If today’s conditions persist long enough, then, the reputation of capitalism may recover.
Timing is relevant to our evaluation in another way. If our economy has gotten worse at generating sustained prosperity, worse enough to make a loss of faith in capitalism understandable if not justified, then it matters when this decline began.
In 2015, during the last presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton suggested that “for decades” the economy had been offering a worse deal for most people. Her explanation: “For 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at the top — by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules — it will trickle down. It will trickle down to everyone else.” The election of Ronald Reagan, in other words, was the turning point. It followed that many of his policies should be reversed: The top tax rates should go back up and unions should be strengthened. Advertisement
If economic conditions have been deteriorating for an even longer period, however, then merely reversing Reaganomics might not be enough. And it is common to run into claims, apparently backed by data, that suggest as much. The Pew Research Center notes that the average wage, adjusted for inflation, fell between 1973 and 2018. It had risen steeply from 1964 (when the data series began) through 1973. Then it dropped for roughly two decades, and over the next two recovered but did not get back to its peak. Advertisement
If real wages have truly been stagnant for longer than most Americans have been alive, then the economy has not worked in anything resembling the fashion we expect. Economic growth has been mostly an illusion: We have more stuff only because more of us work, large numbers of women having joined the paid labor force. If this picture is accurate, we need to make radical changes either to the economy or to our expectations of ever-rising prosperity. Advertisement
There are, however, two big reasons to doubt the stagnation thesis. The first is that non-wage benefits have become a larger and larger element of compensation. Perhaps they have become too large an element: The tax code encourages employees to get health insurance through their companies rather than take higher wages and buy coverage themselves, and there are reasons to think we would be better-off if the tax code did not do that. But non-wage benefits have economic value to employees, and so looking at wages alone will cause us to underestimate employees’ material welfare.
The second reason for doubt is that a common method of adjusting for inflation — the one used in the Pew numbers cited above — overdoes it. The center-right social scientist Scott Winship has been indefatigable in explaining why using the Consumer Price Index (specifically a measure called “CPI-U”) as the gauge of inflation is a mistake, and how it warps our understanding of economic trends. It overestimates housing inflation before 1983, and ignores how consumer behavior responds when prices change. Advertisement Advertisement
Since inflation compounds, small errors each year add up to major changes over decades. Use a better measure of inflation, one based on personal-consumption expenditures, and the average wage rose by 21 percent from 1973 to 2018. (Average compensation must have risen more.)
The data on median family income also show a reassuring amount of growth. The family in the middle of the pack in 2015 made 45 percent more, with the right inflation adjustment, than its counterpart in 1970.
But the same numbers may also explain some of the public’s dissatisfaction with the economy. Median family income grew by a spectacular 58 percent in the 15 years from 1955 to 1970, then grew another 11 percent from 1970 to 1985, and 24 percent from 1985 to 2000. But the median family income of 2014 was slightly lower than it was in 2000. Advertisement Advertisement
What happened is that after the turn of the millennium we went through an extended period of slow growth punctuated by one mild and one severe recession. Median family income dropped more than 7 percent from 2007 through 2011, the sharpest decline since this data series started in 1953. It did not recover completely until 2015.
We have had a few good years since then. But it is not surprising that during the last two decades many Americans came to feel that their economic circumstances were stagnant and insecure. It is not surprising, either, that many of them have the sense that things used to be better — or that a generation of young people who started their work lives in a slow-growth economy tend not to have positive attitudes toward capitalism.
Instead of five decades of economic stagnation, we have had two decades of weak growth. That record does not suggest that the pro-market policies of the 1980s and 1990s were fundamentally mistaken. It suggests, rather, that we have discrete problems that deserve to be tackled. Advertisement
High on the list of needed changes should be a reform of our monetary regime. It failed badly over the last dozen years. In 2008, excessive fear of inflation led the Federal Reserve to signal that it was going to tighten monetary policy even as the economy was sinking into a recession. It kept monetary conditions too tight after the crisis hit, too, for example by encouraging banks to hold additional reserves. These policies made the recession more severe and the recovery weaker. That these failures are not more widely appreciated is symptomatic of the misguided thinking that continues to govern monetary policy."
Joe Biden's China Stance is Wrong | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/joe-biden-drastically-downplays-china/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter May 2, 2019 10:07 AM Former vice president Joe Biden speaks at a rally with striking Stop & Shop workers in Boston, Mass., April 18, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: On the campaign trail, Joe Biden offers an assessment of China’s leaders that is simply stunning; the Democrats rage about Attorney General William Barr but are vague on what they’re willing do about him; a familiar congresswoman blames the United States for the violence in Venezuela; and the Democrats get yet another presidential candidate. Joe Biden’s Wildly and Dangerously Naïve Assessment of China You hear pretty often that a this-or-that political figure made a shocking statement, and sometimes it’s genuinely shocking, and sometimes it’s overhyped. But former vice president Joe Biden declaring that the figures running the Chinese government are “not bad folks” and that “they’re not competition to us” has to be the most jaw-dropping assessment of a world power since Gerald Ford’s 1976 assessment that “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.” Biden’s full quote : China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. They can’t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west. They can’t figure out how they are going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they’re not competition for us.” A few moments earlier, Biden had bragged, “I’ve met virtually every major world leader in my role as vice president, as Foreign Relations chairman over the last 30 years.” We’re left wondering if Biden’s view of the world changed at all in the past three decades. China’s government is growing more repressive and more belligerent towards the United States. FBI director Christopher Wray said recently ,“China in many ways represents the broadest, most complicated, most long-term counterintelligence threat we face.” China is investing in offensive capabilities to disrupt or destroy U.S. assets in orbit . They’re pursuing genetic research with no ethical limitations . They’ve used “Confucius Institutes” to co-opt and influence what is taught about China on American colleges and universities. They’ve got more than a million people in concentration camps for “reeducation.” They are expanding their economic leverage and strategic assets : China has landed, not only by militarizing artificial islands it built in the South China Sea, but by building or acquiring seaports, logistics terminals, and related transportation, communication, and energy assets in more than a dozen countries around the globe, including U.S. allies in the EU and Latin America.” As Chinese fighter jets regularly violate the airspace of our Asian allies, “The risk of accidental conflict goes up as China becomes more active, more determined, and more belligerent. An assessment that China’s government are “not bad guys” and are “not competition” is so out-of-whack that I think it’s fair to wonder if the 76-year-old Biden is growing senile. The White-Hot Democratic Rage Over William Barr This morning, a lot of the usual suspects are just white-hot livid about Attorney General William Barr. James Comey says President Trump has “co-opted” him. Michael Tomasky says he’s the “wartime consigliere” of the GOP “racket.” E.J. Dionne accuses Barr of “shamelessly corrupting the debate over Mueller report.” The Washington Post editorial board declares Barr “torched his reputation” and charge that his letter summarizing the top conclusions of the Mueller report was “highly misleading.” House Judiciary chairman Jerrold Nadler is threatening to hold Barr in contempt Even Charlie Sykes over at The Bulwark looks back to long-forgotten allegations of the George H.W. Bush administration secretly funding Saddam Hussein and concludes, “Barr, it turns out, has for 30 years been the go-to guy for protecting a president, covering up scandals, and obstructing investigations.” (I’m not quite sure how he managed to be the go-to-guy for 30 years when he didn’t work for the government between 1993 and 2019.) Guys . . . if you think this is worthy of impeachment, then go and attempt to impeach him. This applies to Trump and to Barr. We keep hearing from Democrats and like-minded commentators that Trump’s actions clearly constitute obstruction of justice, that the lack of an underlying crime is immaterial, and that Trump passed the threshold requiring removal from office a long time ago. They contend that the evidence is overwhelming, that the counterarguments are weak, and that the precedents are ample. Okay, fellas, then act like it. Stop talking about what should be done and do it. Much like celebrities’ apocalyptic rhetoric around climate change and their continued use of private jets, there’s a giant disconnect between what these prominent Democrats and liberal thought leaders are saying and what they’re doing. Most folks on the Right are looking at liberals’ furious denunciations of Barr with skepticism and maybe even a bit of bewilderment . Why is there so much screaming about Barr’s letter when the Mueller report is now released? Even the contempt threat doesn’t make much sense : "
Confirmations Actions Speak Louder Than Words | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Thomas Jipping,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/on-confirmations-actions-speak-louder-than-words/,"About Thomas Jipping May 2, 2019 1:22 PM
A senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, with a president of his party in the White House, said that “those who delay or prevent the killing of these [judicial] vacancies must understand that they are harming the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.” Overall, judicial vacancies are 89 percent higher than when Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that. He has yet to say a word about the judicial vacancy crisis today. Advertisement Advertisement
In October 1998, Leahy noted that 21 judicial nominees had been approved by the Judiciary Committee and were waiting on the Senate’s executive calendar to be confirmed. Today, 34 nominees to the U.S. District Court and U.S. Court of Appeals are on that calendar, yet Leahy has not called for their consideration.
When Leahy declared a “judicial vacancies crisis,” 34 vacancies had been designated “judicial emergencies” by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. These are vacancies that have lasted so long that they have a particularly negative effect on judicial caseloads. Today, judicial-emergency vacancies are 150 percent higher, but Leahy has said nothing.
In 1998, Leahy demonstrated the judicial-vacancies crisis in several ways. He said, for example, that “the Senate has been losing ground to normal attrition over the last two years.” He was right. Vacancies had risen from 63 to 71. Well, the Senate is failing to keep up with normal attrition today; vacancies have risen by 10 percent in the last two years. No word from Leahy. Advertisement
One year earlier, Leahy said that “confirming federal judges should not be a partisan issue.” Since Leahy was elected in 1974, the Senate has confirmed 2,323 judges to the federal district, appeals, and supreme courts. He voted “no” 64 times; you guessed it, all Republicans. In 1998, with a Democrat in the White House, Leahy called filibusters of judicial nominees a “travesty.” Since then, he has voted 60 times to filibuster judicial nominees; right again, all Republicans.
Partisan obstruction of judicial nominations has become so relentless that Republicans had to take the unusual step of reinterpreting Senate Rule 22 to take one of those obstruction tactics off the table. The federal judiciary is still in the longest period of triple-digit vacancies since the early 1990s. High levels of longstanding vacancies are harmful to the administration of justice, no matter which party occupies the White House or controls the Senate. It’s time to fill those vacancies.

Kansas Supreme Court -- What’s the Matter with It? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Carrie Severino,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/whats-the-matter-with-the-kansas-supreme-court-part-2/,"May 2, 2019 4:41 PM (Carlos Jasso/Reuters)
Yesterday I wrote about the Kansas Supreme Court’s lawless ruling in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt , which for the first time in history located a right to abortion in the Kansas Constitution. Today, I examine the role that commission-based methods of nominating state judges — a.k.a the Missouri Plan — have had in causing the Kansas Supreme Court and other state supreme courts to seemingly abandon their commitment to the rule of law. Advertisement Advertisement
As I have discussed in this space many times over the last decade, Kansas is one of approximately a dozen states that uses a version of the Missouri Plan to nominate state supreme-court justices. The invention of progressive era activists, today the Missouri Plan (or so-called “merit system,” for its purported focus on nominee qualifications) is the favored method of selecting judges among liberal legal activists, because it helps the far-left leaning state-bar associations to capture a state’s legal infrastructure by giving them the dominant role in the selection of judges.
First adopted in Missouri in 1940, the Missouri Plan eventually made its way to Kansas in 1958. The Kansas Supreme Court has a total of seven justices. When a vacancy arises on the court, the Kansas Supreme Court Nominating Commission submits a list of three nominees to the governor, and the governor is then compelled to pick one of those nominees. At the end of a justice’s term, he or she is subject to a statewide retention election. If retained, the justice continues to another term. (Note that judges in Missouri Plan states are retained 99 percent of the time in such retention elections . This is not surprising given that voters are asked to vote yes or no on whether to retain incumbent candidates who are unopposed.) Advertisement
As prescribed by the Kansas Constitution , the Kansas Supreme Court Nominating Commission is comprised of nine members, four of whom are elected by the state bar (one each from Kansas’s four congressional districts). Four non-lawyer members are appointed to the commission on a staggered four-year basis by the then-governor (again, one each from the four congressional districts). The ninth member — the Chairman — is elected by members of the Kansas Bar Association. Thus, the majority of the nine seats are both held by lawyers and chosen by the state bar, and the staggering of the governor-appointed members means that the governor’s influence over the process is even further diluted.
It is no accident that judicial selection in Missouri Plan states is shielded from public accountability. The progressive-era architects of the Missouri Plan believed that all aspects of American life should be run by experts. Their vision was to remove the process of judicial selection from the purview of the electorate and instead place it in the hands of legal professionals. It’s no surprise that the bar associations were the leading advocates for the adoption of the Missouri Plan 80 years ago and remain its biggest cheerleaders today. Advertisement Advertisement
Missouri Plan boosters argue that commission-based judicial-selection systems result in a more independent judiciary. While that argument might sound appealing to anyone who dislikes the federal-selection process, or judicial elections, the data prove otherwise. In recent years, Professor Brian Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt University Law School has done extensive empirical research studying the ideological impact of various methods of judicial selection across the country. A 2016 study conducted by Fitzpatrick found that state appellate judges in Missouri Plan/merit-selection states are demonstrably more left-leaning than the general electorate at large in those same states. According to Fitzpatrick, “judges in merit selection states were on average 16% more Democrat than the public in those states as measured by their federal house [Congressional] votes and 14.6% more Democrat than the public as measured by their state house votes.” In Kansas, the leftward ideological skew is even larger than the national average: Fitzpatrick found that Kansas appellate judges are 17.9 percent more Democrat than the public as measured by their Congressional votes and 16.8 percent more Democrat as measured by their state-house votes.
Professor Fitzpatrick’s research findings reflect the phenomenon we are seeing on the ground. Supreme courts in states such as Kansas and Missouri (whose judicial activism I also recently wrote about ) are beginning to bear an uncanny resemblance to the San Francisco-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit — not exactly what one would expect in the Midwest. But is anyone surprised that a selection process dominated by liberal bar associations has led to disproportionately liberal courts? Advertisement
Kansas is long overdue for judicial-selection reform. The state has already eliminated the Missouri Plan for its selection of court of appeals judges. Thanks to a 2013 bill passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Sam Brownback, Kansas’s court of appeals judges are now selected by the governor with the approval of the state senate, similar to how federal judges are appointed. But changing the method of selection for supreme-court justices will require an amendment to the Kansas Constitution. Advertisement Advertisement
The appointment method designed by the Founders and used for over two centuries to select federal judges has endured the test of time. But partisan judicial elections have also worked very well for many states, and, in fact, some of the most conservative judges in the country have come from states that elect their judges. Both of these alternative selection methods have proven to result in less ideological skew according to Professor Fitzpatrick’s research. And critically, both methods would finally provide a means of electoral accountability that is currently nonexistent in Missouri Plan states: The Kansas Bar Association is accountable to no one but its own members.

Without the judicial-selection reform that Kansas and other states desperately need, I fear that we can expect to see many more state supreme-court opinions that are completely untethered from the rule of law. Carrie Severino is chief counsel and policy director to the Judicial Crisis Network."
Mueller Report Details Conduct that Hearkens Back to 1990s | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mona Charen,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/mueller-report-president-trump-bill-clinton/,"May 3, 2019 6:30 AM President Clinton at a White House ceremony in 1998 (Win McNamee / Reuters) Though impeachment is the wrong remedy, the Mueller report details disturbing conduct that hearkens back to the 1990s
E very Republican remembers with disgust the video of Bill Clinton glowering into the camera and declaring: “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie. Never. These allegations are false.”
It’s worth revisiting why that statement was so infuriating. It wasn’t because we were — well, let me speak for myself, I was — outraged at the idea of a president having an affair with a young intern (though that was part of it). No, it was the lying. Bill Clinton lied and lied and lied. He even lied under oath. Lying is cheating. Lying displays contempt for other people. Advertisement Advertisement
Today, the attorney general of the United States asserts, in terms that should make Bill Clinton smile, that because the president of the United States was “frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,” he could not be considered guilty of obstruction of justice.
Other Republicans echo this line, arguing that the nature of the false allegations against President Trump bruited in the press and among some Democrats — that he was a Russian sleeper agent; that the Russians had “kompromat” on him; that some accusations arose from Clinton surrogates — tainted the entire investigation and justified his flamboyant attempts to obstruct it. But the fact that some allegations are outlandish doesn’t mean all allegations are false. Bill Clinton was accused of running illegal drugs through the Mena Airport in Arkansas and being complicit in the death of Vince Foster. By Mr. Barr’s logic, it was therefore okay that he lied under oath about Monica Lewinsky.
“No underlying crime, therefore no obstruction,” they say. But Bill Clinton encouraged his secretary to lie about Monica Lewinsky to avoid embarrassment, not to hide a crime. Many Democrats but zero Republicans said that that excused it. Advertisement Advertisement
Not only do Republicans utterly reverse themselves about the importance of truth telling, they also lean in. William Barr told the world that the president “fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation.” This is laughable. Yes, he turned over some documents and permitted aides to be interviewed, but he fired the director of the FBI and told Russian visitors that this relieved great “pressure due to the Russia thing.” He ordered Robert Mueller to be fired for risible “conflicts” (such as asking for his old FBI job back, which was itself a lie). He lied about the meeting in Trump Tower, tasked Corey Lewandowski with ordering Attorney General Jeff Sessions to unrecuse himself, and instructed the special counsel to limit his inquires only to future election interference. He asked his White House counsel to lie about whether he had ordered Mueller fired. He claimed he could not recall events 30 times in response to written questions. He repeatedly refused requests to sit for an in-person interview, and dangled pardons to those facing criminal trials to discourage cooperation with law enforcement. “Stay strong,” our don-in-chief told his felonious former lawyer — “hang in there.” And throughout it all, he kept up a steady campaign of delegitimization of the Mueller inquiry as a “witch hunt” and a “hoax.”
Anyone would have been upset, Trump’s defenders explain, at being falsely accused. It was his consciousness of innocence, not guilt, that caused him to lash out. Advertisement
Really? Does that seem logical? An innocent man would have thrown open his files, freely testified, left the investigator unmolested (verbally and with regard to firing), and kept his mouth shut about former associates under indictment. Advertisement
Besides, Trump’s motive may have been concern that the investigation would uncover other wrongdoing — such as tax evasion or paying off porn stars in the midst of a presidential campaign. Or it’s possible that hiding more contacts with agents of the Kremlin was the true motive — and that it worked . Mueller’s report says that, in addition to Trump’s failure to testify and faulty memory, many witnesses lied, destroyed evidence, and successfully encrypted communications. Given these clear acts of obstruction, Mueller’s report noted, “the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.” That is what Mr. Trump and his minions call “total exoneration.”
None of this is to suggest that the Congress should impeach Trump. There are prudential reasons to avoid that course. The president would relish the mud fight, voters are already exhausted, and an election is only 18 months away. But the Mueller report provides abundant evidence that the president attempted to obstruct justice and abused his power. The past few weeks have seen the attorney general and most of the Republican party distort those findings and attempt to hoodwink the Republican rank and file. Advertisement"

Al Sharpton’s Role in Democratic Party Presidential Politics in 2020 | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Zachary R. Wood,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/al-sharpton-democratic-party-presidential-politics-2020/,"About Zachary R. Wood May 3, 2019 6:30 AM Sen. Kamala Harris and Reverend Al Sharpton following their lunch meeting at Sylvia’s Restaurant in Harlem, February 21, 2019. (Bebeto Matthews/Pool via Reuters) He has a large African-American following — but can he deliver it?
T he first time I met the Reverend Al Sharpton, his laughter was uproarious, and his blithe countenance suggested knavery. His eye contact, wide and roaming, felt shifty. I smiled politely and paid close attention — unable to discern whether he was willfully animated or just being himself. After briefly explaining “how he handles business” on his MSNBC show, PoliticsNation , Reverend Sharpton slapped his palms together, thrust his hips forward as if rising from a squat, and flashed a big grin, concluding our interaction. Advertisement Advertisement
Growing up in a working-class African-American community in Washington, D.C., I have known many neighbors and friends who have long admired Al Sharpton. They consider him a God-fearing African-American bellwether with the courage of his convictions. When any race-related event or tragedy makes national headlines, they drop everything and turn on the news to watch Al Sharpton. When he speaks, heads in not a few African-American households and barbershops nod in agreement. Fortunately, my parents encouraged me to be circumspect and suspicious of talking heads who purport to represent the interests of an entire demographic.
One enduring criticism of Al Sharpton has been the absence of an apology for his involvement in the Tawana Brawley fiasco, which catapulted him to fame in 1987. Others have focused wisely on his divisive rhetoric about race and policing, his derogatory comments about Jewish people, and the reported $4.5 million in unpaid taxes accrued by Mr. Sharpton and his personal holdings. Given the role Mr. Sharpton appears poised to play in the 2020 election, as kingmaker and strategic intermediary between African Americans and the promising Democratic contender, we should also consider other questions about the street preacher–turned–progressive macher . Advertisement
But let’s give Mr. Sharpton the benefit of the doubt and grant that the civil-rights icon, neither a seasoned politician nor a journalist by training, is well suited to summon the meeting, assess the candidate, and give his blessing to whomever makes the strongest impression.
What precisely does Mr. Sharpton hope to achieve in his widely publicized power lunches with Mayor Buttigieg, Senator Harris, and other 2020 presidential aspirants? Does he hope to speak on behalf of left-leaning African Americans? Does he want to gain a deeper understanding of candidates’ values and platforms? Does he want to assist or advise? Or, does he want to be seen with them — and perceived as being clothed in power? As he acknowledges proudly, Mr. Sharpton has “been able to reach from the streets to the suites.” Advertisement
To his credit, Mr. Sharpton has on occasion forged purposeful alliances across the aisle with inveterate politicos such as Newt Gingrich to pursue education reform. He’s also used his megaphone with some consistency to highlight economic concerns of black underemployment, home ownership, and small business. When asked about his lunch with Mayor Buttigieg, Mr. Sharpton noted that their conversation was “candid” and that Mr. Buttigieg did not “duck any issues.” Advertisement
At first blush, so far so good. Indeed, their public commentary reflects the success of a substantive discussion. If Mr. Sharpton is in fact being “candid” and he values Mr. Buttigieg’s willingness to tackle the tough topics, we should take him seriously. Perhaps these dialogues have some potential to make a difference in the lives of ordinary Americans. But only if we hold Mr. Sharpton to a higher standard, and this would require closer scrutiny should Mr. Sharpton continue to initiate such meetings."
Obamacare Won't Lead to Single-Payer Health Care | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Marc Siegel,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/obamacare-failure-shows-folly-government-health-care/,"May 3, 2019 6:30 AM A woman reads a leaflet at a health insurance enrollment event in Cudahy, Calif., in 2014. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters) Its failures have made the folly of government-driven health care obvious.
T his week the first congressional hearing on Medicare for All took place in the House Rules Committee. The following day, the Congressional Budget Office indicated that the transition to a single-payer system “ could be complicated, challenging, and potentially disruptive .”
As a physician I wholeheartedly agree. And I don’t believe we are ever going to get there. Advertisement Advertisement
Ten years ago, when Obamacare was first being put together, many people — including yours truly — warned that the new law was a big step in the direction of single-payer. This was because it relied so heavily on government overreach, control, and subsidy, and locked patients into a unified form of insurance that covered many services you might not need (so-called essential benefits). In order to maintain profitability, insurers had to increase premiums, copays, and deductibles and shrink provider networks to the point where the insurance became completely dysfunctional. It seemed only a matter of time before the government would have to take the whole system over and provide coverage for all directly, as in Canada.
But then something happened that the Obamacare architects weren’t expecting. More than 6 million people a year, most of them under 35 and relatively healthy, decided to take the tax penalty rather than pay for an overstuffed policy they didn’t need. More and more insurers dropped out.
Then President Trump signed a tax bill that eliminated the penalty for failing to buy Obamacare-compliant insurance. Though Obamacare still exists, patients are now no longer coerced into it, and the Trump administration has used this sudden opening as an opportunity to add more choice with short-term skinny plans, association plans, and expanded direct-care models. These free-market solutions fit a health-care system with exciting new emerging treatments in the worlds of surgery, cancer immunotherapy, and genetics. I believe that coverage more suited to an individual’s needs may actually lead to more people choosing or being able to purchase private insurance than before. Advertisement Advertisement
So the dysfunction and unaffordability of the Affordable Care Act has brought us farther away from single-payer, not closer. The health-care solutions of the future are more and more high-tech, expensive, and personalized, requiring creative payment plans including installments, expanded health savings accounts, or payments that vary according to how well a patient responds to treatment . One-size-fits-all insurance is becoming less useful all the time."
Broadway Play ‘Ink’ Treats Rupert Murdoch Fairly | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/ink-broadway-play-treats-rupert-murdoch-fairly/,"May 3, 2019 6:30 AM Jonny Lee Miller and Bertie Carvel in Ink (Joan Marcus) Surprisingly, the zingy Broadway play Ink considers events from the media mogul’s point of view.
O ur liberal friends love to quote Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird , “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb in his skin and walk around in it.” Does that go for Rupert Murdoch then? Because Murdoch, like Mockingbird , is suddenly big on Broadway. Advertisement
To my surprise and pleasure, Ink , a zingy play about Murdoch’s explosive entry into the London newspaper market in 1969, isn’t a shallow hit piece, as you’d expect, but a robustly entertaining and measured work that dares to consider events from Murdoch’s point of view.
Since I happily spent many years working for Murdoch newspapers, including the one this play deals with, I’m not the guy to go to if you’re looking for a disinterested opinion on the man or his papers (although, contra thousands of angry emails I’ve gotten over the years, I’ve never had a meaningful conversation with the New York Post ’s proprietor, much less taken marching orders on what to write in my columns). Ink celebrates Murdoch as a gutsy outsider who disrupted an industry, blew up the conventional wisdom, democratized the media, made shedloads of money, and had himself a lot of laughs at all the fools he humiliated along the way.
Written by James Graham, Ink (at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre through July 7) begins in 1969, when Murdoch buys a sleepy broadsheet called The Sun and gives it an extreme makeover to which all other extreme makeovers should be compared. Murdoch, vigorously if eccentrically portrayed by Bertie Carvel (who doesn’t evoke the actual Murdoch in any way I can perceive), hires a former editor at The Daily Mirror , Larry Lamb (a ferociously committed Jonny Lee Miller, familiar to TV audiences from his role in Elementary ), and urges him to throw out the rulebook. But revolutions have consequences. Advertisement
Desperate to catch the world’s best-selling paper, then the Mirror , Murdoch brings in huge typefaces, a new logo, italicized headlines, and a brash voice, turning his paper into a tabloid and aiming at the masses via such innovations as extensive TV listings while finding clever solutions to intractable problems. The paper had to go to press before the evening sports matches, so the sports editor had to fill his pages with bloke-at-the-pub attitude instead of recaps. Advertisement
Ink , which takes place on a gorgeously grimy set that portrays the literally dirty news business as a sort of semi-dormant volcano of battered editors’ desks, captures much of the bonkers energy of tabloids with all of their mischief and ingenuity. Assembling the front page in an era when newspaper type meant actual pieces of metal set in trays, Lamb discovers the printers are in possession of only three letter E’s large enough for the front-page splash, so the word “exclusive” has to go. He prays nothing happens to the Bee Gees. Advertisement
The Sun hurls Britain into the Seventies in a nutty, Benny Hill–style musical sequence in which the paper staffs up and starts knocking down Fleet Street traditions. Some of the jokes and references will baffle Americans, even American journalists (editors known as “subs” who heavily rewrite stories are crucial to British papers but aren’t much used in the States), and I wouldn’t say Ink goes terribly deep into the details of newspapering. Nevertheless it’s a smart piece of entertainment that both recognizes the fun of the game and gives serious consideration to what a media outlet should be. In a TV interview, Murdoch says, “I don’t agree that it’s sleazy; I think it’s fun, and I don’t like this term ‘downmarket.’ Who is the arbiter of what is up and what is down. Is it you?”"

1984 —Federal district judge H. Lee Sarokin modifies a consent decree to require that layoffs of New Jersey firefighters be on a proportional quota basis rather than (as state law provided) according to seniority. The result is that white firefighters with more seniority are to be laid off in favor of minority firefighters with less seniority. Advertisement Advertisement
In an especially bizarre twist, Sarokin rules that his order constitutes an unconstitutional taking of the seniority rights of white firefighters, and he orders the federal government, which opposed his order, to provide compensation for the taking! Sarokin expresses sympathy for the white firefighters, stating that they are “not themselves the perpetrators of the wrongs inflicted upon minorities over the years [but] are being singled out to suffer the consequences.”
In June 1984, after the Supreme Court’s ruling in Firefighters v. Stotts forces Sarokin to change his order and to have seniority govern layoffs, Sarokin changes his tone and attacks the white firefighters: “If they have not directly caused the discrimination to occur, many have certainly condoned it by their acquiescence, their indifference, their attitudes and prejudices, and even their humor.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "
Friedrich Hayek on Economic Nationalism and Central Planning | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/friedrich-hayek-lessons-economic-nationalism-central-planning/,"May 3, 2019 6:30 AM Freeway interchange in Los Angeles, Calif. (Eric Thayer/Reuters) Whenever government regulations lead to higher prices, the champions of regulation blame the free market for failing to fix the problem.
I t has “invariably been the fate of conservatism to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing,” the philosopher and economist Friedrich Hayek famously wrote. Hayek’s larger point was that while conservatism plays an important role in pumping the brakes on radical ideas that go too far, too fast, it lacks a positive alternative agenda itself. Advertisement Advertisement
In fairness to American conservatism, Hayek was talking primarily about the European variant that defended a status quo of aristocracy, theocracy, and a fairly closed economy. But his basic point about the conservative temperament has always resonated with me, because it rings true. Conservatives often start from the position of saying “No” to any new proposal or reform and end up, because of the nature of politics, agreeing to some compromise between no and a total yes.
Sometimes this is fine. Sometimes it’s worse than doing nothing. For example, imagine that liberals want to build a bridge that conservatives think is unnecessary pork. Compromising on half a bridge is dumber than no bridge or a whole bridge. Cheering the “bipartisan” or “centrist” nature of the half-bridge deal doesn’t change the foolishness of it. Worse, liberals understand that they can pocket the concessions and benefits (union jobs, expanding the baseline budget, etc.) and come back the next year to demand more money to finish the project. As Milton Friedman said, “Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.”
This dynamic doesn’t apply just to public works but to a whole raft of market-distorting policies, from subsidies for higher education and health care to entitlements. The political priority for liberals is to establish the principle that there is a role for government in X and then keep insisting that the supposedly worthy initiative is underfunded. Look at where Democrats are today on health care. A couple years ago the Affordable Care Act was a bold progressive reform. Now it’s too conservative for Democrats eager to do away with private health insurance and establish Medicare for All. Advertisement
What makes this dialectic so frustrating for conservatives is that whenever government regulations lead to higher prices — in college tuition, energy prices, rent, etc. — the champions of further regulation blame the free market for failing to fix the problem. Advertisement
This seems worth bearing in mind as President Trump and Democratic leaders hammer out an agreement to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure before agreeing on where the money will come from or how to spend it. The president would like to put it on the nation’s credit card. The Democrats have no insurmountable objection to that, but they’d like to goad Trump into agreeing (before the 2020 election) to tax hikes to pay for it.
However it’s spent, or paid for, you can be sure that before the last dollar goes out the door, Democrats will be insisting again that infrastructure is underfunded and that the private sector is inadequate to the task. Advertisement
I don’t really have a solution, in part because I’m not sure there is one. And as the saying goes, a problem without a solution isn’t a problem, it’s simply a fact. This is the nature of politics generally, and not just for conservatives. After all, there are many issues where liberals start from a position of “No” and end up being forced to accept a compromise they don’t like. Advertisement
But, as a conservative of the Hayekian variety, I see a particular threat in how some on the right are responding to this inconvenient truth: They want to get in on the action.
Historically, the primary conservative argument against top-down planning wasn’t so much that politicians and bureaucrats aren’t smart enough to run the economy from some Washington-based control room, but that it simply can’t be done. Policymakers suffer from what Hayek called “the knowledge problem.” The market is too complex, with too many variables on the ground, for anyone to manage things from above.
On some parts of the right, the argument is changing. The new proponents of “economic nationalism” no longer think elites can’t run the economy — just that liberal elites, or “globalists,” can’t run it. Part of this stems from the often-paranoid conviction that liberal elites have brilliantly rigged the system in their favor. So, the thinking goes, if they can pull that off, so can we.

Venezuela Crisis of 1902-1903: Lessons For Today | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jerry Hendrix,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/venezuela-crisis-1902-lessons-theodore-roosevelt/,"May 3, 2019 6:30 AM President Theodore Roosevelt, c. 1902 (Library of Congress) A century ago, the United States managed an international crisis over Venezuela.
T he Venezuelan national assembly has held that the country’s 2018 presidential election country was illegal and that Juan Guaido, not Nicolas Maduro, is the lawful president. As a result, Venezuela is undergoing an internal political crisis while also owing significant financial debts to Russia and China. To protect their interests, these rising great powers have deployed military forces to the region and are increasing the number of diplomats and intelligence operatives in Latin America. They are also directly protecting Maduro from his own government and people. As it considers how best to deal with the threat of hostile foreign governments covertly taking control in Venezuela, the Trump administration would be well advised to examine the lessons from the last great Venezuelan crisis over 100 years ago. Advertisement
Venezuela sits atop the largest proven oil and natural gas reserves in the world. Yet due to the outright technical incompetence of the Maduro government, Venezuela is currently over $100 billion in debt to foreign nations, mostly Russia and China, intent on ensuring that every dollar is repaid, with interest. Additionally, these foreign powers view Venezuela as a comfortable base for military and intelligence assets in South America; Russia has recently deployed nuclear-capable bombers to Venezuelan airfields , and China has opened the path for naval warship visits to the troubled South American nation by first sending its hospital ship for a goodwill port call. Additionally, Russia has sent a contingent of security forces to Venezuela, including cyber-war experts, and Iran, which also has financial interests in Venezuela, recently initiated a regular series of commercial Mahan Air flights . Such flights have previously provided useful cover for the insertion of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps elements into foreign nations. Each of these countries can and do claim that they are simply supporting their friend, Nicolas Maduro. They also state that they are protecting their financial interests. But they of course have the ulterior motive of undermining American leadership and the current global liberal order.
Today’s Venezuelan crisis parallels the events of the winter of 1902–1903. In the late fall of 1902 the government of Venezuelan president Cipriano Castro, just recovering from an internal civil war, was unable to make payments on the debts Venezuela owed to European powers. In a reaction typical of that era, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy imposed a naval blockade on the South American nation. With three European powers strangling the Venezuelan economy and threatening to seize its customs houses (another common tactic), Castro requested that the claims against his country be settled through international arbitration. Advertisement
Germany and the United Kingdom objected, despite having previously suggested the same solution. By now the European powers had come to distrust Castro’s word. However, President Theodore Roosevelt decided to step in and uphold the Monroe Doctrine , issued in 1823, which rebuked efforts by any European power to exert control over independent nations in the western hemisphere and viewed any such effort as unfriendly to the United States. Accordingly, Theodore Roosevelt ordered the U.S. fleet in the Caribbean just off Puerto Rico to assemble under the command of Admiral George Dewey, who was not known for warm feelings toward Europe, and quietly threatened to send the fleet south against the Europeans if they did not agree to arbitration within ten days.
At first the European powers were taken aback by Roosevelt’s ultimatum. Blockade and custom-house seizures were the international normative process for such matters where great powers were involved, but they didn’t want to provoke conflict with the United States. The strength of Roosevelt’s private statements (speaking softly) and the apparent readiness of his fleet to go to war (carrying a big stick) forced first England and then Germany to change course and accept arbitration as the path for resolving the crisis. This incident went a long way toward strengthening the Monroe Doctrine, establishing U.S. leadership in the western hemisphere, and introducing the Roosevelt Corollary, which reserved the “policing power” in the Americas to the United States. Advertisement Advertisement
Roosevelt understood that he had two advantages in the crisis. First, any military conflict in the western hemisphere was going to be a “home game” for his forces, whereas the United Kingdom and Germany would have to support their navies from across the Atlantic. Second, the U.K. and Germany had imperial interests all over the world, which allowed Roosevelt a variety of options. The United States could mass all of its power in one place, or hit the two European powers in any number of vital locations simultaneously. In the end Roosevelt chose to focus American power and threaten decisive battle on the terms and moment of his choosing. He had an innate feel for naval power and its role in coercive diplomacy.
A few years later, near the end of his term, Roosevelt would send another fleet out, the “Great White Fleet ,” to circle the globe, heralding the United States’ arrival on the world stage. That fleet’s mission was two-fold: to promote the public perception of the United States as a global power and to support the burgeoning sense of the rule of law and the emergence of a liberal global order. Such concepts were new then. Advertisement Advertisement
It would be a mistake at this point, however, to gloss over the legacy of the United States in Latin America. Both the Monroe Doctrine and the accompanying Roosevelt Corollary gained decidedly negative reputations in the century that followed the 1902-03 crisis. Numerous armed interventions in the region, and support for various dictatorships, have created a negative opinion of the United States and its “leadership” of the western hemisphere. Latin American countries have sought to distance themselves from any perception that the U.S. exerts a role in their internal governance or security, while still seeking opportunities to cooperate with the U.S. in matters dealing with law enforcement and national security. Such dynamic tensions have become the norm. Conversations about the Monroe Doctrine faded into the background after World War II; given U.S. preponderance, such assertions were deemed unnecessary. Advertisement
However, conditions in the region are rapidly changing. Today Russia, China, and their puppets in Cuba are intent on pursuing new status as rising great powers and seek to undermine the United States in its own hemisphere. It might seem wise for them to distract the United States with events in its own backyard from China or Russia’s pursuit of power elsewhere, potentially setting the stage for a future negotiated arrangement to withdraw from the western hemisphere in exchange for U.S. recognition of their own spheres of influence in Asia and Europe. Advertisement
However, such moves by China and Russia ignore the fact that U.S. foreign policy is not built around a regional mindset or regional interests. The 20th century, from start to finish, was about building a liberal international order based on the rule of law that is global in scope, and the United States understands the establishment of regional spheres of influence to signal the collapse of the entire global structure. So, in the end, the U.S. will not pursue a deal so regionally limited in its focus.
And like the U.K. and Germany a century ago, China, Russia, and Cuba ignore their own dispersed global interests and forces. Should Putin press too hard in Caracas, additional men and war-making materials might quickly appear in Ukraine or Syria to begin a paper-cut campaign against his interests. For China, its billions in loans to Maduro are little compared with its investments in Africa and Central Asia. Should it try to establish too large a military or intelligence footprint in South America it may find rising disturbances amongst the Uighurs, increased arms sales to Taiwan, civil unrest by workers supporting Chinese investments in Africa, or even stronger trade tariffs. As for Cuba, well, its proximity to American shores makes it an easy target for a full spectrum of coercive activities. Advertisement"
Mike Pompeo: Ilhan Omar's Venezuela Comments 'Ignorant' & 'Disgusting' | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/mike-pompeo-ilhan-omars-venezuela-comments-ignorant-and-disgusting/,"May 3, 2019 11:29 AM Representative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) in Minneapolis, October 26, 2018 (Brian Snyder/Reuters)
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday evening that he finds Representative Ilhan Omar’s comments blaming the U.S. for the political crisis in Venezuela “disgusting.”
“The nicest thing I can say is, it is unbelievable ignorance. It’s just factually wrong,” Pompeo told Fox News. “The problems in Venezuela have been years in the making. It’s been a socialist regime, first with Chavez now with Maduro. And for a member of Congress, who, frankly — one who sits on an important national-security committee — to make a statement blaming America first in this way, it’s not only ignorant, it’s disgusting.”
Omar, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was asked Wednesday by PBS’s Democracy Now! about the “U.S.-supported coup attempt against President Maduro,” to which the Minnesota Democrat responded that America’s push for regime change in Venezuela does not help the country’s citizens.
“A lot of the policies that we have put in place has [ sic ] kind of helped lead [to] the devastation in Venezuela,” Omar said. “And we’ve sort of set the stage for where we’re arriving today.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

“This particular bullying and the use of sanctions to eventually intervene and make regime change really does not help the people of countries like Venezuela, and it certainly does not help and is not in the interest of the United States,” she added."
Spying on the Trump Campaign Isn't a Conspiracy Theory Anymore | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/spying-on-the-trump-campaign-isnt-a-conspiracy-theory-anymore/,"May 3, 2019 9:57 AM Then presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Fresno, Calif., May 27, 2016.

The F.B.I. sent her to London as part of the counterintelligence inquiry opened that summer to better understand the Trump campaign’s links to Russia. Wait, it gets weirder, as shortly after the New York Times ran this story, George Papadopoulos tweeted : “Azra Turk” clearly was not FBI. She was CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel. She could hardly speak English and was tasked to meet me about my work in the energy sector offshore Israel/Cyprus which Turkey was competing with. (Was is possible she was only posing as having troubles with English?) Does the Federal Bureau of Investigation traditionally send undercover investigators to talk to a presidential campaign’s low-level staffers? The term “Spygate” doesn’t seem so hyperbolic now. Quite a few Democrats were livid when Attorney General William Barr said “spying did occur” in testimony last month. (His full quote: “I think spying did occur. The question was whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting it wasn’t predicated. I need to explore that.”) "

“Anti-Semitism has always been with us. It probably always will be. It exists on the far left and on the far right.

Diversity & Inclusion in Higher Education | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Leef,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/do-we-really-need-an-inclusive-academy/,"May 3, 2019 11:58 AM (Dreamstime)
It has been quite a long time since America’s education sector excluded anyone who was a capable teacher/scholar. But that isn’t good enough for the many “ diversophiles ” (as Peter Wood calls them) in our midst. Those people can always find some reason to complain that we don’t yet have enough diversity and that some group is “ underrepresented.”
Two such academics are Abigail Stewart and Virginia Valian, who have written a hefty book entitled An Inclusive Academy. Their goal is to persuade everyone that more diversity is always good.
In today’s Martin Center article, Professor Charles Geshekter examines their book and finds it to be very lame. He writes:
This study confirms the tenacity of diversity activists and bureaucrats whose ‘numbers game’ continues to embroil universities. For any contemporary campus, the authors find so much diversity to consider to achieve genuine inclusivity—’race and ethnicity, gender, sexuality, rank, ability status, age, dependent care demands, partner status, health, and more.’ Even more?
One obvious problem with the book that Geshekter exposes is that the authors cite all kinds of research purporting to show that “ diversity ” makes for better results, but never once consider any of the counter-arguments that have been made against their beliefs."
Pro-Abortion Protest: Students for Life of America Display Disrupted | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/students-shout-their-abortions-to-disrupt-a-pro-life-display/,"Follow Alexandra DeSanctis on Twitter May 3, 2019 12:47 PM
Earlier this month, at the University of Texas–San Antonio (UTSA), we got a disturbing glimpse of what it looks like when proponents of abortion begin to revere it as a sacrament. National pro-life group Students for Life of America reported earlier this week that pro-abortion protestors disrupted a Cemetery of the Innocents display that the group set up in mid April at UTSA.

The display consisted of 911 pink crosses in the ground to commemorate each of the unborn human lives ended by abortion every day at Planned Parenthood clinics. Students from a campus group called Students United for Planned Parenthood showed up to protest with Planned Parenthood signs and danced in the middle of the memorial, while some of them shouted in sing-song, “I’ve had an abortion!”
The protesters repeatedly yelled that they love abortion, and some pointed at the crosses, saying, “Look, there’s mine right there.” One student described aborting fetuses as her “number-one kink.” They also chanted, “Hey, stop, what’s that sound? All the fetuses are in the ground,” riffing on the protest song “For What It’s Worth.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

Any mockery of a pro-life memorial is distressing, to be sure, especially on college campuses, where progressive students most often have the ability to shout down or shut down dissenting perspectives. But it is especially heartbreaking to witness such casual, chilling disregard for the dignity and value of unborn human lives, and to see young people so entrenched in a pro-abortion mindset that they openly cheer and celebrate their own abortions.

World Press Freedom Day & Journalists -- Remember Media Who Risk Their Lives | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Marlo Safi,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/on-world-press-freedom-day-remember-the-journalists-who-risk-their-lives/,"May 3, 2019 2:07 PM (Philippe Wojazer/Reuters)
Journalists have a habit today, especially during the Trump era, of patting their own backs. CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s upcoming book “The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America” is a good example of this hubris. The book is described by the publisher as an “explosive, first-hand account of the dangers he faces reporting on the current White House while fighting on the front lines in President Trump’s war on truth.” While Trump’s rhetoric can be brash and inappropriate (especially his “enemy of the people” rebukes, which I find pernicious), we enjoy press freedoms in America that few other places in the world offer. Even our friends in the U.K. don’t enjoy the freedoms we do. Advertisement Advertisement
Today is World Press Freedom Day, and while, on American soil, journalists enjoy rights enshrined by the Constitution, much of our news comes from places where governments are hostile toward writers, or where journalists are on the front lines of conflict and reporting the news puts them in harm’s way. In Myanmar, Reuters journalist Kyaw Soe Oo has been in prison for 508 days, handcuffed and flanked by police for investigating the killings of Rohingya Muslim men and boys. Persian journalists face harassment and intimidation from Iranian authorities for doing their jobs. Journalists in Gaza and Syria have covered war while bullets are flying through the air. Shifa Gardi was killed by a roadside bomb in February 2017 while covering the Iraqi army’s offensive against ISIS. The Turkish government jails more journalists than any other nation. Most jailed journalists (70 percent) face anti-state charges."

EMP Electromagnetic Pulse: Countermeasures Urgently Needed | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,William Graham,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/emp-executive-order-trump-administration-takes-threat-seriously/,"About Peter Vincent Pry May 3, 2019 1:05 PM Department of Homeland Security workers at the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center in Arlington, Va., January 13, 2015. (Larry Downing/Reuters) A threat that could literally mean the end of civilization is finally getting the attention it needs under Trump.
W ashington and the press call almost everything an “existential threat” these days. But the threat from a natural or man-made electromagnetic pulse (EMP) really is one, as our congressional commission reported in 2017:
The critical national infrastructure in the United States faces a present and continuing existential threat from combined-arms warfare, including cyber and manmade electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, as well as EMP from a solar superstorm. During the Cold War, the U.S. was primarily concerned about an EMP attack generated by a high-altitude nuclear weapon as a tactic by which the Soviet Union could suppress the U.S. national command authority and the ability to respond to a nuclear attack — and thus negate the deterrence value of assured nuclear retaliation. Within the last decade, newly-armed adversaries, including North Korea, have been developing the ability and threatening to carry out an EMP attack against the United States.
The bottom line:
Such an attack would give countries that have only a small number of nuclear weapons the ability to cause widespread, long-lasting damage to critical national infrastructures, to the United States itself as a viable country, and to the survival of a majority of its population.
The EMP Commission warns that potential adversaries are developing a revolutionary new way of warfare combining cyber-attacks, sabotage, and nuclear EMP attack against national electric grids and other critical infrastructures to achieve quick and decisive victory:
Combined-Arms Cyber Warfare, as planned by Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, may use combinations of cyber-, sabotage-, and ultimately nuclear EMP-attack to impair the United States quickly and decisively by blacking-out large portions of its electric grid and other critical infrastructures. Foreign adversaries may also consider nuclear EMP attack as the ultimate cyber “denial of service” weapon, one which can gravely damage the U.S. by striking at its technological Achilles’ heel, without having to engage the U.S. military. . . .
The synergism of such combined-arms is described in the military doctrines of all these potential adversaries as the greatest Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) in history — one which anticipates rendering obsolete many, if not all, traditional instruments of military power.
Alarmingly, in the military doctrines of potential adversaries, nuclear EMP attack is considered a dimension of cyber warfare, because EMP is not directly injurious to people, only to electronics. High-altitude EMP attack entails exo-atmospheric detonation (30 to 500 kilometers high), so none of the blast, fire, radiation, radioactive fallout, or other effects associated with a nuclear attack on a city would occur — only the EMP.
Yet EMP, like a super-energetic radio wave that can destroy all kinds of electronics across a region as vast as North America with a single weapon, could in the long run kill far more Americans through its indirect effects than nuclear bombing of a city. Fatalities estimated from a protracted nationwide blackout lasting one year range from 67 to 90 percent of the U.S. population, due to starvation, disease, and societal collapse.
The EMP Commission tried, but could not figure out a way to keep 328 million Americans alive for a year without food and water. In 1880, just before the invention of the first electric grid in 1882, and long before the advent of our high-tech electronic civilization, the U.S. population was about 50 million, sustained by horse-drawn, coal-fired, and mechanical critical infrastructures that no longer exist. Advertisement Advertisement
Nuclear deterrence may not prevent an EMP attack, which can be executed anonymously using a balloon or a private jet or by doing a zoom-climb, with a short-range missile launched off a freighter (as practiced by Iran), or by satellite (as practiced by North Korea). Retaliatory threats are credible only if you know who attacked.
EMP also blinds, at the speed of light, satellites, radars, and other National Technical Means used for threat assessment and identifying attackers. Super-EMP weapons now possessed by Russia, China, and probably North Korea could generate 100,000 volts/meter or more, greatly exceeding the U.S. military hardening standard (50,000 volts/meter) and potentially paralyzing U.S. nuclear and conventional retaliatory capabilities.
For more on the military dimensions of the EMP threat, see the EMP Commission Report “Nuclear EMP Attack Scenarios and Combined-Arms Cyber Warfare” (July 2017). All the unclassified EMP Commission reports are available at www.firstempcommission.org .
Terrible as the consequences of a nuclear EMP attack on the United States would be, a natural EMP from a solar superstorm, such as a recurrence of the 1859 Carrington Event, could be even worse, potentially collapsing life-sustaining critical infrastructures — electric grids, communication, transportation, business and finance, food and water — worldwide:
Solar super-storms, like the 1859 Carrington Event, generate natural EMP that could blackout electric grids and other life-sustaining critical infrastructures . . . putting at risk the lives of many millions. Recurrence of another Carrington Event is inevitable. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reports the Earth was nearly impacted by a solar super-storm on July 23, 2012. NASA estimates the likelihood of such an event to be 12 percent per decade, virtually guaranteeing Earth will be impacted by a solar super-storm within the lifetimes of our grandchildren — and perhaps ourselves as well.
But there is some good news, according to the EMP Commission Chairman’s Report: “Protecting and defending the national electric grid and other critical infrastructures from EMP can be accomplished at reasonable cost and minimal disruption to the present systems.” Protecting against the most severe threat — nuclear EMP attack — could be done in a manner that also protects against natural EMP from solar storms and mitigates other threats, including cyber-attacks, sabotage, and severe weather such as hurricanes.
The great news is that President Trump has issued his “Executive Order on Coordinating National Resilience to Electromagnetic Pulses” (March 26, 2019), which implements core recommendations of the EMP Commission, requiring that: “The Federal Government must foster sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective approaches to improving the Nation’s resilience to the effects of EMPs.” Advertisement
The EMP Executive Order describes a program for protecting electric grids and other life-sustaining critical infrastructures that shall be, as recommended by the EMP Commission, run from the White House.
One of the biggest obstacles to achieving national EMP preparedness is buck-passing by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), and utilities. No one wants to take the lead on protecting critical infrastructures from EMP, and everyone has plausible arguments why responsibility belongs to someone else. Now the EMP Executive Order requires DHS, DOD, DOE, and the utilities to work together on national EMP preparedness — under White House supervision.
The recent foot-dragging and erroneous DHS “National EMP Strategy” (October 9, 2018) — reluctantly drafted by DHS only because Congress tried to compel them to do something about EMP in the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act — would have continued studying EMP until 2028. In contrast, President Trump’s EMP Executive Order moves like lightning. Some deadlines: “Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security . . . shall identify and list the national critical infrastructures . . . that, if disrupted, could reasonably result in catastrophic national or regional effects.” “Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security . . . shall review and update Federal response plans, programs, and procedures to account for the effects of EMPs.” “Within 1 year of the date of this order . . . the Secretary of Homeland Security . . . shall submit to the President . . . a report that analyzes the technology options available to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure to the effects of EMPs.” “Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security . . . shall identify regulatory and non-regulatory mechanisms, including cost recovery mechanisms, that can enhance private-sector engagement to address the effects of EMPs.” “Within 1 year of the date of this order . . . the Secretary of Energy . . . shall review existing standards for EMPs and develop or update . . . quantitative benchmarks that sufficiently describe the physical characteristics of EMPs, including waveform and intensity, in a form that is useful to and can be shared with owners and operators of critical infrastructure.”
Very importantly, given the development of super-EMP weapons by Russia, China, and probably North Korea, the EMP Executive Order directs:
The Secretary of Defense shall conduct R&D and testing to understand the effects of EMPs on Department of Defense systems . . . and develop technologies to protect Department of Defense systems and infrastructure from the effects of EMPs to ensure the successful execution of Department of Defense missions.
President Trump’s EMP executive order is an opportunity for the U.S. government and private sector to achieve national EMP preparedness quickly, within two to three years. But “the swamp” may yet win. Obama holdovers and career bureaucrats, the electric-power lobby, and ignorant media “instant EMP experts” will do everything in their power to derail Trump’s plan to make America safe from EMP.
Shortly after issuance of the EMP executive order, a spate of articles appeared claiming that EMP is not a real threat, or the threat is overblown. For example, on April 30, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), a lobby for the electric utilities masquerading as a quasi-governmental partner with the Department of Energy, released a bogus study purporting a nuclear EMP attack would be no big deal. The EPRI report includes a disclaimer that EPRI is not responsible and cannot be sued if anyone believes their report, follows their advice, and suffers loss of property or life from EMP.
Stratfor’s Scott Stewart, in “ The EMP Threat Is Real, but It Shouldn’t Keep You Up at Night” (April 9, 2019), makes many erroneous claims, including that, because Puerto Rico recovered from Hurricane Maria (with massive emergency assistance from the United States), somehow a protracted blackout of North America would not kill millions of Americans deprived of food and water, possibly for months or years.

William Barr's Testimony -- Cover-Up Allegations Reveal a Never-Ending Spin Cycle | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/g-file/the-bill-barr-chicanery-is-about-controlling-the-narrative/,"Follow Jonah Goldberg on Twitter May 3, 2019 3:24 PM Attorney General William Barr testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., May 1, 2019.

D ear Reader (Including Jacob Wohl, who might need help with the big words),
I’m leaving in a little while to chaperone a New York City weekend get-together for my daughter and 15 other 16-year-olds. So . . . pray for me. This might mean that this week’s “news”letter is not only abbreviated but also a bit snitty. Advertisement Advertisement
Speaking of snitty — and I don’t mean the eighth dwarf — I really don’t want to write about the Bill Barr brouhaha bedeviling the Beltway Brahmins, but alliteration beckons and beguiles, perforce the professional pundit proceeds with perhaps pusillanimous, perchance pugnacious, pontification on the pending pertinent predicaments.
Sorry, I won’t do that again.
You know that feeling when you and your fellow Knights Templar are sitting around drinking absinthe-flavored Fresca watching turtles play chess, but no one else notices that the bigger turtle, which is actually a rare breed of parrot that likes to wear unlicensed Phish concert T-shirts, brings its queen out way too early? No wait, that’s a different feeling. A somewhat related one is when everybody is screaming about stuff you don’t think is scream-worthy. Advertisement
That’s how I feel about this Barr stuff. On the substance, I mostly fall in with my colleagues on this one . Bill Barr stands accused of a heinous cover-up. But he didn’t actually cover up anything. He wrote a letter that characterized the findings of the Mueller report in terms that were favorable to the president, but not inaccurate. The monster! He then released the report less than a month later with minimal and, by most objective accounts, perfectly reasonable redactions. Advertisement
In the long history of attorneys general playing the role of political fixers and cronies, this doesn’t seem to amount to much. George Washington’s first — “handpicked” — attorney general, Edmund Randolph, served as a political operative and confidante of the president. JFK appointed his 35-year-old, unqualified brother to run interference for him. FDR’s first AG was a former head of the DNC who spent much of his tenure concocting dubious constitutional arguments to give the boss wartime powers over the economy. If you’ve seen Boardwalk Empire , you probably know that Harding’s AG, Harry Daugherty , was a piece of work.
Give Me Narrative or Give Me Death
Anyway, Eli Lake asks a good question :
So what are Democrats so upset about? Is it that they lost a precious 25 days — from March 24 to April 18 — to spin Mueller’s findings to their liking? This is worse than Watergate! They will never get those news cycles back.
E. J. Dionne has the answer: Yes, that is exactly what they are upset about:
It’s not good enough that a redacted version of the report was eventually made public. For 27 days, the debate over Mueller’s findings was twisted by Barr’s poisonous distortions that implied a full exoneration of President Trump. Many public statements and much punditry were devoted to insisting that Trump’s opponents owed the president an apology, that the Russia matter was never what it was cracked up to be, that the president was free and clear.
Back to Eli:
This complaint is not only picayune but also hypocritical. Since Trump won the 2016 election, the narrative (that word again) that he might be a Russian asset or may have conspired with Russia has been a near article of faith for the resistance. If Democrats can chastise Barr for spinning Mueller’s report for 25 days, then why can’t Republicans ask why Mueller didn’t end all the speculation about a Trump-Russia conspiracy as soon as he found out it wasn’t true?
Much like that time the border patrol opened my car’s trunk during my Bolivian-tree-frog-smuggling phase, a few things jump out at me.
The first is that Eli says it was 25 days and E. J. says it was 27. I will not adjudicate this because I was promised there would be no math. But I am tempted to split the difference Salvador Dali style and say it was melting clock number of days. Advertisement
Second, I think E. J. has a point, I just think it’s a strange one to get so angry about. Barr did throw a monkey wrench into the gears of the juggernaut of the media-industrial complex. I have no quarrel with folks who think Barr overstepped in an effort to blunt the spin of the report. But Mueller declined to make a call on obstruction, leaving that up to Bill Barr. He decided not to pursue charges of obstruction for debatable, but certainly defensible, reasons. Once he made that decision, it would be odd for him to lend aid and comfort to those who would disagree with it no matter what. Advertisement
But the really amazing part is the way the imperative of narrative is overpowering everything else. I’m with Eli in being a little exhausted with the thumbsuckery about narratives these days. But this is remarkable. Barr’s “cover up” amounts to accurately describing the conclusions of the Mueller report, but not in a way that would have chummed the water for the media and the Democrats. Advertisement
This is a categorical change in the way we normally talk about scandals. Dionne — and many others — is sincerely outraged that pundits were denied their preferred column fodder for 27 days. Mueller himself also seems perturbed that the Barr letter contributed a narrative that was less hostile to Trump than the one he wanted. And, to be honest, I get it. I think the Mueller report is far more damning of the Trump administration than the pro-Trump narrative-crafters claim. But successfully winning a battle in an ongoing spin war is not a “cover up,” never mind a “crime.” Advertisement
The assumption seems to be that a great opportunity to gin up public outrage was lost by Barr’s chicanery and that it now unfairly falls to the Democratic House to make its case on the merits. I get why partisans would be pissed off about that. I can recount countless examples of Bill Clinton winning spin battles with similar “cheating” during his impeachment struggles. But at the end of the day, winning a spin cycle is not an affront to the Constitution.
One last thing. I do think many criticisms of Barr have some merit, but I am deeply skeptical of the various theories about his motivations. All of this talk about how Trump has finally found his Roy Cohn or Eric Holder strikes me as another form of narrative maintenance. If someone does something that is beneficial to Trump, it must be proof that they’ve gone over to the Dark Side or some such. But it still strikes me as possible, indeed probable, that Barr’s motivations are nobler. Remember the anonymous op-ed in the New York Times ? The author said he was one of many administration officials working to blunt or thwart the president’s “worst inclinations.” Don McGahn arguably saved the Trump presidency by refusing to do some of the “crazy sh**” Trump wanted him to do. Gary Cohn reportedly stopped Trump from pulling out of NAFTA and a trade deal with South Korea by snatching the paperwork from his desk. I know too many people in the administration who see themselves as doing the right things despite Trump, not because of him, to immediately assume everyone in there is a less stupid Jacob Wohl. Advertisement
It is not obvious to me that Barr’s actions aren’t consistent with these kinds of efforts. Who knows what Barr had to do to get Trump’s permission to release the Mueller report in a timely manner? The widespread assumption is that Barr wrote that memo about the Mueller probe as a way to curry favor with the administration. Maybe. But it’s also possible that he sincerely believed the Mueller probe was fatally flawed on the merits, as many of my friends around here believe as well. Maybe he is trying to salvage the Department of Justice as an institution. The public facts make this seem preposterous to people who think that anything that is good for Trump must not only be bad but also come from bad motives. Barr has certainly taken a reputational hit since he became attorney general — a job he didn’t need — but we don’t know what he is getting for paying that price. But the history of all this has yet to be written, and I’m willing to hold off final judgment until it is — or at least until we have better facts than the ones currently on offer. Advertisement

It may well be my last piece for the magazine — as a senior editor. I hope to still grace (and be graced by) NR’s pages in the future. Advertisement
It’s been a good week for The Remnant podcast. For episode 100 (?) I talked with the great Thomas Sowell . For episode 101 (?) I finally convinced my bride, The Fair Jessica , to talk with me about her career as an author and ghostwriter, her roots in Alaska, our shared dog-love, and a host of other topics (Warning: I apparently giggled a lot). Going by the feedback on Twitter, it was one of the most popular episodes ever. The latest installment features my friend and colleague Michael Brendan Daugherty, discussing his book, staggered identity, Ireland, and the disenchantment of the world.
Canine Update: The middle-age mellowing of Zoë continues apace. Kirsten our indispensable canine perambulator sent Jessica and me a text the other day: “Wow, so ZZ found some ancient bone and Obi [a member of the pack] went to investigate and all she did was tell him off. That would have been a face ripping offense once upon a time. I’m kind of proud of her.” Some evidence of Zoë’s meddling might just be a misreading of the data. She is a little overweight (we’re working on it), and so she’s lost a step when it comes to chasing rabbits and squirrels. It could be that when we get her back down to fighting weight, she will be able to add to her metaphorical necklace of critter skulls. Still, she seems more content with smelling (and occasionally eating) the flowers than she used to be and more content with scritches too . Though she still considers guarding the pack a non-negotiable part of her portfolio, even if she sometimes thinks Pippa should fight her own battles . Meanwhile, Pippa remains the indefatigable ball of energy she’s always been. As she matures, that puts a bit more pressure on us to regulate her butt-waggling spanielness since she came without any factory -installed regulator. Regardless, they’re good dogs , no matter what Comfortably Smug says. And Gracie is a good cat. When she chooses to be.

Colorado senator Michael Bennet makes 21 Democratic presidential candidates, and the impending announcement of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio will bring the total to 22. Our Dan McLaughlin asks whether we should include Mike Gravel and Montana governor Steve Bullock, apparently still seriously considering a bid.
That would make 24, and if it all pans out, this will be the worst 24 since Sangalese rebels took over the White House by sneaking in through the sewers . Advertisement Advertisement
We’ve seen Pete Buttigieg break into the top tier, but the odds are stacked pretty heavily against the remaining lesser-known candidates. The DNC thresholds for the debates are set way too low; you need either 1 percent — 1 percent! — in three polls or 65,000 individual donors. Getting 65,000 people to donate to your campaign is not that hard, particularly if you do something like John Delaney’s gimmick of offering to give to charities on donors’ behalf if they chip into his campaign. The New York Times calculates that 17 candidates have met the threshold so far, and Bennet, de Blasio, and Bullock could all reach 65,000 donors or hit 1 percent support in three polls, and Seth Moulton probably can do it, too.
The DNC had been contemplating two-night debates, but now each night is going to have at least eight candidates, and perhaps as many as 12. You’ll be waiting for them to get back to Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, and you’ll have to sit through two minutes of Eric Swalwell, and then two minutes of Tim Ryan, and then two minutes of Delaney, and then two minutes of Moulton, each one determined to show that they’re even more opposed to Trump than the Democratic official who spoke before them.

There is not much ideological or policy variety among these candidates. Maybe John Hickenlooper and Bennet and Bullock will represent a somewhat centrist position, but another dozen will be insisting, “I’m the true progressive in this race.” We’re going to hear “back in my city, as mayor, I laid out a plan to . . . ” from Buttigieg, de Blasio, and maybe Julian Castro, Cory Booker, and Hickenlooper. You’ll hear a lot of “I introduced legislation to . . . ” or “I led the fight in the Senate to . . . ” (To reuse a line from the Kerry Spot days, “I led the fight on this issue” usually means “I gave a speech on this topic that was only seen by people watching C-SPAN at that moment.”) Advertisement
Oh, and don’t be surprised if the audience for the second night isn’t as big as the first night. It’s not an exact comparison, but back in August 2015 , the “undercard” debate of lower-polling candidates had a quarter of the audience that the main debate had. The audience for the first two was huge — 24 million for the first, 23 million for the second — but then settled in the 11 million to 18 million range for the rest. There’s a lot of curiosity at first — but then listening to a long line of candidates all offer variations of the same message gets boring. Advertisement"

Remembering James V. Schall: A Jesuit Scholar’s Last Days | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Stephen Wu,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/remembering-father-james-schall-last-days/,"May 4, 2019 5:30 AM Father James Schall in 2012 The priest and philosopher died where he had lived, in the City of God.
Y esterday afternoon, on a bright blue, cloudless day, Father James V. Schall (1928–2019) was laid to rest in the warm soil of California, alongside his Jesuit brethren at the old Mission Cemetery, a short distance from both Santa Clara University and the Sacred Heart Jesuit Center in Los Gatos. It might be said that these two institutions represent the twin pillars of Schall’s life and philosophy: fides et ratio . He studied philosophy and theology as a young man at Santa Clara almost 75 years ago. At Sacred Heart, he pledged his life to the Society of Jesus, and departed this earth as well. Advertisement Advertisement
In the days since his death, many have written movingly about the life and character of Father Schall. Among the recurring themes are his deep learning, his unwavering commitment to the tradition of the Church, and his sheer exuberance for life and friends. He lived out his principles to the very end, writing columns, publishing books, and maintaining a steady diet of reading along with a staggering volume of e-mail correspondence. According to the archivist for the Western Province of the Society of Jesus, Schall published continuously since 1954. The Special Collections at Georgetown University, where he taught for over 35 years, maintains Schall’s papers, some twenty-odd archival boxes stretching 33 linear feet. Christendom College houses a huge collection of books donated from his personal library. His own published books number over three dozen, and his bibliography spans 168 single-spaced pages. At his feet, thousands of students have read Plato and Cicero and Augustine. I was one of many undergraduates at Georgetown who had received the same advice: “Major in Schall.”
I still recall the day Father Schall told me he was retiring from teaching. I had stopped by his office one autumn morning and asked how he had been. He mentioned some fatigue — not unsurprising for a man then in his mid 80s and still teaching six classes a week. Then, ever so casually, he added that he would be retiring at year’s end, a decision he had made earlier that day. I was stunned. It had not occurred to me that he would ever retire, as though such a thing would violate a fixed law of the universe: Objects in motion stay in motion. He told me he planned to return to Los Gatos, to the same house where he had been a Jesuit novice, and where he was prepared to live out his retirement. Parties were planned, though he resisted drawing attention to his departure. He demurred, initially, about delivering a “Last Lecture” at Georgetown, thinking it too much a fuss. Eventually, he relented. He would give a farewell address. But he added, “I cannot imagine that you will need a very big place. A classroom strikes me as plenty big enough.” Advertisement
A few weeks later, 800 people flooded Gaston Hall, Georgetown’s largest auditorium. Schall spoke in a marvelous, old-fashioned moral vocabulary: on the ethical implications of political life, the nature and limits of philosophy, the ordering of souls. He titled his lecture “The Final Gladness” and touched on many of his enduring themes: friendship, justice, and the triune God. The subjects were related. Justice — that which man merited — was a necessary benchmark against which God could dispense His grace through the offering of eternal life. God, Schall maintained, is not lonely, and friendship with the divine, as Aristotle and Aquinas hinted, is the fulfillment of human life. And such fulfillment is not only logical, it is the truest and deepest expression of man’s nature. Schall believed to his core that revelation, which offered the path to communion with the divine if only man would accept it, was not merely compatible with reason but was indeed the very completion of it. The modern project was doomed to failure precisely because it sought to cleave the one from the other, if not eliminate the transcendent altogether. That rupture impoverished both reason and revelation, forcing the intellect to shoulder more than it could bear, while sapping the spiritual dimension of man’s ethical life. Advertisement
Schall sought instead to maintain the unity of intellect and faith as expressed in the Roman Catholic tradition of Thomas Aquinas. Schall’s business was to talk to the potential philosophers, the young men and women who had a whole world and a whole life ahead of them, and to suggest that they be mindful of its ultimate purpose. He thus lived out his vocation as a priest in a sort of radical evangelization — quintessentially Ignatian, engaged in what the Greeks called metanoia , the “conversion,” or the “turning.” He would be the first to admit that not every student would, or could, get down to the intricacies of Augustine or Ratzinger or Gilson. But if he could but open that young man’s eyes to the drama of human existence, a life might yet be redeemed. Schall was a turner of souls. Advertisement Advertisement
He left Washington for California on the first day of spring in 2013. The date, he noted, was “deliberately chosen.” There was poetry in an old man’s returning home on the day that signified new life. For those who have never been, the Jesuit House in Los Gatos is a remarkable place. Formerly the novitiate for the California Province of the Society of Jesus, it is sited on a steep hill, bounded by a winery, and enveloped by what used to be sprawling vineyards. The House sits at the highest point, accessible only from a road that winds past black gates adorned with white crosses. There Schall would spend six good years, writing and reading and looking out over the San Francisco Bay and the Santa Clara Valley. His strength even seemed to improve — some function, perhaps, of the California sunshine? Only toward Christmas of 2018 did his health begin to decline noticeably. The end was thought to be near, but, after refusing antibiotics and further treatment, a man who had survived cancers of the eye and the jaw, whose hearing flagged and vision dimmed, bounced back. We went out to lunch and he ordered hot soup and glazed prawns, eating with the appetite of a man half his age. I thought it a miracle. I still do. Advertisement
The period between then and April, when Father Schall finally left us, turned out to be a grace note, a blessing for those of us able to spend a little more time with him. Word eventually issued forth one day that another, more serious hospitalization had taken place and that he was returned to Los Gatos with instructions to keep comfortable. That evening, when I walked in to visit, his eyes opened. He had been hooked up to an oxygen machine but returned to his old room in the Jesuit House. His first words were “What in the world are you doing here this time of night?” Even then, his instinct was not to focus on himself but to ask after others. We made some small talk, and he cracked some jokes. It’s been noted how a man of such prodigious intellect, who taught the Western canon from the Greeks through the moderns, could put anyone at ease with his easy banter and effortless relatability. A few weeks prior, he had celebrated his 91st birthday. Rather than ruminate on old age or his legacy, he wanted to watch the Rams take on the Saints. Such was the genius of Father Schall, for whom “play” got to something deeply meaningful. So even as his body failed, he smiled and laughed. I promised to come back to see him again. He nodded, replied, and we said good night. Advertisement
The next day I returned to the Jesuit House. Father was alert and conscious, but his breathing was shallow and labored. I sat with him into the night. Late in the evening, two nurses came in to wash his face. They brought music — Mozart. I read him two things. The first was from Leon Kass’s recent collection of essays, Leading a Worthy Life: Finding Meaning in Modern Times . The passage was on hope, what Kass calls the “indispensable virtue.” It reminded me of that great encyclical of modern times , Spe Salvi . There Benedict XVI writes, “Ultimately we want only one thing — ‘the blessed life,’ the life which is simply life, simply ‘happiness.’ In the final analysis, there is nothing else that we ask for in prayer. Our journey has no other goal — it is about this alone .” Advertisement Advertisement
The other item I read was the conclusion of Plato’s Phaedo . At the end of his life, Socrates takes the hemlock. Rejecting the entreaties of his friends, he does not delay. Socrates is prepared to die. Life, he knew, is good, but so too may be leaving it when called. Philosophy itself, as Cicero reminded us, is preparation to die. And so Socrates drinks the cup and lays on his back. His legs and arms become stiff, and his body cold. Father lay in bed, his own body firm, his own legs heavy. The final words of Socrates are “Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius; make this offering to him and do not forget.” Asclepius tended to the sick. I pressed Father’s hand into mine, whispered down, and left him to sleep. He died the next day."
William Barr: The New Dick Cheney | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Matthew Continetti,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/mueller-report-william-barr-dick-cheney/,"May 4, 2019 5:30 AM Attorney General William Barr testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, May 1, 2019. (Aaron Bernstein/Reuters) Washington finds a bugaboo.
I can’t think of a better illustration of our partisan divide than the reactions to Attorney General William Barr’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Democrats are furious at Barr’s defense of his rollout of the Mueller report and his assertions of executive power. Some Democrats want Barr to resign, others want him to be impeached, and Nancy Pelosi says he’s guilty of lying to Congress. Republicans have found a hero. Advertisement Advertisement
Barr is the new Dick Cheney: a stocky, bespectacled, confrontational, blunt, intelligent, unapologetically conservative, experienced, high-powered official who believes in and fights for the office of the president. Just as Democrats loathed Cheney as a bugaboo manipulating President George W. Bush to further the interests of Halliburton, they attack Barr as a dishonest factotum of President Trump’s. The qualities that drove Democrats batty over Cheney — his inscrutability, his cleverness, his asperity, and above all his success — make them incensed about Barr. These happen to be qualities Republicans find appealing.
What’s behind conservative support for Cheney and Barr is their lack of embarrassment. Most Washingtonians, no matter their party, find it important to be held in esteem by the city’s tastemakers, who are overwhelmingly liberal. Not these two. The classic Cheney moment was his 2004 exchange with Pat Leahy on the Senate floor. Cheney complained that Leahy had called him a war profiteer. Leahy responded that Cheney had said he was a bad Catholic. So Cheney ended the conversation by telling Leahy to perform a physically impossible four-letter act. “You’d be surprised at how many people liked that,” Cheney recollected in a 2010 interview. “It’s sort of the best thing I ever did.” He’s selling himself short. Advertisement
Republican fans of Barr circulated clips of his Senate appearance Wednesday even as media coverage of his testimony was uniformly negative. No Democrats are held in less esteem by conservatives than are the ones on the Judiciary Committee. They will never live down their treatment of Brett Kavanaugh. Trump supporters nodded in agreement when Barr said the controversy over his March 24 description of the Mueller report is “mind-bendingly bizarre.” They chuckled when he said Mueller’s March 27 letter to him was “a bit snitty and I think it was probably written by one of his staff members.” They guffawed when Barr described the verb “spying” as “a good English word.” They cheered when Richard Blumenthal asked for notes Barr had taken of his phone conversation with Mueller and Barr told him no. “Why should you have them?”
Where his predecessor was genial and deferential to Congress and the press, Barr is disdainful and combative. At his April 18 press conference before the publication of the Mueller report, a CBS reporter asked Barr if his use of the word “unprecedented” to describe the circumstances of the Russia investigation was “quite generous to the president and his feelings and emotions.” Barr replied, “Is there another precedent for it?”“No,” the reporter acknowledged sheepishly. Another reporter wondered, “Is it an impropriety for you to come out and sort of spin the report before people are able to read it?” Barr said, “No,” and left the room. Lib owned. Advertisement Advertisement
In 2001, Cheney fought with Henry Waxman over records related to the former’s energy task force. Almost two decades later, Barr and Jerry Nadler face each other in a standoff over whether a sitting attorney general ought to be questioned by staff counsel. Not even CNN “could locate an instance where a Cabinet official was interviewed by staff members during a public hearing before the House Judiciary Committee.” But that hasn’t stopped Nadler from claiming there’s “ample precedent” for his request. Committee Democrat Steve Cohen accuses Barr of being afraid of staff attorneys, but anyone who’s watched Barr before Congress knows he doesn’t spook easily. The fight with Nadler is over optics. Nadler wants his hearing to evoke memories of Watergate and Iran-Contra. Barr has no problem denying him the opportunity.
The Democrats have a dilemma. Their base would like to impeach Trump, but the public at large is against it, and Democratic voters themselves don’t put impeachment high on the priority list. The people most interested in impeachment, it seems, are cable-news anchors and the same four Democrats — SwalwellSchiffLieuBlumenthal — who appear on their shows day after day. Pelosi has adopted a too-clever-by-half strategy of letting the committee chairmen hound the Trump administration while leadership resists full-bore impeachment. The danger of overreach is real. Advertisement
Barr is an obstacle not just because of his support for a strong presidency. He also shows every sign of wanting to get to the bottom of malfeasance at the FBI and DOJ during the 2016 campaign. His critics decry his use of the word “spying” to describe surreptitious intelligence gathering on Trump advisers, but the day after his Senate testimony the New York Times revealed that George Papadopoulos had been contacted by a second FBI employee as part of the Bureau’s counterintelligence probe. It was another vindication of Barr, who had told Congress last month the question wasn’t if spying had occurred, but if it had been “adequately predicated.” Advertisement"
TEFAF New York: Joyous Art Fair Delivers the Goods | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Brian T.

(Courtesy Wildenstein) From ancient artifacts to contemporary work, TEFAF delivers the goods at the Park Avenue Armory.
A rt fairs are a big part of the market. A good fair is a forum for dealers and buyers to do serious business, but also a chance to maintain and rekindle professional relationships. The best dealers and the most conscientious collectors often have known and worked with one another for decades. There’s plenty of warm feeling, and a premium on what I call “fresh meat” – work not seen before. The best fairs vet the art on view for quality and authenticity. Advertisement
I wrote about The European Fine Arts Fair (TEFAF) in March, when it convened in titanic form in the Dutch city of Maastricht. Its smaller, equally classy annual New York iteration, begun three years ago, opened on Thursday at the Park Avenue Armory. It remains a work in progress, and that detracts nothing from its elegance. The Europeans who run TEFAF are still adjusting to the habits of New Yorkers and of Americans art collectors more broadly. I think they expected their New York fair to attract buyers from throughout the country. But there are lots of fairs in America now, and TEFAF’s New York edition is still new.
The crowd is mostly local. This has surprised TEFAF’s masters, because the Maastricht fair attracts people from all over Europe. It’s easy to get from little country to little country on the continent, though, and Maastricht is charming but otherwise without distractions. In New York, there are a million other things to do. Advertisement
There’s some discussion of moving the fair to Washington or Chicago or even Nashville. No one from the Upper East Side is going to go to Nashville for an art fair, much less admit they ever bought something there. Washington? It’s a city where everyone lies. It’s infectious. I’d buy a bottle of Perrier there but not much else. Art Basel has cornered Miami, the one place where everyone wants to go in December.
The Armory is expensive. A decent-size booth at TEFAF can cost $75,000, and then there are the big added costs of extras like outfitting the space. That’s for a four-day fair. So the dealers either need to sell some stuff or, if they lose money, calculate that the visibility and chance to schmooze were worth it. Advertisement
TEFAF offers the highest-quality art and attracts serious collectors and connoisseurs. The other big fairs? Frieze sometimes has the Whiff of the Night: a little shady, a little tacky, with altogether too much that’s shiny new. It appeals to aficionados of contemporary art as well as lots of lookers and scenesters. It and most of the other, big, newer fairs happen on the Hudson River Piers in New York. The spaces there are huge, but a pain to get to. The Piers are enclosed docks, putting you port side. It’s fitting, I guess. You never know what high tide will leave behind. Advertisement
This year, TEFAF seems to have hit its stride, concentrating on contemporary and modern art with some variation.
The big, corporate New York guns are prominent. Gagosian has a selection of work by the profoundly overrated Roy Lichtenstein. Zwirner has an all-Paul Klee booth, which is topical given the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus movement, though I thought only one of the works on display was really good. Pace has an all-Dubuffet booth, and I suspect paid the wandering model in the Armory vestibule dressed as a Dubuffet sculpture. Matthew Marks features a 2017 sculpture by Martin Puryear, the star of this year’s American pavilion at the Venice Biennale, an artist I like. But it’s not the best thing Puryear has done, and I wonder why he’s represented by something so . . . so-so.
Wildenstein, the timeless dealer, again shows superb taste. A sparkling $600,000 1975 painting by Sam Gilliam, acrylic with painted canvas collage, is flanked by a wild Monet tropical garden from 1884, as if he time traveled to the future, and a Bonnard garden from 1943. It’s dazzling. Grazer by the Sea , 1938, by Milton Avery (Courtesy Waddington Custot) Study for Homage to the Square: “Late Sound” by Josef Albers (Courtesy Waddington Custot)
Waddington Custot from London has two impressive things. I was drawn first to a big Milton Avery watercolor from 1938, a time before he was discovered when he was doing lovely rural scenes. It’s $85,000, a great price. Next, I saw a rarity: a Josef Albers painting I loved. Usually, his work is so dry, bright, and hard. But this one is from 1957, the perfect moment for him, and has a surface richness that’s striking and an elegant, muted, dark palette. It’s been in some distinguished shows, too. It’s $690,000 and was on hold when I saw it. I hope whoever reserved it realizes what a great thing it is. Männerbildnis (Selbstbildnis) , 1918, by Erich Heckel. Color woodcut.

David Tunick is among the most venerable dealers of Old Master works. He has always sold some new things, among them Warhols in the 1970s, but he is renowned mostly for his older stuff. At TEFAF, he shows his responsiveness to modern taste in, as usual, splendid things.

Ede from London is a venerable antiquities dealer. The finest antiquities dealers cater to specialist collectors but also contemporary collectors who like the clean lines, simple palette, and stylized figures of Classical Greek, Roman, and Near Eastern art. The old work gives the new work gravity, and the new work gives the old a dash of pizzazz. I loved Ede’s fabulous Roman cinerary urn from the first century AD, the era of Tiberius, which at $38,000 is the best value of the fair. It held the ashes of, as the boldly graphic Latin inscription tells us, “Epitynchanus, the chief accountant of Ampliatos, a freedman from the imperial household, he lived twenty years.” We don’t know whether our accountant lived to age 20 or balanced Ampliatos’s books for 20 years. But it’s fitting that his urn — his ashes long ago flew the coop — made it to Park Avenue. New York’s becoming more and more like Tiberius’s Rome; we still need guys who are handy with an abacus.

James Matthew Wilson on Poetry’s Form and Substance | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mary Spencer,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/james-matthew-wilson-poetry-form-substance/,"May 4, 2019 5:30 AM James Matthew Wilson A conversation about poetry’s form and substance
J ames Matthew Wilson is an award-winning professor of religion and literature at Villanova University and the author of two poetry collections, Some Permanent Things (2014) and The Hanging God (2018).
As a poet, Wilson makes use of formal structures that are often a secondary concern, if not entirely disregarded, in much contemporary poetry. He is attentive to the centuries-long tradition of poetry not only as a common inheritance but as a living canon. Advertisement Advertisement
In the foreword to Wilson’s second collection, Dana Gioia describes his work as “not the music of the humble shepherd’s pipe but the double keyboard pipe organ — resonant, complex, and contrapuntal.”
National Review spoke with Wilson about his formal and stylistic poetic emphases, art’s permanence, and the influence of the Catholic faith on his writing.
Mary Spencer : Who do you consider your ancestors in the poetic tradition? Advertisement
James Matthew Wilson : I was writing short stories and working on my first novel when I fell in love with poetry. What I saw poetry had — that short stories and novels didn’t — was meter and rhyme. I came to poetry because of the specific formal properties that make poetry poetry as opposed to some kind of prose fiction. And I came to it through the great modern poets, T. S. Eliot, Yvor Winters, and the work of W. B. Yeats and W. H. Auden. Actually, if you look at those four poets together, who between them could divide the world in terms of the achievement of modern poetry, they actually are all still practicing in the longer tradition that in English goes back through Shakespeare to Chaucer (and the longer Western metrical tradition that, of course, goes back to Virgil and Homer).
Eliot exploits fragmentation a great bit, and in some of his later poetry there’s a use of a psalm-like or high-platform rhetoric. But even where Eliot is most jagged and fragmented in The Waste Land , the world in which he’s writing is still a metrical world. It’s still very much in continuity with the poets whom he unseated to become the king of the cats. Late in life he was really disconcerted that young people weren’t reading Browning and Tennyson because he seemed to have criticized them. But in fact, to really understand what Eliot is doing, he has to be read in this larger context, including people he seemed to be attacking, such as Browning and Tennyson. Advertisement
I use forms that Shakespeare would recognize and that with relatively little explanation could be made intelligible to poets of earlier ages. Poetry, as a living and contemporary art, is also in continuous contact with a tradition that extends back several thousand years. When I was a young, aspiring novelist, I looked at the novel and thought, “Oh, you have no pedigree. You have no ancestry.” And I looked at the poetic tradition and thought, “That’s what I want to belong to.” It’s a much more ancient family. Advertisement
Spencer : Is there anything commonly considered poetry that you would not classify as poetry? Advertisement
Wilson : There’s so much. In 2015 I published a book called The Fortunes of Poetry in an Age of Unmaking , and the first hundred pages of that book are like a police record of child abuse.
What our age has done to this venerable art that everybody should love, from schoolchildren to the oldest and wisest of us!
There’s a lot that doesn’t rise to the level of poetry. Yet it all has some poetic element to it.
Poetry has been subject to terrible abuse before. The loose, totally unmeasured lines of most free verse — I just don’t know why people ever thought that was a good idea.
These poets who are becoming quite popular on Instagram these days — their poetry is totally ephemeral and uninteresting and unimaginative — but they take all this effort to make sure that it’s typed out nicely and looks pretty on the page; that’s a very slight virtue but a real virtue. They sense that there is something about poetry that connects us with permanent things. And in many of our imaginations, a vintage typewriter seems permanent in its crude, mechanical way.
Spencer : What is poetry’s relation to permanence? Advertisement
Wilson : Every good human activity has an aspiration to permanence. Everything that’s fruitful is about participating in eternity in some way. Works of art just do this in a way that’s a little more obvious, because they come into being, there they are, and they take their position among the things of the world. They stand apart from us and our lives in a way that they can, in principle, last forever. Though, of course, they will never really last forever. Like Shelley’s Ozymandias, the statue will eventually lay fallen in the desert. But this is the particular kind of permanence that is appropriate to a work of human hands.
Every dimension of a work of art should betray the way in which it is a thing of its time, made by one person at a particular moment in which certain things are believed and certain others aren’t. But, in addition to that, the work should try to make its case for being a kind of lasting work that should exist forever. Advertisement
The poetic tradition is a tradition where things accumulate. It’s not the case that one kind of poem is appropriate in one century or generation and not appropriate in the next. To the contrary, the poetic tradition is one where we’re finding new ways to bring more of human experience into aesthetic representation. And that means that older ways, or aspects of human experience that could already be well represented, don’t go away or cease to be relevant or salient for poetry. Advertisement
But the poet has a responsibility to do his best to stand simultaneously in the permanent and lasting and in the ephemeral. Because what’s most permanent often looks very different from one moment to another. It’s part of the dramatic dimension of poetry that it’s capable of showing us the permanent under the light of the temporal.
Spencer : Do you consider poetry song?
Wilson : Yes — and kind of. The second-to-last section of The Hanging God is called “The Stations of the Cross.” The stanzaic form of all the poems in that section is that of the “Stabat Mater,” Jacopone da Todi’s medieval poem about the Blessed Virgin Mary standing beneath the cross on Good Friday. When I wrote “The Stations,” I intended them to sound good both recited as poetry and also sung.
I published a grand total of one poem in free verse, and that was a satire making fun of other free-verse poetry. Advertisement
One of the great ruinations of modern poetry was through pretending that poetry could somehow exist only on the page as a textual artifact. Whereas writing always has its origin in the ear and on the tongue. It’s harmful to language when it stands at any remove from the spoken word. I always write with an ear to oral performance, and my hope is that if I’m doing so it will lend itself to song.
Over the last few years, I’ve tried to keep the sentence rhythms of my poetry more tightly contained within the stanzas. Part of the reason for that is because that lends itself more to song. Even though I always write metrically, prior to that I was always very interested in exploiting techniques that allow the sense of a sentence to get drawn out across the verse in ways that would not always lend themselves to singing, because the sentence rhythm might be overflowing the limits of a stanza.
In Milton’s preface to Paradise Lost he speaks of “the sense variously drawn out from one verse into another.” I think that for Milton and for me alike, the first interest in metrical poetry is that it makes our own spoken language more polished and refined.
I hope, though, that in most cases, when it’s refined speech, it could also be further refined and set to music.
Spencer : Do you have a preferred meter to read or write?
Wilson : Yeats’s greatest poems are all written in ottava rima, eight-line stanzas that rhyme abababcc . If I come across an ottava rima poem in his works, I know it’s going to be one of my favorites. But I never wrote in ottava rima until a couple of years ago when I wrote two poems — one called “The Fourth Sunday of Advent” and another poem that hasn’t been collected yet called “Self-Possession . ”
I like stanzas that are elaborate and complex and that startle us with their own extravagance. But I also am a great lover of blank verse. Meter really is just a further refinement of natural human speech, and blank verse shows that to the greatest effect. With just a few brief turns of syllables, blank verse can go from the most colloquial speech, such as “the toilet’s clogged again; you better call the plumber,” to the most tightly wrought and refined statement, like the beginning of Shakespeare’s Sonnet 30, “When to the sessions of sweet silent thought / I summon up remembrance of things past.” Those two lines are just so perfectly realized as the highest possible speech, and they’re in the same meter as the toilet-clogged-again line. That’s one of the particular joys for me of meter in general.
Spencer : Do you consider any aspects of human experience unworthy of poetry? Advertisement
Wilson : There are most certainly particular subjects that are more naturally worthy of poetic representation, but that’s because those are just more important subjects, period — love, death, the desire for God, the contemplation of the divine, the contemplation of the world.
But poetry just needs to be in a specially refined language, not in a particular subset of language where only certain things can be dealt with. I do my best to try to find from time to time some kind of far-flung object for a poem. I test to see whether poetry has the ability to shed wisdom on that oddity.
Spencer : Should poetry be necessarily didactic or moral?
Wilson : I think it would be too restricting. But a didactic poem can be a very good poem. Sometimes, the only appropriate response to things is a very didactic or settled response. If you read some of the great poems of the 16th century, they often read like little moral epigrams.
There’s a poetry of definition or summary that begins with the drama of human experience already having been gone through and then it arrives at a certain conclusion.
But most poetry, even when it’s called a lyric poem, is intrinsically dramatic. It wants us to live through the experience and have to fight our own way toward a conclusion. Most great poems are of that kind, because they not only deliver to us the final wisdom that we might appreciate and agree with, but they help us move toward that wisdom in a first-person experience.
Spencer : Were your reversion to religion and your increased interest in poetry related?
Wilson : They interwove. When I was younger, I had a clear sense that literature had this sacramental power. Literature can reveal the truth and change your life — and that’s what a sacrament does too.
I’m not sure how much faith I had in the actual sacraments. But I trusted the sacramental quality of art. It’s only a matter of time, if one continues to reflect on the nature of art, until one realizes that works of art are capable of the power they attain only because there’s more to the world than art or the stuff of time. Beauty has to be a real thing for works of art to do what they do. And for beauty to be a real thing, there has to be a God.
I remember being a callow sophomore thinking of nothing but Dante all day and not thinking that it had anything to do with the Catholic Church in which I grew up. But it wasn’t that long before I was reading the Purgatorio for the tenth time or so on a porch in Ann Arbor and I just got up and went to Mass. And then I just kept going.
Even when my faith was tepid, it always seemed to me that the only seriousness was the seriousness that the Church represents. The experiment that I made for a short time as a student — and one that many others have made — is to test whether there can be any meaningful life apart from one that’s given over to the love of God and the thought of God. I don’t think anyone can really convince themselves that that’s the case.
My whole understanding of the poetic tradition is one that could, with pretty limited changes, be mapped onto the history of the Church. I have written a fair amount on sin and lust and fallenness, and that’s all in the context of trying to see the inferno dimension of human experience alongside the purgatorial and the paradisal.
Art and poetry led me back into the Church. Yet it was while reading John Paul II’s Fides et Ratio when it was first published that I realized that even the aesthetic attraction to the Church that I had wasn’t adequate. I was too cavalierly bifurcating the world into the beautiful and the true. It took reading that encyclical to realize that truth and beauty are one."

2009 —On the heels of Justice David Souter’s announcement of his decision to retire, Harvard law professor Laurence H. Tribe writes a letter to his protégé, Barack Obama, offering his nuggets of wisdom on how President Obama should seize the “opportunity to lay the groundwork for a series of appointments that will gradually move the Court in a pragmatically progressive direction.” Among the nuggets: Don’t nominate Sonia Sotomayor:
“Bluntly put, she’s not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is, and her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the Court on issues like those involved in the voting rights case argued last week and the Title VII case of the New Haven firefighters argued earlier, issues on which Kennedy will probably vote with Roberts despite Souter’s influence but on which I don’t regard Kennedy as a lost cause for the decade or so that he is likely to remain on the Court.”
Instead, Tribe recommends that Obama nominate Elena Kagan. As Tribe explains it, the techniques that Kagan deployed as Harvard law school dean “for gently but firmly persuading a bunch of prima donnas to see things her way in case after case” would give her much more of “a purchase on Tony Kennedy’s mind” than Justice Breyer or Justice Ginsburg have.

Trump & Anti-Semitism: Democrats Play the Projection Game | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Deroy Murdock,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/democrats-anti-semitism-accusations-trump-projection/,"May 4, 2019 4:21 PM President Trump prepares to leave a note at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, May 22, 2017. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Left-wing smears overlook his numerous pro-Israel, pro-Jewish words and actions.
P sychological projection has become a key characteristic of the Left. If Democrats and their serfs in the liberal media complain about something, they most likely do it themselves, but pin it on an often blameless GOP. Consider their explanation of Hillary Clinton’s approval of the deal that handed the Kremlin 20 percent of America’s uranium supply, while investors in Uranium One Inc . donated $145 million to the Clinton Foundation . Yet the Left has screamed, “Russian collusion!” at Donald Trump for nearly three years. Advertisement Advertisement
Likewise, Democrats and the Left whitewash the anti-Semites in their midst and, instead, blame Trump — a decidedly pro-Jewish, pro-Israel president — whenever Jews are attacked or killed, as atrociously transpired on April 27, when a 19-year-old gunman opened fire on the Chabad of Poway Synagogue near San Diego. He killed Lori Gilbert Kaye, 60, and injured three others.
Predictably, the Left engaged their only gear and trampled Trump . “Why do these people feel they have license now to attack synagogues?” Senator Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) wondered on CNN. “This has really been fomented because of the rhetoric we’re hearing from the White House .” According to Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), Poway and similar onslaughts “are borne out of hate — hate which has received new fuel in these last two years .” “He’s provocative. He gives dog whistles constantly to these people,” said Joy Behar, co-host of ABC’s The View . “Take responsibility for your actions, Mr. President. You are the culprit!” “We have a president who not only will not acknowledge that we have an epidemic of white-nationalist terror,” Mehdi Hasan said on MSNBC’s The Intercept , “he’s providing the mood music for it.” “This president has emboldened neo-Nazis and white nationalists in this country,” said Waleed Shahid, communications director of Justice Democrats. MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough remarked, “White nationalists say he [Trump] has inspired them to take a far more public and aggressive stance in Trump’s America.” “I think the president needs to look in the mirror and understand that the rhetoric, the words he uses in all of this inflame a big part of what’s going on in America, give permission to the most craziest people in America,” said Matthew Dowd on ABC’s This Week .
These Trump haters might be believable if the killer had yelled “Make America Great Again!” as he fired into the synagogue. Yet in his rambling, profane open letter, he made clear his intense disdain for Trump and conservatism. Among other things, he called the president “Jew-loving” and “traitorous,” declaring further: “I am not a conservative.” The villain who murdered eleven and wounded seven in October at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue made clear his hatred for Trump, too.
The Left’s anti-Trump attacks occur despite his pro-Jewish and pro-Israeli statements and actions. These go at least as far back as 2004, when Trump was the grand marshal of New York’s Salute to Israel Parade . Most recently, on Thursday, the president hosted a National Day of Prayer ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. He said: “We will fight with all of our strength and everything that we have in our bodies to defeat anti-Semitism , to end the attacks on the Jewish people, and to conquer all forms of persecution, intolerance, and hate.” Advertisement
Trump welcomed Poway’s rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein. He said, “I’d like to thank our dear, honorable Mr. President for being, as they say in Yiddish, a ‘mensch par excellence.’ Mr. President, when you called me, I was at home weeping. You were the first person who began my healing. You heal people in their worst of times, and I’m so grateful for that.” The president also shared the podium with Army veteran Oscar Stewart and Border Patrol agent Jonathan Morales. Trump called them “heroes who raced after the murderer and helped disrupt the attack at the Poway Synagogue.” Advertisement
This dramatic development surely dominated the major networks’ evening-news broadcasts. No such luck. As the Media Research Center discovered, this moving story of a rabbi — with fingers freshly shot off by a deadly killer — being honored at the White House by a supposedly Jew-hating president generated exactly zero minutes and zero seconds of coverage on these flagship newscasts. Advertisement
None of the three big networks spared a moment to report on the president rallying the republic against anti-Semitism. However, the CBS Evening News dedicated 22 seconds to new Scrabble words. NBC Nightly News devoted 30 seconds to Scientology. And ABC’s World News Tonight invested a full two minutes in a married couple who are scaling, essentially, his and hers mountains on opposite sides of Earth.
As MRC vice president Brent H. Baker told me, “It’s almost as if the press corps were trying to suppress anyone learning about anything that contradicts their view of Trump as a racist promoter of white nationalism and anti-Semitism — which would, of course, confirm Trump’s disdain for the media.” Advertisement Advertisement
Last Saturday at 8:25 p.m. , six hours after bullets flew at Poway, President Trump told supporters in Green Bay, Wis.: “Our entire nation mourns the loss of life, prays for the wounded, and stands in solidarity with the Jewish community. We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate, which must be defeated.” Advertisement
CNN’s Don Lemon, naturally, questioned Trump’s sincerity. “One has to wonder as a thinking, rational person, if he means those words and if they ring hollow to Americans who have been looking for him to say those things,” Lemon said Saturday. At 8:32 p.m ,. just seven minutes after Trump called to vanquish anti-Semitism, Lemon squeezed Trump for “trafficking in bigotry, in racism, in anti-Semitism , in hate, and making excuses for us.”
If Trump’s words were insincere, then he is among the finest actors of his generation. Perhaps he fooled even Poway’s spiritual leader.
“I received a personal phone call from our president, Donald Trump,” said Rabbi Goldstein. “It’s the first time I’ve ever spoken to a president of the United States of America. He shared with me condolences on behalf of the United States of America. . . . And he spoke about his love of peace and Judaism and Israel . And he was just so comforting that I’m really grateful to our president for taking the time and making that effort to share with us his comfort and consolation .
“He was so gracious and generous with his words. Exceedingly comforting to me, my community. He spoke to me like a friend, like a buddy.” Advertisement
President Trump expressed himself similarly before Poway.
“We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism , or those who spread its venomous creed,” he declared in his State of the Union address on February 5. “With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.” Trump also introduced his guests in the House gallery: Dachau survivor Joshua Kaufman and Herman Zeitchik, a World War II veteran who liberated that Nazi concentration camp.
For Trump, this is personal.
When his daughter Ivanka converted to Orthodox Judaism in 2009 to prepare for her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump did not erase her from his will or banish her from Trump Tower. Instead, his daughter and son-in-law are among his closest advisers; he never leaves home without them. The president, Ivanka, Jared, and the first grandchildren have celebrated Hanukkah together in the White House.
Trump is the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall, Judaism’s most hallowed site, in Jerusalem — Israel’s capital, to which he relocated America’s embassy from Tel Aviv. Trump signed the Taylor Force Act to defund Palestinian terrorists. In March, he recognized the previously Syrian Golan Heights as Israeli. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the Oval Office on March 25, “We have never had a greater friend than President Trump.” Advertisement
If evidence of Trump’s anti-Semitism exists, his enemies should present it now or forever hold their peace."
National Review Spring Webathon: Help NR Fight Socialism,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/spring-webathon-help-fight-socialism/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter May 5, 2019 5:00 AM Sen. Bernie Sanders at a news conference introducing the “Medicare for All Act of 2019,” April 10, 2019. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) This moment in time is why William F. Buckley Jr. created NR — and why we continue our work today.
W e live in incredibly consequential times. Everything is up for grabs.
The late, great Charles Krauthammer used to say that American politics was fought between the 40-yard lines, meaning the band of differences between the two parties was relatively narrow. Now it is being fought on the entire playing field, between outright, self-declared socialists and defenders of the traditional American order. Advertisement Advertisement
The fight over what political and economic system we will live under is now well and truly joined, and at NR we are thoroughly committed to winning it. Which brings me to our 2019 Spring Webathon .
At National Review , we live for the battle of ideas. A profound understanding of how and why the American project is special is written into our DNA. Our writers and editors care deeply about this debate, not just professionally but personally. This moment in time is literally why William F. Buckley Jr. created NR.
He would surely be dismayed, though, that the fight against socialism is now as urgent and necessary as it’s been at any time since the magazine’s early years. Advertisement
We have spent years, nay decades, warning America where Democrats want to take us, always to their fervent yet unconvincing denials. But now they are openly embracing our longstanding indictment of them. It is the Democratic party’s Perry Mason moment, when it suddenly breaks down on the witness stand and admits, “Guilty as charged.” Advertisement
We’ve always said that Democrats want to impose socialized medicine, and here come Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris with their “Medicare for All” plan that, as Harris helpfully explained on national TV, entails eliminating private insurance.
We’ve always said that left-wing environmentalism is a cloak for an agenda of government coercion, and here comes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the “it girl” of millennial socialism, to propose eliminating the fossil-fuel industry by government fiat, as well as far-reaching changes in our buildings, transportation, industry, and farming (it’d be better if we all grew our produce in our backyards, and, yes, if cows didn’t pass gas).
We’ve always said that, at bottom, Democrats want open borders, and here comes Beto O’Rourke, the “it boy” of unsuccessful Texas Senate candidates, saying he wants to tear down the border wall around El Paso, Texas, because, of course, walls are immoral. Advertisement Advertisement
We’ve always said that Democrats are pro-abortion and favor any abortion in any circumstance, and here come Ralph Northam and legislators in Virginia, New York, and Vermont to remove any doubt that the Democrats are the party of infanticide.
We’ve pushed back against all of this, and more, as strenuously and often as we can.
I’m not sure any publication has written as frequently and as cogently against the left-wing vision of health care, and in favor of free-market reform, as we have. We have inveighed against and picked apart the Green New Deal at every opportunity, and recently featured AOC on the cover, alarmed by her least favorite bovine activity.
We have consistently advocated not just for tougher border security, but for reforms to our legal immigration system to make it more truly accord with our national interest, and for a renewed culture of assimilation. It is a major cause of ours to protect the constitutional order from the left-wing assault against it as allegedly antiquated, unworkable, and unfair.
Finally, we will never let anyone forget the horrors of Communism.
Our next two issues are a twin special issue entirely devoted to the fight against socialism, the first ( just out ) making the case for markets, the second reminding people of the economic, political, and spiritual failures of socialism. It is our honor and pleasure — and duty — to do all this, and more.
I’m asking you to pitch in and support this work, which is shaping up as a defining, generational struggle. Advertisement
As you’ve heard me say before if you’ve ever read one of these pitches, journals of political opinion don’t make money. They never have and they never will. They are too controversial and too small. Enterprises such as ours depend on the generosity of our readers to survive.
We don’t do the lowest-common-denominator clickbait stories necessary to driving mass traffic online. We aren’t The Atlantic , a center-left publication that influential New York advertising shops feel an ideological kinship with. We are an unabashedly conservative publication that never has trimmed its sails (and never will) on abortion or guns or marriage or immigration, or any of the other issues that the liberal elite considers out of bounds and disrespectable.
People have the misperception that Bill Buckley was our sugar daddy when he owned the magazine, but he never was. Instead, he made these sort of pitches to our readers (although on paper, via snail mail). Advertisement
And year after year they responded. Advertisement
I’m hoping you will, too.
The fact is that if National Review didn’t exist, no one would invent it today. Not when everything is geared to instant gratification on Twitter and other social-media platforms, not when the old-fashioned art of persuasion — based on facts and reasoning — is increasingly out of style. There is no replacing the wit, erudition, passion, and intelligence our writers bring to contemporary controversies in every issue of the print magazine and every hour online.
In the fight against socialism, we need every piece of artillery available to us on the battlefield, and NR is an indispensable howitzer — read by young people just figuring out what they believe, relied on by conservative radio and TV hosts, and impossible for the other side to dismiss.
Please consider making a generous donation today of $50 , $75 , $100 , or $250 . And, if your means allow, perhaps a gift of $500 or even $1,000 .
Your donation will make it possible for us to continue our work, and continue to grow. Over the last few years we’ve made the transition from primarily a print publication to primarily a digital one. But the essential mission is the same. Advertisement
It doesn’t matter if the socialist leaders are named Norman Thomas and Beatrice Webb, or Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . . . if they get their message out via pamphlets, or Instagram posts from their kitchens . . . if they favor socialized medicine, or socialized medicine (some things never change) . . . we will point out the impracticality and immorality of their plans, never let them forget the woeful record of failure of their model, and insist on markets and the rule of law as the greatest inventions of the last 400 years and the keys to human flourishing."
Qatar Airways Cheats — Trump Should Enforce Open Skies Act | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Fund,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/trump-should-enforce-open-skies-act/,"May 5, 2019 8:14 PM A Qatar Airways Airbus A350-900 takes off in Colomiers, France, in 2017. (Regis Duvignau/Reuters) Qatar is circumventing a trade agreement intended to ensure fair competition in international air travel.
P resident Trump is in the middle of a growing number of trade disputes. On Sunday, he promised to dramatically raise tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods if a trade deal isn’t completed by this Friday.
But while the Trump trade threats over tariffs steal the headlines, the Trump administration will soon have to make a series of decisions about non-tariff barriers to trade. Those include quotas in the new Trump agreement with Canada and Mexico that will supersede NAFTA and a nasty dispute over agreements the U.S. has negotiated to ensure fair competition in international airline flights. In these non-tariff trade cases, the chief debate isn’t over how to convince trading partners to level the playing field but how to enforce existing agreements. As Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, notes, “unless trade agreements are enforced, it does not matter what philosophy drives their negotiation.” Advertisement Advertisement
International airline travel has exploded in recent years, making enforcement of the dozens of agreements under the Open Skies Act ever more important. Open Skies regulates which airlines get to enter another country’s territory. The goal is open entry, unless a government-subsidized carrier is using its artificial advantage to unfairly compete with private carriers.
Such is the case with Qatar Airways, which is owned by the fossil-fuel-rich government of Qatar and has spent billions to become a major player in international aviation. Qatar Airways is now so big that the U.S. and Qatar signed an agreement in January 2018 to limit Qatar’s ability to fly directly into the U.S. from European cities. These so-called fifth-freedom flights are carefully negotiated to avoid unfair competition. Advertisement
But Qatar soon made it clear that it was reinterpreting the agreement in such a way as to make it meaningless. It bought a 49 percent stake in a failing carrier called Air Italy, which previously had flown only regionally in Europe along with a couple of seasonal flights to the U.S. Two days after Qatar Airways bought a stake in it, Air Italy began an expansion that now has it making nonstop flights from Milan, Italy, to New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Its bargain rates are clearly designed to poach passengers from U.S. carriers, using its Qatar-government subsidies to make up any losses. Advertisement
Qatar Airways didn’t make much of an effort to hide the fact that Air Italy is basically a front for its Qatari owners. Air Italy’s extensive operating losses are covered by Qatar, its top executives are almost all former executives at Qatar Airways, and even Air Italy’s crew uniforms are almost identical to those worn by employees of Qatar Airways. Advertisement
A range of U.S. officials, from Democratic senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey to Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have called foul on this subterfuge and complained to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. At a recent Senate hearing, Pompeo responded to such concerns by reiterating his support for the Open Skies Act: “The U.S. government sees what’s going on, and we’re working to put this agreement — we think it was a good agreement, and we’re trying to ensure it’s enforced.”"

There is a great deal of chatter among the big-brained about granting “rights” to artificial intelligent machines. Understanding this, two biology professors have proposed a new definition of “life” that would exclude machines–making it more difficult to effectively argue that these inanimate objects should be included in the moral community.
First, they define the threat. From, “ How to Define Life , ” published in The Scientist :
Case Western Reserve University researchers are moving toward creating robots with superior emotional intelligence. They’re advancing artificial intelligence (AI) to create next-gen personalized robots that can read human emotions in real time. What will be the next step in AI robots? If they can be developed to mimic biological life, do we confer the status of living creatures on them? Do we confer personhood as well?
I like the use of the word “ mimic, ” because that is what would be happening.
I have long believed that “ being alive ” is the fundamental predicate to possessing even rudimentary intrinsic moral value. Thus, sophisticated AI computers would certainly be valuable — as in worth a lot of money or having great utility — but as a machine, it would have no more moral value than a broken toaster."

The Left “should be compiling lists of cases to be overruled at the first opportunity on the ground that they were wrong the day they were decided” and should “aggressively exploit the ambiguities and loopholes in unfavorable precedents that aren ’t worth overruling.” Advertisement Advertisement
Rather than try to “accommodate the losers” in the culture wars, the Left should take a “hard line” against its fellow citizens. “Trying to be nice to the losers didn’t work well after the Civil War.” And “taking a hard line seemed to work reasonably well in Germany and Japan after 1945.”

John Hickenlooper Makes His 2020 Case Poorly | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/john-hickenlooper-makes-his-case-poorly/,"About Kevin D. Williamson May 6, 2019 11:01 AM Former governor John Hickenlooper (D, Colo.) at a news conference in his office at the capitol in Denver, December 19, 2013. (Rick Wilking/Reuters)
“The curious task of economics,” as F. A. Hayek famous put it, “is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.”
John Hickenlooper, justifying his presidential campaign in the pages of the Wall Street Journal , is deep in the fatal conceit, writing: “To save capitalism, the government has to adjust it, as it has countless times in this nation’s history — from Teddy Roosevelt and the muckrakers to Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.”
Hickenlooper is an expensively educated man (the Haverford School, undergraduate and graduate degrees from Wesleyan) but he seems to lack curiosity. Apparently, he has not asked himself how those earlier government efforts to “adjust capitalism” worked out. Many economists believe that the policies of the Roosevelt administration worsened the Great Depression rather than mitigating its effects; Social Security may be one of the federal government’s most popular programs, but it also is a major driver of long-term debt. Hickenlooper rightly laments the low savings rates among non-wealthy Americans, but he is either unwilling or unable to consider the dual role programs such as Social Security may play in discouraging savings by diverting more than 15 percent of a worker’s wages into a government pension scheme and medical entitlements. And he might do himself a favor and have a look at the cost and deficit projections used to sell those programs and see how that worked out.
He goes on to write that in order to help workers to earn more, government must
make obtaining necessary skills affordable. For too many Americans, getting the training they need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps is cost-prohibitive. More than 65% of Americans over 25 don’t have four-year degrees, and a high-school diploma is no longer enough. As president, I would make community college free for those who can’t afford it and expand apprenticeships and skills training programs dramatically.
Again, the incuriosity. Why is a high-school degree no longer sufficient — not only as work-force preparation but also, in many cases, as college preparation? We spend much, much more on education today (in real dollars per student) than we did in the past, but our results are in many ways inferior. Has Hickenlooper considered that the centralizing, state-dominated approach to K-12 education may have some unintended consequences — as may applying something more like that model to community colleges and other institutions of higher education? Wouldn’t it make more sense to reform K-12 rather than focus on college, which, as he notes, excludes two thirds of the rising work force? Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Which government agency does he actually trust to choose which skills need to be developed and which apprenticeship programs are likely to prove effective? The Labor Department? The Department of Education? What, if anything, does the broad failure of government attempts at the same thing in the past — he is, after all, repeating a promise that has been made for decades — tell us about the likely failure or success of such programs in the future?

We wanted to advertise our 40th Anniversary Gala on May 11, at which we’re honoring Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to readers of our own online publication, The American Mind. But Google refuses to allow us to do so. . . .
Google, either its algorithm or some individual, had a look at my essay launching our new campaign for a unifying Americanism, “ Defend America—Defeat Multiculturalism. ” They decided it to be in violation of their policy on “race and ethnicity in personalized advertising” and shut down our advertising efforts to American Mind readers. We weren’t “advertising” anything in the essay, of course, but the relevant section of their policy lists “racially or ethnically oriented publications, racially or ethnically oriented universities, racial or ethnic dating” as examples of violations.
Somebody must have determined we were offering “racially or ethnically oriented publications.” This is news to us. The Claremont Institute has spent forty years teaching all who are willing to listen that the meaning of the proposition that all human beings are created equal is the central, animating principle of American political life.
One of my colleagues spent two hours on the phone with Google to determine whether we could appeal this ruling or determine which section of the essay was in violation. The response, in short? There is no appeal; we recommend you remove the content to bring yourself into compliance.
This appalling decision must not stand. Claremont is rightly highlighting the contradiction between the constitutional principle of individual rights and the premises of identity politics. It is this contradiction, not gerrymandering or talking heads on cable television, that lies at the root of America’s growing polarization. Advertisement Advertisement
Whether you agree or disagree with the thrust of Claremont’s view, if Google can censor it, then conservatism itself is banned in this country. To prevent conservatives from defending constitutional principles as they understand them is to ban America itself. Advertisement
Ah, but you say, this is just about an ad, it’s not a total defenestration. Don’t be silly. If the Claremont Institute can be censored, we are rapidly tumbling to the bottom of the slippery slope. Google’s action is intolerable and must be reversed."
Donald Trump Strengthens Medical Conscience San Francisco Sues | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J. Smith,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/donald-trump-strengthens-medical-conscience-san-francisco-sues/,"May 6, 2019 11:43 AM President Donald Trump in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., April 18, 2019 (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)
The Left once honored conscientious objection, such as the civil-rights movement’s campaign of peaceful civil disobedience (who didn’t?) and men refusing to be drafted during Vietnam. But when conscientious objectors refuse to obey policies with which the Left agrees , the screaming, howling, and name calling could shatter eardrums.
Case in point: The Trump administration has finalized a rule that will expand HHS enforcement of exiting — not new — statutory conscience protections for doctors, nurses, and other professionals who do not wish to participate in legal medical services — such as assisted suicide, abortion, or transgender medical interventions. Generally stated, the rule prevents employers that receive federal funds (like hospitals) from punishing medical professionals who so refuse.
Prior to the new rule, HHS only focused on enforcing conscience protections contained in three federal laws — and the Obama administration was credibly charged with barely enforcing those. Under the new rule, all federal laws granting medical conscience rights will be vigorously enforced. From the HHS fact sheet :
The 2011 rule provided inadequate enforcement of conscience rights by only providing for handling complaints based on three federal conscience protection laws. This final rule implements approximately 25 federal conscience protection provisions, and provides significant tools and mechanisms appropriate for enforcing the conscience protections passed by Congress. These tools are needed in light of the substantial growth in conscience complaints received by the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR).
I suspect this growth came about because medicine increasingly is being put in harness to further ideologically progressive social change, and due to the recent shift from an administration distinctly unfriendly to medical conscience to one that believes in robust enforcement.
The Left — becoming increasingly authoritarian by the day — loathes the message sent when a medical professional says, “ No. This is morally wrong. I refuse to participate. ” So, of course , San Francisco has sued to thwart the new rule. From the FNN story : San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued the Trump administration on Thursday, accusing it of effectively sacrificing patients’ health and lives by expanding “conscience” protections for patients and health care professionals who opposed controversial treatments. “At its core, this rule is about denying people medical care,” Herrera said, according to a press release from Thursday . “This administration is willing to sacrifice patients’ health and lives — particularly those of women, members of the LGBTQ community and low-income families — to score right-wing political points. It’s reprehensible.”
No. Trump is complying with his oath of office by faithfully executing the law. Herrera is the one making (left-wing) political points. Stay Updated with NR Daily

San Francisco is in the notorious Ninth Circuit — where district judges are fond of issuing nationwide restraining orders preventing this administration from pursuing policies with which the Left disagrees, so in the short term, Herrera may be able to block implementation. But I don’t see the Supreme Court preventing the executive from faithfully executing and enforcing duly enacted statutes. Advertisement"

During a debate in the Alabama House of Representatives over a proposed abortion ban last week, Democratic representative John Rogers of Birmingham made an appallingly honest pro-abortion comment.
“It ought to be a woman’s choice,” Rogers said . “I’m not about to be a man and tell a woman what to do with her body. She has a right to make her decisions herself. Some kids are unwanted. So you kill them now or you kill them later. You bring them into the world unwanted, unloved, then send them to the electric chair.” Advertisement Advertisement
After Donald Trump Jr. criticized him for this remark, Rogers doubled down, suggesting in a subsequent interview that Trump Jr. had proven his point because he was “retarded or crazy” and ought to have been aborted.
On Thursday evening, Democratic Alabama senator Doug Jones condemned Rogers in a tweet: The rhetoric of Rep. John Rogers gets more appalling each time he speaks. He does not speak for the people of Alabama and is in fact offending all Alabamians with his crude and reprehensible comments. https://t.co/ZLI8e83Z2d

Now, Rogers asserts that Jones called him privately to say he agreed with the Democratic representative’s reprehensible comments. In an interview on local Alabama radio “Matt & Aunie Show” this morning, Rogers noted that Jones was his friend and had been his attorney in the past. Advertisement
“He called me twice. He told me, ‘John, I know you’re right but I [have] to come out against you,’” Rogers said in the interview. “I said, ‘Okay, fine, if it’s going to help your campaign, do that.’ That’s the kind of guy I am.” Advertisement
In a statement provided to National Review via email on Monday evening, Senator Jones denied Rogers’s claim. “Look, we are just going to have to agree to disagree on this,” Jones said. “I made my position clear. I thought his remarks were appalling and I told him that I strongly disagreed with him. There is already too much division in our politics and I won’t add to it here.

(Leah Millis/REUTERS)
President Trump on Monday pardoned a former Army lieutenant who served five years in federal prison after being convicted of killing an Iraqi prisoner during an interrogation.
First Lt. Michael Behenna shot Ali Mansur, an Iraqi man believed to be connected to Al Qaeda, while interrogating him about an attack that left two American soldiers dead in 2008.
Behenna claimed that he shot Mansur in the chest and head in self-defense after the suspected terrorist threw a piece of concrete at him and reached for his gun. A military court nevertheless found him guilty of “unpremeditated murder in a combat zone” in 2009 and sentenced him to 25 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2014.
The White House cited the support Behenna has received from elected officials in Oklahoma and his record as a prisoner in justifying the pardon. Behenna “has attracted broad support from the military, Oklahoma elected officials, and the public,” the White House statement read. “Further, while serving his sentence Mr. Behenna was a model prisoner. In light of these facts, Mr. Behenna is entirely deserving of this Grant of Executive Clemency,” the statement continued. Stay Updated with NR Daily

The pardon comes after the Oklahoma attorney general sent three letters asking for leniency on Behenna’s behalf.

As we end our first week of the 2019 Spring Webathon , approaching $30,000 in kindly contributions from a few hundred kindly conservatives, let me stress how vital reader support has always been for National Review , and how in this particular call to arms we urge such in order to help us intensify our combating of socialism.
It’s very much alive on Capitol Hill, and in the plans of a slew of Democratic presidential candidates. Do read Jim Geraghty’s important article “ Five Bills to Move America Closer to the Socialist Ideal ,” which touches on just how pervasive the ideology’s reemergence is — which in turn compels us to attack, and attack again. And again. Done only with your assistance. Here’s the beginning of Jim’s piece:
Right now, Democrats are debating whether they are outright, outspoken socialists, like Bernie Sanders; capitalists trying to save capitalism, as John Hickenlooper describes himself ; or some sort of quasi-socialist midpoint between those identities. But self-identification almost always involves a bit of self-deceit and a healthy dose of self-flattery. To assess the leading Democrats’ true agenda, look beyond their rhetoric and instead consider the legislation they introduce, and how they want to change America’s laws. The portrait is clear: Well beyond the high-profile bills such as the New Green Deal and Medicare for All are less-noticed proposals for price controls and revoked patents, vastly expanded government benefits programs, much higher taxes, bans on the closure of federal-agency field offices, and a general appetite to expand the size of government at all levels.
Do read the whole thing. And do find some inspiration from these good folks who yesterday plunked down some support for NR, and explained why in the process:
• Scott sends NR 100 selfless dollars, and a reminder of what we are up against: “Socialism is a scourge upon mankind. I’ll take personal property, personal responsibility, and freedom from government control over any ‘ism’ invented by the left.”
• David also tosses a C Note into the collection plate, and says nice things about us: “NR deserves every buck one can spare to support it. Principle has always been its guide.” Advertisement Advertisement
• Anonymous sends $50 and this: “Keep America Strong. Never give up, and never surrender! My family is counting on you.” We’re up to it, and if you and the kids need a place to stay, NR has a nice guest room! Advertisement
• Michael chimes in with $100, and the prayers help too: “May God bless your efforts to get conservative ideas out in the public square. Let our efforts bear fruit, and may we not become complacent!”"

Georgia Heartbeat Bill: Governor Brian Kemp Signs Abortion Ban | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/georgia-governor-signs-pro-life-heartbeat-bill/,"May 7, 2019 11:23 AM Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (Chris Aluka Berry/Reuters)
This morning, Georgia governor Brian Kemp signed into law a “heartbeat bill,” which prohibits abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually about six weeks into pregnancy. The state legislature passed the bill in late March and it has been awaiting Kemp’s signature, though he assured Republicans and pro-life activists in his state that he intended to approve the measure. Advertisement Advertisement
The legislation is the latest in a series of state efforts to regulate abortion earlier in pregnancy. Already this year, legislatures in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Ohio have passed heartbeat bills that were subsequently signed by Republican governors. A few months ago, Iowa’s heartbeat bill was struck down by a state judge, who found that it violated the Iowa state constitution.
After Georgia’s legislature passed the bill, the ACLU announced its intention to sue the state government should Kemp sign the bill, and a number of celebrities, including actress and progressive activist Alyssa Milano, have threatened to boycott the state over the legislation.
Though it is unlikely that courts will uphold this type of legislation in the near future, without action on the part of the Supreme Court to loosen the pro-abortion regime created by Roe v. Wade, Planned Parenthood v. Casey , and Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt , heartbeat bills are still a valuable tool in a broader pro-life legislative strategy. Advertisement
Abortion-rights supporters consistently describe abortion procedures in euphemistic terms, dismissing embryos or fetuses in the womb as a “clump of cells” or “just part of its mother.” One pro-life activist reports that at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in April on the federal 20-week abortion ban, a pro-abortion state senator from Georgia, Jen Jordan, lamented the bill pending in her state as containing protections for children possessing “what some call a heartbeat.” Advertisement "
Met Gala Recap: Fleeting Celebrity & Lasting Art | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Marlo Safi,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-met-gala-ars-longa-vita-brevis/,"About Marlo Safi May 7, 2019 11:49 AM Gigi Hadid at the Metropolitan Musem of Art Costume Institute Gala in New York City, May 6, 2019. (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters) Last night, the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted the most exclusive event of the year: the Met Gala. Its purpose — fundraising for the Met’s fashion exhibit — was overshadowed by the ostentation and paparazzi, with the attendees vying for the celebrity superlative awards of “Costume That Likely Required a Civil and Mechanical Engineer to Create” and “Most Likely to Anger God Enough to Provoke Old Testament Locust Plagues.” Perhaps God granted us a reprieve last year during the “Heavenly Bodies” theme, when Rihanna came dressed as Pope, but this year’s theme — “Camp”– was similarly decadent. While I’m on the topic of Ancient Egypt, Billy Porter was carried in by several men dressed in gold (shirtless), and he seemed to have been drawing inspiration from Isis, the golden-winged Egyptian goddess. Katy Perry was a functional chandelier (I’m interested in the collaboration between the stylist and electrician). Hamish Bowles invoked Louis XIV’s aristocratic excess down to the heels. (In the 1670s, Louis XIV declared that only members of his court could wear his signature red heels — Bowles wore purple.) The Met on a regular day attracts plenty of visitors, ordinary people who arrive at the ticket desk and pay a donation of their choosing. Tickets to the Met Gala cost $35,000, but only if you’re selected as a guest by Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who has final say over every invitation and attendee. The rest of us are welcome to pay much less to gain entry into a museum that carries art from every region of the world, a maze that could take an entire day to navigate but that hides artifacts from Mesopotamia and classical Roman sculpture in its corners. But the Met Gala is theatrical fanfare attended by the famous for the purpose of being gawked at and idolized for a night among others who also know their way around flashing cameras and red carpets. And it’s an honor to be invited — it’s arguably the most important event the Met will host of the year, attracting the most important people and the most publicity. When the parade of photogenic celebrities get their money’s worth of press attention, they’ll leave until next year, when they’ll be invited again (hopefully — sometimes former invitees get benched). Celebrity, however, is fleeting. Gala attendees face the perennial challenge of getting attention. The event has already reached a florid, pretentious plateau with diminishing returns, and no costume, no matter how convoluted the bells and whistles are, can surprise us. The names on the invitee list will change, and so will the efforts made by those who made the cut and who want to personalize their iteration of the “ next big thing ” by defying physics and convention, and in Katy Perry’s case, possibly NYFD fire-safety rules. Today, and for as long as humanity values its artistic contributions, the Met’s halls of sculptures, paintings, and artifacts will be open to the public, who come to see the permanent, timeless things that outlive us all.

Orca Rights & Human Exceptionalism | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J.

(Mike Blake/Reuters)
As the “I t will never happen here ” complacency continues, the “ nature rights ” agenda grows increasingly mainstream. A few years ago, granting “ rights ” to nature was rarely mentioned outside of the most radical outlets. Today, advocacy has become ubiquitous within the environmental movement, the academy, and bioethics, and has even been given the imprimatur of prestigious science journals .
Latest example: Orca rights! Apparently orcas are threatened in an area of Canadian waters. The government has suggested voluntary sanctuaries — perhaps too timid in its scope, I don’t know. But law professor Linda Nowlan urges instead that orcas be granted “ rights ” that the whales could legally enforce. From The Conversation column :
One way to extend rights to nature is to provide it with the rights of legal personhood. The key feature of legal personhood is the ability to hold rights and to enforce those rights through the courts.
People have the right to life, liberty and security of the person, as guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Whales do not.
Yet laws have increasingly extended legal personhood rights to non-human entities. Corporations are the most prominent example.
I’ll write this slowly. Corporations have rights because they are human enterprises. One can disagree with the concept — I have significant doubts about this approach — but it does not undermine human exceptionalism one whit to grant human juridical entities rights that its human managers and owners exercise.
Moreover, rights don’t arise in a vacuum, but are associated with assuming responsibilities. Unlike animals, rivers , or Lake Erie, corporations and partnerships can be held to account when their managers or owners break the law or otherwise fail in their duties. Again, this is because these juridical persons are human enterprises managed by humans . Orcas, rivers, mosquitoes, bacteria — all aspects of nature — cannot, by definition, assume legal duties and ethical responsibilities because animals are not moral beings and geological features are not sentient. It’s not that hard! Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The point of the orca-rights project is to give the killer whales the right to sue to enjoin the fishing industry from catching the whales’ prey, and also, to sue over global warming:
The southern resident killer whales are threatened by depleted prey populations (mainly Chinook salmon), physical disturbances that interfere with echolocation, pollution and climate change, as well as the projected increased tanker traffic from the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The federal government will announce on June 18 whether it will re-approve the expansion project, despite findings of a “significant adverse environmental effects” on the whales.
Thus, if orcas have rights, salmon fishers could be bankrupted. Important energy projects would almost surely be impeded or driven out of business by repeated litigation or the impossibility of obtaining liability insurance. The opportunities for anti-human mischief would only be limited by the most radical environmentalist’s imagination.
Orcas rights would be enforced by a commission that would put the supposed needs of killer whales above those of people:
The law would enshrine the legal rights of personhood for these whales. It would appoint a guardian or governance board empowered to act on behalf of the whales and enforce their rights. It could, for example, ask for habitat maintenance and restoration, and could claim and receive compensation for past injuries.
Do you see how the fix would be in? Could humans sue the whales for any injury they might cause? Don’t be ridiculous, Wesley!
Moreover, orcas don’t use currency or write checks. The scheme would permit the orca commission to engage in law fare against industries and extort huge financial settlements to finance the next round of litigation. Advertisement"
Abortion & CNN Segment: Christine Quinn Says Unborn Babies Aren’t Human Beings | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/cnn-contributor-when-a-woman-is-pregnant-that-is-not-a-human-being-inside-of-her/,"May 7, 2019 3:07 PM (Carlos Barria/Reuters)
In a segment yesterday evening on Chris Cuomo’s primetime show, a CNN contributor and former New York City Democratic politician made a particularly unscientific assertion in defense of abortion rights. During a discussion about state-level “heartbeat bills,” which prohibit abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, Christine Quinn claimed, “When a woman is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her.” Advertisement Advertisement
Quinn, who served as the speaker of the New York City Council until 2013, is also a board member for the National Institute for Reproductive Health, a pro-abortion action fund. Her comment last night was, of course, factually and scientifically inaccurate by entirely objective standards.
Basic biology tells us that every pregnant woman is pregnant not with a horse or an acorn or a tumor but with another human being. Inside each pregnant woman is a human being that meets all the scientific criteria to be considered alive. Each embryo or fetus has human DNA, entirely distinct from that of both its mother and its father and, indeed, from every other human being that has ever existed or will ever exist for all of human history. Each of those developing human beings is inside its mother, yes, but not part of its mother. From the moment of conception, that unborn human being has all of the cells that will develop into fully functioning organs, into its own unique fingerprints, into its own heartbeat and neural tissue.
Birth does not magically confer humanity on that being. It was a human being from the start. Advertisement
Progressives often accuse conservatives and pro-lifers of ignoring biological facts, of being “science deniers.” Abortion-rights advocates like Quinn are the real science deniers. She openly contradicts simple, scientific, biological facts for the sake of furthering her defense of the right to kill unborn human beings in the womb. Advertisement"

If you want, you can go to the AFA website and join more than 35,000 of your fellow citizens who’ve signed a petition condemning my “character assassination” and deploring my “ yellow journalism. ” My sin was writing a piece last month critiquing Franklin Graham for his selective moral outrage. In 1998, Graham wrote an essay in the Wall Street Journal arguing that even Bill Clinton’s private sins can have serious, public consequences. He rightfully asked the key question: “If [Clinton] will lie to or mislead his wife and daughter, those with whom he is most intimate, what will prevent him from doing the same to the American public?”
But in 2018 he reversed course. When the philandering Democrat Bill Clinton was out of office, and the philandering Republican Donald Trump occupied the White House, Graham told the Associated Press that the Republican pursuit of Clinton was a “ great mistake that should never have happened. ” He resurrected the old Clinton defense — that adultery is an entirely private matter. Graham said, “T his thing with Stormy Daniels and so forth is nobody’s business. ”
Then, this year, he changed course yet again, this time publicly tweeting his opposition to Pete Buttigieg’s gay marriage. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Here was my central point — the “ yellow journalism ” that the AFA condemns:
The proper Evangelical position toward any president is not hard to articulate, though it is exceedingly difficult to hold to, especially in polarized times when one party seems set on limiting religious liberty and zealously defending abortion: We should pray for presidents, critique them when they’re wrong, praise them when they’re right, and never, ever impose partisan double standards. We can’t ever forget the importance of character, the necessity of our own integrity, and the power of the prophetic witness.
And:
In other words, Evangelicals can never take a purely transactional approach to politics. We are never divorced from our transcendent purpose, which always trumps political expediency. In scripture, prophets confronted leaders about their sin. They understood a core truth, one clearly articulated in the Southern Baptist Convention’s 1998 Resolution on Moral Character of Public Officials : “Tolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God’s judgment.”
The AFA, of course, can’t quite defend the president’s conduct, but it sure can minimize it. “ Certainly, no one would agree that President Trump’s past is a perfect model of morality, ” says the AFA. Not ‘perfect’ is one way to characterize marrying one woman, having an affair, marrying his mistress, marrying a third woman, and then having an affair with a porn star while that third woman is pregnant with his child. But so what? The AFA says that since taking the oath of office, Trump has come “ nowhere near ” the “ glaring moral indecencies of Clinton. ”
Well, even by the AFA’s made-up standard, their argument fails. While president, Trump has lied to the public about his porn-star affair and there is strong evidence that he paid hush money as part of Michael Cohen’s criminal scheme to conceal the affair during a crucial phase of the presidential campaign. I think that’s a pretty glaring moral (and potentially criminal) indecency, but your mileage may vary. And those lies and deceptions are but a few of the torrent of untruths that have poured from the president’s mouth throughout his first term. It turns out that the answer to Graham’s 1998 question is clear — if a man will “ lie to or mislead his wife and daughter ” there is nothing that will stop him from “ doing the same to the American public. ” Advertisement"

Did the Buttigieg hype hit its peak already?
Yes, Pete Buttigieg and his husband are on the cover of Time this week. But since Joe Biden’s formal entry into the race, the South Bend mayor’s standing in the polls has been pretty tepid — 8 percent in The Hill/HarrisX , 6 percent in the Morning Consult survey , and just 2 percent in the Harvard Harris poll . Advertisement Advertisement
Back in April, Quinnipiac had Buttigieg at 10 percent, CNN had him at 7 percent, and Emerson had him at 9 percent. That’s not a huge drop, but it suggests Buttigeig’s surprising early momentum has slowed. Also . . . he didn’t have that far to drop!
One also has to wonder how well the mayor of a small heavily Democratic city will persevere in the rough-and-tumble of a hard-fought campaign. The one time Buttigieg ran statewide, he was demolished by Richard Mourdock — admittedly, in a pretty Republican state and in a good year for the GOP. The parody interview of Buttgieg posted in McSweeney’s probably offers a good sense of how the other campaigns see him: “I am evasive in seven different languages . . . If I may, I’d like to speak to that very specific issue with a few glittering generalities: Freedom. Democracy. Bridges.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

Like me, Renkl writes from Tennessee (she’s in Nashville; I’m in Franklin), and she uses a recent Tennessee incident where a Dickson County baker refused to design and bake a cake for a gay wedding as a launching pad for an attack on America’s most fundamental First Amendment freedoms. Unfortunately, she makes two important legal errors. Advertisement Advertisement
First, she gets the primacy of American law exactly backwards. She formulates religious liberty like this: “ In this country, citing religious or spiritual convictions is often a surefire way to get out of doing something you’re required by law to do. ” This is a common framing on the left. Essentially, it’s an argument that religious freedom is an intrusion into the law and that religious people are engaged in a form of special pleading — seeking rights and exemptions unavailable to other Americans.
In reality, the First Amendment is supreme, and when states seek to intrude on religious liberty, they’re trying to get out of something they’re required by law to do. Respecting the First Amendment is the default obligation of the federal government and every state and local government in the United States. When people of faith appeal to the First Amendment, they’re appealing to America’s highest law, and while Employment Division v. Smith weakened the Free Exercise Clause, multiple subsequent cases have restored at least some of its vitality, and most religious freedom claims are also grounded in the very robust free speech clause of the First Amendment."
Joe Biden 2020: The Ironic Implications | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/the-ironic-implications-of-biden-2020/,"May 8, 2019 10:03 AM Joe Biden delivers remarks at the First State Democratic Dinner in Dover, Del., March 16, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: The hilariously ironic implications if Joe Biden’s current polling boost continues and he goes on to win the Democratic nomination; Kamala Harris and the question of what kind of Democrat can win in the Midwest; some news that will probably influence your choice for lunch; and an appeal for a little bit of help. What If It’s Just Joe Biden All the Way Through the Primaries? Late yesterday afternoon I raised the possibility that the hype surrounding Pete Buttigieg is peaking. He’s back to modest single digits in most national polls after a quick rise and very few African-Americans are attending his events, even in places such as Orangeburg, S.C. Young, well-educated, ambitious, and articulate, Buttigieg may well be a boutique candidate who mostly appeals to one important but not quite decisive demographic: the kinds of people who end up covering the Democratic presidential primary for major news organizations. Since formally announcing his presidential run, Joe Biden has enjoyed leads in national polls of 21, 32, 30, 26, and 24 percentage points ahead of Bernie Sanders. Perhaps this will turn out to be a short-term bump, but the people currently preferring Biden probably feel like they know him well. He’s a familiar and liked face amidst a crowd of strangers. Biden doesn’t need the formal endorsement of Barack Obama because he’s already received the clearest de-facto endorsement imaginable: Obama wanted Biden in the Oval Office if he ever died or was incapacitated. Obama effectively made his 2020 presidential endorsement in the summer of 2008. And if Biden does become the 2020 Democratic nominee . . . the ramifications will be hilarious. After all the talk of the most diverse group of candidates in American history, and for all the identity-politics obsession gripping the party, the Democratic nominee would be a (very) old, straight, white male. Post-Obama Democratic politics would not be focused on a Generation X or Millennial figure, but (sigh) yet another Baby Boomer. Here’s Biden’s inspiring message to young people : “The younger generation now tells me how tough things are. Give me a break. No, no, I have no empathy for it. Give me a break. Because here’s the deal guys, we decided we were gonna change the world. And we did. We did.” (Paraphrasing what they say on Twitter, “What the heck? I love Joe Biden now.”) For all of the talk of the Democrats’ move towards socialism, the nominee would be a figure from the party’s establishment, who’s done the bidding of Delaware’s banking industry and credit-card companies for most of his career. Biden might throw out a proposal or two to appeal to the hipster Bolsheviks setting the tone for Democrats on Twitter, but as with Trump, the instincts and attitudes of a septuagenarian rarely change much. Biden 2020 would, explicitly or implicitly, promise a return to the Obama-era status quo. The Trans-Pacific Partnership would be back. Finally, we would have a Democrat willing to stand up for demonized billionaires: “I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason we’re in trouble.” Ideas like a new “universal basic income” would be off the table. As vice president, Biden defended immigration policies in 2014 that were designed to assess asylum claims quickly and return those who did not qualify — and that “the vast majority” would be returning to their countries of origin: The Department of Justice, Homeland Security, this is what they’re doing. They are enhancing the enforcement and removal proceedings because those who are pondering risking their lives to reach the United States should be aware of what awaits them. It will not be open arms. It will not be ‘come on’ — it will be, ‘we’re going to hold hearings with our judges consistent with international law and American law, and we’re going to send the vast majority of you back.’ . . . we are prioritizing the need to resolve these cases as quickly as position in light of the humanitarian crisis caused by the — number of crossings. Make no mistake, once an individual’s case is fully heard, and if he or she does not qualify for asylum, he or she will be removed from the United States and returned home. Everyone should know that. We expect many of the recent immigrants — migrants I should say to fall into this category. My guess is a vast majority, and they will be going home. For all the talk of cultural “wokeness” and progressives’ eagerness to police even casual speech for unintended slights and insults, the Democratic nominee would be a guy who jokes about Indian-Americans owning 7-11s and uses terms such as “Shylocks” and “ the Orient .” After all of the talk about the enormous consequences of #MeToo, the 2020 race would come down to Trump, of the infamous Access Hollywood tape and tawdry payoffs to Stormy Daniels, against Biden, the hair-sniffing habitual toucher of female strangers — whose wife, Jill Biden, recently declared “ it’s time to move on ” from discussion about the Anita Hill hearings. For some progressives, Biden winning the nomination would be almost as severe a defeat as Trump’s reelection. It would mean that the Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs, Ilhan Omars, and Rashida Tlaibs of the world were no more than newer versions of Maxine Waters, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Barbara Lee — liberals representing heavily Democratic districts with limited influence over the party as a whole. It would affirm, as some of us have insisted for a while, that the current House majority was built by Democrats in reddish-purple districts running as centrists and — Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma — touting their ownership of guns and support for immigration enforcement and disavowing or at least ignoring a chunk of the progressive agenda. It would mean that Twitter really is a bubble, representing a limited political discourse that is far to the Left of the political spectrum of the real world. For Democrats who wanted a woke, diverse, intersectional or Socialist candidate, and who find themselves horrified that their party could betray those much-touted values in exchange for a well-known egomaniacal septuagenarian with a runaway mouth . . . well, those of us who thought the Republican nominee should worry about deficits and the debt know exactly how you feel. Is ‘the Midwest’ Oversimplified? A side effect of a party obsessed with identity politics is that any supporter or argument in favor of any white male will inevitably face the accusation that it is rooted in racism or sexism. "
Abortion & New York City -- Focus on the Family Hosts Moving Pro-Life Event in Times Square | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/these-are-the-times-to-be-focused-on-the-mother-and-child-the-heartbeat-of-life-and-love/,"Follow Kathryn Jean Lopez on Twitter May 8, 2019 10:09 AM
I saw the end of a commercial for a car, I think, this morning. The tag line was “Roar Silently.” Maybe that’s the way to best describe the rally this weekend in Times Square. I went because I was grateful for Focus on the Family for making it happen. I am grateful for the perseverance and tenacity of Abby Johnson and the eager and courageous heart of Ashley Bratcher, who plays Johnson in the movie Unplanned . I went because I’ve seen beautiful pro-life things happen in New York, but never in Times Square. Never like this. The majority of the counter protesters had given up by the times the heartbeat moment came and a there really was a kind of silence that fell on the busiest part of the busiest city. Focus couldn’t get anyone to sell them ad space to livestream Abby’s sonogram, and so they had a number of screens on a number of streets. Ever since the heartbeat moments, I’ve been wondering in prayer about the women who might have been passing through – and men, too – who have experience with abortion, who have wounds in need of healing. I hope they get it. I always point people toward the Sisters of Life , who have a charism and retreats for this. There’s Project Rachel , too. There’s Abortion Changes You . What I loved most about the rally Saturday is that it was wrapped in prayer and messages of healing and hope, mercy and redemption. And, yes, prayers for conversion. That might scream “Bible bullies” to a Keystone State representative, but it looks a little bit like making a civilization of love real in a brutal world, in a state with an especially acute coarseness. Advertisement Advertisement
The mother and child. That’s the image to hold up and protect and celebrate. We’ll be judged on this. Among my favorite moments of the Alive in New York event was football player Benjamin Watson talking about fatherhood. Another was survivors of abortion speaking with love and hope and courage. And, again, with great love about scared moms who didn’t realize, who didn’t have support, who didn’t really feel they had choice. Advertisement
In the face of people tweeting away life as missed periods and exposing the inhumanity of our Roe regime, we need to do more gutsy things like talking love and life in Times Square. We need to focus on the mother and child and make room for a culture where men are expected to be protectors, not harassers."
Heidi Schreck's 'What the Constitution Means to Me': Crude Legal Analysis | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/progressives-and-their-imaginary-constitution/,"May 8, 2019 10:30 AM Heidi Schreck in What the Constitution Means to Me (Joan Marcus) A Broadway show presents legal analysis crude enough to dazzle progressives.
W e’ll stipulate that should the end of the American experiment as defined by its current Constitution be imminent, it will probably not be habitués of Broadway theater who do the overthrowing. Nor are the folks who can afford to pay $197 for an hour and a half’s entertainment likely to form a seething mob. Nevertheless, it is disappointing to hear hundreds of fellow Americans whooping and cheering at the suggestion that the Constitution be abolished and that the cure for our ills is to model ourselves on South Africa. Advertisement
What the Constitution Means to Me , a play by Heidi Schreck that is mostly a monologue starring the author, a middle-aged television writer from Washington state, has been called “not just the best play to open on Broadway so far this season, but also the most important” (the New York Times ), “theater in the old sense, the Greek sense, a place where civic society can come together and do its thinking and fixing” ( Time Out New York ), an “ingenious play [that] keeps peeling away its layers, to reveal a blood-chilling core truth: The Constitution isn’t here to protect you” (the New York Observer ), and “a play of ideas for which people are not just hungry but starved [in which] Schreck relates her own history to the gaping holes in the Constitution where adequate protections for women should be” (the Hollywood Reporter ). This week it won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best American Play.
What the Constitution Means to Me does not offer any particularly damning evidence against the Constitution but the reaction of its audience is pretty damning against liberals. Remember when the Left liked the Constitution? The hosannas for What the Constitution Means to Me provide strong evidence that that era is over. Advertisement
As a teenager, Schreck used to win prize money from the American Legion giving a set speech (now lost) in praise of the Constitution. In later years she narrowed her focus: The only parts she is interested now are the three famously vague bits: the equal-protection clause, the due-process clause and, vaguest of all, the Ninth Amendment, which states that the enumeration of rights in the Constitution is not to be construed as denying the existence of other rights. Schreck’s face lights up when she discusses “Amendment Nine,” as she calls it, because she misunderstands it as a green light for liberals to do anything they want to do. Schreck says the Ninth Amendment is why you have “a right to brush your teeth.” Or to have an imaginary friend. The Ninth Amendment is the Right to Whatever Heidi Schreck Wants Amendment, according to Heidi Schreck.
The error of this way of thinking is fairly obvious: What if I think the Ninth Amendment gives me the right to do things I want to do that Heidi Schreck might not want me to do, such as moving in next door to her and blasting Metallica into her window at 3 a.m. ? The Ninth Amendment can’t possibly mean “You have any right you can dream up.” If Wyoming passed a law forbidding the brushing of teeth, it would be time to wield the Antonin Scalia stamp of legend, the one that says “stupid but constitutional.” Advertisement Advertisement
Naturally this is all leading to abortion; the Ninth inspired Justice William O. Douglas’s “penumbra” remark about implied rights, and Harry Blackmun picked up that ball and ran with it in Roe . All good to Heidi Schreck, but though she exercised her right to abortion many years ago, the Constitution disappoints her in other ways. There is a long history of violence against women in her family, particularly against her grandmother Betty. The Constitution is flawed because it didn’t stop that. She recites the bogus statistics that one in three women is sexually assaulted and one in four is raped (usually these false claims are made regarding women on college campuses only but Schreck broadens the claims to all American women). When she starts calling for a South Africa–like constitution, she seems unaware that violence against women is vastly higher in that country, which is currently mulling an amendment to make it easier for the government to seize private property."
Robert Mueller’s Excuse for Airing ‘Obstruction’ Evidence Preposterous | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C. Mccarthy,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-muellers-preposterous-rationale-for-tainting-the-president-with-obstruction-allegations/,"May 8, 2019 10:51 AM Robert Mueller on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., September 17, 2008 (Molly Riley/Reuters File Photo) Volume II of his report does exactly what he claimed to be avoiding.
I n gross violation of Justice Department policy and constitutional norms, a prosecutor neither charges nor recommends charges against a suspect, but proceeds to smear him by publishing 200 pages of obstruction allegations. Asked to explain why he did it, the prosecutor says he was just trying to protect the suspect from being smeared . Advertisement Advertisement
This is the upshot of the Mueller report’s Volume II. It might be thought campy if the suspect weren’t the president of the United States and the stakes weren’t so high.
The smear-but-don’t-charge outcome is the result of two wrongs: (1) Mueller’s dizzying application of Justice Department guidance, written by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), holding that a president may not be indicted while he is in office; and (2) the media-Democrat complex’s demand that only laws they like — those that serve their anti-Trump political purposes — be enforced.
On the matter of the OLC guidance, the Mueller report exhibits the same sleight-of-hand that I detailed in Monday’s column regarding its account of the George Papadopoulos saga — in which Mueller obscures the fact that the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation (“Crossfire Hurricane”) was opened on the false pretense that a Russian agent named Joseph Mifsud confided to Trump adviser Papadopoulos that Russia had thousands of Clinton emails, which Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer the Kremlin planned to publish in a manner timed to damage Clinton for Trump’s benefit. To the contrary, if you wade through the fine print of Mueller’s report, you learn that Mifsud was not a Russian agent; there’s a good chance he did not tell Papadopoulos anything about emails; in relating to Downer that Russia might have damaging information on Clinton, Papadopoulos said nothing about emails or about Russia trying to help Trump; but, two months after they spoke and the hacked DNC emails were published, Downer (in consultation with the Obama State Department) leapt to the overwrought conclusions that Papadopoulos must have been referring to those emails (he wasn’t) and that Russia and the Trump campaign must be collaborating to undermine the election (they weren’t).
The narrative head fakes and legal mumbo-jumbo make you wonder what’s going on here. Who is running this show, Mueller — or some of his notoriously aggressive staffers, recruited from the Obama Justice Department and private practice stints representing the Clintons? Advertisement Advertisement
On the matter of the OLC guidance, if you can follow his reasoning, the special counsel twists himself into the position that it would have been unfairly prejudicial to Trump to recommend charges when the president would not have been able to defend himself in a judicial proceeding — but, somehow, it was perfectly fair to Trump for Mueller to publish his evidence in a document manifestly written for exploitation by congressional Democrats and the media.
Flaws in the OLC Guidance For what it’s worth, I have always thought the OLC guidance is wrong. I do not believe the Framers intended to insulate a sitting president from indictment.
The Constitution presumes that the check on a rogue president will be impeachment. It elaborates, however, that impeachment is no impediment to indictment. Further, the Constitution does not say that indictment must await either impeachment or other departure from office. (Article I, Section 3, says a “party convicted” of impeachment is liable to court prosecution, but this does not necessarily mean prosecution may occur only after a president either has been convicted in a Senate impeachment trial, or his term otherwise ends.)
While there was significant discussion of impeachment when the Constitution was being drafted in 1787 (I outlined much of it in Faithless Execution ), I doubt the Framers gave much thought to the timing of a president’s indictment. There were no federal prosecutors to speak of at the time (there was no Justice Department until 1870 and no FBI until 1908), and the federal Constitution would not have barred action by state prosecutors. The Constitution presumes it is Congress’s job to check a wayward president — and not a job to be delegated to a prosecutor. Advertisement Advertisement
More to the point, it makes no sense that a president should be spared indictment under seal. This is how the Justice Department routinely deals with cases in which (a) a crime must be charged to prevent the statute of limitations from lapsing, but (b) the indictment should not be publicized for some good policy reason (usually, because the accused is at large and, if put on notice, could flee and destroy evidence). The OLC guidance’s objective is simply to delay prosecution in deference to the chief executive’s weighty responsibilities; it is not supposed to put the president above the law by giving him a statute-of-limitations defense that would not be available to the rest of us.
Consequently, if there is a truly serious offense and enough evidence to support prosecution, a president should be indicted under seal (i.e., under court-supervised secrecy). Then the indictment could be unsealed once a president is out of office, and the criminal case could proceed in the normal course. Advertisement Advertisement
Whether I am right or wrong about this, it is indisputable that we are talking only about timing . The OLC guidance does not say a president may never be indicted; just that he can’t be indicted while serving.
Indefensible Decision Not to Decide That means the OLC guidance should be irrelevant to the prosecutor investigating the case. Even if we stipulate, for argument’s sake, that a president may not be indicted in the here and now, he may still be prosecuted for any indictable offense at some future point. Therefore, someone must decide if there is a crime worth charging. That someone, obviously, is the prosecutor assigned to investigate the case. Since there is no bar on investigating a sitting president, it makes no sense to refrain from making the prosecution judgment — to charge or not to charge — until later (potentially, years later) when witnesses’ memories have faded and evidence has gone stale or missing.
If there is sufficient evidence, then it is the prosecutor’s job to recommend indictment. The question of whether the OLC guidance should then be invoked to delay indictment should then be up to the attorney general. The guidance should not burden the prosecutor’s analysis of whether there is an indictable case. Advertisement
Yet Mueller chose not to see it that way. His thinking on the matter, it appears, was muddled, evolving over a few weeks’ time as he groped for a way to rationalize his failure to make a decision about whether obstruction should be charged.
In recent Senate testimony, Attorney General Bill Barr related that he and his staff met with the Mueller team a couple of weeks before the report was completed. Mueller surprised them with the news that he would not be resolving the obstruction question. When asked to explain, Mueller said his rationale for this non-decision was not yet fully developed — such temporizing, of course, is often the sign of handwringing as one tries to rationalize a determination one knows is wrong. Nevertheless, Barr reports that Mueller was emphatic that the OLC guidance was not what drove his decision to abdicate.
Yet when we finally saw the Mueller report , we found that the obstruction volume begins with a discussion of the OLC guidance. It is, by turns, vaporous and preposterous. It is no wonder Barr has said he does not know exactly what Mueller was thinking. Advertisement
Here’s my take.
Mueller deduces that the guidance (a) prohibits indictment in order to avoid a public charge that would undermine the capacity of a president to govern, but (b) permits investigation with an eye toward post-presidency prosecution. The special counsel pretends that this gives him “fairness concerns” over the president’s due-process rights: If, after a thorough investigation, a prosecutor made a judgment that the president had committed a crime but did not charge him, Mueller reasons that the poor president would bear all the stigma of a criminal accusation but would have no opportunity to clear his name in formal court proceedings. That is, the OLC guidance denies him his day in court.
Mind you: Mueller says this as a précis to pouring out over 200 pages’ worth of obstruction evidence — and, implying that this evidence is quite serious indeed, he is at pains to tell you he will not “exonerate” the president, even though he hasn’t charged him. That is, Mueller’s report is designed to taint the president when he does not have the constitutional protections of a criminal defendant — exactly the thing Mueller claimed to be avoiding by not making a decision on obstruction.
Of course, there would be no such danger if the report had been kept confidential, as federal regulations require. There would be no such danger if Mueller had simply done his job, made the required binary decision about whether or not the evidence supported indictment, and left the application of the OLC guidance to the attorney general. And there would be no such danger if the OLC guidance provided for a sealed indictment, such that the question of whether prosecution is warranted could be resolved now, and the timing of prosecution could be tabled — for the president sake, and the country’s — until the end of Trump’s term (or terms).
This would have had no bearing on Congress’s ability to consider impeachment. Advertisement
It would also have allowed for internal Justice Department deliberation over the law of obstruction. Right now, the report has been publicized when it should not have been. Moreover, Attorney General Barr had to know that if he had tinkered with the report’s legal analysis, this would have resulted in cries that he was protecting the president, so he had to stay his hand. As a result, the Mueller report’s construction of federal obstruction law appears to stand as a definitive Justice Department position, even though Mueller’s interpretation is controversial — the attorney general has indicated that he and the deputy attorney general have disagreements with it; I suspect OLC would have qualms, too.
A live debate over the correct construction of unsettled law, or its novel application, is something the Justice Department is supposed to sort out internally before publicizing a voluminous set of allegations. Here, the special counsel’s legal argument almost surely does not reflect the Justice Department’s position."
Puzzling and Extreme Ruling Against Physician-Only Abortion Requirement | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/puzzling-ruling-against-physician-only-abortion-requirement/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter May 8, 2019 3:57 PM
In a ruling on Monday (in Falls Church Medical Center v. Oliver ), senior federal district judge Henry E. Hudson (a Bush 43 appointee) held that a 1975 Virginia law that allows only licensed physicians to perform abortions cannot be enforced against abortions in the first trimester. On initial read, I find Judge Hudson’s ruling on this issue very puzzling—indeed, deeply troublesome—in several respects: Advertisement Advertisement
1.Hudson acknowledges that the challenge to the physician-only law, “ if waged by Plaintiffs as a facial challenge , … could face a formidable arsenal of countervailing authority.” (Slip op. at 16 (emphasis added).)
The Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) noted with approval that “[o]ur cases reflect the fact that the Constitution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed professionals, even if an objective assessment might suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others.” (Hudson quotes the first part of this passage, but not the second.) On that basis, the Court upheld a requirement that a licensed physician, rather than a qualified assistant, provide the information relevant to informed consent. Likewise, in Mazurek v. Armstrong (1997), the Court summarily reversed a Ninth Circuit ruling against a licensed-physician-only abortion law and emphasized “our repeated statements in past cases … that the performance of abortions may be restricted to physicians.”
Contrary to Hudson, I don’t see how the holdings of Casey and Mazurek are limited to facial challenges, and I don’t see why they don’t dispose of plaintiffs’ challenge. Advertisement
(I also don’t understand Hudson’s account of why plaintiffs’ challenge in the case before him is not a facial challenge. He states that “Plaintiffs’ challenge … is more narrowly focused to the specific application of the Physician-Only Law to access abortion care in the Commonwealth of Virginia.” (P. 16.) But that supposedly “specific application” is the entire reach of the law.) Advertisement
2. Hudson’s ruling applies to all first-trimester abortions, both medication abortions and surgical abortions. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Hudson explains that there are “two forms” of abortion that “can be utilized in the first and early second trimester of pregnancy”: aspiration abortion and dilation-and-evacuation abortion. (P. 19.) Hudson appears to credit one physician’s testimony that “some APCs [non-physician advanced practice clinicians] could capably perform first trimester abortions, but ‘ I don’t believe their training would support them managing complications .’” (P. 19 (emphasis added); the internal quote is the physician’s testimony, and the broader quote is Hudson’s paraphrase of that testimony.) But if that is so, why isn’t it eminently reasonable, and consistent with Casey and Mazurek , for Virginia to require that only physicians conduct first-trimester surgical abortions? If Hudson provides an answer to this question, I don’t see it.
Hudson’s seeming disregard for the state’s interest in maximizing the safety of surgical abortion is further reflected in his statement that “[s]urgical abortions need not be performed in a sterile operating room.” (P. 19.) Advertisement Advertisement
3. Hudson concludes that plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment against the physician-only law for first-trimester abortions, but that the physician-only requirement is “amply justif[ied]” for second-trimester abortions (p. 37), as “potential complications in performing second trimester abortions may arise that may warrant the judgment and skills that a physician can best provide” (p. 20). Are we really supposed to believe that there is some marked change in the safety of surgical abortion that occurs precisely at the trimester mark? And, if there is, why doesn’t Hudson bother to spell out precisely when the first trimester ends?
4. Although Hudson’s ruling is premised on the proposition that some trained medical professionals other than licensed physicians could perform first-trimester abortions (including surgical abortions), his ruling, as I understand it, would allow anyone to do so. Hudson rules that the physician-only requirement is invalid during the first trimester, but he doesn’t substitute any less restrictive requirement in its place. (Perhaps the accompanying order that he says he will issue will do so.)
Again, these are my takes on my initial review of Hudson’s ruling. I acknowledge that I have found the ruling difficult to make sense of. If my further review clarifies or corrects my initial understanding, I will amend or supplement this post. Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "
"F-Word: One Taboo, Now an Unfortunate National Habit | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Heather Wilhelm,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/f-word-once-taboo-unfortunate-national-habit/,"May 9, 2019 6:30 AM (Joe Skipper/Reuters) Once taboo, the word has become an unfortunate national habit in need of breaking.
O ne of my favorite 1960s anecdotes comes from legendary broadcaster Larry King, who tells of attending his first roast at New York City’s Friars Club. There, French actor Maurice Chevalier dared to utter the F-word live on stage. King was practically blown out of his seat. “I thought I’d die,” he recalls. Advertisement Advertisement
Today, as King himself has noted, the F-bomb — once known as the ultimate forbidden verbal lightning bolt, the Utterance That Must Not Be Named, or at least the word of last resort to use when you’re really hopelessly mad — might as well be growing out of random cracks in the sidewalk. In 2019, the F-word is a throwaway. It is a sneeze. It is as common as dandelion fluff.
Does anyone else find this awkward? Mock me if you will — no doubt my quest is a lonely one — but I certainly do.
Just the other day, while I was communing with a wildly energetic and occasionally shouty spin instructor in my garage — I am the enthusiastic new owner of one of those Peloton workout bikes where you can beam into classes via an Internet-connected screen — I discovered that even the most winsome and cheerful Peloton instructor might one day randomly bombard you with the F-bomb. In my case, this happened right in the middle of an insanely steep fake “hill” climb and a cheerily judgmental pop song. (If the song had happened to be Ariana Grande’s regrettably catchy hit “Thank U, Next,” or perhaps Pink’s unedited “F-ing Perfect,” I could have absorbed approximately seven bonus F-words for good measure.)
I have since discovered that Peloton classes have labels and filters for explicit language, which is certainly nice of them. I somehow missed this the first go-round, because just as no one expects the Spanish Inquisition, I naïvely failed to expect that my workout bike would one day curse at me like my own personal Colonel Jessup from A Few Good Men. Advertisement Advertisement
Thankfully, my kids were out of earshot when that particular F-bomb dropped. Unfortunately, there have been plenty of others to go around. My kids were in exceptionally clear eyeshot on a different day, for instance, when we happened to pass a bored-looking young lady sporting a tank top that declared, “YOU MUST HAVE ME CONFUSED FOR SOMEONE WHO GIVES A [F-WORD].” The word in question was, of course, uncensored, helpfully available for every kindergartener in a 20-foot radius to see.
What is wrong with everyone? Have we lost our national “edit” button? (I’ll answer my own question, because the answer is obvious: Yes.)
The F-bomb has long been with us, but the growing tendency to cheerfully, unhesitatingly use it in any old circumstance is something new and alarming. Forget venturing into R-rated movies or edgy art galleries: Take your kid into a random gift shop in the Texas hill country these days, and you might find cutesy hand towels embroidered with swear words that would have made young Larry King faint. Beto O’Rourke, always game to roll on the bad-idea bandwagon, gained notoriety during his Senate campaign for letting an impressive parade of F-bombs fly. Self-help books with the F-word fly off the shelves, even though — at least in the humble opinion of this writer, who grew up in the famously repressed rolling fields of the American Midwest — “The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a Rip” would make for just as compelling a title as “The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a” — well, I’ll stop there. You know what word is coming next. Advertisement
It gets worse: Just last week, Burger King, which is gross even without the help of swear words, launched a series of mood-themed “Real Meals,” questionable foodstuffs boxed with wonderfully poetic names like — you guessed it — the DGAF Meal.

Weirdly, Burger King released these meal deals as part of “Mental-Health Awareness” month. That seems paradoxical at best, but since we’re speaking of mental health, let’s take this moment to get philosophical. My crusade against the public explosion of the F-bomb, you see, goes beyond simple manners. Much like, say, The Lego Batman Movie , it is far deeper than it appears.
In many ways, words can shape our very perception of reality. Edward Sapir, who helped develop the hypothesis of linguistic relativity in the 1930s, put it this way: “Human beings . . . are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society. . . . The fact of the matter is that the ‘real world’ is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group.” Advertisement
It’s a radical idea, but what if it contains a grain of truth? What does our society’s thunderstorm of public F-bombs do to our greater sensibility, cultural or otherwise? When the worst swear word becomes commonplace, what do we use to describe the truly horrific? What happened to mystery and subtlety? For that matter, what happened to the fashion sense of people who regularly sport shirts that evoke memories of the early routines of Andrew Dice Clay? Advertisement"
Modern Boycotts Not Effective for Social Change | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Brendan Dougherty,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/boycotts-not-effective-social-change-publicity-campaigns/,"May 9, 2019 6:30 AM Uber and Lyft drivers protest outside Uber’s office in Saugus, Mass., May 8, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) Modern boycotts are less like “social excommunication” and more like publicity campaigns.
I n ten cities across the country, the drivers who contract for rideshare services Uber and Lyft are supposed to be on strike, and activists have asked that those who would hail them should join in the action by refusing to use their services. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sander s and the U.K.’s Labour party leader Jeremy Corby n have tweeted their support for the drivers to be recognized and governed as employees, rather than as subcontractors for these Silicon Valley companies.

Under Uber’s terms of service, drivers are “partners” who are both contractors and customers. And so technically, the planned strikes are, in Uber’s eyes, temporary boycotts.
I’m skeptical of the ability of boycotts to achieve their purpose. Chick-fil-A changed its behavior of supporting political groups, but its founders have not disavowed their religious beliefs, and their business keeps expanding. The Nestle company has been subjected to several boycotts over the years, and it is so untroubled by them, even the continuing ones, that it provides informatio n on them on its own website.
The term boycott was coined by a Catholic priest, Father John O’Malley, to describe the “social excommunication” of Charles Cunningham Boycott, a 19th-century English land agent who was working in Ireland. Boycott was known for particularly harsh evictions of tenants on Lord Erne’s 40,000 acres of land in County Mayo.
The tenancy terms from Lord Erne forbade tenant farmers from freely selling their crops or achieving fixed leases for the land. 80 percent of landlords in Ireland were absentee in 1870, and most tenancies were annual contracts to farm less than 15 acres. Boycott developed a particularly nasty reputation collecting rents and enforcing the terms on a precarious class of peasant Irish. The land issue came to dominate Irish politics under the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, who organized land leagues to organize demands for a freer agricultural economy, rather than the semi-feudal terms on which things ran. As bad harvests, the memory of the Great Hunger, and political activism put pressure on this system, something had to give. And tenants decided on a complete social and economic excommunication for Boycott.
His own workers were pressured to cease laboring for him. Shops in neighboring towns refused his service. Common people were pressured not to even speak to him. He complained bitterly in a letter to newspapers in Great Britain:
My herd has been frightened by them into giving up his employment, though he has refused to give up the house he held from me as part of his emolument. Another herd on an off farm has also been compelled to resign his situation. My blacksmith has received a letter threatening him with murder if he does any more work for me, and my laundress has also been ordered to give up my washing. A little boy, twelve years of age, who carried my post-bag to and from the neighbouring town of Ballinrobe, was struck and threatened on 27th September, and ordered to desist from his work; since which time I have sent my little nephew for my letters and even he, on 2nd October, was stopped on the road and threatened if he continued to act as my messenger.
Protestant farmers were brought in from Ulster by the government to break the power of this social strike against Boycott. It is estimated (probably generously) that the British government spent the equivalent of $10 million in today’s dollars to bring in $500,000 worth of crops. But the social strike of the Irish eventually broke Boycott’s will to continue living in Ireland.
The boycott provided a great tale and legend to motivate the growing land-reform movement. The “social excommunication” of Boycott included in it the threat of violence. How could it not? To organize the universal refusal to acknowledge the existence or voice of a human being is to give a person a foretaste of death and perdition. And to organize such a thing successfully requires a level of social cohesion and moral resolve that is difficult to replicate elsewhere. That’s true even if you take the form of this protest to be immoral and menacing. Advertisement"
Brian Sims and Today's Political Fanaticism | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/brian-sims-political-fanaticism-identity-politics/,"May 9, 2019 6:30 AM Pennsylvania state representative Brian Sims (Pennsylvania House Video/via YouTube) Political fanatics such as Representative Brian Sims fixate on terminology as a substitute for ideas, and for them buzzwords are a necessary intellectual crutch.
H ow to explain Brian Sims? None of the three most likely possibilities — that he is not very bright, that he is insane, that he is a fanatic — speaks very well of the Pennsylvania state representative, who for some reason decided to accost an elderly woman praying silently in front of an abortion facility, to film the attack, and then to boast about it on Twitter. Advertisement Advertisement
It is tempting to lean toward stupidity as an explanation for Sims’s shenanigans, if only because that is the most statistically likely scenario when the subject in question is a member of the Pennsylvania state legislature, as witless a collection of moldering goofs and ravening mediocrities as you will find in any of our state capitals.
But let’s not give short shrift to the insanity option. Sims — who holds elected office and previously worked for the Philadelphia Bar Association — offered a cash bounty to his social-media followers for identifying information with which to “dox” three teenage girls who were praying outside the same clinic. Mentally normal adult men do not go around photographing teenaged girls and then trolling for their names on social media in order to facilitate harassing them. Generally speaking, adult men who go around taking photographs of teenaged girls are considered creeps; Representative Sims is a homosexual, which may spare him the charge of lechery in this matter, but his behavior is still pretty weird.
The times being what they are, perhaps we should classify political fanaticism of the social-media performance-art variety as a kind of insanity. Political fanatics such as Sims live in the shadows between the idée fixe and outright monomania. The inferior kind — and Sims is the inferior kind — fixate on terminology as a substitute for ideas, and for them buzzwords are a necessary intellectual crutch. Hence, Sims’s shouty accusations of “white privilege” in the face of a young woman who, as she pointed out with a smile , is not white . Intersectionality — it is a bitch. Advertisement
What should be remarkable (but is not remarkable) about the Sims video is the superficiality and banality of his thinking. His political arguments are utterly sophomoric, e.g. demanding that the elderly lady interrupt her Rosary to tell him how many unwanted children she is clothing and feeding. The taunt is childish: No one ever asks critics of capital punishment how many murderers they’re willing to bring into their homes. The Pennsylvania state legislature is not the Olympus of politics, but even that repulsive body deserves better than this stuff. It would be tempting to describe this as dorm-room discourse, but most kindergartens do not have dormitories. Advertisement
Some fanatics are dangerous. Almost all of them are boring. They are tedious in themselves and the cause of tediousness in others. Forgive me for repeating this story: I once had a student who discovered the Palestinian cause in college, as a certain kind of WASP suburbanite does, and she endeavored to turn every conversation to the evils of Israel, rarely speaking a sentence that did include the word “Zionist,” which she pronounced in a distinctly low-pH way. I shared with her Winston Churchill’s observation that a fanatic is “a man who can’t change his mind and won’t change the subject.” She did not miss a beat. “Exactly. It’s like when you’re debating with a Zionist . . .” Advertisement
Representative Sims is a low kind of man with a low kind of mind, but Representative Sims is, in fact, representative . In our time, politics has become a very strong part of some people’s identities, fundamental to their self-conception. Partly it fills the hole left by the attenuation of religion, but it is also a kind of identity politics for — Representative Sims surely will appreciate the irony — college-educated white people. People without a politically piquant demographic characteristic (and being gay ain’t what it used to be) sometimes use affinity groups as a substitute, seeking in being a vegan or a socialist or a Hamas apologist the solidarity, cohesion, and social cachet they imagine African Americans or transgender decathletes enjoying by virtue of their membership in those ranks. They take up political causes just as some young people take up exotic religions, in the same way and for the same reason."
Women Candidates & Hillary Clinton Not Interchangeable Terms | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/women-candidates-and-hillary-clinton-are-not-interchangeable-terms/,"May 9, 2019 10:24 AM Hillary Clinton speaks at the Woman’s National Democratic Club in Washington, D.C., November 2, 2017. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)
Over at The New York Times , columnist Farhard Manjoo urges Democrats to nominate a woman :
Democratic voters say that while they themselves may support Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and other women who are running for president, they worry that other people — their friends and neighbors, the news media, a lot of the men in their lives — won’t give a woman a fair shot against President Trump…
Overlooking a qualified woman because you expect misogynists to have a problem with her is the very definition of patriarchy. In doing so, you are abdicating the voting booth to the enemies of equality and are perpetuating the dynamic that has given us 45 male presidents in a row.
Manjoo glides over the fact that the mentality he describes is quite self-flattering: “I would be fine with a woman president, but those backwards hicks in those state we need to win won’t vote for one, so there’s no point in considering it.” It’s an argument that relies on a data point of one election, 2016 — and conflates the projected problems of “women candidates” with the established problems of “Hillary Clinton.”
If the Democrats nominate a woman in 2020, whoever she is, she will not have been in the public eye for a quarter century as Hillary Clinton had been in 2016. That woman probably won’t have an issue with lots of classified information in an insufficiently secure private email server. That woman probably won’t have a husband involved in a series of infamous and embarrassing sex scandals and harassment allegations. That woman probably won’t be facing accusations that the Democratic National Committee pulled out all the stops to ensure she won. A woman who wins the 2020 Democratic nomination will have other problems — as will any man who wins the nomination. Advertisement Advertisement
Nor is there a particularly strong case that a woman candidate would be particularly weak in all of those swing states that Democrats are worried about. The notion that women can’t win in Iowa will be news to Senator Joni Ernst and Governor Kim Reynolds. Senator Tammy Baldwin has won in Wisconsin several times, as has Senator Debbie Stabenow in Michigan; Michigan’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and Jennifer Granholm were elected to two terms. North Carolina elected Governor Bev Purdue and senators Elizabeth Dole and Kay Hagan a few cycles back. Democrats had a lousy year in Florida in 2018, but Nikki Fried won the statewide race for agriculture commissioner.
The notion that women are more likely to be elected in blue or traditionally Democratic states doesn’t really hold up, either. Alabama and South Dakota currently have women governors, South Carolina had one in Nikki Haley, Oklahoma had one in Mary Fallin, and you probably remember a particular governor from Alaska who made national news in 2008.

Constitutional Crisis As Absurdist Theater | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/constitutional-crisis-as-absurdist-theater/,"May 9, 2019 9:15 AM House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)
J erry Nadler has declared a constitutional crisis.
The proximate cause is a couple of redacted lines, including one footnote, in a 400-page report. Let’s be glad for the sake of the republic that an entire page wasn’t withheld.
To review the plot: Robert Mueller conducted what was in effect an impeachment inquiry from within the executive branch for two years. In defiance of the spirit of the special-counsel regulations, he wrote a long, detailed narrative account of what his investigation found, even though he didn’t accuse the president of a crime (he did, however, “not exonerate” the president on obstruction, a bastard concept hitherto unknown to American law). Advertisement Advertisement
Nothing in the regulations required Attorney General Bill Barr to release any of the report, let alone release it in its entirety. He did anyway with minimal, entirely defensible redactions that the DOJ worked through with Mueller. He then testified for hours in public before a Senate committee about his handling of the report, while declining to appear for more voluntary testimony before a House committee the next day over a process issue (the committee wanted a counsel to question Barr; the attorney general objected, likely because he didn’t like the optics).
Collectively, then, and often working at cross-purposes, the Trump administration has done Congress an enormous favor the last two years. It appointed a special counsel; not only let him finish his work, but cooperated with him (despite Trump’s ineffectual scheming against the investigation); didn’t object to his writing a narrative for public and especially congressional consumption; and with only a brief delay handed the full report, signed, sealed, and delivered, over to Congress to potentially to use as a roadmap for impeachment. (And, oh yeah, the report has been published as a book and is being sold on Amazon.) Most of Jerry Nadler’s work has been done for him. Advertisement Advertisement
For the New York Democrat to turn around and have his committee vote to hold Bill Barr in contempt is truly bizarre. Barr’s alleged offense is the redactions. But he has made an almost entirely un-redacted report available to top Democrats to review. They have refused to do so, boycotting the further information that they say they so desperately need.
The redactions that Barr can’t undo relate to grand-jury material. These are extremely minor in the obstruction volume — now the most politically relevant part of the report — amounting to a few lines . The notion that they would change anything is absurd, and regardless, the rules written by Congress forbid their release to Congress (something Congress might have considered prior to the onset of this purported crisis).

U.S. Trade Relations with China Haven't Changed Beijing's Bad Human-Rights Record | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/u-s-trade-relations-with-china-havent-changed-beijings-bad-human-rights-record/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter May 9, 2019 9:59 AM Chinese and U.S. flags placed for a meeting between Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and China’s Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu at the Ministry of Agriculture in Beijing, China, in 2017. (Jason Lee/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: Tough questions about what two decades of ever-increasing trade with China has gotten us, and a look back at the not-so-realized promises of those who contended Permanent Normal Trade Relations would improve China’s behavior; a look at how politics gives some people a form of easily justified hate; and an observation about the danger of defining the value of human life by whether it is wanted. Increased U.S. Trade with China Was Supposed to Change Beijing’s Behavior. It Didn’t. What if authoritarian capitalism (or quasi-capitalism, or however you want to characterize the Chinese model) is every bit the threat to a free-market democratic republic like ours that Soviet Communism was? In the 1992 presidential debate, Bill Clinton hit President George H.W. Bush for being soft on Chinese leaders after Tiananmen Square and pledged to use trade as a form of leverage to pressure China’s rulers on human rights: "
