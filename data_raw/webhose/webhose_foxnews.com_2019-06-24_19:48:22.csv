No &apos;accomplishments&apos; but hurting people. No motivation but cruelty. Disgusting, outrageous, and pathetic,"" she tweeted on Saturday. She was commenting on an article about the HHS rule, which would reverse the Obama-era decision to protect ""gender identity"" under federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination in health care.
Gillibrand&apos;s comments received a wave of criticism on Twitter:
Gillibrand, an outspoken critic of the president&apos;s, has also joined other 2020 candidates in condemning abortion regulations as well as immigration practices under the administration.
According to RealClearPolitics&apos; polling average , she fell behind a long list of other candidates vying for the Democratic nomination -- grabbing just 0.7 percent of support.
Trump, meanwhile, enjoyed the strong support of the Republican National Committee and touted the economic milestones reached under his administration. Those included substantial GDP growth, record-low unemployment among the general population and within minority segments, and rapid manufacturing growth.

Trump suggests Jussie Smollett owes an apology to 'millions' in 'MAGA COUNTRY',www.foxnews.com,Sam Dorman,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/trump-suggests-jussie-smollett-owes-an-apology-to-millions-in-maga-country,"Jussie Smollett Published 16 hours ago Trump suggests Jussie Smollett owes an apology to 'millions' in 'MAGA COUNTRY' By Sam Dorman | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Judge rules to unseal records in Jussie Smollett case 'Empire' star Jussie Smollett wanted to keep his case file sealed, arguing that after charges against him were dismissed he deserved privacy; Christina Coleman reports from Los Angeles.
President Trump indicated on Saturday that controversial actor Jussie Smollett owed his supporters an apology after allegedly lying about what appeared to beTrump supporters beating him up in a hate crime.
""In addition to great incompetence and corruption, The Smollett case in Chicago is also about a Hate Crime,"" he tweeted.
""Remember, &apos;MAGA COUNTRY DID IT!&apos; That turned out to be a total lie, had nothing to do with &apos;MAGA COUNTRY.&apos; Serious stuff, and not even an apology to millions of people!""
Trump&apos;s comments came amid news that an Illinois judge ordered authorities to unseal Smollett&apos;s criminal case file. The incident served as another flash point in debates over racism and fake hate crimes in the United States.
Controversy erupted around the case when the state attorney dropped 16 charges against him, despite the police accusing him of faking the attack.
This wasn&apos;t the first time Trump called out the ""Empire"" actor. During a rally in April, he called Smollett a ""third-rate"" actor and said his case was a ""disgrace to our nation.""
""He said &apos;I was beaten up by MAGA country.&apos; Can you believe it?"" Trump asked during a rally in Green Bay. ""Turned out to be a total lie,"" he told the audience.
Smollett&apos;s alleged assailants have filed a defamation suit .

"Trump, calling for legal appeal, slams ‘activist Obama appointed judge’ over border wall ruling",www.foxnews.com,admin,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-slams-activist-obama-appointed-judge-over-border-wall-ruling-calls-for-appeal/,"Home / WORLD NEWS / Trump, calling for legal appeal, slams ‘activist Obama appointed judge’ over border wall ruling Trump, calling for legal appeal, slams ‘activist Obama appointed judge’ over border wall ruling 3 hours ago WORLD NEWS President Trump on Saturday ripped into what he described as an “activist Obama appointed judge” after a federal judge blocked the administration’s plan to reallocate money to building a wall on the southern border with Mexico. “Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern Wall that is already under construction,” he said. “This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime, drugs and human trafficking.”
JUDGE TEMPORARILY BLOCKS TRUMP’S BORDER WALL CONSTRUCTION PLANS
Trump went on to say that the administration is asking for “an expedited appeal.”
U.S District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam’s ruling late Friday temporarily prevents the administration from using reallocated funds for two wall-related projects in Arizona and Texas by diverting money that Congress has not approved.
Trump declared a national emergency in February and is using that declaration to redirect funding from the Pentagon, after Congress did not agree to the president’s demand for more than $5 billion in wall funding.
“Congress’s ‘absolute’ control over federal expenditures — even when that control may frustrate the desires of the executive branch regarding initiatives it views as important — is not a bug in our constitutional system. It is a feature of that system, and an essential one,” Gilliam, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, wrote in his opinion.
“In short, the position that when Congress declines the executive’s request to appropriate funds, the executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds ‘without Congress’ does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the earliest days of our Republic,” he said.
Gilliam’s ruling does not stop the Trump administration from using other sources to fund the wall, and he rejected a request by California and 19 other states to prevent the diversion of $600 million in Treasury funds to the wall.
REPUBLICAN LAUNCHES FRESH PUSH TO DEFUND SANCTUARY CITIES AFTER COURTS BLOCK TRUMP
Trump’s declaration of a national emergency, coming after a 35-day government shutdown, was controversial on both sides of the aisle. A resolution disapproving of the declaration passed both chambers of Congress, but was vetoed at the president’s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it a “power grab by a disappointed president” in a statement.
Congress had OK’d $1.4 billion for border security, but it wasn’t close to the $5 billion Trump requested.
The White House eyed an additional $8 billion in existing funding that could be moved for the wall, $3.5 billion of which could be shifted over from the Defense Department’s military construction budget via the emergency declaration.
Trump predicted a difficult legal fight when he declared the national emergency, saying he believed it would end up in the Supreme Court.

“We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued,” Trump said, adding that the federal appeals courts could well rule against his administration. “Then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake, and we’ll win at the Supreme Court — just like the [travel] ban.”
The case is one of a number of lawsuits the administration is facing over the declaration. On Thursday, a judge in Washington heard arguments on a lawsuit from the House of Representatives that claims it violates the Constitution.
The judge was considering whether the House can sue the president instead of resolving a dispute through the political process.

But also it indicate that he feels a connection with President Trump. Something that hasn't occurred in the past with other Presidents. Biden's liberal politics might be the best President for Kim to take advantage of like he did with Obama. But probably realizes that with Biden, Kim might achieve his goals of a Nuclear N. Korea but also may end up with permanent sanctions and a hostile S. Korea and Japan. Plus a Venezuela like economy due to the sanctions. With President Trump, once he denuclearizes N. Korea, Kim will have a full economy with a friendly S.Korea and Japan and his power will be preserved without being so paranoid of being assassinated or Coup by someone in his Government."

Stan Lee's ex-business manager arrested on suspicion of elder abuse,www.foxnews.com,Louis Casiano,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/stan-lees-ex-business-manager-arrested-on-suspicion-of-elder-abuse,"Keya Morgan, 43, was taken into custody in Arizona after Los Angeles prosecutors charged him with five counts of elder abuse , that include theft, forgery or fraud against an elder adult, false imprisonment of an elder adult and embezzlement. Authorities say Morgan tried to manipulate Lee and act on his behalf without his authority. Prosecutors said Morgan pocketed more than $262,000 from autograph signings Lee did in May 2018. Morgan took Lee from his Hollywood Hills home to a Beverly Hills condominium where he exerted control over him, authorities said. Lee died in November at the age of 95.
In this April 23, 2018, file photo, Stan Lee, left, and Keya Morgan arrive at the world premiere of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" in Los Angeles. Morgan, the former business manager of Lee has been arrested on elder abuse charges involving the late comic book icon. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)
Lee&apos;s daughter accused Morgan of preventing her father from seeing his family and friends and attempting to take control of his money and assets.
Morgan&apos;s attorney, Alex Kessel, asserts his client&apos;s innocence. He said he was in contact with prosecutors to arrange for Morgan&apos;s surrender on Tuesday.
Video ""It is unfortunate that the DA and police did not honor our commitment to surrender next week and arrested him,"" Kessel told The Associated Press in an email.
Morgan will go before a judge in Arizona before he is expected to be extradited to Los Angeles, He is being held on $300,000 bond.
