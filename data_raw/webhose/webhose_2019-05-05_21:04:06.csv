Bill Maher Defends Joe Biden: ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs Not Harvey Weinstein‚Äô,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bill-maher-defends-joe-biden-hes-not-harvey-weinstein,"YIKES Bill Maher Defends Joe Biden‚Äôs Creepy Touching: ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs Not Harvey Weinstein or R. Kelly‚Äô The ‚ÄòReal Time‚Äô host defended the former vice president against allegations of sexual misconduct on Friday. HBO
On Friday night, Real Time host Bill Maher did the expected: he defended Joe Biden.
The HBO comic, responding to multiple allegations that the former vice president made women feel uncomfortable with his groping and close contact, made light of their experiences.
‚ÄúBiden is still at large. Women are being urged to walk at night in pairs‚ÄîI just want to make that clear,‚Äù said Maher during his monologue. ‚ÄúNo, he was out‚Äîdid you see Joe Biden today? He finally emerged. He came very close, oh this close, to saying he was about to run. But we still don‚Äôt know that that‚Äôs true. We do know it‚Äôs true that his hands have been part of an exploratory committee for decades.‚Äù
And then, Maher defended the indefensible: ‚ÄúBut you know, we‚Äôre getting a little nitpicky. I mean, of course no one likes to be touched unwantingly, and women get a lot more of that than men, but the first person who brought this up said he made her feel ‚Äògross and uneasy.‚Äô You know what makes me feel ‚Äògross and uneasy?‚Äô A second Trump term.‚Äù
After receiving heavy applause from his crowd, he continued: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not Harvey Weinstein or R. Kelly‚Äîhe‚Äôs more like the TSA. And it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. A woman who came forward today said she was touched by one of his speeches.‚Äù
Earlier in the day, Biden himself joked about the sexual misconduct allegations against him when, before addressing the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers‚Äîand after embracing union president Lonnie R. Stephenson‚Äîhe joked, ‚ÄúI just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie.‚Äù"

Trump Picks Former Presidential Candidate Herman Cain for Fed Board,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/trump-picks-former-presidential-candidate-herman-cain-for-fed-board/ ,"U.S. President Donald Trump plans to nominate former pizza chain executive and Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, where he will help set interest rates for the world‚Äôs biggest economy.
‚ÄúI have recommended him highly for the Fed,‚Äù Trump said in a press conference Thursday. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told my folks that‚Äôs the man.‚Äù
Trump has been a vocal and strident critic of the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes under Jerome Powell, whom the president picked two years ago to chair the U.S. central bank. Trump‚Äôs other Fed appointees have also supported the Powell Fed‚Äôs rate hikes, which the president has said hurt the economy.
This year the Fed has put rate hikes on hold, citing a slowing economy and risks from overseas. Trump, meanwhile, has continued to rail against the Fed, even as he has said he will nominate conservative commentator Stephen Moore, a proponent of rate cuts, for a second vacant seat on the Fed Board.
Asked if he is sending a signal to the Fed with the pair of nominations, Trump said: ‚ÄúNone whatsoever. He‚Äôs a highly respected man. He‚Äôs a friend of mine. He‚Äôs somebody that gets it, and I hope everything goes well ‚Äî but Herman Cain is a very good guy.‚Äù
Board members have a vote on setting interest rates every time U.S. central bankers meet, making them among America‚Äôs most powerful officials for economic policy. At full strength, there are 19 Fed policymakers, including 12 regional Fed bank presidents.
Cain in February told Fox Business Network he believed deflation is a bigger worry, a view that suggests he is not inclined to support rate hikes aimed at keeping inflation in check.
Still, Cain‚Äôs policy views are not entirely clear: in the same February interview, he said he wanted to use wages as a factor in deciding monetary policy, which in the context of recently rising pay could suggest he would support rate hikes.
Cain‚Äôs history
Cain, who is 73, has little direct experience with monetary policy, but what track record he does have suggests a penchant for tighter, not looser, policy.
In the 1990s he served as a director at the Kansas City Fed, one of the 12 regional Fed banks that help process payments in the U.S. banking system and whose presidents take turns voting on rate policy. He chaired the board from 1995 to 1996, when its president was the famously hawkish Thomas Hoenig.
Minutes of meetings during that period, obtained by Reuters from the Fed, show that the bank‚Äôs directors were among those who repeatedly asked the Washington-based Board of Governors to raise rates when most of the boards of directors for the other Fed banks opposed any hike. The concern, according to the minutes, was that continued economic growth could produce price pressures that needed to be contained by tighter policy.
Cain made his fortune as chief executive of Godfather‚Äôs Pizza before launching a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.
He led opinion polls for a while during the Republican nominating contests, buoyed by his signature 9-9-9 tax proposal, which would have levied a flat 9 percent corporate, income and sales tax.
Romney criticism
But his popularity slipped amid sexual harassment allegations from several women, which he denied as ‚Äúcompletely false.‚Äù
Cain‚Äôs likely nomination drew criticism from Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney.
‚ÄúI doubt that will be a nomination,‚Äù Romney told Politico. ‚ÄúBut if it were a nomination, you can bet the interest rates he would be pushing for. ‚Ä¶ If Herman Cain were on the Fed, you‚Äôd know the interest rate would soon be 9-9-9.‚Äù

Arkansas Senate Passes Bill Mandating 72 Hour Waiting Period Before Abortions,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/arkansas-senate-passes-bill-mandating-72-hour-waiting-period-before-abortions/ ,"by Grace Carr
The Arkansas Senate passed a bill Thursday expanding the restrictions it places on women seeking to end their pregnancies by mandating they wait 72 hours post-counseling before they can have an abortion.
The state senate voted Thursday 29-5 to pass SB 278 . Under the legislation, women must wait 72 hours after they are counseled by a physician before they can undergo an abortion. If the law is passed, Arkansas will be the sixth state to enact a 72-hour waiting period, according to The AP.
Previously, women seeking abortions were required to wait 48 hours following state-directed counseling before they could undergo a procedure. State law also requires minors to provide a letter of consent from a parent or guardian prior to the scheduled abortion with the exception of a court order or medical emergency.
Arkansas has three abortion clinics, only one of which offers surgical abortions. Planned Parenthood operates two clinics, one in Little Rock and one in Fayetteville, that both offer medication abortions but not surgical abortions.
Arkansas also passed a law , SB149, in mid-February banning all abortions except those that are necessary to save the mother‚Äôs life if the high court overturns Roe v. Wade . No exceptions for rape or incest are included in the bill.
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wisconsin also have laws banning abortion that would become effective if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The laws were passed prior to Roe v. Wade, according to The Guttmacher Institute.
Louisiana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Mississippi have constitutional statutes that would make abortion illegal should the court rescind a woman‚Äôs legal right to abort.
Arkansas law permits a woman to abort a baby past the point of viability in cases of rape, incest or where an abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the mother. Persons who violate Arkansas‚Äôs abortion laws face fines up to $1,000 and one to five years of prison time.
SB278 will now head to Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson‚Äòs desk for signature. Hutchinson is expected to sign the bill into law.

Immigration Officials Arrest 280 at Texas Company,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/immigration-officials-arrest-280-at-texas-company/ ,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raided a Texas cellphone repair company Wednesday, in what Homeland Security officials are calling the largest worksite raid in the country in more than a decade.
ICE arrested 280 employees of CVE Technology Group Inc. on immigration charges. The company is in the Texas city of Allen, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Dallas.
The investigation started after special agents with ICE‚Äôs Homeland Security Investigations division (HSI) received tips CVE was hiring undocumented people. ICE said some of those employed by the tech company were using fake documents.
A business that knowingly hires undocumented workers ‚Äúcreates an unfair advantage over their competing businesses,‚Äù HSI Special Agent Katrina W. Berger said in a statement.
HSI began an audit of CVE‚Äôs hiring practices in January 2019. The audit confirmed numerous hiring irregularities.
Berger also said the practice creates ‚Äúan atmosphere poised for exploiting their illegal workforce.‚Äù
CVE‚Äôs website is down. VOA could not reach the company for comment.
The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) in a statement to reporters said the organization is working non-stop to help undocumented workers arrested Wednesday.
Domingo Garcia, LULAC‚Äôs national president, said the operation was tragic and unnecessary.
‚ÄúMothers were separated from their children, husbands and parents. ‚Ä¶ All they were doing, when ICE agents swooped down on them with guns and badges, was standing at assembly lines working on making cellphones,‚Äù he added.
According to media reports, the raid did not take place quietly. CVE employee Yessenia Ponce told NPR that it was ‚Äúcrazy,‚Äù and people were working like it was a ‚Äúnormal day‚Äù when ICE agents conducted the raid.
‚ÄúWe just heard screaming, you know, people screaming and stuff. We went out and an officer just said, ‚ÄòFollow my voice, follow my voice,'‚Äù Ponce said.
Hotline for relatives
Those arrested Wednesday are expected to be interviewed by ICE staff to record and note any medical, sole-caregiver or other humanitarian situations.
‚ÄúBased on these interviews, ICE will determine if those arrested remain in custody or are considered for humanitarian release. In all cases, all illegal aliens encountered will be fingerprinted and processed for removal from the United States,‚Äù according to an official statement.
A 24-hour, toll-free detainee locator hotline is available. Relatives who call (888) 351-4024 can find people‚Äôs detention location and status, and the removal process. This hotline operates in English and Spanish.
HSI said the operation was an effort from federal, state and local officials, including the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Eastern District of Texas, and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Grassley: Mueller Team Mischaracterized Trump Campaign Emails in Court Filing,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/grassley-mueller-team-mischaracterized-trump-campaign-emails-in-court-filing/ ,"by Chuck Ross
The special counsel‚Äôs office fed ‚Äúspeculation and innuendo‚Äù about possible collusion with Russia by withholding key details from emails cited in a court filing in the case of former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos, a top Republican senator alleged in a newly released letter.
‚ÄúThe public deserves to have the full context for the information the Special Counsel chooses to release. The glaring lack of it feeds speculation and innuendo that distorts the facts,‚Äù Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley wrote to special counsel Robert Mueller on Oct. 16, 2017.
Grassley, who then chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, was responding to a ‚Äú statement of offense ‚Äù released in the case against Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign adviser who entered a plea deal in the special counsel‚Äôs probe on Oct. 5, 2017.
Prosecutors Quote: d from several emails in a way that suggested top Trump campaign officials were eager to meet with Russians. But Grassley asserted that the full emails showed that campaign officials rebuffed the idea of meeting with Russians. The Iowa Republican took Mueller‚Äôs team to task for failing to correct news reports that cited the Papadopoulos court filings as evidence of possible collusion with Russia.
‚ÄúIt should be the goal of anyone interested in an accurate portrayal of the facts for the American people to correct the erroneous reporting,‚Äù he wrote in the letter, which was published Thursday by Fox News.
Grassley‚Äôs letter to Mueller took on new significance in early April after members of the special counsel‚Äôs team began airing their frustrations over a letter that Attorney General William Barr sent Congress regarding the findings of the Mueller probe.
Barr said in a letter to lawmakers on March 24 that prosecutors were unable to establish that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. He also said that Mueller declined to make a decision on whether obstruction of justice charges could be brought against Trump.
The New York Times and Washington Post reported that anonymous Mueller prosecutors have expressed frustration that the Barr letter mischaracterized their findings on the obstruction component of the investigation.
The Times and Post articles did not identify which Mueller team members have raised concerns about the Barr letter.
Grassley sent a letter to Barr on March 8 asking the attorney general to look into the special counsel‚Äôs ‚Äúselective use‚Äù of emails in the Papadopoulos ‚Äústatement of offense.‚Äù
The full October 2017 letter to Mueller was not made public until Fox News published it on Thursday.
In the letter to Mueller, Grassley pointed to two sections of the Papadopoulos ‚Äústatement of offense‚Äù that Quote: d from emails sent on May 4, 2016 and Aug. 15, 2016.
In the May 4 email, Papadopoulos wrote to others on the Trump campaign that Russia ‚Äúhas been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me to discuss.‚Äù
Mueller‚Äôs team Quote: d from an email response from Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Quote: : ‚ÄúWe need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.‚Äù
Numerous news outlets reported that the passage showed that Manafort wanted a low-level campaign adviser to meet with Russians. But Grassley said that other emails sent by Manafort‚Äôs deputy, Rick Gates, show that he was asserting that a low-level adviser should be the person to reject requests to meet with Russians.
‚ÄúAgree. What if I get our correspondence coordinator to do it. This is the person responding to all mail of non-importance. It would be a general letter,‚Äù Gates wrote.
Manafort replied: ‚Äúgood.‚Äù
Grassley also faulted Mueller‚Äôs team for misrepresenting email exchanges involving Sam Clovis, another Trump campaign official.
The statement of offense Quote: d from an Aug. 15, 2016 email in which a campaign supervisor, later identified as Clovis, told Papadopoulos that ‚ÄúI would encourage you‚Äù to ‚Äúmake the trip, if it is feasible.‚Äù
But Grassley said the rest of the email makes clear that Papadopoulos asked Clovis to join him on conversations with representatives from several foreign governments, including ‚Äúthe UK, Greek, Italian and even Russian government.‚Äù
Clovis declined the invitation and wrote in other emails that any potential meetings with Russians would have to follow meetings first with Western allies.
‚ÄúMy thought is that we probably should not go forward with any meetings with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO allies, especially France, Germany and Great Britain,‚Äù wrote Clovis. ‚ÄúWe need to reassure our allies that we are not going to advance anything with Russia until we have everyone on the same page.‚Äù
Grassley also suggested that Mueller‚Äôs inaccurate statement led Clovis to withdraw his name from consideration to a top Department of Agriculture post.

Chicago Police Union Announces Vote of No Confidence in Kim Foxx After Jussie Smollett Charges Dropped,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/chicago-police-union-announces-vote-of-no-confidence-in-kim-foxx-after-jussie-smollett-charges-dropped/ ,"by Evie Fordham
Chicago‚Äôs police union and a group of suburban chiefs demanded Thursday that Cook County State‚Äôs Attorney Kim Foxx resign after prosecutors dropped charges against actor and alleged hate crime hoax perpetrator Jussie Smollett.
Duane Mellema, head of the North Suburban Association of Chiefs of Police, said the chiefs voted unanimously to declare they had ‚Äúno confidence‚Äù in Foxx, reported The Chicago Sun-Times . His organization represents more than 30 departments.
The Smollett case did not start the discontent for the police chiefs, but instead became a symbol of the problems they had with Foxx.
‚ÄúOur officers must explain your decisions not to prosecute to our local victims,‚Äù Mellema said. He also called the Smollett case ‚Äúthe straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back,‚Äù according to The Chicago Sun-Times.
Chicago Fraternal Order of Police president Kevin Graham also said the decision was about more than just the Smollett case.
‚ÄúThis is about many cases in the Cook County system that have gone un-prosecuted, or having charges reduced,‚Äù Graham said.
Foxx‚Äôs office responded by saying the police chiefs were resistant to the way her office prioritizes resources to fight crime.
Chicago police chiefs were not only angered that charges against Smollett were dropped. They said Foxx‚Äôs office also did not notify them, according to Townhall.com . Many of them are also upset Foxx‚Äôs office does not necessarily prosecute people charged for shoplifting or marijuana-related crimes, reported The Chicago Sun-Times.
The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police joined a group of protesters outside Foxx‚Äôs office in Chicago on Monday over the decision to drop charges against Smollett.

"Hiring Rebounds as US Employers Add a Solid 196,000 Jobs",tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/hiring-rebounds-as-us-employers-add-a-solid-196000-jobs/ ,"Hiring in the United States rebounded in March as U.S. employers added a solid 196,000 jobs, up sharply from February‚Äôs scant gain and evidence that many businesses still want to hire despite signs that the economy is slowing.
The unemployment rate remained at 3.8 percent, near the lowest level in almost 50 years, the Labor Department reported Friday. Wage growth slowed a bit in March, with average hourly pay increasing 3.2 percent from a year earlier. That was down from February‚Äôs year-over-year gain of 3.4 percent, which was the best in a decade.
The employment figures reported Friday by the government suggest that February‚Äôs anemic job growth ‚Äî revised to 33,000, from an initial 20,000 ‚Äî was merely a temporary blip and that businesses are confident the economy remains on a firm footing. Even with the current expansion nearly 10 years old, the U.S. economy is demonstrating its resilience.
At the same time, the economy is facing several challenges, from cautious consumers to slower growth in business investment to a U.S.-China trade war that is contributing to a weakening global economy.
Stock futures rallied after Friday‚Äôs jobs data was released at 8:30 a.m. and bond prices rose as well, with yields slipping.
So far this year, U.S. job gains have averaged 180,000 a month, easily enough to lower the unemployment rate over time, though down from a 223,000 monthly average last year.
Last month, job growth was strongest in the service sector. Health care added 47,000 jobs, restaurants and bars 27,000 and professional and business services, which includes such high-paying fields as engineering and accounting, 37,000.
Manufacturers cut 6,000 jobs, marking their first decline in a year and a half. The weakness stemmed from a sharp drop in employment at automakers, likely reflecting layoffs by General Motors. Construction firms added 16,000.
The overall economy is sending mixed signals. Most indicators suggest slower growth this year compared with 2018. That would mean hiring might also weaken from last year‚Äôs strong pace.
Consumers have shown caution so far this year. Retail sales fell in February, and a broader measure of consumer spending slipped in January, potentially reflecting a waning effect of the Trump administration‚Äôs tax cuts. Businesses have also reined in their spending on industrial machinery and other equipment and on factories and other buildings.
And in Europe and Asia, weaker economies have reduced demand for U.S. exports. Europe is on the brink of recession, with its factories shrinking in March at the fastest pace in six years, according to a private survey.
The U.S. trade war with China has weighed on the Chinese economy, which has hurt Southeast Asian nations that ship electronic components and other goods that are assembled into consumer products in China‚Äôs factories.
Economists now forecast that the U.S. economy will expand roughly 2 percent to 2.5 percent this year, down from 2.9 percent last year.
Some positive signs for the economy have emerged in recent weeks: Sales of both new and existing homes rose in February after declining last year. More Americans are applying for mortgages now that rates have fallen.
And some of the weakness in spending earlier this year likely reflected delays in issuing tax refunds because of the government shutdown. Refunds largely caught up with their pace in previous years in March, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, suggesting that spending may as well.

PAC Behind Ocasio-Cortez's Rise Challenges Democratic Leadership with DCCC Blacklist Launch,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/pac-behind-ocasio-cortezs-rise-challenges-democratic-leadership-with-dccc-blacklist-launch/ ,"by Evie Fordham
The progressive PAC credited with Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs rise is launching its own infrastructure to raise funds for primary challengers because of a new anti-challenger policy from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).
‚ÄúWe just launched DCCCBlacklist.com because it‚Äôs time to stand up to the DCCC‚Äôs bullying of the progressive movement. The movement is building a network of alternative infrastructure to help progressive primary candidates like AOC and Ayanna Pressley win their next race,‚Äù the Justice Democrats wrote on Twitter Thursday evening.
Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeted March 30 to criticize the DCCC‚Äôs decision to not contract with consultants working with challengers to Democratic incumbents, reported The Hill . The two representatives followed similar paths to victory by defeating incumbents with roughly two decades‚Äô experience apiece: Ocasio-Cortez knocked out Joe Crowley , and Pressley knocked out Michael Capuano.
‚ÄúThe DCCC‚Äôs new rule to blacklist [and] boycott anyone who does business [with] primary challengers is extremely divisive [and] harmful to the party. My recommendation, if you‚Äôre a small-dollar donor: pause your donations to DCCC [and] give directly to swing candidates instead,‚Äù Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter March 30.
The @DCCC ‚Äôs new rule to blacklist+boycott anyone who does business w/ primary challengers is extremely divisive & harmful to the party.
My recommendation, if you‚Äôre a small-dollar donor: pause your donations to DCCC & give directly to swing candidates instead.
Some great ones:
‚Äî Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 30, 2019
A DCCC spokesman defended committee chair and Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos and the policy in a statement to The Hill when the fallout began.
‚ÄúWhen Chairwoman Bustos was running to lead the DCCC, she stood up in front of her colleagues and made a promise to stand with and protect every Member of the most diverse caucus in Congressional history as we work to defend and grow our Democratic majority. ‚Ä¶ This transparent policy follows through on that exact promise and will protect all Members of the Democratic Caucus ‚Äì regardless of where they fall within our big tent,‚Äù Cole Leiter told The Hill in a March 30 story.
Some Democratic consultants believe the blacklisting policy is not totally new and is merely verbalizing a formerly unwritten rule, reported Roll Call.
The Justice Democrats have been a lightning rod for controversy lately. A conservative group filed a 21-count Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint against Ocasio-Cortez Wednesday claiming her unreported affiliation with the political action committee during her 2018 primary campaign violated campaign finance rules.

Carlson noted 2020 candidates Pete Buttigieg and Beto O‚ÄôRourke having to walk back past statements despite being true.
‚ÄúHow do you know if you‚Äôre living in a free society?‚Äù Carlson said. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a quick test: Are you allowed to say obviously true things in public, or are you forced to lie? As George Orwell put it in ‚Äò1984‚Äô: ‚ÄòFreedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.‚Äô But what if that freedom isn‚Äôt granted? What if you‚Äôre required to repeat things that you know aren‚Äôt true. What if everyone that hears you knows perfectly well that you‚Äôre lying but can‚Äôt say so out loud? What if everyone is required to nod along in mock sincerity as if it‚Äôs all completely real? That‚Äôs what a pep rally in a police state looks like.‚Äù
Later in the segment, Carlson summed up the left‚Äôs ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù grip on dialogue as ‚Äúwoke fascism‚Äù and likened the lies that grip forces to those lies of some authoritarian regimes.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing liberal about any of this, obviously,‚Äù Carlson said. ‚ÄúIt is purely authoritarian ‚Äì woke fascism, power over ideas ‚Äì in place of thinking, obedience. In return for dissent, punishment, lying as an official policy. And not just conventional lying ‚Äì the ordinary truth-shading of everyday life ‚Äì but terrifying full-inversion lies, the exact opposite of the truth. The kind of lies that regimes that seek total control must tell in order to maintain their power.‚Äù

Donald Trump likes to boast he‚Äôs a great businessman. But one part of his reputation as a wheeler and dealer is not so grand: He can be stingy when it comes to paying his bills. Of course, there are his bankruptcies, and he has bragged about forcing bankers to take haircuts on the money he owes them. USA Today this week reported that it ‚Äúfound hundreds of people‚Äîcarpenters, dishwashers, painters, even his own lawyers‚Äîwho say he didn‚Äôt pay them for their work.‚Äù And some years ago, an 82-year-old Latvian immigrant named Nicolas Jacobsen learned the hard way about Trump‚Äôs penchant to squeeze folks when it‚Äôs time to settle up.
The saga began in 2004, when Trump was sprucing up his private Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, ahead of his January 22, 2005, wedding to his third wife-to-be, Melania. His upgrades included the purchase of three crystal chandeliers from Jacobsen‚Äôs West Palm Beach business, Classic Chandeliers, which specialized in expensive replicas of chandeliers that hung in Versailles or Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs palace.
The price tag for the chandeliers was more than $68,000, but Jacobsen offered to sell them to Trump for $34,000. Jacobsen claimed Trump did not want to pay the sales taxes on the sale but eventually relented; Trump ultimately paid nearly $17,000 as a deposit . Jacobsen installed the chandeliers in the entryway and two bathrooms in the resort‚Äôs new 20,000-square-foot ballroom, which Trump had built in advance of his star-studded wedding, where many of the wedding vendors reportedly provided their services gratis, hoping for a boost from the extra publicity. (The New York Times even reported that Trump got Melania‚Äôs 13-carat diamond ring for half-price.)
After the wedding, Jacobsen repeatedly tried to get Trump and the resort to pay the remaining $17,000 owed to him. But the tycoon would not settle up. So Jacobsen took his story of being stiffed by Trump to the Palm Beach Post . After the article ran‚Äîit was headlined, ‚ÄúThe Big ‚ÄòI Do‚Äô Leaves Some Dues and Don‚Äôts‚Äù‚ÄîTrump berated the columnist who wrote it by phone, insisting that he hadn‚Äôt paid the bill because Jacobsen had done a poor job installing the chandeliers. As the columnist subsequently reported:
‚ÄúYou want a story?‚Äù Trump yelled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a story. This guy (Jacobsen) did a terrible, terrible job. He was late with the chandeliers. He didn‚Äôt have the proper equipment to install them. His bills were too high. He had to use my people to install them. We‚Äôre going to end up in court because he‚Äôs just trying to get free publicity. I‚Äôm not going to pay him what I owe him. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not paying.‚Äù
Jacobsen denied Trump‚Äôs claim of shoddy work, saying, ‚ÄúMr. Trump wants to belittle me‚Ä¶That‚Äôs his style. He is 58. When is he going to grow up? I will collect, one way or another.‚Äù Jacobsen subsequently told the New York Daily News that, after his story had appeared in the Post, he received 22 calls from merchants who claimed Trump had ‚Äústiffed [them] in the past. He can‚Äôt get anybody to work for him.‚Äù
The day that story ran, February 2, 2005, Mar-a-Lago asked the local sheriff to serve Jacobsen with a civil suit against his company for breach of contract, alleging that Jacobsen had failed to properly install the chandeliers and that the resort had to hire an electrician to do all the work. And on February 3, one of Trump‚Äôs lawyers, John Marion IV, sent Jacobsen a letter threatening to bring a libel suit against him over his comments to the Daily News. He demanded that Jacobsen turn over the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the 22 merchants who had called him. The lawyer accused Jacobsen of being a ‚Äúpublicity hound‚Äù who‚Äôd ‚Äúmade this up.‚Äù
Marion continued to pressure Jacobsen, and on February 11, he reiterated Trump‚Äôs intention to file a libel suit. But, he told Jacobsen, the chandelier store owner could end his legal tangle with Trump if he‚Äôd do one of two things: take back the chandeliers and refund Trump‚Äôs money, or accept half the remaining amount owed on the bill and write a letter apologizing to Trump for his comments in the media and saying he‚Äôd lied about Trump‚Äôs desire to dodge sales taxes. Marion also demanded that Jacobsen state in his letter that he ‚Äúnever told anyone at the newspaper that 22 people had called and told you that Mr. Trump had stiffed them.‚Äù
According to legal filings in the case, Jacobsen (who died last year) initially agreed to accept half of what was owed to him and sign the apology letter (Trump‚Äôs lawyer helpfully wrote a draft for him), rather than face Trump‚Äôs legal army. He wasn‚Äôt fluent in English and had no lawyer at that point. But Jacobsen changed his mind, according legal filings, primarily because ‚Äúthe proposed apology letter would have had [him] lie‚Äù about Trump‚Äôs behavior and because he‚Äôd gotten many calls from newspaper readers urging him to fight the case. After getting legal representation, Jacobsen countersued Trump for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, calling Trump and Mar-a-Lago‚Äôs lawsuit ‚Äúnothing but fabricated allegations, falsehoods and outright lies‚Äù and an attempt to use the court system to avoid ‚Äúpaying what they owe.‚Äù
The dispute dragged on for months in court, until the case went to mediation and finally settled in early 2007. Ronald Jones, who represented Jacobsen, said his client ended up getting about a third of what he was owed. ‚ÄúMy client [was] just a small businessman. No big corporation. He just didn‚Äôt have the money to fight Mr. Trump,‚Äù Jones told Mother Jones, adding that Trump‚Äôs behavior in the chandelier case is apparently ‚Äúhis modus operandi.‚Äù
The chandelier episode is far from an outlier. Trump is well known for forcing workers, vendors, and small businesspeople he does business with to take haircuts on what he owes them , sometimes with legal threats, a practice known as ‚Äúthe Trump discount,‚Äù one aggrieved contractor told the Economist . Trump brags that he always gets the best deals, and he has vowed to bring his aggressive deal-making style to the White House. But his slash-and-burn approach doesn‚Äôt always work, particularly against people with the means to fight back.
William Scherer, a prominent Fort Lauderdale lawyer and GOP fundraiser who had represented Trump in a legal matter, told the Sun-Sentinel last year that Trump is a ‚Äúdeadbeat.‚Äù (Scherer isn‚Äôt the first critic t o use such a term for Trump.) In 1994, Scherer took Trump to small-claims court to get him to pay a $5,000 bill he owed. Scherer told Reuters that he‚Äôd already cut his rate for Trump, but after the matter was resolved, Trump‚Äôs reps called him and wanted to cut the outstanding bill ‚Äúfrom small potatoes to smaller potatoes‚Ä¶I wouldn‚Äôt go for it.‚Äù Scherer told the paper he won his full bill, plus court costs.
The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. But, when asked by USA Today about various episodes in which he has been accused of stiffing people, Trump was unapologetic. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say that they do a job that‚Äôs not good, or a job that they didn‚Äôt finish, or a job that was way late,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll deduct from their contract, absolutely. That‚Äôs what the country should be doing.‚Äù

"Canadian Warming, Calving Ice Sheets, Shrinking Glaciers, Dolphins Not Getting It On as Climate Warming Continues",globalwarmingisreal.com,Andrew Burger,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://globalwarmingisreal.com/2019/04/05/canadian-warming-calving-ice-sheets-shrinking-glaciers-warming-seas/,"By Andrew Burger ¬∑ Comments (0) ¬∑ Friday , April 5 th , 2019
Sobering, unsettling, and at times startling climate change-related news emerged this past week around the world. Tourists in Iceland ran for their lives as the wall of a glacier they had come to see collapsed and dropped into a bay propagating a huge wave that traveled quickly towards the rocky shore where they were standing. Scientists conducting a long-term study in Shark Bay, Australia find that dolphins‚Äô reproductive capacity diminishes and they‚Äôre having fewer young because of heat waves and warming ocean waters. Part of Antarctica‚Äôs Brunt Ice Shelf reportedly about twice the size of New York City is about to break off, or calve, creating a giant iceberg. Canada‚Äôs climate is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the world on average and it is having effects across the economy, society, and the environment. Tourists flee as part of a glacier drops into the sea
Fortunately for a group of tourists, an expert guide was accompanying them when they visited Iceland‚Äôs Breidamerkurjokull glacier recently. A huge chunk of the glacier‚Äôs wall broke off and dropped into the sea as they were watching, creating a series of huge waves that rapidly moved to the shoreline where they were standing. No one was injured.
Air and water temperatures are rising much faster at high latitudes on average than they are at lower ones and Iceland‚Äôs 269 named glaciers are thinning and disappearing. Iceland‚Äôs Okjokull glacier shrunk to the point where it has been considered dead ice ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt moving or creating new ice ‚Äî since 2014, but it wasn‚Äôt the first, according to a post from The Reykjavik Grapevine .
‚ÄúOk is the largest named glacier to officially disappear,‚Äù the head of the Vedurstofa glacier research team was quoted. ‚ÄúSome snow patches remain, but a glacier is by definition a mass of ice so heavy that it flows under its own weight, and has some dynamics. The patches around Ok have become so thin that they sit there without movement, and therefore no longer qualify as a glacier.‚Äù
Rapid ice thinning of Iceland‚Äôs glaciers became near universal in the mid-1990s, the report highlights. ‚ÄúAn overwhelming majority of Iceland‚Äôs glaciers are decreasing in volume almost every year,‚Äù the report says. Shark Bay Dolphins aren‚Äôt doing well as waters warm
Dolphins in Australia‚Äôs Shark Bay are giving birth to fewer young over at least a 10-year period, from 2007 to 2017, according to research scientists conducting the long-term study. The researchers discovered the persistence of low birth rates and other anomalous reproductive developments by chance after noticing that Shark Bay dolphins were giving birth to fewer young after a heat wave struck in 2011.
The water temperature in Shark Bay rose about 4 degrees Celsius (~39 degrees F) above the annual average and the survival rate for some species of dolphin dropped 12 percent, according to the study. The dolphins also gave birth to fewer calves.
The scientists haven‚Äôt pinpointed the cause or causes of the dolphins‚Äô survival and birth rates. They noticed that warming waters have killed off seagrass in Shark Bay, which provides habitat and a source of food and nutrition for many and varied marine species, including those that the dolphins rely on, however.
‚ÄúOnce we realized that the 2011 warm water event had such devastating consequences on the seagrass beds in Shark Bay, we wondered whether [animals] on top of the food chain might also be affected,‚Äù study author and director of the Dept. of Anthropology at the University of Zurich Michael Kr√ºtzen was quoted.
What was a surprise, he said, was that even six or seven years after the heat wave, there was still ‚Äúno clear sign that things were back to normal ‚Äî survival and reproduction were still lower, so these short-term effects have long-term consequences on marine megafauna.‚Äù Converging rifts in Antarctica‚Äôs Brunt Ice Shelf
A rift in Antarctica‚Äôs Brunt Ice Shelf has lengthened 200 meters (>650 ft) in the past month and it‚Äôs converging with another rift near to a research facility run by the British Antarctic Survey. The convergence of the two rifts is a sure sign of calving, the process by which part of an ice shelf separates from the main body of the ice sheet to create an iceberg, according to a news report .
Calving is a natural process for ice shelves but a large and growing body of evidence indicates warming ocean temperatures are accelerating the process. More than 3.3 million tons of Antarctic ice has melted since 1992, according to a 2018 study, the news report points out.
‚ÄúThere have been a number of published studies that show there are ice shelves that are thinning,‚Äù Christoper Shuman, a research scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County‚Äôs Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology at NASA‚Äôs Goddard Flight Center, was quoted as saying.
‚ÄúThey are still getting snow on top of them, but they‚Äôre getting warmed and melted from below, which happens when the ocean waters around Antarctica become warmer.‚Äù A fast-warming Canada
Average mean temperatures in Canada has risen an estimated 1.7 degrees Celsius (3¬∞F) since 1948, twice as fast the global average, according to the latest climate report from the federal government. Temperatures in the Canadian Arctic have been rising the fastest and the effects of nationwide climate warming are probably irreversible and likely to intensify a news report highlights.
Annual average temperatures have increased by some 2.3¬∞C (~4.1¬∞F) in northern Canada. Temperatures in Canada‚Äôs Prairies and northern British Columbia have also been experiencing increases in average mean annual temperatures higher than the national average.
Both natural and human factors contribute to rising temperatures, but the human factor dominates, according to the study.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely that more than half the observed warming in Canada is due to the influence of human activities,‚Äù the report authors state.
Canada‚Äôs federal government is taking steps to strengthen and expand its climate change policies and actions. It recently imposed carbon taxes on four Canadian provinces (out of 10) that haven‚Äôt introduced their own climate change action plans, the news report points out.
An initial federal carbon tax of C$0.044 (US$0.036) per liter of fuel sold is being added to sales in Manitoba, New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. The federal government will compensate households with rebates to offset the higher retail fuel costs, according to the news report.

What‚Äôs in a name?
Quite a lot if you are a Japanese citizen Monday learning that the fresh emperor era will be called Reiwa. Get alerts:
It‚Äôs a proclamation that has occurred in nearly a century. Reiwa will follow Emperor Naruhito, following his May 1 investiture and beyond, getting his official name after death. An age name is an inextricable part of life that is public and shared memory in Japan. A whole lot of what happens in the years to include ‚Äî natural disasters, deaths, births, societal and cultural phenomena, election, glory and political scandal ‚Äî will likely be connected to the era name.
As such, the closing days of the current Heisei era, which is what retiring Emperor Akihito‚Äôs 30-year reign was predicted, have prompted a collective bout of nostalgia, soul-searching and occasional goofiness, as many Japanese reflect on both Heisei and also this new block of decades connected to Reiwa which will loom over a massive portion of their lives.
Teens fielded questions since the bunch of Heisei sluggers at the hallowed high school baseball tournament about their feelings. TV quiz shows analyzed contestants‚Äô Heisei knowledge. When Chief Cabinet Minister Yoshihide Suga appeared before cameras Monday to reveal a card using calligraphy of the name Reiwa onto 30, dolls were created to mimic the moment. A luxury Tokyo restaurant has unveiled a 900 wagyu hamburger.
Reiwa was an top-secret committee that pored to obtain what they believed to be the perfect two characters to spell out the next several decades‚Äô choice. The process, such as the imperial system itself, is steeped in bureaucracy and ritual and also opaque, vaguely mysterious.
What they settled on, nonetheless ‚Äî Reiwa ‚Äî can affect everything to train tickets to computer software to government records, creating a windfall for programmers and printers when they give a name into the foreseeable future of Japan.
‚ÄúThe age names take this weight together they have this sense of specifying a period,‚Äù said Daniel Sneider, a Japan specialist and lecturer at Stanford University.
Since Heisei ends,‚Äùwhat‚Äôs imbued with this excess meaning. It is the last cherry blossom season of the Heisei era. And I am sure it will be true when another era starts: It will be the first of what during this upcoming majestic age,‚Äù explained Sneider, that has been seeing and residing in Japan off and on since 1954. ‚ÄúJapanese lifestyle is filled with these combinations of heritage and modernity that a number of people used to find bothersome‚Ä¶ but this insistence on adhering to tradition is the thing that distinguishes Japan from other societies.‚Äù
In a lot of the West the years are utilised to catch the spirit of a time ‚Äî that the Swinging ‚Äô60s. Japan‚Äôs age system is somewhat more like a version of the way monarchs lent their names into an entire sweep of years ‚Äî the Victorian Age, for instance.
The power of an emperor was once showcased by the age title, but together with the disappearance of real imperial strength after the war, it‚Äôs lost much of its authority, stated an associate professor of sociology at Toyo University, Hirohito Suzuki.
‚ÄúIt has become something people can casually talk about, and just a subject on television quiz shows,‚Äù he explained. Many younger Japanese are more used to the western calendar and thus tend to see the age name as clumsy, although some see the convention as part of‚Äùtrendy Japan,‚Äù he explained.
The wave of enthusiasm for nostalgia and the new name for the evaporating age is in part because these modifications of the protector are infrequent.
The last man was in 1989 that took power. His Showa age was followed by his son Akihito‚Äôs Heisei era, that will come to an end with an abdication ‚Äî most emperors rule until departure ‚Äî which ushers in Naruhito on May 1.
Each era carries its memories and taste.
The Taisho age ‚Äî 1912 to 1926 ‚Äî for example, was indicated by an opening of society called.
Japanese often keep in mind the Showa era for a period of tumult that is extraordinary: The country moved from democracy to militarism and colonial growth, pursuing a war of aggression that killed millions and left from a bitterness that is still felt in much of Asia. Following the destruction of the war, the country then emerged out of U.S. occupation as a democratic success story as well as from the 1980s, a planet economic titan.
Heisei, meanwhile, watched a crumbling of life employment, a downturn, and an easing of inherent military limitations. Foreigners and women have joined the workforce in far greater numbers, although frequently not in positions, and, as the country rapidly ages and birthrates plunge, a growing number of young people have fled on the farms to get stuffed cities.
‚ÄúLots of things have changed in the past 30 years, things that would have been hard to envision‚Äù at the start of the Heisei era, said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. It is only natural, he said, that the nation attempts to set the final of this era in circumstance.
‚ÄúIn all countries there are certain rituals of identity and belonging and nationalism that are important for people, and the emperor is a symbol of who (the Japanese) are as a people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEspecially when you‚Äôre facing troubled times, that becomes even more significant.‚Äù
