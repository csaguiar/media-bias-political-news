It is amazing, and like no other movie ever made. You will never forget it. It is a riveting, touching true story. I actually have trouble sitting still for long periods of time. If I am watching TV at home, I will usually get up and walk around after about 20 minutes, so watching a movie in a movie theater is usually hard for me. Not this one! The time flew by, and I was never one bit restless, because the true story was so good."

They set the table for the elitist and infallible attitude MSM/journalism has today. There is no doubt information back then was ""edited"" to push what CBS, NBC, ABC etc wanted you to know. I don't disagree with you at all. I merely point out that today's journalists want the unquestioned recognition and fame the Cronkite types had back then. Many modern journalists act as if power automatically comes with the title, journalist. Politicians learned to use television as a messaging service in the 60's starting the downward slide of news print and the elevation of TV personalities (telling not reporting) controlling the information flow. It was the beginning of a corrupt relationship between the ""new"" media called TV and the ""modern"" politician."

and subjective opinion. If people read or watch an opinion piece,
they know they are seeing a point of view.
The corporate mass media, however, used to claim objectivity, except in its defined ""editorials.""
There is a place for both, but today's mass media mislabels
its leftist activism as objective reporting. They slant what
they advertise as objective both in how the information is presented, and in what they do or do not choose to allow their
audience to discover.
And they hope no one notices.
People do notice, and the mass media will never regain the
credibility it has lost. People hate to be lied to, either through commission or omission.
People demand all the facts and differing points of view, to
then be able to think and decide for themselves. That is why
they flock to new media sites like Breitbart."
