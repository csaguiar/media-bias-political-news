'SNL' brings back Jason Sudeikis' Joe Biden for sensitivity training - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Frank Pallotta,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/media/snl-sudeikis-biden/index.html,"New York (CNN) Former cast member Jason Sudeikis returned to ""Saturday Night Live"" to reprise one of his most memorable characters: former Vice President Joe Biden.
Sudeikis' Biden returned to the NBC variety show to kick off Saturday night's episode by taking sensitivity training, even though he thought he was there to talk about his March Madness bracket. ""I know I had Delaware winning the whole thing, even though they didn't make the tournament this year, but hey it's better than last year when I picked Amtrak, right?"" he said. Kenan Thompson's adviser character informed the fake Biden that it was about the ""touchy, feely stuff."" The sketch follows allegations that the real-life Biden made women feel uncomfortable with the way he touched them. ""I'm a hugger, I'm a kisser and a little bit of a sniffer,"" Sudeikis' Biden said. ""But the last thing I want to do is offend anyone."" Read More A consultant who handles sensitivity training, played by Kate McKinnon, then came in to help fix Biden's behavior. ""Great to meet you,"" Sudeikis' Biden said up close and nose-to-nose with the female consultant. ""Yeah, so this is exactly the kind of thing I'm here to prevent,"" McKinnon's consultant told the fake Biden. Sudeikis' Biden then played soul singer Lou Rawls to help bring in some ""vibes"" and build a ""human connection."" ""Mr. Vice President, let's discuss how to properly greet a woman,"" McKinnon's consultant said.

Aviation world faces moment of reckoning after 737 MAX crashes - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Gregory Wallace,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/boeing-aviation-737-max-aftereffects/index.html,"(CNN) It was a moment the aviation world had been waiting for since a second deadly crash grounded the 737 MAX fleet: Boeing gathered hundreds of pilots, airline executives, and regulators to unveil a fix that would return the jetliner to the sky.
""Every time something happens ... we learn from it,"" a senior Boeing official told reporters, reflecting on lessons from the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, less than five months apart, that had killed nearly 350 people. ""There are one-off occurrences that happen -- accidents like we've just experienced."" In the week-plus since that announcement, it has become increasingly clear that the two accidents were not unfortunate ""one-off occurrences,"" the software change Boeing touted would not be enough, and the industry is facing a serious test of its mettle. The challenges of crafting deeper, more expensive fixes, addressing structural deficiencies in the certification process, and reassuring shaken fliers around the world have become more apparent. Boeing has said that its software change needs additional weeks of work, and has seemed to accept some responsibility for designing a system in need of improvement. Fueled in part by damning preliminary reports that show how starkly similar the two crashes were, the moment of reckoning is challenging corporations, regulators, and investigators to take a critical look at the design and inspection of aircraft, and question whether decisions and long-standing methods -- employed for practical reasons -- put the flying public at risk. Read More ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday. ""We own it and we know how to do it."" His comments in a Boeing video followed the Ethiopian government's preliminary report describing the pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 struggling on the morning of March 10 to control their 737 MAX 8 during the six-minute ill-fated flight. According to Ethiopian crash investigators, the pilots correctly followed procedures publicized after the Lion Air accident in October to disable a faulty computerized stabilization system that Boeing created to prevent planes from crashing, but the plane's speed and the clock worked against their efforts. Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and a CNN aviation analyst, said he sees evidence Boeing is now no longer primarily focused on returning the MAX to the skies, but is working on regaining public trust in its latest, most fuel-efficient version of the workhorse jet that airlines had been lining up to buy. ""I think clearly it has got through to Boeing,"" Goelz said. The Ethiopian report contained two recommendations: First, that Boeing develop a remedy, and second, a call that regulators scrutinize the fix ""before the release of the aircraft to operations."" Questions of trust lay with the Federal Aviation Administration, which has faced concerns from lawmakers of excessive coziness with Boeing. Due to the company's broad aerospace portfolio, the federal government is both the regulator of Boeing and hires it for sensitive military contracts and complicated space operations. The world's most famous aircraft, Air Force One, is, after all, a Boeing jet. The FAA, created with the dual mission of regulating and promoting the aviation industry, has defended its decision to keep the 737 MAX flying while other aviation authorities around the world ordered it grounded. Acting Administrator Daniel Elwell bristled when members of Congress asked him why other countries had acted sooner by proactively pulling it from service. Elwell defended the US and Canadian authorities as awaiting evidence, calling them ""the first countries to ground the aircraft with data."" The FAA's decisions have ""shaken"" confidence in the FAA, the ""gold standard for aviation safety,"" said Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel. While Ethiopian and Indonesian investigators continue to probe the circumstances of those crashes, multiple investigations in the United States are casting a wide net. A long-standing practice that has allowed both plane- and part-makers to certify their own work as meeting airworthiness standards is coming under scrutiny. House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio said he has ""many serious questions surrounding the Boeing 737 MAX and the FAA's certification process."" He said the inspector general has opened a probe, and a special DOT advisory committee will review ""the procedures ... for the certification of new aircraft."" Prosecutors with the Justice Department have subpoenaed documents, including from former Boeing employees. The FAA has formed its own international review into ""the 737 MAX automated flight control system."" For all the reviews, some are wondering what will change. When the public's attention moves on, the FAA will still be left with a mandate to delegate some certification decisions to the manufacturers, former FAA chief of staff Michael Goldfarb told CNN. It's one thing, he said, for Congress to criticize the system it put into law, but another for it to fund enough FAA inspectors to oversee manufacturer decisions. ""It's been hard for the agency (FAA) to keep pace with pay"" in private industry, Goldfarb said. The NTSB, with power to recommend safety changes but not require them, is reviewing the organizational delegation authority, Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Friday. ""We would not really be doing our job if we weren't making sure that those aspects were being looked at,"" Sumwalt said. He said the board has the power to make conclusions separate from the Ethiopian and Indonesian investigations, of which it is a part. Goldfarb said the FAA and its worldwide counterparts would be smart to assemble for a ""regulatory summit"" to evaluate the 737 MAX before it returns to service. Confidence in the agency has been hurt since its delayed decision to ground the MAX, he said. Goelz, the former NTSB leader, sees signs -- in Boeing's latest comments and the decision to put more work into the software change -- that Boeing and FAA are moving in the right direction. ""I think the top priority is to make sure that this aircraft is 100% safe, secondly to make sure that the pilots who fly it have the information and the skills to fly it safely even in difficult situations,"" Goelz said. ""Then thirdly to convince the public -- prove to the public that they've done everything in their power to make this safe again."" Convincing the flying public may be the most difficult task of all. Among the defenders of the MAX were the pilots who flew them -- who, in some cases, reacted to the Ethiopian report by calling for additional review of what went wrong. ""In the wake of the tragic loss of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on Sunday, people around the world are jumping to conclusions about the Boeing 737 Max,"" the Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots of American Airlines, said on Thursday afternoon. ""Federal and international authorities have just begun to look into Sunday's accident. It is too early to determine possible causes."" And then there's those who sit behind the pilots. In the weeks ahead, travelers will need to decide if they are comfortable walking onto a 737 MAX, buckling up, and taking off."
Where's the real Timmothy Pitzen? A week of hope and heartbreak leaves many questions unanswered - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Holly Yan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/timmothy-pitzen-case-lingering-questions/index.html,"(CNN) Timmothy Pitzen's family, still grappling with the child's disappearance and his mother's suicide, just suffered a painful roller coaster of emotions -- all because of an imposter's prank.
Why did this happen? And where does the search for Timmothy go now? As more details emerge, many questions linger. But there's one silver lining to this hoax that has gripped the country. Timmothy Pitzen disappeared when he was 6. He's still missing and would be 14 years old now. Why did a man claim to be Timmothy? When Brian Michael Rini drifted into a Kentucky neighborhood claiming to be Timmothy, he ignited hope that the boy, who vanished at age 6 after his mother killed herself , was found alive and well after almost eight years. Read More What we know about Brian Michael Rini But a DNA test showed Rini was an imposter. Now he faces charges of making false statements to federal agents and could face up to eight years in prison. Rini has a history of using other people's identities, his brother Jonathon said. The suspect learned about Timmothy's case after watching a story about him on ABC's ""20/20,"" according to a criminal complaint and affidavit. The affidavit also said Rini ""wanted to get away from his own family. When questioned further, Rini stated he wished he had a father like Timmothy's because if he went missing, his father would just keep drinking."" Why would someone claim to be a missing child? Jonathon Rini told CNN's ""New Day"" that his brother had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and bipolar disorder. ""Still, he should have the rational thinking to not do something like this,"" he said. What happens to the search for Timmothy now? It'll keep going, but authorities are back to square one in trying to figure out where Timmothy is. Man who claimed to be Timmothy Pitzen faces federal charges ""To be clear, law enforcement has not and will not forget Timmothy, and we hope to one day reunite him with his family,"" the FBI's office in Louisville said. In Timmothy's hometown of Aurora, Illinois, a brief rush of excitement gave way to disappointment and resolve. ""Although we are disappointed that this turned out to be a hoax, we remain diligent in our search for Timmothy, as our missing person's case remains unsolved,"" Aurora police Sgt. Bill Rowley said. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children still has Timmothy's profile online, including an age progression photo showing what the boy might look like as a teenager. Timmohy Pitzen, shown before his 2011 disappearance, and an age progression photo showing what he might look like as a teen ""For eight long years, Timmothy's family has never given up hope that he will be found,"" the nonprofit said. ""We will keep working to make sure this happens."" Who is Timmothy with? This remains a huge mystery, as his mother left only a vague and cryptic clue before she died. In May 2011, when Timmothy was 6, his mother Amy Fry-Pitzen checked him out of his elementary school. They went on a road trip, stopping at a zoo and a Wisconsin water park.

This off-Broadway show hilariously explores what it means to be Puerto Rican and American - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Maria Santana, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/entertainment/elizardi-castro-made-in-puerto-rico/index.html,"(CNN) Lately it seems everyone -- including the President -- is confused about Puerto Rico.
It's not a country. It's not a state. The residents speak Spanish and have their own culture, but are also American citizens. What gives? It's a question comedian Elizardi Castro tackles head-on in ""Made in Puerto Rico,"" an off-Broadway show running at New York's Puerto Rican Traveling Theater. Although Castro developed the one-man show more than a decade ago, it has never been more relevant. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump complained on Twitter that all Puerto Rican politicians do is ""complain & ask for more money"" to rebuild after the devastation of Hurricane Maria, which struck the island in 2017. Trump called the politicians ""grossly incompetent,"" said they ""spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from the USA."" Read More Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, & all their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019 Trump's remarks came amid a bitter feud with Puerto Rican officials over disaster relief efforts. The week before, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said he would "" punch the bully in the mouth ."" While defending Trump against backlash on MSNBC, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley referred to Puerto Rico as ""that country"" -- not once, but twice. He later said the mistake was simply a slip of the tongue. In fact, Puerto Rico is not a country or state . It's a commonwealth that is controlled by the US government . Puerto Ricans hold American citizenship, vote in presidential primaries (not elections), and travel freely between the island and US mainland. As such, Puerto Ricans are Americans -- not immigrants. But they also maintain a strong cultural identity all their own. It's this unique experience that Castro, 46, shares with his audience in his show. ""'Made in Puerto Rico' started with wanting to share some of the stories about growing up in Puerto Rico that I missed, but also growing up in the US,"" says Castro. ""We live in in both worlds. ... We express ourselves in both languages."" ""We are Puerto Rican but we are also American, but we sometimes feel like we are 'ni de aquí, ni de allá'. ('neither from here nor there'),"" he added. Comedian Elizardi Castro sits with CNN's Maria Santana to talk about his off-Broadway production ""Made in Puerto Rico."" Castro moved from Puerto Rico to White Plains, New York, at the age of 9. As he tells it, the transition was both difficult and hilarious. Among the many stories he shares with the audience is how he learned to eat American food (trust me, you'll never eat a hot dog the same way again) and the pain of having to listen to 80's punk rock music instead of Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. ""In Puerto Rico, we have a strong sense of cultural pride and it is not like the US. When we come here we may be legal citizens but that's as far as it goes,"" said Castro. ""It is not an easy transition. Language is very strong. Our sense of music and style is very different. It's a culture clash."" Castro is aware of political controversies that have thrust Puerto Rico into recent headlines. But says he prefers to keep politics out of his show. In fact, Trump isn't mentioned once. The goal, he says, is to help others, especially on the mainland, understand and identify with what it's like being Puerto Rican. ""I wanted to create a space to celebrate our culture,"" he says. ""Where people can come and see that it's OK to feel different and say, 'It's great to be Puerto Rican, it's great to be Latino.'"" ""That doesn't have to be offensive. You can be proud to be from wherever you are from, without having to lower yourself so that others can feel more comfortable."" So far, audiences have flocked to that message. ""Made in Puerto Rico"" was supposed to run through March, but has extended its stay at the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater until April 21 and is sold out. Castro says he hopes to one day take the show to Broadway so he can reach an even bigger audience."

A year after becoming the first No. 1 seed in men's college basketball history to lose to a No. 16 seed in the NCAA tournament, Virginia has reached the title game, defeating No. 5 seed Auburn at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. ""To think this time last year we were starting our spring workouts, and to still be playing at this point in the season with, after tonight, one other team in the whole country on the stage that you dreamed about since you were a little kid, it's an unreal feeling,"" Virginia guard Ty Jerome said.

Collins, the NCAA's national coordinator of officiating, gave a statement regarding the foul. ""The call was made by official James Breeding, who ruled that Doughty moved into the airborne shooter, making contact with Guy while taking away his landing spot,"" Collins said. ""The foul was a violation of Rule 4, Section 39.i, which states, 'Verticality applies to a legal position and also to both the offensive and defensive players. The basic components of the principle of verticality are: The defender may not ""belly up"" or use the lower part of the body or arms to cause contact outside his vertical plane or inside the opponent's vertical plane.'"" In addition to the foul, there was a no-call that has fans talking. It appeared officials missed a double dribble by Jerome, which happened a few seconds before Guy was fouled.

After being shocked by No. 16 seed University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in the NCAA tournament last season, Virginia (34-3) is the lone No. 1 seed to reach the Final Four this year. This year's NCAA men's Final Four has a bit of a different feel to it. Missing this year are the well-known established blue bloods: This is the first Final Four since 1987 that doesn't have Duke, North Carolina, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisville or UCLA. Instead, the most experienced team to make the Final Four -- and the only to win a championship -- was Michigan State, winning it all in 2000 and 1979.

This is Virginia's third Final Four appearance and first since 1984. While there was no true Cinderella in this year's Final Four, the closest one was Auburn (30-10). The Tigers beat three of those blue bloods -- Kansas, UNC and Kentucky -- en route to Minneapolis, making Auburn the only team to have beaten those programs in consecutive games in NCAA tournament history. ""I think that for us, I thought that we looked like we belonged,"" Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl said after Saturday's loss to Virginia. ""We weren't supposed to be here. We weren't supposed to have a chance to win -- or maybe had a chance to win, but unlikely. ...So this will be a memorable game, and I'd like it to be remembered for a great game."""

Aviation world faces moment of reckoning after 737 MAX crashes - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Gregory Wallace,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/boeing-aviation-737-max-aftereffects/index.html,"(CNN) It was a moment the aviation world had been waiting for since a second deadly crash grounded the 737 MAX fleet: Boeing gathered hundreds of pilots, airline executives, and regulators to unveil a fix that would return the jetliner to the sky.
""Every time something happens ... we learn from it,"" a senior Boeing official told reporters, reflecting on lessons from the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, less than five months apart, that had killed nearly 350 people. ""There are one-off occurrences that happen -- accidents like we've just experienced."" In the week-plus since that announcement, it has become increasingly clear that the two accidents were not unfortunate ""one-off occurrences,"" the software change Boeing touted would not be enough, and the industry is facing a serious test of its mettle. The challenges of crafting deeper, more expensive fixes, addressing structural deficiencies in the certification process, and reassuring shaken fliers around the world have become more apparent. Boeing has said that its software change needs additional weeks of work, and has seemed to accept some responsibility for designing a system in need of improvement. Fueled in part by damning preliminary reports that show how starkly similar the two crashes were, the moment of reckoning is challenging corporations, regulators, and investigators to take a critical look at the design and inspection of aircraft, and question whether decisions and long-standing methods -- employed for practical reasons -- put the flying public at risk. Read More ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday. ""We own it and we know how to do it."" His comments in a Boeing video followed the Ethiopian government's preliminary report describing the pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 struggling on the morning of March 10 to control their 737 MAX 8 during the six-minute ill-fated flight. According to Ethiopian crash investigators, the pilots correctly followed procedures publicized after the Lion Air accident in October to disable a faulty computerized stabilization system that Boeing created to prevent planes from crashing, but the plane's speed and the clock worked against their efforts. Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and a CNN aviation analyst, said he sees evidence Boeing is now no longer primarily focused on returning the MAX to the skies, but is working on regaining public trust in its latest, most fuel-efficient version of the workhorse jet that airlines had been lining up to buy. ""I think clearly it has got through to Boeing,"" Goelz said. The Ethiopian report contained two recommendations: First, that Boeing develop a remedy, and second, a call that regulators scrutinize the fix ""before the release of the aircraft to operations."" Questions of trust lay with the Federal Aviation Administration, which has faced concerns from lawmakers of excessive coziness with Boeing. Due to the company's broad aerospace portfolio, the federal government is both the regulator of Boeing and hires it for sensitive military contracts and complicated space operations. The world's most famous aircraft, Air Force One, is, after all, a Boeing jet. The FAA, created with the dual mission of regulating and promoting the aviation industry, has defended its decision to keep the 737 MAX flying while other aviation authorities around the world ordered it grounded. Acting Administrator Daniel Elwell bristled when members of Congress asked him why other countries had acted sooner by proactively pulling it from service. Elwell defended the US and Canadian authorities as awaiting evidence, calling them ""the first countries to ground the aircraft with data."" The FAA's decisions have ""shaken"" confidence in the FAA, the ""gold standard for aviation safety,"" said Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel. While Ethiopian and Indonesian investigators continue to probe the circumstances of those crashes, multiple investigations in the United States are casting a wide net. A long-standing practice that has allowed both plane- and part-makers to certify their own work as meeting airworthiness standards is coming under scrutiny. House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio said he has ""many serious questions surrounding the Boeing 737 MAX and the FAA's certification process."" He said the inspector general has opened a probe, and a special DOT advisory committee will review ""the procedures ... for the certification of new aircraft."" Prosecutors with the Justice Department have subpoenaed documents, including from former Boeing employees. The FAA has formed its own international review into ""the 737 MAX automated flight control system."" For all the reviews, some are wondering what will change. When the public's attention moves on, the FAA will still be left with a mandate to delegate some certification decisions to the manufacturers, former FAA chief of staff Michael Goldfarb told CNN. It's one thing, he said, for Congress to criticize the system it put into law, but another for it to fund enough FAA inspectors to oversee manufacturer decisions. ""It's been hard for the agency (FAA) to keep pace with pay"" in private industry, Goldfarb said. The NTSB, with power to recommend safety changes but not require them, is reviewing the organizational delegation authority, Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Friday. ""We would not really be doing our job if we weren't making sure that those aspects were being looked at,"" Sumwalt said. He said the board has the power to make conclusions separate from the Ethiopian and Indonesian investigations, of which it is a part. Goldfarb said the FAA and its worldwide counterparts would be smart to assemble for a ""regulatory summit"" to evaluate the 737 MAX before it returns to service. Confidence in the agency has been hurt since its delayed decision to ground the MAX, he said. Goelz, the former NTSB leader, sees signs -- in Boeing's latest comments and the decision to put more work into the software change -- that Boeing and FAA are moving in the right direction. ""I think the top priority is to make sure that this aircraft is 100% safe, secondly to make sure that the pilots who fly it have the information and the skills to fly it safely even in difficult situations,"" Goelz said. ""Then thirdly to convince the public -- prove to the public that they've done everything in their power to make this safe again."" Convincing the flying public may be the most difficult task of all. Among the defenders of the MAX were the pilots who flew them -- who, in some cases, reacted to the Ethiopian report by calling for additional review of what went wrong. ""In the wake of the tragic loss of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on Sunday, people around the world are jumping to conclusions about the Boeing 737 Max,"" the Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots of American Airlines, said on Thursday afternoon. ""Federal and international authorities have just begun to look into Sunday's accident. It is too early to determine possible causes."" And then there's those who sit behind the pilots. In the weeks ahead, travelers will need to decide if they are comfortable walking onto a 737 MAX, buckling up, and taking off."
Where's the real Timmothy Pitzen? A week of hope and heartbreak leaves many questions unanswered - CNN,us.cnn.com,Holly Yan,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/timmothy-pitzen-case-lingering-questions/index.html,"(CNN) Timmothy Pitzen's family, still grappling with the child's disappearance and his mother's suicide, just suffered a painful roller coaster of emotions -- all because of an imposter's prank.
Why did this happen? And where does the search for Timmothy go now? As more details emerge, many questions linger. But there's one silver lining to this hoax that has gripped the country. Timmothy Pitzen disappeared when he was 6. He's still missing and would be 14 years old now. Why did a man claim to be Timmothy?

Now he faces charges of making false statements to federal agents and could face up to eight years in prison. Rini has a history of using other people's identities, his brother Jonathon said. The suspect learned about Timmothy's case after watching a story about him on ABC's ""20/20,"" according to a criminal complaint and affidavit. The affidavit also said Rini ""wanted to get away from his own family. When questioned further, Rini stated he wished he had a father like Timmothy's because if he went missing, his father would just keep drinking."" Why would someone claim to be a missing child? Jonathon Rini told CNN's ""New Day"" that his brother had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and bipolar disorder. ""Still, he should have the rational thinking to not do something like this,"" he said. What happens to the search for Timmothy now? It'll keep going, but authorities are back to square one in trying to figure out where Timmothy is. Man who claimed to be Timmothy Pitzen faces federal charges ""To be clear, law enforcement has not and will not forget Timmothy, and we hope to one day reunite him with his family,"" the FBI's office in Louisville said. In Timmothy's hometown of Aurora, Illinois, a brief rush of excitement gave way to disappointment and resolve. ""Although we are disappointed that this turned out to be a hoax, we remain diligent in our search for Timmothy, as our missing person's case remains unsolved,"" Aurora police Sgt. Bill Rowley said. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children still has Timmothy's profile online, including an age progression photo showing what the boy might look like as a teenager.

""We will keep working to make sure this happens."" Who is Timmothy with? This remains a huge mystery, as his mother left only a vague and cryptic clue before she died. In May 2011, when Timmothy was 6, his mother Amy Fry-Pitzen checked him out of his elementary school. They went on a road trip, stopping at a zoo and a Wisconsin water park.

How the women in my family taught me to fight injustice (Opinion),us.cnn.com,Cynthia Hudson,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/06/opinions/injustice-humanity-project-hudson/index.html,"Cynthia Hudson is senior vice president and general manager of CNN en Español and Hispanic Strategy of CNN US.

(CNN) I come from a lineage of strong, warrior women who have influenced me and my daughters. As a girl, I would listen to my grandmother Titi, as we used to call her, and my mother, Ofelia, a professor of Spanish literature, as they recounted the pivotal moments in which they found the courage to stand up for what they believed in and spoke out against injustice.
Cynthia Hudson Each day I thank the universe for being born at this moment in history, when I have the opportunity to knock on any door and dream any dream in my work managing CNN en Español. But it's not just about opportunity -- being successful also requires determination, fearlessness and grit -- all of which I learned from the women in my family. From a protest in Cuba to an encounter with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., my mother and grandmother frequently shared the experiences that shaped their personal convictions with me. They taught me that the search for justice is a duty, and that with privilege comes responsibility and integrity. Recently, the alarming increase in hate crimes, hate speech and a heightened sense of division in civil society motivated us to create the Humanity Project for CNN en Español to help shine a light on the injustice of discrimination in all its forms. The St. Louis in Havana Read More In 1939, more than 900 passengers aboard the cruise ship St. Louis arrived at the Port of Havana in Cuba. Most of the passengers were Jews fleeing Germany, hoping they would eventually make their way to America. But the ship was not allowed to dock, and only 28 people were allowed entry . This situation caused a frenzy in Havana and stirred my great-grandmother María Luisa to action. She was from one of Cuba's secret Sephardic families, Jews who were sent to colonize Cuba in the 17th century in an agreement to watch the interests of the crown and convert to Christianity in exchange for freedom from persecution. Mormon church drops anti-LGBT policy from 2015, saying children of same-sex couples now can be baptized Even though her family was agnostic by the time she was born, María Luisa was moved by the refugees' plight. She, along with my grandmother, who was 26 at the time, protested the Cuban government's decision for days despite it being frowned upon for upper class women to protest publicly. Years later, my grandmother's clear blue eyes would fill up with tears every time she remembered the ship sailing away from Cuba. It made its way to the shores of Florida and Canada before it eventually turned back toward Europe. While Great Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands admitted a percentage of the passengers, more than 250 were ultimately killed in the Holocaust. My grandmother would tell me it had been a crime against humanity that the cowardly leaders of Cuba, the United States and Canada had not allowed the refugees entry. As a young child, from hearing this story, I learned that discrimination was not only based on skin color but religion and cultural hatred as well. Segregation in the '50s In 1957, my 19-year-old mother arrived in the beautiful city of New Orleans to improve her English while studying at Tulane University. For a Latin American family in those times, it was a luxury. It was also audacious: It was commonly accepted for daughters to get married and sons to study. One night, my mother went on a date with an American boy, and they rode in the front of one of the trolleys heading toward the famous French Quarter during a heavy rain flooding the streets. At one stop, an elderly African-American lady got on, laden with bags, only to be told by the driver to ""go to the back of the car."" Southern Poverty Law Center names new interim president and CEO Upon noticing that no one got up to offer a seat, my mother stood up -- and ""se formó"" -- or as Cubans would say, things got out of hand. Her companion told her that she could not give up her seat for the elderly lady, who had to go to the back because she was black. Meanwhile, the driver stopped the trolley to tell her that the lady could not ride in the front of the car. My furious mother told her date that all the men in the trolley should have risen to give their seat to an elderly woman, regardless of her color. The boy was annoyed, and the driver told my mother that if she did not sit back down he was going to remove her from the trolley. She yelled, ""Well, in my country we don't do this to an elderly person -- we are all equal and this is an injustice."" She got off the trolley and walked back to her dorm alone, soaked under the intense rain. She never again went out with a boy who agreed with segregation. When she finally met my father, who was also a Tulane student, he passed her criteria with flying colors. My mother would later tell us that story to show that we should not turn a blind eye to the injustices others face. A maid for Martin Luther King Jr. When he graduated from Tulane, my father joined the US Navy officers' corps. He was fighting in Vietnam when my grandfather was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I was 3 years old, and my mother was pregnant with my brother at the time. My grandmother had never worked before her exile in the United States following the Cuban Revolution, and spoke English very badly. But in the midst of this horrible personal crisis, she was able to get a job as a maid at a luxury hotel in Miami. One day, she had to clean the presidential suite where the great Martin Luther King Jr. was staying. The greatest MLK speeches you never heard Upon hearing her accent, King asked her where she was from and inquired about her life in Cuba. He treated her with empathy. Later, she learned that in one of his many speeches in Miami he spoke about the need for African- Americans in the city to work together with the Cuban community instead of fighting for jobs. Coretta Scott King would tell her not to wash the dishes, and upon leaving the hotel they left her a huge tip, the likes of which my grandmother had never seen. Thanks to their generosity, my grandmother used to tell us that that week we ate red meat after months of eating chicken, eggs and pasta. She emphasized that the most important thing in a human being was humility and empathy to understand the pain of others, and again her eyes would fill up with tears upon saying that only a monster could have killed a man who only promoted justice in the world. Social justice is passed from one generation to the next When my older daughter was just 6, she was playing with her friend at a summer camp in Miami. Two other girls expressed interest in playing with my daughter and said their parents forbade them to play with the friend because she was African-American. Stay up to date...

My daughter yelled at how unfair and awful this was, and told them that if they didn't play with her friend, they wouldn't play with her. That night I received a phone call from the girl's mother, who shared the details of the confrontation with me and thanked me for teaching my daughter not to be racist. She said, ""You have taught your girl to love and the other girls have been taught to hate."" It moved me to know that my daughter had reacted in a fair and decent way. Although she was only 6, she had heard her grandmother's and great-grandmother's stories and internalized my lessons on being empathetic and compassionate toward all people. And now with three daughters between the ages of 18 and 28, I feel proud to have instilled a sense of fairness and social justice that the women in my family have taught me. Recently, I have shed the occasional tear of pride when my three girls have gone out to demonstrate in favor of women's rights. I'm proud when they tell me that thanks to me, they will follow in the footsteps of strong women that came before them. I cannot help but smile, because love is also learned."
Einstein's theory was put to the test.

(CNN) To state the obvious, Albert Einstein was one of the smartest and most impactful scientific minds in history, with a long track record of staggering predictions. Those predictions have been tested in the real world, and they've always checked out.
Don Lincoln Of course, in science, you're only as good as your last successful calculation and that means that scientists are constantly working out new ways to test Einstein's ideas. Astronomers have recently made an exciting and novel measurement of his theory of relativity. Einstein's theory of relativity , which he developed over a period of years, makes mind-blowing predictions: that moving clocks tick more slowly than stationary ones and that objects are measured to be shorter the quicker they are moving. When he added gravity to his thinking, he deduced that clocks run slower when they're in regions of high gravity. He also predicted that light emitted in a place where the gravity is strong will redden as it moves to locations where gravity is weaker. But that doesn't mean contemporary scientists complacently accept his theory of relativity as unquestioned fact. They have now sought to answer a new question: Are Einstein's predictions valid in an environment with a gravitational field far stronger than any found on Earth? A new experiment needed doing -- and black holes, the burned-out hulks of massive stars with gravitational forces so strong that light cannot even escape -- provide the perfect environment to put, once again, Einstein's theory of relativity to the test. Read More It turns out Albert Einstein was pretty smart after all At the center of nearly every galaxy is an enormous black hole. In our own Milky Way galaxy sits one with a mass about 4 million times that of our sun. It's called Sagittarius A* , after its location in the constellation Sagittarius. The black hole isn't alone but rather surrounded by stars that orbit it very closely and sometimes in highly elliptical orbits. And that is key to the new measurement . A star by the name of S2 has passed close by Sagittarius A*, traveling through a region of gravity that is about a million times higher than can be experienced on Earth. There is a central feature of general relativity called local position invariance, or LPI, which states that any measurement performed on a freely falling object should be identical whether it is in a strong gravitational field or none at all. That sounds a bit complicated, but it's really no different than saying that a skydiver's wristwatch should tick the same during a parachute jump as the same watch on an astronaut in deep space, where there is no gravity. That watch should function just the same for a hypothetical skydiver on Jupiter, which has much stronger gravity than Earth. Essentially, if LPI is true, then measurements should be entirely blind to whether they occur in a gravity field or not. If a measurement invalidates LPI, it also invalidates Einstein's theory. The scientific theories battling to explain the universe Getting a stopwatch near a distant star or black hole isn't possible, so scientists needed to come up with a different means of comparison. Stars are made predominantly of two atomic elements, hydrogen and helium. Every element emits a unique set of colors, and each color has a different frequency. This has been measured well in the low gravitational environment of Earth, and scientists wanted to see whether the elements emitted the same colors in a strong gravitational field. If they didn't, that would invalidate LPI. So, to perform the test, scientists watched the light emitted from S2 as it dove into Sagittarius A*'s strong gravitational field. Now, because the light emitted from the star moved from the strong gravity near a black hole to the weak gravity on Earth where the scientists were making their observations, it is expected that the colors will appear redder on Earth than they were when they were emitted by the star. However, the color of light emitted by hydrogen and the color of light emitted by helium should be reddened by the same amount. And that's exactly what scientists observed. Both elements emitted the same wavelengths of light as they fell through the black hole's strong gravitational field as they emit in the weak gravitational field on Earth. Einstein's theory of general relativity was again validated, and the findings were published last month in Physical Review Letters. While this measurement is clearly a scientific triumph, researchers aren't resting on their laurels. A new facility, called the Extremely Large Telescope , will be able to make even more precise tests of general relativity, so we can be sure more measurements are to come. Stay up to date...

You might wonder why scientists constantly question well-established theories such as Einstein's, but that's simply the nature of science. No scientific prediction is ever taken to be sacrosanct. Just as Sir Isaac Newton's ideas of gravity that were developed in the 1670s were replaced by Einstein's, scientists fully expect Einstein's theories will eventually be replaced by something better. Until then, Einstein's theory of gravity will continue to reign supreme."

""The United States stands ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief."" Iran's Foreign Minister responded angrily on Twitter two days later . ""It seems the US Secretary of State is unaware of the mismanagement of natural disasters in the US over the past two years, and hence opines -- in an unprofessional, interventionist and demagogic manner -- on Iran's management of the horrific and unprecedented floods which simultaneously afflicted 24 provinces,"" Zarif said, before referencing Hurricanes Harvey, Michael and Florence and Maria."

As Chicago's beaming mayor-elect stood at a podium, she turned toward her wife, Amy Eshleman, and kissed her in full view of a roomful of jubilant supporters while photographers snapped away. The images of that moment looked like a sneak preview of a New America breaking through -- a black, gay woman kissing her white wife before a mini-rainbow coalition of onlookers. And nobody raised an eyebrow. Lori Lightfoot kisses her wife, Amy Eshleman, after being elected Chicago's first black gay woman mayor. But focus on just the black supporters in that room and another image emerges.

Martha Simmons, a scholar on black preaching and a consultant to an upcoming PBS special on the black church. There is a cruel irony in Lightfoot's election that few, if any, are talking about. Many of the same black voters who asked her to lead their city wouldn't dare ask her to lead their own churches because she is a gay woman. Women and LGBTQ members are still treated like second-class citizens in many black churches across America. Two of the nation's largest black church groups still do not officially accept women clergy or bishops. And while largely white denominations like the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church (USA) affirm gays and lesbians, most black churches in America still have a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that forces its LGBTQ members to live in the closet or be consumed by self-loathing.

Lori Lightfoot on the challenges facing Chicago 00:55 Yet Lightfoot was able to get many of the same churchgoers, including many who declare that ""God didn't make Adam and Steve,"" to vote for her.

One of the city's most prominent black pastors said she couldn't have won without the strong support of Chicago's black church community. Her victory is bigger than Chicago or politics. How did she do it? The answer to that question can be found in a peculiar way of thinking in the black community that is at once ""beautiful"" and ""terrible."" What the terrible looks like Ask many gifted, ambitious women who attend traditional black churches, and they can tell you about something terrible. Black women are the heart and muscle of the black church. More than two-thirds of a typical black congregation are women. But click on the web sites for groups like the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. or the Church of God in Christ, Inc. and you'll see that virtually all their leaders are solemn-looking black men staring intently at the camera. The pictures look as out of date as those black-and-white photos of all-white NBA teams from the 1950s. Ask these black church groups about their attitude toward women and LGBTQ people, and you'll hear everything except a full-throated affirmation of both groups as equals. The National Baptist Convention won't come out and officially say women cannot be ordained as pastors. Instead, its web site says it "" does not offer specific support for female ministers at this time. "" The Church of God in Christ is more straightforward . It does not allow women to become senior pastors or bishops, though it accepts some as ""evangelists.""

Lightfoot to Chicago: You did more than make history 02:06 Some of these men are threatened by barrier-breaking women leaders like Lightfoot, says Simmons. Don't talk to them about changing times or the changing faces of politics. ""They think, 'Why would I believe that women's roles have changed when it doesn't serve me.' Why would I believe that, especially given how many women are in seminary. There are now more women in seminary than men,"" says Simmons. ""Do you really believe that men are going to help women get jobs that only men were once able to get?"" And then there's another terrible tradition in the black church that I saw first-hand -- the many LGBTQ members who were humiliated by their congregations. I once attended a black Baptist church where the senior pastor wouldn't allow women to preach and taught that homosexuality was a sin. There was one catch -- his right-hand man was gay, and virtually everybody in the church seemed to know it. This man was a pillar in the church. He was one of those unsung heroes who make a church function -- attending dull late-night meetings because somebody has to, bringing meals to shut-ins, arranging the pastor's schedule. I can't think of a moment when he didn't have a smile on his face. He was killed, though, by a young man he'd invited to his home. I thought the grief would break the unspoken agreement in the church to never talk about his sexuality. But when I asked a buddy of mine who attended his funeral if they had finally talked openly about who he was, he reacted with scorn. Real prize is taking down 'old, entrenched Chicago machine,' Lightfoot says ""Of course not. It was completely whitewashed,"" he said. ""Some speakers even pretended that he liked women."" As to why so many black churches are like this, the answers could fill a book. Here's one from the Rev. Otis Moss III, senior pastor of one of the largest predominately black congregations in Chicago. He points to how often blacks have been told by America they aren't welcome. ""Those who have been traumatized pass on their trauma, and for some it makes them feel powerful to hold power over someone,"" he says. ""Those who have been held back are able to say to another, 'You are not fully human.' "" Lightfoot, though, somehow marched into this black subculture of trauma, repression and contradictions and convinced enough black churchgoers to vote for her. She made a believer out of the skeptics because of another tradition in the black church that isn't terrible. It's ""beautiful."" What the beautiful looks like Moss, pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ, knows about this side of the black church, and he points to how it operates in politics. His father was a close aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Former President Barack Obama used to attend Trinity, and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose fiery sermons almost derailed Obama's first presidential bid, led the church for over 30 years. Moss says there is a tradition of pragmatism in the black church in which congregants ultimately care more about a leader who can deliver than one who can quote doctrine. He tells the story of a politician who tried to answer questions about his sexual orientation before a black church elder cut him off: ""Child, I could care less who you date,"" the elder told him. ""I just wanna' know what your policy is going to be."" This vein of pragmatism is what Lightfoot tapped into. Black women govern only 4% of the biggest US cities. But their numbers are growing Moss says he was impressed with how Lightfoot showed up in so many black churches and took on every question. He says she couldn't have won without strong support from the black church. Lightfoot ran as an outsider. She wasn't part of the political machine in Chicago that many blacks distrusted. She had never held political office before. Turns out a lot of black churchgoers felt like outsiders in Chicago, too. A former federal prosecutor, she capitalized on the outrage sparked by a white police officer's fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, to launch her campaign as a reformer. ""Racism is a great equalizer,"" Moss says. ""Regardless of your sexual orientation, we are still hit by the same political machine that attempts to marginalize people of color."" A crucial moment for Lightfoot came when she gained the endorsement of one of the most well-known figures in Chicago's black church community. Willie Wilson is a prominent businessman and gospel music impresario with a following among older black churchgoers in Chicago. He placed fourth in the mayoral primary, winning the highest percentage of black votes. Wilson is also the ""devout product"" of a socially conservative black church that teaches that homosexuality is a sin, according to a Chicago Sun-Times story . But he threw his support behind Lightfoot even as others sought his endorsement. Wilson echoed the church elder from Moss' story -- Lightfoot's policy positions were ultimately more important than her piety. He said her sexual orientation wasn't a primary concern for him. Three Chicago police officers found not guilty of cover-up in Laquan McDonald's shooting death ""This thing's about working with me, and should be about economic and social issues. It should not go outside of that,"" he said in a Chicago Tribune story . Now here's the sticky part. Some say that the pragmatism of many black churches is really just a fancy word for hypocrisy. How, for example, are black churchgoers' voting habits any different than those of white evangelicals who support Trump and oppose gay rights? Moss doesn't see it that way. He has another term to describe the difference between what black churchgoers profess and what they practice. He calls it a ""beautiful contradiction"" -- black churchgoers can embrace a doctrine that excludes a group of people but jettison those scriptures once they get to know and love such a person. He recalls a story he heard from another black pastor. The man had conducted the funeral for a person in his congregation who was transgender. A deacon stood up during the service and said he couldn't abide by the ceremony because the person they were saying goodbye to dressed as a woman. Then another group of deacons stood up and talked about how that same person had been a force in the church who had done so much to help people. ""She will be buried with full honors,"" one deacon said before sitting down. Relationships take precedence over doctrine in many black churches, Moss says. ""When you have a relationship with someone, you see the sacredness of God flowing through them versus a doctrine that's been stuck in the back of your head,"" Moss says. 'Representation matters.' Tributes as Chicago elects first black gay woman as mayor Jonathan Walton, a professor of religion and society at Harvard Divinity School, amplified Moss' point. He says it's simplistic to say most black churches are homophobic and anti-women. He says those black churchgoers who voted for Lightfoot weren't defying black church tradition; some were acting within it. ""Are we really changing when we go into the voting booth or are we just as pragmatic in our religious spaces,"" Walton says. ""Do I wish we would actually challenge homophobia, sexism? Absolutely? But do I think black churches are just bastions of homophobia and sexism? No, not quite."" Still, what about the gifted women who will never be able to preach or become bishops? What about the members of the LGBTQ community who cannot be recognized for their full humanity -- like the aide to the pastor who was gay? I tell Walton about the aide, and he says that even that story has some hope in it. ""It's what's beautiful and terrible at the same time about our community,"" he says. ""It's beautiful because that brother who everybody knew who was gay probably found life in that community and had authority in that space he probably wouldn't have anywhere else. ""What's terrible, though, is the conspiracy of silence around a certain aspect of his identity, and that people felt like they had to love him in spite of his sexual orientation."" Why Lightfoot's victory is bigger than Chicago This ""beautiful contradiction,"" though, could be changing. Simmons, the PBS consultant, says a new generation of black churchgoers and pastors aren't preoccupied with issues of gender and sexual orientation. Too many of them, she says, are struggling to pay student loans and worrying about getting gunned down in the streets. ""They don't have time for this foolishness about who loves who,"" says Simmons, who hosts a live discussion every Monday on her Facebook page about black church issues. ""The young folks look at all that and say, 'No, no. We outta' here. We don't have time for this hypocrisy and for majoring in minor stuff while we continue to die.'"" Lightfoot's election could be a sign of that change. Moss is confident the black church will eventually grow to fully affirm women and members of the LBGTQ community. He envisions a day when Lightfoot, or a politician like her, could actually kiss her partner during a victory celebration in a traditional black church. And the cheers wouldn't stop. ""I look forward to it,"" he says. Some might think such a barrier-breaking moment would be terrible. But for others, one word would describe such a moment: It would be beautiful."

Suspected rhino poacher killed by an elephant then eaten by lions in South Africa,us.cnn.com,"Livvy Doherty, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/africa/south-africa-rhino-poacher-eaten/index.html,"(CNN) Only a skull and a pair of trousers remained after a suspected rhino poacher was killed by an elephant and then eaten by lions in Kruger National Park, South African National Parks said.
The incident happened after the man entered the park Monday with four others to target rhinos, according to a parks service statement. An elephant ""suddenly"" attacked the alleged poacher, killing him, and ""his accomplices claimed to have carried his body to the road so that passersby could find it in the morning. They then vanished from the Park,"" police said. His family were notified of his death late Tuesday by his fellow poachers, and a search party set out to recover the body. Rangers scoured on foot and police flew over the area, but because of failing light it could not be found. Botswana's 'significant' elephant-poaching problem Read More The search resumed Thursday morning and, with the help of added field rangers, police discovered what was left of his body. Police say they arrested three men and seized guns following the alleged poacher's death. ""Indications found at the scene suggested that a pride of lions had devoured the remains leaving only a human skull and a pair of pants,"" the statement said. Glenn Phillips, the managing executive of Kruger National Park, extended his condolences to the man's family. ""Entering Kruger National Park illegally and on foot is not wise, it holds many dangers and this incident is evidence of that,"" he warned. ""It is very sad to see the daughters of the deceased mourning the loss of their father, and worse still, only being able to recover very little of his remains."" Three individuals who joined the illegal hunt were arrested Wednesday by the South African Police Service, and officers continue to investigate what happened. The suspects appeared in Komatipoort Magistrate Court on Friday to face charges of possessing firearms and ammunition without a license, conspiracy to poach and trespassing. A judge remanded them to custody and they will be back in court this week, pending a formal bail application. The African rhino is targeted for its horn because of the belief among some who practice Eastern medicine that the horn has benefits as an aphrodisiac, making it more valuable than cocaine in parts of the world. Lions left only the poacher's skull and a pair of his pants, officials say. Of special concern is the black rhino, which is considered critically endangered after its population tumbled from about 65,000 to 1970 to 2,400 in 1995, according to Kruger National Park. Conservation efforts have boosted their numbers, and the world's remaining 5,000 or so black rhinos live predominantly in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya and Zimbabwe. In 2016, there were between 349 and 465 black rhinos living at Kruger and between 6,600 and 7,800 white rhinos, who also suffer from poaching, South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs said. Kruger is considered an intensive protection zone, and the government employs a range of resources to deter poaching, including aircraft, dogs, special rangers and an environmental crime investigation unit. Of the 680 poaching and trafficking arrests made in 2016 by the South African Police Service, 417 were in and around Kruger, the department said. In September, the department announced that six men -- including two syndicate leaders, two police officers and a former police officer -- had been arrested for trafficking in rhino horns."
"Egypt discovers a tomb full of mummified cats, mice and other animals",us.cnn.com,Lauren M. Johnson,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/06/world/egypt-unveils-discovery-of-new-tomb-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced its most recent discovery of a preserved double graveyard containing the remains of a man, his wife, and mummified animals, including cats and mice.
Scientists believe the discovery, which was unveiled Friday, is from the Ptolemaic period, which dates back more than 2,000 years. The tomb was found in the city of Akhmim about four miles from Sohag. The tomb is made of two rooms covered in colored pictures and inscriptions. ""It's one of the most exciting discoveries ever in the area,"" said Dr. Mustafa Waziri, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. The most impressive discovery was that of 50 animals and a human mummy . Eagles, falcons, ibex, cats and mice were all found mummified in the tomb. Archeologists found about 50 mummified animals in the tomb, including cats and mice. According to the ministry, the entrance to the burial ground was discovered after the arrest of a gang trying to smuggle the artifacts out of the side of a hill. After an investigation, the site was passed on to Waziri and his team for archeological excavation. One preserved human mummy was also found in the tomb. Read More The tomb is believed to belong to a high-ranking official named TuTu and his wife T-Cheret Isis. Perfectly preserved inscriptions cover the walls, including the names of the family members of the deceased. The colors that fill the two-room tomb have been remarkably preserved. Excavators found two limestone jars with human burials, as well as a collection of stuffed animals that indicates the tomb was reused in later time periods, the ministry said."
Israel's political discourse: From 'peace process' to 'annexation',us.cnn.com,Analysis by Oren Liebermann,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/06/middleeast/israel-elections-benjamin-netanyahu/index.html,"Jerusalem (CNN) One of the more striking campaign ads preceding Israel's election featured footage from 2011 of Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House telling Barack Obama that the President's wish to see a restarted peace process between Israelis and Palestinians was pie-in-the-sky.
""It's not going to happen,"" Netanyahu tells a stony-faced Obama, adding, ""and it's time to tell the Palestinians forthrightly it's not going to happen. Israel obviously cannot be asked to negotiate with a government that is backed by the Palestinian version of al Qaeda. We cannot go back to the 1967 lines because these lines are indefensible."" Trump backs Netanyahu, but will voters? Your guide to Israel's elections The campaign ad was for Likud, the Prime Minister's party. And the message was simple: Netanyahu will stand up to anyone who wants him to resume talks about the creation of a Palestinian state. Once upon a time such unequivocality opposite the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would have triggered a serious debate among the parties in Israel. Indeed, for decades the conflict was the main fault line in Israeli politics. Just as the Green Line separated Israel from the West Bank, the approach to the conflict separated right from left on Israel's political spectrum. The left was more willing to engage in negotiations and make concessions in a peace process, while the right took a more hardline approach. This time, issues like security -- for which, read the threat of Iran in Syria -- the Israeli economy, and, most of all, the criminal investigations against Netanyahu have dominated the headlines. Read More For a few days, the conflict with the Palestinian militant group Hamas was top of the agenda, after a rocket fired from Gaza hit a house north of Tel Aviv injuring seven, including three children. Israel responded with airstrikes , also injuring Palestinians, and a serious escalation looked possible. But within days the talk was of a Gaza truce and an easing of Israeli restrictions on the enclave's two million residents. Any improvement in conditions in Gaza would be welcomed by pretty much everybody. But it is a long way away from what resolution of the conflict used to look like. Back in the 1990s, the Oslo peace accords envisioned final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, leading to the creation of a Palestinian state. It is an idea still held on to dearly by Western diplomats serving in Jerusalem and Ramallah, but fewer and fewer others seem to give it much chance. Bibi forever? Supporters in Netanyahu's heartland think so Netanyahu's main rival in this election, former Chief of Staff Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party, has made only vague references to the conflict. He has advocated a policy of ""separation"" from the Palestinians, without endorsing the idea of a two-state solution. Gantz has tried to position himself as a centrist in Israeli politics -- and so to fully commit to any peace process with the Palestinians risks losing potential political partners, which Gantz is unwilling to do at this point. Waiting in the wings is the Trump administration's ""Deal of the Century,"" set to be released sometime after the April 9 election. Trump's team, led by son-in-law and foreign policy novice Jared Kushner, has said the peace plan resolves all of the final-status issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including security, refugees, borders, and Jerusalem. He has also said it will require difficult concessions from both sides. The Palestinian Authority has already flatly rejected any plan put forward by the Trump administration following the President's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the moving of the US embassy there from Tel Aviv . Though Netanyahu for his part has said he won't pre-judge the plan, and will wait to see its contents, his potential right-wing coalition partners have already done it for him. Two of them -- The Union of Right Wing Parties and The New Right -- have categorically rejected any proposals that require concessions to the Palestinians. In fact, if Netanyahu succeeds in winning the election, the likelihood is that the parties he is courting, rather than seeking to hold peace negotiations at bay, will try to move things in the opposite direction, pushing for annexation of some, or all, of the West Bank. Israeli President and Gal Gadot among those warning of 'anti-Arab rhetoric' after Netanyahu comments Hard-line right wing parties believe that Trump has given them the opening they wanted, when he recognized Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights , overturning decades of US foreign policy in the process. For these parties, and indeed for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the announcement sets a precedent that territory taken by force in a defensive war can be legally retained. If that precedent could be applied to the Golan Heights -- captured from Syria in 1967 -- it could work for the West Bank as well, so advocates of annexation believe. The West Bank was captured during the same war from Jordan, which had occupied the territory since 1948. Naftali Bennett, the hardline leader of the New Right party, certainly seemed to have his eyes on that prize in the aftermath of Trump's Golan announcement, calling on Netanyahu to formally renounce a key speech from 2009, in which he endorsed a two-state solution. ""We call upon Prime Minister Netanyahu as soon as this evening to announce that his agreement to the establishment of Palestine in the Bar-Ilan speech is null and void,"" Bennett said. And Netanyahu himself, in a TV interview over the weekend, said that he intended to extend Israeli sovereignty across all Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he won re-election, suggesting sweeping annexation across the territory. In a separate interview a day earlier, he said he had told Trump that he was not willing to see a single Israeli settler evacuated from the West Bank -- settler population is more than 400,000 -- as part of any peace effort. Gantz, the main challenger to Netanyahu, described the remarks as ""irresponsible"" and asked why the Prime Minister had chosen to bring up annexation now. ""We should ask how it is that annexation has been sitting in Netanyahu's back pocket for thirteen years and did not come out until now,"" Gantz said. ""I think that announcing a strategic and historic decision [like this] in the midst of an election campaign is not serious and is irresponsible."" If elected, Gantz said his government would not make any unilateral moves in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and said that any annexation in the West Bank would be a result of negotiations and not a starting point. As Netanyahu's critics accuse him of desperate electioneering in the face of a projected tight finish on Tuesday, the switch in the discourse -- from peace process to annexation -- shows how far Israeli politics has moved in the last few decades."
Suspected rhino poacher killed by an elephant then eaten by lions in South Africa,edition.cnn.com,"Livvy Doherty, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/africa/south-africa-rhino-poacher-eaten/index.html,"(CNN) Only a skull and a pair of trousers remained after a suspected rhino poacher was killed by an elephant and then eaten by lions in Kruger National Park, South African National Parks said.
The incident happened after the man entered the park Monday with four others to target rhinos, according to a parks service statement. An elephant ""suddenly"" attacked the alleged poacher, killing him, and ""his accomplices claimed to have carried his body to the road so that passersby could find it in the morning. They then vanished from the Park,"" police said. His family were notified of his death late Tuesday by his fellow poachers, and a search party set out to recover the body. Rangers scoured on foot and police flew over the area, but because of failing light it could not be found. Botswana's 'significant' elephant-poaching problem Read More The search resumed Thursday morning and, with the help of added field rangers, police discovered what was left of his body. Police say they arrested three men and seized guns following the alleged poacher's death. ""Indications found at the scene suggested that a pride of lions had devoured the remains leaving only a human skull and a pair of pants,"" the statement said. Glenn Phillips, the managing executive of Kruger National Park, extended his condolences to the man's family. ""Entering Kruger National Park illegally and on foot is not wise, it holds many dangers and this incident is evidence of that,"" he warned. ""It is very sad to see the daughters of the deceased mourning the loss of their father, and worse still, only being able to recover very little of his remains."" Three individuals who joined the illegal hunt were arrested Wednesday by the South African Police Service, and officers continue to investigate what happened. The suspects appeared in Komatipoort Magistrate Court on Friday to face charges of possessing firearms and ammunition without a license, conspiracy to poach and trespassing. A judge remanded them to custody and they will be back in court this week, pending a formal bail application. The African rhino is targeted for its horn because of the belief among some who practice Eastern medicine that the horn has benefits as an aphrodisiac, making it more valuable than cocaine in parts of the world. Lions left only the poacher's skull and a pair of his pants, officials say. Of special concern is the black rhino, which is considered critically endangered after its population tumbled from about 65,000 to 1970 to 2,400 in 1995, according to Kruger National Park. Conservation efforts have boosted their numbers, and the world's remaining 5,000 or so black rhinos live predominantly in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya and Zimbabwe. In 2016, there were between 349 and 465 black rhinos living at Kruger and between 6,600 and 7,800 white rhinos, who also suffer from poaching, South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs said. Kruger is considered an intensive protection zone, and the government employs a range of resources to deter poaching, including aircraft, dogs, special rangers and an environmental crime investigation unit. Of the 680 poaching and trafficking arrests made in 2016 by the South African Police Service, 417 were in and around Kruger, the department said. In September, the department announced that six men -- including two syndicate leaders, two police officers and a former police officer -- had been arrested for trafficking in rhino horns."

Get ready for awful corporate earnings - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Paul R. La Monica,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/investing/stocks-week-ahead-earnings/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) 1. Weak first quarter, but the rest of 2019 should be OK: The first quarter is over. Now we're about to find out just how bad it was for big American companies.
Earnings probably fell in the first three months of the year. But investors have largely looked past that. The Dow is up 13% so far in 2019 and is not far from its all-time high. The S&P 500 has surged 15% while the Nasdaq has skyrocketed nearly 20%. The market is predicting that profit growth will return to near double-digit levels by the fourth quarter. So investors will need to pay close attention to what CEOs say about the remainder of 2019 in their earnings calls. S&P 500 EPS growth forecasts Q1: -4.2% Q2: 0.0% Q3: +1.6% Q4: +8.2%
Source: FactSet Research
""Unless this quarter's earnings are much worse than consensus, the more important thing will be the guidance,"" said Cliff Corso, executive chairman of Insight North America. Corso thinks that earnings for the full year could wind up increasing around 5% thanks to strength in the second half. That's not fantastic but it might be good enough to keep the market rally going -- albeit at a less explosive rate than previous years. Read More ""This year's earnings are probably not a recipe for a blockbuster market return, but there is no viable alternative for investors."" Market valuations: Not too hot. Not too cold. Just right? Concerns about an imminent recession should continue to fade, notes Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager and founder of investment firm InfraCap. Hatfield thinks that stocks are still reasonably priced, if not necessarily cheap. The S&P 500 is currently trading at around 17 times earnings forecasts for this year. That's roughly in line with its historical average. ""There are no sectors overheated and imploding right now. The market is not a screaming buy but it's not overvalued either. There are still some bargains,"" Hatfield said, adding that he thinks banks and energy stocks look particularly attractive. So investors should be looking at sectors that would benefit from the continued economic expansion in the United States, says Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy at Sun Life Investment Management. Now is not the time to get skittish and defensive. ""It's still a good idea to be bullish and exposed to growth. People will be rewarded for sticking with stocks right now,"" Mullarkey said. 2. Banking on the banks: JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report earnings Friday. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently told investors in the company's annual report that the bank's profits got a big boost last year from corporate tax cuts. Dimon may talk more about that, as well as his recent criticism of President Donald Trump's latest two choices for open spots on the Federal Reserve , in calls with reporters and analysts. As for Wells Fargo, expect questions about the scandal-ridden company's search for a new CEO now that Tim Sloan has stepped down . Investors are hoping for signs that earnings at both banks will improve later this year. Revenue is expected to be flat at JPMorgan Chase in the first quarter and down at Wells Fargo. There are concerns about how low interest rates will impact their businesses. 3. Delta flies high: The airline giant has already forecast earnings for the first quarter to be better than expected thanks to fuel costs rising at a less dramatic pace than it had originally anticipated. Delta will report its official results on Wednesday. The stock is a favorite pick of investing legend Warren Buffett . And Delta has held up better than other US airlines since it does not have any Boeing 737 Max jets in its fleet. 4. ECB and Fed in focus: The European Central Bank will announce its latest decision on interest rates Wednesday morning. No changes are likely but expect ECB president Mario Draghi to talk more about the bank's plans to delay rate hikes as well as its new program of inexpensive loans for banks. Draghi may also address recent weak economic data in Germany and Italy. Later Wednesday, the Fed will release minutes from its March meeting. The Fed held rates steady, lowered its economic forecasts and signaled that no further rate hikes are coming this year. Investors will hunt for clues about whether some members think the Fed should cut rates -- which both President Trump and his Fed board pick Stephen Moore have called for as of late. 5. When you wish upon a streaming star (and Star Wars): Disney will host an investor day event Thursday. The media giant says the event will focus on its streaming media plans, including its upcoming Disney+ service. Investors may also ask questions about the integration of the Fox assets that the House of Mouse just bought as well as succession plans for CEO Bob Iger, whose contract expires in 2021. Disney could reveal more Star Wars news a day after the investor event. Episode IX director J.J. Abrams will speak at the Star Wars Celebration in Chicago on Friday, leading to rumors that a trailer and movie title could drop. 6.

Rees-Mogg, the leader of the European Research Group, a faction of Conservative members of Parliament who have been staunchly opposed to May's Brexit deal, praised Johnson as a potential Conservative party leader in an interview on Sky News program ""Sophy Ridge on Sunday."" ""I think very highly of Boris Johnson,"" Rees-Mogg said, arguing that the Brexit question aside, Johnson was a moderate figure among Conservatives who ""could unite the party and win an election."" Johnson, the former mayor of London, has been a frequent thorn in May's side, repeatedly stating his opposition to her Brexit plan and resigning as foreign secretary last year over her strategy. Theresa May admits she can't pass her Brexit deal without Labour He has been linked with the top job many times and looked set to make a run in 2016, before Michael Gove, who was Johnson's campaign manager at the time, withdrew his support in dramatic fashion and declared his own candidacy. Johnson is popular with grassroots party members and has long held leadership ambitions. Read More May has told Conservative MPs that if they back her deal, she'll step down as Conservative Party leader, and it seems that members of her party are already jockeying for her spot. In a statement on Saturday , May said that the only way of passing her rejected Brexit deal is with support from the opposition Labour Party, further roiling hardliners in her Conservative Party like Rees-Mogg. Her statement is an admission that her previous strategy of attempting to win over the hardline elements of her own party has failed. It's a high-risk move that could cost her support for the deal from her own side, but, given her pledge to resign, she no longer needs the support. Britain is staring down the barrel toward April 12, when it will leave the European Union without a deal if May is unable to secure a delay. British papers have reported that Amber Rudd, left, and Boris Johnson might unite on a joint ticket. The Prime Minister is due to meet EU leaders at a special summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where she will ask for a short extension to the Brexit process, to June 30. May's strategy of reaching out to Labour has caused fury within her own party: Two ministers resigned from the government earlier this week, and party members posted pictures on social media tearing up their membership cards. Speaking on Sky News, Rees-Mogg also praised Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd as ""a first class intellect,"" suggesting that he might support a Boris-Rudd ticket. A Brexit war is looming in Theresa May's Conservative party British broadsheet the Financial Times reported on Friday that Rudd looked poised to play ""kingmaker"" in a leadership race, while The Sunday Times suggested she was already preparing to back Johnson at the urging of MPs who are pushing for the alliance they've dubbed ""BAmber."" The Mail on Sunday referred to Boris and Rudd as the ""dream ticket,"" with one MP telling the British paper: ""Amber would take half the party with her, while Boris is the man you need to beat (opposition Labour party leader Jeremy) Corbyn at a General Election."" British bookies are already declaring Johnson the favorite to take over from May. According to London-based Ladbrokes gambling company , the odds on Johnson becoming the next prime minister are 5/1."

Trump's odd riffs (Opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Pat Wiedenkeller, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/opinions/trumps-odd-riffs-weekly-opinion-roundup-wiedenkeller/index.html,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
(CNN) If the President was in the driver's seat last week, then the car seemed like it was having trouble, shuddering and fishtailing all over the road: A week after announcing he would try to destroy Obamacare again, on Monday night he said he'd wait till after the election. After repeatedly saying he was OK with releasing the Mueller report, now he wasn't. He dug in about releasing his tax returns (he won't) and went on odd riffs about his German-born (not true) father and carcinogenic windmills (not true) and declared, at the border on Friday, that America was ""full.""
The chaos is intentional, Julian Zelizer thought: Trump wants "" to use his mastery of the media cycle to totally control the agenda throughout the next two years, making it difficult -- if not impossible -- for Democrats to discuss their own ideas."" Michael D'Antonio , Trump's biographer, warned that the President's batty behavior was more than just a bizarre spectacle, it hinted strongly at mental decline. ""The talk coming from this President is frightening, destabilizing and bewildering ,"" he wrote. Dean Obeidallah , meanwhile, suggested that Trump should savor, while he can, his latest roasting on ""Saturday Night Live"" -- a sketch on how he seemed to have dodged the Mueller bullet. It won't last, he wrote: ""Trump's potential criminal and legal woes are not over. As (Robert) DeNiro's Mueller stated near the end of the sketch, ""P.S., can't wait to see what the Southern District of New York has in store for Trump."" On Friday, Trump visited the border town of Calexico, California, where he railed against a ""colossal surge"" in immigration -- and mistakenly referred to the Flores Settlement as decided by ""Judge Flores"" (it was named after Jenny Lisette Flores, who fled El Salvador as a teenager). Frida Ghitis was exasperated: He is presenting a humanitarian crisis -- Central American asylum seekers -- as an illegal criminal invasion, and demanding a wall, she observed. If the President really wanted a border solution, he would send money south to support ""well-vetted nongovernmental organizations that improve governance, rule of law, and economic development"" in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, she wrote. Read More Van Jones and Jessica Jackson, meanwhile, took a look at a rare bipartisan success on criminal justice reform, explaining why they're celebrating a three-month-old law signed by President Trump. Is Bernie Sanders really like Donald Trump? In the Washington Post, Dana Milbank went out on a limb and called Bernie Sanders the Donald Trump of the left : ""Fundraising and polls show that many Democrats think the best answer to an angry old white guy with crazy hair, New York accent and flair for demagoguery is, well, another angry old white guy with crazy hair, New York accent and flair for demagoguery."" SE Cupp countered that a more ridiculous comparison was hard to imagine: "" No one is like Donald Trump. He is, in ways that are both impressive and disturbing, inimitable, unprecedented, unique."" Top court blesses barbarity? Russell Bucklew, on death row in Missouri for murder, wanted to be executed using nitrogen gas instead of a lethal injection of pentobarbital. His lawyers argued that he had tumors in his throat, and could choke to death on his own blood under lethal injection. On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected his request. The 5-4 decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, shows the conservative court continuing to move in "" an exceptionally barbarous direction ,"" wrote Jill Filipovic , putting ""a legal veneer on judicially sanctioned torture and murder."" Inspiration and grief over Nipsey Hussle The shooting death on Sunday of hip-hop star Nipsey Hussle outside his Los Angeles clothing store drew a torrent of grief in the community where he had worked to create opportunity for others. ""You were about something..positive and for your community in every chance you had to speak..and because of that You inspired millions,"" tweeted Pharrell Williams . But there was another, troubling, thread that emerged, lamented Clay Cane : ""Sadly, social media is already being flooded by many trying to use Hussle as an example of the always popular, intellectually bereft, black-on-black-crime talking point."" The facile framing, he said, detracts from Nipsey's status and contributions -- the STEM program he helped launch and several other entrepreneurial and community-focused ventures aimed at lifting up his South LA neighborhood. "" Racializing crime perpetuates a stereotype"" and dishonors Nipsey, he wrote. Trump under pressure Two weeks after Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary declaring that the much-longer, still-unseen Mueller report largely exonerated the President, Congress is ratcheting up the pressure to see for itself. The House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize chairman Jerrold Nadler to issue a subpoena (when he wants to) for the full report and other evidence. It's a battle Nadler was born to fight , suggested Norman Ornstein in The New Republic. Michael Zeldin , a formal federal prosecutor, said Barr's decision to exonerate President Trump of any potential obstruction of justice allegations was out of line . ""There is nothing in the special counsel regulations that would appear to authorize the attorney general"" -- a political appointee -- to put his (and Rod Rosenstein's) spin on Mueller's own decision ""that he lacked sufficient evidence to make a criminal charging decision."" Barr should have given the full report to Congress, which can take up the question of obstruction in an impeachment investigation, he wrote. Barr told the House and Senate Judiciary committee chairmen he would send up the full report by mid-April -- as soon as he's done reviewing whether and how to redact it. OK, fine, wrote Elie Honig , a former federal prosecutor. But it gets dicey when Barr says he'll scrub the report of information that would ""unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties,"" as well as grand jury materials. Barr should ""put away his redaction pen"" in favor of transparency, Honig wrote. ""Anything less will raise one big question: What is Barr trying to hide?"" Taxing Trump Meanwhile, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday asked the IRS for six years of Trump's tax returns -- a request Trump will fight all the way to the Supreme Court, a source told CNN. In the Washington Post, Aaron Blake noted a report in Bloomberg that in February Trump asked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to fast-track his nominee for IRS chief counsel, Michael J. Desmond -- who had once advised the Trump Organization on a tax matter. Trump attempting to install ""people who have publicly taken his side"" is a recurring theme , Blake wrote. Michael McGough , writing in the Los Angeles Times, observed that Democrats were in ""search of skullduggery."" Biden's bad week ""Joe Biden has problems,"" wrote Roxanne Jones . Since last weekend, a series of women have told of uncomfortable, handsy encounters with the former Vice President -- and likely 2020 candidate. Joe Biden waited several days before he addressed the issue in a Twitter video, saying he would "" be more mindful about respecting personal space. "" But then, on Friday, he joked about his predicament to a largely male crowd of union electricians, causing Emily Peck to complain in an essay in HuffPost that he still didn't get it. Jones took note of the other problematic issues in Biden's personnel file -- the ones rooted in his long Senate career, like his treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings and his once-popular tough-on-crime views that ""mostly targeted black and brown communities and have perpetuated the racial disparities in today's justice system."" Biden will have to explain himself not just to women, but also to communities of color , Jones wrote. But there's another side to consider, wrote Marion Steinfels , Biden's deputy communications director during his 2008 run. She recounted the candidate grabbing her arm once during a plane takeoff and telling her a random story. She realized only later that he was distracting her from her flying anxiety. "" With Biden, it is not about objectifying women or asserting male dominance ; it's about doing what he can to encourage others and make them feel comfortable -- especially in stressful and overwhelming situations,"" she insisted. ""This is who he is."" Biden's case surfaces the challenges facing all the Democratic candidates as they navigate norms ""in an era defined by the #MeToo movement,"" and confront a ""generational divide, in which a rising cohort, characterized by its diversity and tolerance, is intolerant of conduct that was long commonplace,"" wrote Nancy Gibbs in Time. Don't count him out, cautioned John Avlon . "" There are plenty of compelling reasons for Joe Biden to get in the race of a lifetime , aiming to reunite his party and the nation."" Pete Buttigieg on God, marriage and Mike Pence While Biden was trying to get his pre-candidacy back on course, Pete Buttigieg was having a bit of bump in the polls. The South Bend mayor sat down to chat with CNN contributor Father Edward Beck about his religious journey, his views on the intersection of faith and politics -- and Mike Pence. Beck asked him about reports that the Vice President believes that God is behind his and Trump's leadership. Said Buttigieg: ""The idea that God wants somebody like Mike Pence to be the cheerleader for a President largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give God very little credit."" Read the whole Q&A here. Insecurity The White House was playing a game of ""high-stakes dodgeball"" in trying to explain away the White House's push for security clearances for at least 25 people over experts' objections, wrote CNN security analyst Samantha Vinograd . Pay attention, wrote Vinograd, who served 10 years in government, four of them in the White House. ""If red flags about an applicant are raised -- and later overruled by senior White House officials or the President himself -- that means that the very people supposedly charged with protecting our national security are knowingly taking steps that could damage it. The outstanding question is why.""

Disaster relief Package Remains Stalled in Congress - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Alex Rogers,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/disaster-relief-package-congress-stalled/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump has made clear that he does not want to spend more money on Puerto Rico — and Democrats won't agree to a massive bill providing relief for those affected by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and fires without it.
The deadlock has only become clearer in the days since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer saw their own bills fail to pass on Tuesday, as Trump continued to criticize Puerto Rico and its handling of hurricanes Maria and Irma since they devastated the US territory in 2017. ""I'm not sure anybody gains by a protracted standoff where both sides are pointing fingers,"" said Sen. John Thune, the Republican Whip, earlier this week. ""I hope that Schumer and McConnell can sit down and come up with a path forward."" But the White House escalated its attacks on Puerto Rico this week. On Monday, Trump called San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz ""crazed."" (Cruz responded on CNN, ""The President lives in an alternative world where he tries to pin people against one another."") On Tuesday, Trump called Puerto Rico's politicians ""grossly incompetent,"" who ""spend the money foolishly or corruptly."" And on Thursday, the White House put out a ""fact sheet"" describing Puerto Rico's ""extensive history of mismanagement and corruption"" going back to 1999. ""Congress does not need to appropriate more funds for the recovery effort in Puerto Rico,"" stated the White House paper, arguing that the territory has not spent billions of dollars the federal government has already allocated. Read More Republicans on Capitol Hill have not taken such a hard line. ""I don't want to shortchange Puerto Rico,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. ""But in the meantime, we have other states that need help and I'd like to see us go ahead and help everybody."" Disaster relief legislation fails to advance in Senate amid Puerto Rico funding fight The GOP legislation authored by Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Richard Shelby would've spent roughly $13.5 billion for rebuilding and recovery from natural disasters. The legislation also included $600 million to pay for nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico, which Gov. Ricardo Rosselló requested in November to protect the food stamp benefits of more than a million people . The legislation was aimed at helping more than just the people of Puerto Rico. Sen. Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said that the handful of Democratic senators running for president should've voted for the GOP bill to provide aid to the flood-ravaged parts of her state. ""A number of my Democratic colleagues have been finding their way all across Iowa, telling Iowans how important they are to them as the presidential caucuses are nearing,"" Ernst said, according to the Omaha World-Herald . ""And yet they voted to block the very funding that would help these families out."" In voting against the bill, Democrats argued that the GOP relief effort provided insufficient funding for Puerto Rico because it fails to include a variety of measures that were part of the roughly $14.2 billion relief package passed by Democrats who control the House in January. Those measures include funds that could be used by Puerto Rico to rebuild water systems and other infrastructure projects. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, has since offered to add a couple billions dollars for other disasters, including tornadoes that have hit the southeastern United States and flooding in the Midwest, to satisfy Republican concerns. ""Our opinion is that it is clear that the President is holding disaster aid to all American communities hostage over a petty, political grudge with the American citizens of Puerto Rico,"" said Leahy spokesman Jay Tilton."
"The majority of Americans tend to agree with Democratic positions, polling shows - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Grace Sparks,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/democratic-positions-majority/index.html,"(CNN) When it comes to considering the top political issues facing the country -- immigration, health care and gun control among them -- politicians in Congress can give the impression that the public is hopelessly divided on policy solutions.
In reality, the polling shows the majority of the public usually backs policy positions preferred by the Democratic Party. A new Gallup poll released Thursday showed that two-thirds of Americans said protecting the environment should be a higher priority than economic growth and only three-in-10 who said economic growth should be given priority, even if the environment suffers to some extent. This is the highest prioritizing of the environment since spring 2000. Eight-in-10 Democrats and 71% of independents prioritize environmental protection, versus 35% of Republicans who said the same. Another poll out this week by Pew Research Center found that Americans' biggest frustration regarding the country's tax system isn't the amount they pay, but that corporations and the wealthy don't pay their fair share. Read More Overall, 62% said that the feeling that some corporations don't pay their fair share bothers them a lot and 60% said the same of wealthy people. Those are both made up of huge majorities of Democrats -- 79% of Democrats who said those bother them a lot (on both). Independents were in a majority, as well, 62% who were bothered by corporations not paying their fair share, and 60% wealthy people, while 42% and 37% of Republicans said the same, respectively. Those are two examples but there are many other issues that fit under this umbrella, including immigration, gun control and abortion. - Guns, Quinnipiac University poll (March 1-4, 2019): 60% of registered voters support stricter gun laws in the US 87% of Democrats support stricter gun control laws. - The border wall with Mexico, CNN poll conducted by SSRS (January 10-11): 56% oppose building a wall along the entire border with Mexico 89% of Democrats oppose building a wall along the whole of the southern border. - A national ""Medicare-for-all"" plan, Kaiser Family Foundation (March 13-18): 56% have a favorable view 78% of Democrats have a favorable view of a potential national Medicare-for-all program. - Abortion, Fox News poll (February 10-12): 57% of Americans said the Supreme Court should let Roe v Wade stand, 21% overturn 73% of Democrats don't want Roe v. Wade overturned. - Same-sex marriage, Gallup (May 1-10, 2018): 67% of Americans thought marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by the law as valid 83% of Democrats want marriages between same-sex couples to be recognized by law. There are some areas where the positions held by Democrats in Congress are also matters of bipartisan agreement among all voters. - DACA, CNN poll conducted by SSRS (February 20-23, 2018): 83% of Americans said they want to continue the policy and allow immigrants who meet the qualifications to remain in the US 94% of Democrats 83% of independents 67% of Republicans - Immigration, Quinnipiac University poll (January 25-28, 2019): 75% of registered voters thought immigration is overall good for the country 90% of Democrats 79% of independents 60% of Republicans There are issues where Republicans are a majority, but they are few and far between (for example, crime and justice, especially the death penalty). Importantly, the issues where the Republican position is the more popular opinion aren't the ones that Republicans focus vote on when voting."

Theresa May gambles it all in last-ditch bid to deliver Brexit - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Analysis by Jane Merrick, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/uk/theresa-may-brexit-gamble-gbr-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Theresa May has faced many crucial moments in her quest to make Brexit happen. She has also taken risks that have not paid off -- especially her decision in 2017 to call an unnecessary election that resulted in her throwing away her party's majority in Parliament.
Now, May is about to make her biggest gamble yet, and whatever happens, it is likely to be her last as Prime Minister. Amid howls of protest from her own Conservative ranks, May is seeking a compromise Brexit deal with the opposition Labour party. Talks began last week and will continue over the next few hours and days to try to agree a plan that can be backed by a majority in the House of Commons. The timetable is tight. The Prime Minister needs a new deal to present to European Union leaders at their summit on Wednesday. If that plan is rejected by Brussels, the UK is leaving the EU without a deal on Friday. Theresa May admits she can't pass her Brexit deal without Labour Until last week, May had ignored calls to reach out across the Commons to seek a compromise, preferring instead to try to persuade the hardliner Brexiteer faction of her own party to come round to supporting her original deal, which was struck with Brussels all the way back in November. Yet dozens of them remained opposed, and her deal has been defeated three times in Parliament by both Tory and opposition lawmakers. Read More May has slowly reduced the margin of loss with each successive vote, but there is simply not enough support -- or time left on the clock -- to keep pressing the same deal. So May had no choice but to open talks with Labour, given that the alternative was to contradict her own position and the will of Parliament by accepting an economically damaging no-deal Brexit. But the specter of her striking a bargain with Jeremy Corbyn, regarded by Tories as a hard-left Marxist, has caused outrage among some ministers and MPs, particularly those who are preparing to stand for Conservative leader when May eventually steps down. Despite the backlash, the Prime Minister is holding firm. On Saturday night, she issued a statement insisting she had no choice but to compromise with Labour, because otherwise Brexit would ""slip through our fingers"" and never happen at all. Theresa May's plan for another Brexit delay has gone down badly in Europe As it is, a long delay is already on the cards: this week May is asking for an extension to the Brexit deadline until June 30, and under the terms of the so-called ""flextension"" of up to a year proposed by European Council President Donald Tusk, the departure date could be even later. By sticking to her strategy of holding talks with Corbyn, May is risking a civil war in her own party. In those talks, Corbyn and his allies have made clear the Prime Minister needs to give more ground -- particularly on the subject of a future customs union with the EU after Brexit. May's original deal already included a customs arrangement of sorts, but Labour wants the government to go further. In the end, it could come down to finessing the words. The Brexiteer cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom, when asked on the BBC on Sunday whether she would support a customs union in a new deal, said ""it depends what it means ... we can't be purist about it. We are at the point where Brexit is slipping away altogether ... Provided we are leaving the European Union, it is important that we compromise, and it is through gritted teeth."" Not all of Leadsom's fellow Brexiteers agree. Germany once pleaded with Britain to stay in the EU. Now the love has cooled On the other side, Labour maintains that the Prime Minister needs to make more concessions. In her statement on Saturday, May left the door open to a customs union -- and to a second referendum on Brexit -- by conspicuously leaving those proposals out of her list of red lines. Ending freedom of movement by people from the EU to Britain, a position on which both the government and Labour agree, remained in there. This is the fertile ground for compromise. A new deal that contains a form of a customs union could pass the Commons this week -- before Wednesday's EU summit -- as it could gain the support of Conservative lawmakers loyal to May, as well as Labour and other opposition parties. Yet it would cause outrage among the Brexiteer wing of her party, as well as among rank and file Conservative activists and members, many of whom are reportedly refusing to campaign for or donate to the party. May's Conservatives are on the brink. By embarking on this compromise, the Prime Minister is, then, about to gamble the future of her party -- from grassroots to MPs -- as well as the unity of her cabinet on a last-chance bid to deliver Brexit. If this fails, then everything fails: Brexit, her premiership and her party. She would have to quit and possibly even call a general election. But if she succeeds, she will have finally achieved what she pledged to do when she became Prime Minister: deliver Brexit. It will have come at a great personal and political sacrifice."
"Saudi nuclear program accelerates, raising tensions in a ...",www.cnn.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/06/middleeast/saudi-arabia-nuclear-reactor-iran-tensions-intl/index.html,"Saudi nuclear program accelerates, raising tensions in a volatile region CNN 13 hrs ago By Tim Lister and Tamara Qiblawi, CNN © Google Earth Saudi Arabia's first nuclear reactor is located in the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology in Riyadh.
On the outskirts of Riyadh, a building site is quickly being transformed into the birthplace of Saudi Arabia's quest for nuclear power, a bid that has sparked concern in the US Congress and fury in Tehran.
New satellite imagery shows that construction on an experimental reactor is making ""expeditious"" progress -- just three months after the Kingdom announced plans to build it, according to former director for nuclear inspections at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Robert Kelley.
Kelley estimated that the reactor could be completed in ""nine months to a year.""
The Kingdom has been open about its nuclear program with the IAEA, which sent a team to Saudi Arabia last July to check on building plans. It has repeatedly pledged that the program is peaceful. But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year that ""without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.""
Also raising concern among industry experts and some in Congress is the Saudi insistence that it should be allowed to produce its own nuclear fuel, rather than import it under strict conditions.
In an interview last year , Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said: ""It's not natural for us to bring enriched uranium from a foreign country to fuel our reactors,"" citing the country's uranium reserves. Vision 2030
Saudi Arabia went public with its nuclear ambitions nine years ago, but the plans have gone into overdrive as part of the Crown Prince's ""Vision 2030"" -- a strategy to wean Saudi Arabia off its reliance on oil and diversify both the economy and its energy mix.
It already consumes about one-quarter of its own oil production, and output is likely to remain roughly stable even as demand for energy is expected to triple by 2030. So the blueprint for Vision 2030 includes solar and wind power as well as a nuclear program in an effort to source one-third of energy needs from non-oil resources.
Longer-term, Saudi Arabia envisions 17 gigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2040, enough to provide 15% of its power needs.
The experimental reactor under construction at the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology is designed for training scientists, Kelley told CNN.
""It's the size of a waste basket and has no strategic importance,"" he said, adding that it would take 100 years to process enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon.
Next, the Saudis want to build two commercial reactors and are shopping around for contractors. There are five finalists, according to the Saudis: Westinghouse from the US, as well as companies from China, Russia, France and South Korea. Saudi Arabia has also signed agreements with the China National Nuclear Corporation for exploring uranium reserves in the Kingdom.
The IAEA sent a team to Saudi Arabia in July last year to review the development of its nuclear power infrastructure. That mission concluded that the Kingdom is ""well placed to finalize its plans for construction of its first nuclear power plant"" through partnerships with countries that have nuclear power industries.
In a visit to Riyadh in January , Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General, confirmed Saudi Arabia had ""made significant progress in the development of its nuclear power infrastructure.""
But when the Saudis want to move to the next stage -- fueling the reactor at King Abdulaziz City and any commercial plants -- they will have to submit to more intrusive IAEA involvement.
""They've been exempt for 30 years since they signed a non-proliferation treaty,"" said Kelley. ""Now they're going to have to make some serious paperwork and agree to inspections,"" if they want to acquire nuclear fuel. US concerns
Skepticism in the US Congress over whether Saudi Arabia can be a trusted partner has grown since the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last year. That's now manifested itself in critical scrutiny of the Saudi nuclear program -- and especially whether the Trump Administration is doing enough to ensure non-proliferation.
Asked whether it was acceptable for Saudi Arabia to become a nuclear power, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was unequivocal in a TV interview on Friday.
""We will not permit that to happen. We will not permit that to happen anywhere in the world,"" Pompeo told CBS . ""The President understands the threat of proliferation. We will never write a $150 million check to the Saudis and hand them over the capacity to threaten Israel and the United States with nuclear weapons, never.""
A bipartisan resolution introduced in the Senate in February demanded that the use of any US nuclear power technology in Saudi Arabia must be accompanied by safeguards to ensure Saudi Arabia cannot enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel.
""The last thing America should do is inadvertently help develop nuclear weapons for a bad actor on the world stage,"" said Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley , one of the resolution's sponsors.
House Democrats in February claimed that in 2017 White House officials had pushed the sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia despite warnings from National Security Council officials . A spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, said the report amounted to ""a ridiculous conspiracy theory.""
In heated exchanges at the Senate Armed Services committee at the end of March, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said that if the United States did not cooperate with the Saudis, they would look to Russia or China to develop their nuclear industry.
""I can assure you that those two countries don't give a tinker's damn about non-proliferation,"" Perry said.
""That's why we continue to work very, very diligently to try to bring those countries that want to develop civil nuclear programs into the sphere of the United States, because we are committed to non-proliferation.""
Perry said his department had approved several applications for US companies to sell nuclear power technology and assistance to Saudi Arabia. However, they do not allow the transfer of nuclear material, equipment or components.
Iran claims that the Trump Administration plans to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear technology without sufficient safeguards. ""First a dismembered journalist; now illicit sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia fully expose #USHypocrisy,"" Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted in February.
And in March, Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, accused unnamed regional states of developing ""suspicious nuclear projects,"" which would force Tehran to revise its defense strategy. Quoted by Iranian news agencies , Shamkhani said such plans would ""force us to revise our strategy.""
Whatever Saudi Arabia's energy strategy, and however sincere its pledge that it has no wish to develop nuclear weapons, the mere existence of a nuclear program is bound to inflame tensions across the Gulf."

Suspected rhino poacher is killed by an elephant and then eaten by lions in South Africa - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/07/africa/south-africa-rhino-poacher-eaten/index.html,"Suspected rhino poacher is killed by an elephant and then eaten by lions in South Africa Posted 6:37 a.m. yesterdayUpdated 4:48 a.m. today By Livvy Doherty, CNN
CNN — Only a skull and a pair of trousers remained after a suspected rhino poacher was killed by an elephant and then eaten by lions in Kruger National Park, South African National Parks said.
The incident happened after the man entered the park with four others to target rhinos, according to a parks service statement released Friday.
His family were notified of his death late Tuesday by his fellow poachers, and a search party led by Kruger's regional manager, Don English, set out to recover the body. Rangers scoured on foot and police flew over the area, but due to failing light, it could not be found.
The search resumed Thursday morning and, with the help of added field rangers, what was left of his body was discovered.
""Indications found at the scene suggested that a pride of lions had devoured the remains leaving only a human skull and a pair of pants,"" the statement said.
Glenn Phillips, the managing executive of Kruger National Park, extended his condolences to the man's family.
""Entering Kruger National Park illegally and on foot is not wise, it holds many dangers and this incident is evidence of that,"" he warned. ""It is very sad to see the daughters of the deceased mourning the loss of their father, and worse still, only being able to recover very little of his remains.""
The four individuals who joined the illegal hunt were arrested Wednesday by the South African Police Service, and officers continue to investigate what happened.
The African rhino is targeted for its horn because of the belief among some who practice Eastern medicine that the horn has benefits as an aphrodisiac, making it more valuable than cocaine in parts of the world.
Of special concern is the black rhino, which is considered critically endangered after its population tumbled from about 65,000 to 1970 to 2,400 in 1995, according to Kruger National Park. Conservation efforts have since boosted their numbers, and the world's remaining 5,000 or so black rhinos live predominantly in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya and Zimbabwe.
In 2016, there were between 349 and 465 black rhinos living at Kruger and between 6,600 and 7,800 white rhinos, who also suffer from poaching, South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs said.
Kruger is considered an intensive protection zone, and the government employs a range of resources to deter poaching, including aircraft, dogs, special rangers and an environmental crime investigation unit.
Of the 680 poaching and trafficking arrests made in 2016 by South Africa Police Services, 417 were in and around Kruger, the department said. In September, the department announced that six men -- including two syndicate leaders, two police officers and a former police officer -- had been arrested for trafficking in rhino horns.

In Sunday's interview, Schiff defended his comments, saying his accusations against Trump were all incidents that were ""in plain sight,"" including Trump's public call during the 2016 campaign for Russia to ""hack Hillary's emails"" and Donald Trump Jr.'s email exchange ahead of a meeting with a Russian attorney.

"The majority of Americans tend to agree with Democratic positions, polling shows - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Grace Sparks,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/democratic-positions-majority/index.html,"(CNN) When it comes to considering the top political issues facing the country -- immigration, health care and gun control among them -- politicians in Congress can give the impression that the public is hopelessly divided on policy solutions.
In reality, the polling shows the majority of the public usually backs policy positions preferred by the Democratic Party. A new Gallup poll released Thursday showed that two-thirds of Americans said protecting the environment should be a higher priority than economic growth and only three-in-10 who said economic growth should be given priority, even if the environment suffers to some extent. This is the highest prioritizing of the environment since spring 2000. Eight-in-10 Democrats and 71% of independents prioritize environmental protection, versus 35% of Republicans who said the same. Another poll out this week by Pew Research Center found that Americans' biggest frustration regarding the country's tax system isn't the amount they pay, but that corporations and the wealthy don't pay their fair share. Read More Overall, 62% said that the feeling that some corporations don't pay their fair share bothers them a lot and 60% said the same of wealthy people. Those are both made up of huge majorities of Democrats -- 79% of Democrats who said those bother them a lot (on both). Independents were in a majority, as well, 62% who were bothered by corporations not paying their fair share, and 60% wealthy people, while 42% and 37% of Republicans said the same, respectively. Those are two examples but there are many other issues that fit under this umbrella, including immigration, gun control and abortion. - Guns, Quinnipiac University poll (March 1-4, 2019): 60% of registered voters support stricter gun laws in the US 87% of Democrats support stricter gun control laws. - The border wall with Mexico, CNN poll conducted by SSRS (January 10-11): 56% oppose building a wall along the entire border with Mexico 89% of Democrats oppose building a wall along the whole of the southern border. - A national ""Medicare-for-all"" plan, Kaiser Family Foundation (March 13-18): 56% have a favorable view 78% of Democrats have a favorable view of a potential national Medicare-for-all program. - Abortion, Fox News poll (February 10-12): 57% of Americans said the Supreme Court should let Roe v Wade stand, 21% overturn 73% of Democrats don't want Roe v. Wade overturned. - Same-sex marriage, Gallup (May 1-10, 2018): 67% of Americans thought marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by the law as valid 83% of Democrats want marriages between same-sex couples to be recognized by law. There are some areas where the positions held by Democrats in Congress are also matters of bipartisan agreement among all voters. - DACA, CNN poll conducted by SSRS (February 20-23, 2018): 83% of Americans said they want to continue the policy and allow immigrants who meet the qualifications to remain in the US 94% of Democrats 83% of independents 67% of Republicans - Immigration, Quinnipiac University poll (January 25-28, 2019): 75% of registered voters thought immigration is overall good for the country 90% of Democrats 79% of independents 60% of Republicans There are issues where Republicans are a majority, but they are few and far between (for example, crime and justice, especially the death penalty). Importantly, the issues where the Republican position is the more popular opinion aren't the ones that Republicans focus vote on when voting."

Disaster relief Package Remains Stalled in Congress - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Alex Rogers,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/disaster-relief-package-congress-stalled/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump has made clear that he does not want to spend more money on Puerto Rico — and Democrats won't agree to a massive bill providing relief for those affected by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and fires without it.
The deadlock has only become clearer in the days since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer saw their own bills fail to pass on Tuesday, as Trump continued to criticize Puerto Rico and its handling of hurricanes Maria and Irma since they devastated the US territory in 2017. ""I'm not sure anybody gains by a protracted standoff where both sides are pointing fingers,"" said Sen. John Thune, the Republican Whip, earlier this week. ""I hope that Schumer and McConnell can sit down and come up with a path forward."" But the White House escalated its attacks on Puerto Rico this week. On Monday, Trump called San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz ""crazed."" (Cruz responded on CNN, ""The President lives in an alternative world where he tries to pin people against one another."") On Tuesday, Trump called Puerto Rico's politicians ""grossly incompetent,"" who ""spend the money foolishly or corruptly."" And on Thursday, the White House put out a ""fact sheet"" describing Puerto Rico's ""extensive history of mismanagement and corruption"" going back to 1999. ""Congress does not need to appropriate more funds for the recovery effort in Puerto Rico,"" stated the White House paper, arguing that the territory has not spent billions of dollars the federal government has already allocated. Read More Republicans on Capitol Hill have not taken such a hard line. ""I don't want to shortchange Puerto Rico,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. ""But in the meantime, we have other states that need help and I'd like to see us go ahead and help everybody."" Disaster relief legislation fails to advance in Senate amid Puerto Rico funding fight The GOP legislation authored by Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Richard Shelby would've spent roughly $13.5 billion for rebuilding and recovery from natural disasters. The legislation also included $600 million to pay for nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico, which Gov. Ricardo Rosselló requested in November to protect the food stamp benefits of more than a million people . The legislation was aimed at helping more than just the people of Puerto Rico. Sen. Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said that the handful of Democratic senators running for president should've voted for the GOP bill to provide aid to the flood-ravaged parts of her state. ""A number of my Democratic colleagues have been finding their way all across Iowa, telling Iowans how important they are to them as the presidential caucuses are nearing,"" Ernst said, according to the Omaha World-Herald . ""And yet they voted to block the very funding that would help these families out."" In voting against the bill, Democrats argued that the GOP relief effort provided insufficient funding for Puerto Rico because it fails to include a variety of measures that were part of the roughly $14.2 billion relief package passed by Democrats who control the House in January. Those measures include funds that could be used by Puerto Rico to rebuild water systems and other infrastructure projects. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, has since offered to add a couple billions dollars for other disasters, including tornadoes that have hit the southeastern United States and flooding in the Midwest, to satisfy Republican concerns. ""Our opinion is that it is clear that the President is holding disaster aid to all American communities hostage over a petty, political grudge with the American citizens of Puerto Rico,"" said Leahy spokesman Jay Tilton."
Theresa May gambles it all in last-ditch bid to deliver Brexit,us.cnn.com,"Analysis by Jane Merrick, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/uk/theresa-may-brexit-gamble-gbr-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Theresa May has faced many crucial moments in her quest to make Brexit happen. She has also taken risks that have not paid off -- especially her decision in 2017 to call an unnecessary election that resulted in her throwing away her party's majority in Parliament.
Now, May is about to make her biggest gamble yet, and whatever happens, it is likely to be her last as Prime Minister. Amid howls of protest from her own Conservative ranks, May is seeking a compromise Brexit deal with the opposition Labour party. Talks began last week and will continue over the next few hours and days to try to agree a plan that can be backed by a majority in the House of Commons. The timetable is tight. The Prime Minister needs a new deal to present to European Union leaders at their summit on Wednesday. If that plan is rejected by Brussels, the UK is leaving the EU without a deal on Friday. Theresa May admits she can't pass her Brexit deal without Labour Until last week, May had ignored calls to reach out across the Commons to seek a compromise, preferring instead to try to persuade the hardliner Brexiteer faction of her own party to come round to supporting her original deal, which was struck with Brussels all the way back in November. Yet dozens of them remained opposed, and her deal has been defeated three times in Parliament by both Tory and opposition lawmakers. Read More May has slowly reduced the margin of loss with each successive vote, but there is simply not enough support -- or time left on the clock -- to keep pressing the same deal. So May had no choice but to open talks with Labour, given that the alternative was to contradict her own position and the will of Parliament by accepting an economically damaging no-deal Brexit. But the specter of her striking a bargain with Jeremy Corbyn, regarded by Tories as a hard-left Marxist, has caused outrage among some ministers and MPs, particularly those who are preparing to stand for Conservative leader when May eventually steps down. Despite the backlash, the Prime Minister is holding firm. On Saturday night, she issued a statement insisting she had no choice but to compromise with Labour, because otherwise Brexit would ""slip through our fingers"" and never happen at all. Theresa May's plan for another Brexit delay has gone down badly in Europe As it is, a long delay is already on the cards: this week May is asking for an extension to the Brexit deadline until June 30, and under the terms of the so-called ""flextension"" of up to a year proposed by European Council President Donald Tusk, the departure date could be even later. By sticking to her strategy of holding talks with Corbyn, May is risking a civil war in her own party. In those talks, Corbyn and his allies have made clear the Prime Minister needs to give more ground -- particularly on the subject of a future customs union with the EU after Brexit. May's original deal already included a customs arrangement of sorts, but Labour wants the government to go further. In the end, it could come down to finessing the words. The Brexiteer cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom, when asked on the BBC on Sunday whether she would support a customs union in a new deal, said ""it depends what it means ... we can't be purist about it. We are at the point where Brexit is slipping away altogether ... Provided we are leaving the European Union, it is important that we compromise, and it is through gritted teeth."" Not all of Leadsom's fellow Brexiteers agree. Germany once pleaded with Britain to stay in the EU. Now the love has cooled On the other side, Labour maintains that the Prime Minister needs to make more concessions. In her statement on Saturday, May left the door open to a customs union -- and to a second referendum on Brexit -- by conspicuously leaving those proposals out of her list of red lines. Ending freedom of movement by people from the EU to Britain, a position on which both the government and Labour agree, remained in there. This is the fertile ground for compromise. A new deal that contains a form of a customs union could pass the Commons this week -- before Wednesday's EU summit -- as it could gain the support of Conservative lawmakers loyal to May, as well as Labour and other opposition parties. Yet it would cause outrage among the Brexiteer wing of her party, as well as among rank and file Conservative activists and members, many of whom are reportedly refusing to campaign for or donate to the party. May's Conservatives are on the brink. By embarking on this compromise, the Prime Minister is, then, about to gamble the future of her party -- from grassroots to MPs -- as well as the unity of her cabinet on a last-chance bid to deliver Brexit. If this fails, then everything fails: Brexit, her premiership and her party. She would have to quit and possibly even call a general election. But if she succeeds, she will have finally achieved what she pledged to do when she became Prime Minister: deliver Brexit. It will have come at a great personal and political sacrifice."
"Saudi nuclear program accelerates, raising tensions in a volatile region",us.cnn.com,"Tim Lister and Tamara Qiblawi, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/06/middleeast/saudi-arabia-nuclear-reactor-iran-tensions-intl/index.html,"(CNN) On the outskirts of Riyadh, a building site is quickly being transformed into the birthplace of Saudi Arabia's quest for nuclear power, a bid that has sparked concern in the US Congress and fury in Tehran.
New satellite imagery shows that construction on an experimental reactor is making ""expeditious"" progress -- just three months after the Kingdom announced plans to build it, according to former director for nuclear inspections at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Robert Kelley. Kelley estimated that the reactor could be completed in ""nine months to a year."" The Kingdom has been open about its nuclear program with the IAEA, which sent a team to Saudi Arabia last July to check on building plans. It has repeatedly pledged that the program is peaceful. But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year that ""without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible."" Also raising concern among industry experts and some in Congress is the Saudi insistence that it should be allowed to produce its own nuclear fuel, rather than import it under strict conditions. Read More In an interview last year , Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said: ""It's not natural for us to bring enriched uranium from a foreign country to fuel our reactors,"" citing the country's uranium reserves. Vision 2030 Saudi Arabia went public with its nuclear ambitions nine years ago, but the plans have gone into overdrive as part of the Crown Prince's ""Vision 2030"" -- a strategy to wean Saudi Arabia off its reliance on oil and diversify both the economy and its energy mix. It already consumes about one-quarter of its own oil production, and output is likely to remain roughly stable even as demand for energy is expected to triple by 2030. So the blueprint for Vision 2030 includes solar and wind power as well as a nuclear program in an effort to source one-third of energy needs from non-oil resources. Longer-term, Saudi Arabia envisions 17 gigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2040, enough to provide 15% of its power needs. Robert Kelley, former director for nuclear inspections at the IAEA, has said that Saudi Arabia's nuclear reactor is designed for training scientists. The experimental reactor under construction at the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology is designed for training scientists, Kelley told CNN. ""It's the size of a waste basket and has no strategic importance,"" he said, adding that it would take 100 years to process enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon. Next, the Saudis want to build two commercial reactors and are shopping around for contractors. There are five finalists, according to the Saudis: Westinghouse from the US, as well as companies from China, Russia, France and South Korea. Saudi Arabia has also signed agreements with the China National Nuclear Corporation for exploring uranium reserves in the Kingdom. The IAEA sent a team to Saudi Arabia in July last year to review the development of its nuclear power infrastructure. That mission concluded that the Kingdom is ""well placed to finalize its plans for construction of its first nuclear power plant"" through partnerships with countries that have nuclear power industries. Saudi Arabia consumes around one quarter of its own yearly oil production. In a visit to Riyadh in January , Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General, confirmed Saudi Arabia had ""made significant progress in the development of its nuclear power infrastructure."" But when the Saudis want to move to the next stage -- fueling the reactor at King Abdulaziz City and any commercial plants -- they will have to submit to more intrusive IAEA involvement. ""They've been exempt for 30 years since they signed a non-proliferation treaty,"" said Kelley. ""Now they're going to have to make some serious paperwork and agree to inspections,"" if they want to acquire nuclear fuel. US concerns Skepticism in the US Congress over whether Saudi Arabia can be a trusted partner has grown since the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last year. That's now manifested itself in critical scrutiny of the Saudi nuclear program -- and especially whether the Trump Administration is doing enough to ensure non-proliferation. Asked whether it was acceptable for Saudi Arabia to become a nuclear power, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was unequivocal in a TV interview on Friday. ""We will not permit that to happen. We will not permit that to happen anywhere in the world,"" Pompeo told CBS . ""The President understands the threat of proliferation. We will never write a $150 million check to the Saudis and hand them over the capacity to threaten Israel and the United States with nuclear weapons, never."" A bipartisan resolution introduced in the Senate in February demanded that the use of any US nuclear power technology in Saudi Arabia must be accompanied by safeguards to ensure Saudi Arabia cannot enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel. ""The last thing America should do is inadvertently help develop nuclear weapons for a bad actor on the world stage,"" said Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley , one of the resolution's sponsors. US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry has warned that Saudi Arabia will look to China or Russia to develop its nuclear industry if the US fails to cooperate. House Democrats in February claimed that in 2017 White House officials had pushed the sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia despite warnings from National Security Council officials . A spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, said the report amounted to ""a ridiculous conspiracy theory."" In heated exchanges at the Senate Armed Services committee at the end of March, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said that if the United States did not cooperate with the Saudis, they would look to Russia or China to develop their nuclear industry. ""I can assure you that those two countries don't give a tinker's damn about non-proliferation,"" Perry said. ""That's why we continue to work very, very diligently to try to bring those countries that want to develop civil nuclear programs into the sphere of the United States, because we are committed to non-proliferation."" Day by day it becomes clearer to the world what was always clear to us: neither human rights nor a nuclear program have been the real concern of the U.S. First a dismembered journalist; now illicit sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia fully expose #USHypocrisy .
— Javad Zarif (@JZarif) February 20, 2019 Perry said his department had approved several applications for US companies to sell nuclear power technology and assistance to Saudi Arabia. However, they do not allow the transfer of nuclear material, equipment or components. Iran claims that the Trump Administration plans to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear technology without sufficient safeguards. ""First a dismembered journalist; now illicit sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia fully expose #USHypocrisy,"" Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted in February. And in March, Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, accused unnamed regional states of developing ""suspicious nuclear projects,"" which would force Tehran to revise its defense strategy. Quote: d by Iranian news agencies , Shamkhani said such plans would ""force us to revise our strategy."" Whatever Saudi Arabia's energy strategy, and however sincere its pledge that it has no wish to develop nuclear weapons, the mere existence of a nuclear program is bound to inflame tensions across the Gulf."

Mueller witnesses worry about release of testimony - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,"Ben Geldon, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/inside-politics-forecast-april-7-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast.
1. Mueller witness worries From CNN chief national correspondent John King : Most of Washington is waiting to learn how much of the Mueller report will be made public, and whether Congress gets, as Democrats demand, access to the special counsel's interview transcripts and working files. But there is one group with perhaps a unique stake in how this transparency debate plays out: Current and former Trump administration officials who cooperated with the special counsel investigation. Their concern: that their accounts about the President's temper and work habits will infuriate the President if he gets to read them -- or sees media accounts about them. Read More ""Very high,"" is how one Republican source described the tension on this question. ""They cooperated and had to tell the truth. He is going to go bonkers."" That account is from a GOP source who in recent days has been in touch with several current and former officials who were interviewed by and shared documents with the special counsel. The source's take was backed up by a former senior administration official who spent hours being interviewed by investigators. This official, in a weekend exchange with CNN, said any ""fair and thorough"" account of what he shared would detail an effort ""to be truthful and explain the President's perspective."" But the official also conceded just the fact that so many White House aides cooperated gets under the President's skin and ""some truths about how"" he conducts himself would without a doubt make the President angry if he were to read them. 2. Iowa voters feeling the ""Bern""? Sen. Bernie Sanders isn't your typical Democratic presidential candidate -- he's not even officially a Democrat. But after weeks of big crowds, strong fundraising and high poll numbers, AP Washington bureau chief Julie Pace says it's clear he's a frontrunner for the nomination. ""His fundraising far surpasses his rivals, and the energy among his crowds was really palpable,"" said Pace, who spent part of the week in Iowa covering the Vermont senator. ""What's really interesting about Sanders is that he's not doing much different than he did in 2016,"" Pace said. ""With the exception of a few references to Trump, the remarks he's given could have been from a 2016 rally or any of his congressional rallies from years past. It really goes to the core of Sanders' belief in this campaign, which is that his 2016 effort was not a fluke and he will win by moving voters to where he is, not by changing his strategy."" 3. Democrats' 2020 money chase Sanders is leading so far in the money race but Washington Post chief correspondent Dan Balz said none of the candidates' numbers are particularly impressive so far. ""The Center for Responsive Politics noted this week that they all appear to be lagging past campaigns,"" Balz said. ""If you go back to 2007 in the first quarter, Hillary Clinton raised about $26 million. Barack Obama raised $25 million, John Edwards raised $14 million."" Sanders, by contrast, raised about $18 million in the first quarter. Sen. Kamala Harris was second with $12 million, followed by Beto O'Rourke with more than $9 million. Several candidates have yet to report their numbers, which must be submitted to the FEC by April 15. ""What this tells us is there is a lot of money on the sidelines,"" Balz said. ""And how much is this grassroots money really going to be there, and how will it be distributed?"" 4. Transgender troop restrictions take effect this week Also this week, the Trump administration's restrictions on transgender troops go into effect after the Supreme Court declined to stop it. ""The Defense Department wouldn't necessarily call it a ban, but it is a change in how transgender military people are treated,"" Vice News DC bureau chief Shawna Thomas said. ""What I'm most interested in seeing is what does it mean for those who are grandfathered in? There are some members of the military who will get to keep their jobs, but it's going to be much more difficult for them to commission, to ascend into other careers or to cross-train."" 5. Lawmakers to grill Pompeo on Khashoggi Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be back in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week -- and CNN's senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju said he should expect lawmakers to grill him on the US-Saudi relationship and the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. ""The administration has provided briefings to this committee in the past several weeks. Democrats and Republicans came out not satisfied by it,"" Raju said. Congress may decide to punish Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who intelligence officials blame for Khashoggi's murder. ""There is a bipartisan bill before this very committee to slap Saudi Arabia with sanctions,"" Raju said. ""The chairman of that committee, Jim Risch, has put the brakes on that for now as he's tried to discuss other alternative ways of going forward. But nevertheless, pressure is building even as the administration continues to side with Saudi Arabia because of economic concerns."""
Motel 6 will pay $12 million after several locations gave their guest lists to ICE - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/motel-6-immigration-customs-enforcement-settlement/index.html,"(CNN) Motel 6 will pay $12 million to settle a lawsuit that said several Washington state locations gave their guest lists to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to the state attorney general's office.
Between 2015 and 2017, seven Motel 6 locations in the state shared approximately 80,000 guests' personal information with ICE without requiring a warrant, Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office said in a news release this week . Trump's border shutdown threat left them in limbo. Here's what they want you to know The guest lists contained private information of all guests at the hotel, violating their expectation of privacy. The hotel chain's disclosures ""resulted in ICE's targeted investigation of many guests with Latino-sounding names,"" the statement said. Motel 6's actions led to ""significant harmful consequences, including the detention and deportation of many guests and the suffering of their families."" The hotel chain admitted during the attorney general's investigation that at least six of its Washington state locations shared guests' information with ICE, according to the news release. The investigation revealed a seventh location also gave information to immigration authorities. Read More ""Motel 6's actions tore families apart and violate the privacy rights of tens of thousands of Washingtonians,"" Ferguson said in the statement. ""Our resolution holds Motel 6 accountable for illegally handing over guests' private information without a warrant."" ""Any other business that tries to violate Washingtonians' right to privacy can expect to hear from my office,"" he added. Trump punts to Congress to solve the migrant influx, where lawmakers remain at square one The attorney general's office said the $12 million would go towards monetary damages for the 80,000 guests whose information was given to federal immigration authorities. A Motel 6 spokesperson confirmed in a statement it had reached a settlement agreement, and said it would ""continue to enforce its guest privacy policy, which prohibits the sharing of guest information except in cases where a judicially enforceable warrant or subpoena is present, or local law requires this information."" ""The safety and security of our guests, which includes protecting guest information, is our top priority, and we are pleased to be able to reach resolution in this matter."" Ferguson's office filed the lawsuit in January 2018 after two Motel 6 locations in Arizona were accused of giving guests' information to federal immigration agents. The chain reached a tentative settlement agreement in that case last summer."
Are calls for 2020 candidates to reject big money hurting candidates of color? - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Fredreka Schouten,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/battle-over-super-pacs-and-candidates-of-color/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A new fight has erupted in the battle over big money in the 2020 White House election: Outside groups that support candidates of color are warning that calls for presidential contenders to disavow super PACs risk cutting off a crucial avenue for engaging minority voters.
""We agree that money in politics is a problem,"" said Quentin James, the co-founder of The Collective PAC, a super PAC that has supported African-American candidates. ""But the way to solve that is not to put our hands behind our backs and try to fight this battle in 2020."" The pushback comes as the crowded Democratic field faces pressure from progressives to take stands to keep special-interest money out of the Democratic nomination process. Most of the 2020 candidates have rejected money from corporate PACs, and many have said they do not want single-candidate super PACs engaged in their races. One contender, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has gone further, refusing to even attend high-dollar fundraisers . Super PACs, a byproduct of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision and a related appeals court ruling, can raise money from virtually any source, including corporations, but they are barred from coordinating the spending with the candidates they support. Read More Their power was on display in the 2018 election: Just 10 mega-donors contributed a combined $436 million to influence federal races, a tally by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics shows. By contrast, an individual cannot donate more than $2,800 directly to a candidate for the primary or general election in 2020. James said trying to root out super PACs that support individual candidates ignores the reality some candidates of color face: They don't have access to traditional pools of donors or long experience building digital programs to reach grassroots contributors. His group and its arms raised a collective $6.5 million in recent years and provided early backing to Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum -- the 2018 gubernatorial candidates in Georgia and Florida, respectively. Abrams and Gillum took on establishment candidates to win their primaries and became the first black gubernatorial nominees in their states. They lost in the general election. The 2020 field includes two black US senators, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Sen. Cory Booker, along with a Latino contender, former House and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. All have said they do not want super PACs engaged in their races, although a Booker ally, San Francisco lawyer Steve Phillips, has launched one. Harris, the second black woman elected to the US Senate, has reported raising a solid $12 million during the first fundraising quarter of the year. But she was outraised by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who built a massive small-donor base during his 2016 presidential bid. Sanders raised $18.2 million in 41 days . On Sunday, Booker announced he raised $5 million during the first quarter — a number that puts him behind fundraising leaders. Castro has not released his totals but told CNN on Friday that he had not yet met the 65,000-donor threshold to join the early Democratic Party debates. New Democratic Party rules set minimum polling and donor requirements for candidates to qualify for the first two presidential debates this summer. Only a tiny fraction of Americans donates to politicians in the first place. A little more than 1.5 million people gave more than $200 to federal candidates during last year's midterm elections -- or less than half of 1% of the US population, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 'Yet another barrier' African Americans are an important voting bloc for Democrats. They accounted for nearly one in four voters who participated in Democratic primaries or caucuses in 2016, according to a CNN analysis of entrance and exit polls in 27 states. But the racial wealth gap -- white households have about 6.5 times the wealth of black households -- means fewer African Americans have the tradition of contributing money to candidates, said Kimberly Peeler-Allen, the co-founder of Higher Heights. Higher Heights operates a political action committee that supports black women running for office. ""When you have donors who don't have this institutional habit of giving politically -- whether they are giving $5 a month or maxed-out checks -- it makes the whole process of being able to fund candidates who will carry the voices of candidates of color forward, that much harder,"" she told CNN. Disavowing super PACs and other outside groups could set ""up yet another barrier"" for qualified candidates of color, Peeler-Allen said. But rejecting big money in politics increasingly has become a litmus test for progressives in the Democratic Party. Nine liberal groups last month issued an open letter to the 2020 Democratic presidential field, urging all candidates to reject candidate-specific super PACs. ""Single-candidate super PACs fundamentally take power and influence away from everyday people and put it in the hands of big-money donors,"" according to the letter. Signatories included the watchdog group Public Citizen and End Citizens United, a group dedicated to overturning the 2010 ruling. James and his wife, Stefanie Brown James, who co-founded The Collective PAC, have released their own open letter in response and have asked the progressive groups to withdraw their demands. ""One of the few sources of funding for the work to engage voters of color and support candidates of color has come from super PACs,"" they wrote. Politico first reported on the Collective PAC's letter. Taking the moral high ground on money ""sounds cool in a campaign speech,"" James told CNN. ""But that's not what's happening day-to-day. That's not how we were able to help Andrew (Gillum) win his primary."" Patrick Burgwinkle, a spokesman for End Citizens United, said his group objects to single-candidate super PACs because they can ""act as a shadow arm"" of a campaign, allowing candidates to circumvent federal donation limits. He signaled that his group would not object to outside political organizations working on broader issues, such as voter outreach. ""We believe voter engagement, registration, and turnout in communities of color is fundamentally important to a Democrat's ability to be successful in 2020,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""All candidates need to work and dedicate resources to build long-lasting relationships in communities of color."" Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, said the real solution is to ""democratize the funding"" for all candidates by publicly financing campaigns and encouraging small-dollar contributions. ""Super PACs are not a democratizing force,"" he said. ""They are an expression of the political power of concentrated wealth."" This story has been updated."
Kudlow says Trump not interfering with the Fed - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Paul R. La Monica,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/business/larry-kudlow-state-of-the-union-fed/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) A top economic adviser to President Donald Trump defended the plan to nominate Stephen Moore and Herman Cain for spots on the Federal Reserve on CNN Sunday.
Larry Kudlow, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that Trump ""has every right to put people on the Federal Reserve Board with a different point of view."" Much like Trump, Moore has criticized the Fed -- and Fed chair Jerome Powell in particular -- for boosting interest rates several times last year. The central bank has reversed course on rate hikes and sent signals that no rate hikes are likely this year. That's boosted the stock market back near record levels. But Moore has argued that the Fed should go further and lower rates. Read More Cain has not explicitly called for rate cuts as of late. But the 2012 Republican presidential candidate did say in an i nterview with Fox Business Network in February that the Fed should be more worried about deflation than inflation right now. The Fed typically raises rates to combat inflation. Several economic and market experts -- as well as business leaders -- have expressed concerns that neither Moore nor Cain are the most qualified candidates to serve on the Fed. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon said on Thursday that they are ""not the right people"" to be on the Fed's board. Cain, the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza, has served on the Kansas City Fed's board of directors though. Why politicizing the Federal Reserve could have dangerous consequences Moore was an adviser on Cain's presidential bid and advised Trump for his 2016 campaign. (Moore joined CNN as a contributor in 2017 but the network said he would no longer appear on air following the news of his planned nomination to the Fed.) Some worry that Trump is trying to sway the Fed with his picks. The central bank was established to be an apolitical entity whose job is to try and ensure maximum employment and price stability by setting interest rates. Kudlow told Tapper Sunday that the president ""wants people on the Fed who share his philosophy. This is not a political issue."" But the president has expressed his unhappiness with Powell's Fed decisions numerous times on Twitter and in media interviews. Kudlow vehemently denied that this was the case though, telling Tapper that ""we aren't interfering with the Fed's independence."" Kudlow added that Cain, who dropped out of the 2012 presidential race following allegations of sexual harassment, was in the process of being vetted by the White House."
Larry Kudlow says Trump's threat to impose tariff on Mexican cars is just a 'warning' that should be heeded - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/larry-kudlow-mexican-cars-tariff/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday he doesn't believe President Donald Trump will make good on his threat to impose a 25% tariff on cars made south of the border if Mexico doesn't help stem the flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States, saying it's just a ""warning"" that should be heeded.
""Regarding the threat of tariffs, (the) President believes that the border issue, the border security, the wall, the breakdown in immigration are very important issues -- including the drug trafficking. So he is saying, if need be, he may have to take the emergency steps to deal with that. He is not about to do it. He has pulled back a wee bit. He's just issuing a warning, and if you know this President as I do, you better listen to him,"" Kudlow told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" Trump's threat to override new NAFTA with tariff on Mexican cars could undermine ratification The threat from Trump came last week after he walked back his threat to close the US-Mexico border in an effort to quell immigration into the US. After saying Thursday he would give Mexico a year to step up, he backpedaled a day later, tweeting Friday that Mexico is ""for the first time in decades"" apprehending illegal immigrants before crossing the border. ""However, if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesn't work, which it will, I will close the Border,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""This will supersede USMCA,"" he added, referring to his pending US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The ratification of the deal could be undermined by the tariff threat, which Kudlow said was Trump ""just making a very strong statement."" Read More ""I think, over the fullness of time, we will be able to work out border security reform and the wall and immigration reform without interfering with the USMCA trade deal, which is a terrific deal for the United States and its workforce,"" Kudlow said Sunday."
Iran flooding kills 70 after record rainfalls,us.cnn.com,Hira Humayun,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/middleeast/iran-flood-fatalities/index.html,"(CNN) Seventy people have died in flooding in Iran after record rainfalls began saturating parts of the country last month, state-run media reported.

Flash flooding kills 19, injures more than 100 in southwest Iran The semi-official Mehr News agency says record rainfalls since March 19 have so far flooded some 1,900 cities and villages across Iran, causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to water and agriculture infrastructures. ""Over 140 rivers have burst their banks and some 409 landslides have been reported in the country, it reported , adding that 78 roads had been blocked and 84 bridges in flood-stricken areas affected.

""The United States stands ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief."" Iran's Foreign Minister responded angrily on Twitter two days later . ""It seems the US Secretary of State is unaware of the mismanagement of natural disasters in the US over the past two years, and hence opines -- in an unprofessional, interventionist and demagogic manner -- on Iran's management of the horrific and unprecedented floods which simultaneously afflicted 24 provinces,"" Zarif said, before referencing Hurricanes Harvey, Michael and Florence and Maria."
Get ready for awful corporate earnings,us.cnn.com,Paul R. La Monica,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/investing/stocks-week-ahead-earnings/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) 1. Weak first quarter, but the rest of 2019 should be OK: The first quarter is over. Now we're about to find out just how bad it was for big American companies.
Earnings probably fell in the first three months of the year. But investors have largely looked past that. The Dow is up 13% so far in 2019 and is not far from its all-time high. The S&P 500 has surged 15% while the Nasdaq has skyrocketed nearly 20%. The market is predicting that profit growth will return to near double-digit levels by the fourth quarter. So investors will need to pay close attention to what CEOs say about the remainder of 2019 in their earnings calls. S&P 500 EPS growth forecasts Q1: -4.2% Q2: 0.0% Q3: +1.6% Q4: +8.2%
Source: FactSet Research
""Unless this quarter's earnings are much worse than consensus, the more important thing will be the guidance,"" said Cliff Corso, executive chairman of Insight North America. Corso thinks that earnings for the full year could wind up increasing around 5% thanks to strength in the second half. That's not fantastic but it might be good enough to keep the market rally going -- albeit at a less explosive rate than previous years. Read More ""This year's earnings are probably not a recipe for a blockbuster market return, but there is no viable alternative for investors."" Market valuations: Not too hot. Not too cold. Just right? Concerns about an imminent recession should continue to fade, notes Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager and founder of investment firm InfraCap. Hatfield thinks that stocks are still reasonably priced, if not necessarily cheap. The S&P 500 is currently trading at around 17 times earnings forecasts for this year. That's roughly in line with its historical average. ""There are no sectors overheated and imploding right now. The market is not a screaming buy but it's not overvalued either. There are still some bargains,"" Hatfield said, adding that he thinks banks and energy stocks look particularly attractive. So investors should be looking at sectors that would benefit from the continued economic expansion in the United States, says Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy at Sun Life Investment Management. Now is not the time to get skittish and defensive. ""It's still a good idea to be bullish and exposed to growth. People will be rewarded for sticking with stocks right now,"" Mullarkey said. 2. Banking on the banks: JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report earnings Friday. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently told investors in the company's annual report that the bank's profits got a big boost last year from corporate tax cuts. Dimon may talk more about that, as well as his recent criticism of President Donald Trump's latest two choices for open spots on the Federal Reserve , in calls with reporters and analysts. As for Wells Fargo, expect questions about the scandal-ridden company's search for a new CEO now that Tim Sloan has stepped down . Investors are hoping for signs that earnings at both banks will improve later this year. Revenue is expected to be flat at JPMorgan Chase in the first quarter and down at Wells Fargo. There are concerns about how low interest rates will impact their businesses. 3. Delta flies high: The airline giant has already forecast earnings for the first quarter to be better than expected thanks to fuel costs rising at a less dramatic pace than it had originally anticipated.

Three members of Congress will be denied access to facility housing unaccompanied migrant children - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kevin Bohn,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/democrats-migrant-children-florida/index.html,"(CNN) Three Democratic congresswomen will be denied access by the Trump Administration to tour a government-run center for unaccompanied migrant children on Monday in Homestead, Florida, according to the members of Congress and the administration.
The three members -- Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell -- announced in a statement they were told they could not tour the facility and said a new law entitles members of Congress access to tour it. All three represent districts in southern Florida. ""Denying entry to oversee the conditions and care provided to the unaccompanied children in the Homestead facility would not only be a breach of transparency and confidence in the care provided there, it would violate the law,"" the members said in the statement. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed access was being denied in a statement to CNN. ""We have had significant interest for facility visits,"" the HHS statement said. ""To ensure a facility visit does not interfere with the safety and well-being of our [children], we require a minimum two-week notification at the convenience and availability of the facility. This has been policy since 2015."" Read More Regarding the law requiring members of Congress have access, an HHS official said this: ""It meets our current statutory obligation to provide members of Congress with facility access. Indeed, most members of Congress who have sought tours this year have worked with us collaboratively and without objection to schedule tours under the policy."" The government announced last week that the center will expand its capacity to 3,200 beds from 2,350 beds. The center is run by the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement. ""Given long-held concerns about the Homestead facility's lack of staffing, space, education and other services, the recent announcement by the Department of Health and Human Services that it will dramatically expand the number of beds there merits immediate scrutiny. The Department's initial refusal to allow entry there under these current circumstances is deeply troubling. Violating the law is never acceptable, and certainly not in this critical moment,"" the three members said in the statement. Shalala and Mucarsel-Powell were part of a congressional delegation which earlier toured the facility in February. ""During our last visit to Homestead, we witnessed children living in cramped, prison-like conditions,"" the joint statement said. ""The idea to force even more children into an already full detention facility is not only unsafe, but is cruel and violates basic tenets of human decency."" As part of an appropriations bill last year, Congress prohibited federal funds ""from being used to prevent a Member of Congress from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any U.S. facility used for maintaining custody of or otherwise housing unaccompanied alien children."""
US pulls troops from Libya amid a surge in violence - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eliza Mackintosh,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/middleeast/libya-tripoli-violence-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The United States military pulled a contingent of its troops from Libya on Sunday amid a surge in violence in the capital city of Tripoli, America's top commander for Africa said.
""The security realities on the ground in Libya are growing increasingly complex and unpredictable,"" Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of US Africa Command, said Sunday in a statement. ""Even with an adjustment of the force, we will continue to remain agile in support of existing US strategy."" The American forces, who provide military support for diplomatic missions, counterterrorism activities and improving regional security, have been relocated temporarily in response to ""increased unrest."" Col. Chris Karns, spokesman for Africa Command, reiterated that the movement of troops would not impact the force's ability to respond to threats and targets. ""For security reasons, I won't pinpoint where these forces will flow,"" said Karns. ""It is important (that) groups, such as ISIS, don't have an exact map of our whereabouts, but instead we use our finite resources on the continent to adjust swiftly, efficiently, and employ with maximum effect."" Read More Years of chaotic fighting in the war-torn country have reached a crescendo in recent days as General Khalifa Haftar pushes to take control of the capital. On Sunday, his so-called Libyan National Army (LNA) said it had launched airstrikes targeting UN-backed forces in southern Tripoli. General Khalifa Haftar salutes during a military parade in Benghazi on May 7, 2018. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement calling on Haftar to stop the offensive. ""We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,"" he said in a statement Sunday. Saying there is ""no military solution to the Libya conflict,"" Pompeo called on Libyan leaders and other international partners to return to UN mediated negotiations. The United Nations Mission to Libya (UNSMIL) called for a ""humanitarian truce"" from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. local time in the south of the city, urging rival forces to halt fighting so that ambulances could safely extract civilians injured in clashes. Forces under the command of the renegade Libyan general made a surprise advance Thursday on the capital, where the country's UN-recognized government, the Government of National Accord, has its base. The GNA has announced a counteroffensive to defend Tripoli as Haftar's troops draw closer. On Sunday, spokesman for the GNA's armed forces, Mohammed Qanouno, heralded the launch of a military operation dubbed ""Volcano of Rage,"" aimed at ""cleansing all Libyan cities from the outlawed,"" Tripoli-based Libya Al-Ahrar TV reported. A spokesman for the Libyan forces of the Government of National Accord (GNA) holds a press conference in Tripoli on April 7. In the eight years since Moammar Gadhaffi was deposed and killed in the 2011 conflict, Haftar has been one of a handful of strongmen to take advantage of the nation's descent into disarray. Based in the city of Benghazi, Haftar already wields control over much of eastern Libya, but he has his sights set on claiming Tripoli. Warring militia occasionally spar for control over the heavily populated capital, which has prevented the UN-recognized and Western-backed government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj from fully grasping the reins of power. In the mix are multiple tribes competing for control of Libya's dwindling oil wealth, as well as militant groups, including ISIS, scattered across the vast country. A US citizen wants to overthrow a US-backed government in Libya. Here's why ""To our army stationed on the border of Tripoli today, we continue the march of struggle and response to the appeal of our people in the capital as we promised them,"" Haftar said in an audio recording posted on his media office's Facebook account on Thursday. He added that ""safety of our foreign guests and our institutions"" should be ensured. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Benghazi last week for talks with Haftar to push for an international peace deal, but left empty handed. Following their meeting, Guterres said he was leaving Libya ""with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli."" The UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have raised concerns over how the ongoing clashes will impact refugees and migrants stuck in detention centers in the area. ""The safety of migrants in detention is especially concerning should there be an escalation in military action,"" IOM Director General António Vitorino said in a statement on Friday. ""The fate of all Libyan civilians and the safety of humanitarian workers also remains an overriding concern."""
"Mick Mulvaney, administration officials emerge from Camp David summit planning health care rollout 'fairly shortly'",edition.cnn.com,"Sarah Westwood, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/mick-mulvaney-white-house-healthcare-plan/index.html,"(CNN) Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that the White House plans to release an Obamacare replacement plan before the 2020 election, after hosting top administration officials at Camp David over the weekend for a meeting on health care.
""I do think you'll see a plan here fairly shortly,"" Mulvaney told ""Fox News Sunday."" White House aides and administration officials -- including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- huddled at the historic Maryland property on Saturday to discuss the general path forward for President Trump's health care policy, White House aides said. The talks ranged from messaging strategies to lowering drug prices to individual health insurance marketplaces. And while Trump this week ruled out taking a vote on an Affordable Care Act alternative prior to the election amid Republican resistance to the prospect, Mulvaney said the forthcoming plan would provide GOP candidates with campaign fodder. ""Republicans have better ideas than Democrats. We should not be afraid to talk about that,"" Mulvaney said on Fox News. ""We want to run on this."" Read More Trump stunned Republicans late last month when he paired his administration's decision to back an Obamacare court challenge with a call for the GOP to develop a legislative replacement. White House allies, lawmakers and even members of Trump's own staff were caught off guard when the Justice Department filed a brief in court supporting the complete invalidation of the Affordable Care Act, without preparing anything to take its place should that ruling stand. Unhappy with the President's decision to plunge the party back into a battle it lost less than two years ago, Republicans said they would await guidance from the White House. Trump, in turn, said he would ask GOP senators to craft a plan -- leaving the White House and Congress pointing fingers at each other over who should take the lead in writing health care policy. White House aides have cited Graham-Cassidy, a health care proposal floated in 2017, as their starting point for the development of a plan. But even Trump's legislative team was surprised by the news that the President wanted a renewed focus on health care, and the administration has scrambled to come up with a plan that did not exist before Trump waded back into the issue. Top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, privately attempted to persuade Trump that a health care push would not only fail, but backfire on Republicans running up and down the ticket in 2020, multiple sources told CNN last week. Trump on Wednesday claimed he never intended to request a vote before next year's election, noting he had ""very talented people"" working on a replacement plan for him. ""It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare,"" Trump tweeted. ""This will be a great campaign issue."" Democrats running in 2018 midterm races seized on voters' concerns about health care, and their heavy focus on the issue helped propel enough candidates to victory in Republican-held districts that the GOP lost control of the House in November. Now, Democratic presidential hopefuls are spending significant time on the campaign trail talking about health care -- with many candidates promoting universal programs like ""Medicare for All."" Mulvaney on Sunday argued Republicans, who tried unsuccessfully in 2017 to pass health care reform when they controlled both chambers of Congress, need competing ideas to present to voters in 2020. ""You can't beat something with nothing,"" he said. ""Democrats have already admitted that Obamacare doesn't work -- that's why they're out there talking about this amorphous Medicare for All,"" he said."

""Over 140 rivers have burst their banks and some 409 landslides have been reported in the country, it reported , adding that 78 roads had been blocked and 84 bridges in flood-stricken areas affected.

""The United States stands ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief."" Iran's Foreign Minister responded angrily on Twitter two days later .

Theresa May gambles it all in last-ditch bid to deliver Brexit,rss.cnn.com,"Analysis by Jane Merrick, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/wr6SToqsP6M/index.html,"(CNN) Theresa May has faced many crucial moments in her quest to make Brexit happen. She has also taken risks that have not paid off -- especially her decision in 2017 to call an unnecessary election that resulted in her throwing away her party's majority in Parliament.
Now, May is about to make her biggest gamble yet, and whatever happens, it is likely to be her last as Prime Minister. Amid howls of protest from her own Conservative ranks, May is seeking a compromise Brexit deal with the opposition Labour party. Talks began last week and will continue over the next few hours and days to try to agree a plan that can be backed by a majority in the House of Commons. The timetable is tight. The Prime Minister needs a new deal to present to European Union leaders at their summit on Wednesday. If that plan is rejected by Brussels, the UK is leaving the EU without a deal on Friday. Theresa May admits she can't pass her Brexit deal without Labour Until last week, May had ignored calls to reach out across the Commons to seek a compromise, preferring instead to try to persuade the hardliner Brexiteer faction of her own party to come round to supporting her original deal, which was struck with Brussels all the way back in November. Yet dozens of them remained opposed, and her deal has been defeated three times in Parliament by both Tory and opposition lawmakers. Read More May has slowly reduced the margin of loss with each successive vote, but there is simply not enough support -- or time left on the clock -- to keep pressing the same deal. So May had no choice but to open talks with Labour, given that the alternative was to contradict her own position and the will of Parliament by accepting an economically damaging no-deal Brexit. But the specter of her striking a bargain with Jeremy Corbyn, regarded by Tories as a hard-left Marxist, has caused outrage among some ministers and MPs, particularly those who are preparing to stand for Conservative leader when May eventually steps down. Despite the backlash, the Prime Minister is holding firm. On Saturday night, she issued a statement insisting she had no choice but to compromise with Labour, because otherwise Brexit would ""slip through our fingers"" and never happen at all. Theresa May's plan for another Brexit delay has gone down badly in Europe As it is, a long delay is already on the cards: this week May is asking for an extension to the Brexit deadline until June 30, and under the terms of the so-called ""flextension"" of up to a year proposed by European Council President Donald Tusk, the departure date could be even later. By sticking to her strategy of holding talks with Corbyn, May is risking a civil war in her own party. In those talks, Corbyn and his allies have made clear the Prime Minister needs to give more ground -- particularly on the subject of a future customs union with the EU after Brexit. May's original deal already included a customs arrangement of sorts, but Labour wants the government to go further. In the end, it could come down to finessing the words. The Brexiteer cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom, when asked on the BBC on Sunday whether she would support a customs union in a new deal, said ""it depends what it means ... we can't be purist about it. We are at the point where Brexit is slipping away altogether ... Provided we are leaving the European Union, it is important that we compromise, and it is through gritted teeth."" Not all of Leadsom's fellow Brexiteers agree. Germany once pleaded with Britain to stay in the EU. Now the love has cooled On the other side, Labour maintains that the Prime Minister needs to make more concessions. In her statement on Saturday, May left the door open to a customs union -- and to a second referendum on Brexit -- by conspicuously leaving those proposals out of her list of red lines. Ending freedom of movement by people from the EU to Britain, a position on which both the government and Labour agree, remained in there. This is the fertile ground for compromise. A new deal that contains a form of a customs union could pass the Commons this week -- before Wednesday's EU summit -- as it could gain the support of Conservative lawmakers loyal to May, as well as Labour and other opposition parties. Yet it would cause outrage among the Brexiteer wing of her party, as well as among rank and file Conservative activists and members, many of whom are reportedly refusing to campaign for or donate to the party. May's Conservatives are on the brink. By embarking on this compromise, the Prime Minister is, then, about to gamble the future of her party -- from grassroots to MPs -- as well as the unity of her cabinet on a last-chance bid to deliver Brexit. If this fails, then everything fails: Brexit, her premiership and her party. She would have to quit and possibly even call a general election. But if she succeeds, she will have finally achieved what she pledged to do when she became Prime Minister: deliver Brexit. It will have come at a great personal and political sacrifice."

A US citizen wants to overthrow a US-backed government in Libya. right here's why,www.cnn.com,Good King News,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/05/africa/libya-khalifa-haftar-tripoli-analysis-intl/index.html/,"A US citizen wants to overthrow a US-backed government in Libya. right here's why By 2 Share
Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who at present leads the present motion of forces from the east to the capital Tripoli, is on the coronary heart of this initiative. Haftar is, to be well mannered, the last word pragmatist. He supported Muammar Gaddafi throughout his 1969 coup, then returned to Langley, Virginia in the 1990s, the place he obtained US citizenship, earlier than returning to overthrow Gaddafi through the battle. from 2011. Since then, he has been certainly one of many robust males to declare prominence in the nation's turmoil, primarily based in town of Benghazi and exercising the majority of his management in the east. of Libya.
It is unclear to what extent Haftar actually wants to settle in Tripoli, the densely populated capital the place belligerent militias generally train management, thus stopping the government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, acknowledged by the UN and supported by the West, to absolutely grasp the reins of energy.
A western diplomat in town, who didn’t need to be named to focus on a delicate topic, stated that Mr. Haftar was most likely between the place and the definitive gesture in the capital. The consequence may very well be extraordinarily bloody or, given the unscrupulous nature of energy struggles and behind-the-scenes negotiations in Libya, fairly shortly. It can also be happening with a little daring, simply because the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, is current in the nation. Guterres flew Friday between Tripoli and Benghazi to mediate.
On Friday morning, Haftar spokesman Ahmed al-Mesmari stated from Benghazi that his forces had been nonetheless transferring ahead. ""The people of Tripoli, hopefully, will witness the victories of the armed forces in carrying out the main mission of the war on terror, which is to purge the capital,"" he advised the Agency. France-Presse. ""Therefore, law enforcement in the capital will have an effect on the whole country.""
""There will be other centers that will be open in the coming hours for the progression to Tripoli from several angles and locations."" Important forces have now been designated: about two groups, the sunshine infantry and the air drive. mechanized infantry, ""stated Mesmari.
Libyans should now search for some stability, the quarrels of Tripoli having reached a level of absurdity. The final time I used to be there in 2016, the Sarraj government proclaimed its dominance. A spokesman for a fairly empty and model new workplace advised me to ignore the Libya Dawn motion, which ran many of the capital, and to solely settle for the visas of him. The present was going out, and one may guess the placement of a financial institution in the lengthy line of individuals exterior. Things solely bought worse.
Haftar has been strengthened in latest years. The sources of his energy are simple to guess, however troublesome to show. Neighboring Egypt has been sympathetic. Moscow too, though on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov advised reporters: ""The essential factor is that the actions don’t lead to a renewed massacre … Moscow doesn’t take part.
However, Moscow has courted Haftar and made him go to the plane provider Admiral Kuznetsov in 2017. Ukrainian intelligence officers have proven Russian plane trajectories that, in accordance to them, have dropped off Russian mercenaries in Moscow. Benghazi and Tobruk. The proof, they are saying, of Russia utilizing its new most popular type of proxy to strengthen the robust Libyan man of the east.
Could this be the explanation for the brand new spring in Haftar's army march? Is it a present of drive to refine his place with Guterres as he discusses his political ambitions? It's unclear. But Libya has not seen such a decisive motion for years, and few have felt so troubled about its significance. Share this:"

A moment of silence was held at 3:20 p.m., the time police say the 33-year-old was shot a week ago at The Marathon Clothing store. It was organized by the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable. Rapper was more movement than musician ""Here was a young man who was not exclusively about the bling, flash, cash, cars, party, fun, and the fast life.

In the song, Nipsey discusses his commitment to achieving his goals despite his circumstances. The tributes follow a coast-to-coast outpouring of love for the Eritrean-American rapper , who was respected not only for his artistry but for his devotion to the Crenshaw District where he grew up.

Two of his mixtapes -- ""Slauson Boy Vol. 1"" and ""Crenshaw"" -- took their names from the area. The Marathon Clothing store sits near West Slauson Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard.

Street gangs, meanwhile, brokered a truce in Nipsey's honor, with a former leader of the Crips (and reportedly Nipsey's onetime manager), Eugene Henley, announcing on Instagram that they had organized a Friday march among ""Bloods, Crips with a like mind, that want to support and pay homage to one of our lost soldiers, one of our good brothers and teachers and leaders."" Nipsey was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips, and Eric Holder, who police accuse of killing the rapper, is believed to belong to a gang as well, though Police Chief Michel Moore declined to specify gang affiliations. The shooting came after a dispute between Holder and the rapper and does not appear gang-related, the chief said. Holder pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge of murder and two counts of attempted murder, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said.

The number puts Booker well behind the leaders of the 2020 pack — including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who raked in $18.2 million during the first 41 days of his campaign; and Sen. Kamala Harris, who brought in $12 million over a longer period — as well as some lesser-known rivals, like Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke who announced he raised $9.4 million in the first 18 days of his campaign and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who announced raising roughly $7 million in his campaign's exploratory phase . ""I feel incredible,"" Booker said Sunday of his fundraising numbers during a stop in New Hampshire. ""We set goals for ourselves and we surpassed our own goals, we're seeing incredible energy and enthusiasm everywhere we go in this campaign."" Booker also touted a total of $6.1 million cash on hand, a sum some of his rivals, like Buttigieg and Harris, did not disclose. The figure suggests a relatively low burn rate for Booker; it also indicates that he transferred some money from his Senate account. But Booker's email reported that there remains more money left in that bucket available to be tapped at a later date. Are calls for 2020 candidates to reject big money hurting candidates of color? The numbers overall suggest that, while Booker's campaign should have no problem keeping the lights on, he is not among the fundraising powerhouses in this race, particularly in grassroots fundraising — a useful marker of enthusiasm at this stage. Read More Although Booker's campaign touted an average online donation of $34, it did not announce an average overall donation; and even as the campaign said that 82% of donors gave for the first time, it did not confirm the total number of donors to his campaign, as other campaigns have.

"Mick Mulvaney, administration officials emerge from Camp David summit planning health care rollout 'fairly shortly' CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,"Sarah Westwood, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/mick-mulvaney-white-house-healthcare-plan/index.html,"(CNN) Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that the White House plans to release an Obamacare replacement plan before the 2020 election, after hosting top administration officials at Camp David over the weekend for a meeting on health care.
""I do think you'll see a plan here fairly shortly,"" Mulvaney told ""Fox News Sunday."" White House aides and administration officials -- including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- huddled at the historic Maryland property on Saturday to discuss the general path forward for President Trump's health care policy, White House aides said. The talks ranged from messaging strategies to lowering drug prices to individual health insurance marketplaces. And while Trump this week ruled out taking a vote on an Affordable Care Act alternative prior to the election amid Republican resistance to the prospect, Mulvaney said the forthcoming plan would provide GOP candidates with campaign fodder. ""Republicans have better ideas than Democrats. We should not be afraid to talk about that,"" Mulvaney said on Fox News. ""We want to run on this."" Read More Trump stunned Republicans late last month when he paired his administration's decision to back an Obamacare court challenge with a call for the GOP to develop a legislative replacement. White House allies, lawmakers and even members of Trump's own staff were caught off guard when the Justice Department filed a brief in court supporting the complete invalidation of the Affordable Care Act, without preparing anything to take its place should that ruling stand. Unhappy with the President's decision to plunge the party back into a battle it lost less than two years ago, Republicans said they would await guidance from the White House. Trump, in turn, said he would ask GOP senators to craft a plan -- leaving the White House and Congress pointing fingers at each other over who should take the lead in writing health care policy. White House aides have cited Graham-Cassidy, a health care proposal floated in 2017, as their starting point for the development of a plan. But even Trump's legislative team was surprised by the news that the President wanted a renewed focus on health care, and the administration has scrambled to come up with a plan that did not exist before Trump waded back into the issue. Top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, privately attempted to persuade Trump that a health care push would not only fail, but backfire on Republicans running up and down the ticket in 2020, multiple sources told CNN last week. Trump on Wednesday claimed he never intended to request a vote before next year's election, noting he had ""very talented people"" working on a replacement plan for him. ""It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare,"" Trump tweeted. ""This will be a great campaign issue."" Democrats running in 2018 midterm races seized on voters' concerns about health care, and their heavy focus on the issue helped propel enough candidates to victory in Republican-held districts that the GOP lost control of the House in November. Now, Democratic presidential hopefuls are spending significant time on the campaign trail talking about health care -- with many candidates promoting universal programs like ""Medicare for All."" Mulvaney on Sunday argued Republicans, who tried unsuccessfully in 2017 to pass health care reform when they controlled both chambers of Congress, need competing ideas to present to voters in 2020.

Three members of Congress will be denied access to facility housing unaccompanied migrant children CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Kevin Bohn,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/democrats-migrant-children-florida/index.html,"(CNN) Three Democratic congresswomen will be denied access by the Trump Administration to tour a government-run center for unaccompanied migrant children on Monday in Homestead, Florida, according to the members of Congress and the administration.
The three members -- Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell -- announced in a statement they were told they could not tour the facility and said a new law entitles members of Congress access to tour it. All three represent districts in southern Florida. ""Denying entry to oversee the conditions and care provided to the unaccompanied children in the Homestead facility would not only be a breach of transparency and confidence in the care provided there, it would violate the law,"" the members said in the statement. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed access was being denied in a statement to CNN. ""We have had significant interest for facility visits,"" the HHS statement said. ""To ensure a facility visit does not interfere with the safety and well-being of our [children], we require a minimum two-week notification at the convenience and availability of the facility. This has been policy since 2015."" Read More Regarding the law requiring members of Congress have access, an HHS official said this: ""It meets our current statutory obligation to provide members of Congress with facility access. Indeed, most members of Congress who have sought tours this year have worked with us collaboratively and without objection to schedule tours under the policy."" The government announced last week that the center will expand its capacity to 3,200 beds from 2,350 beds. The center is run by the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement. ""Given long-held concerns about the Homestead facility's lack of staffing, space, education and other services, the recent announcement by the Department of Health and Human Services that it will dramatically expand the number of beds there merits immediate scrutiny. The Department's initial refusal to allow entry there under these current circumstances is deeply troubling. Violating the law is never acceptable, and certainly not in this critical moment,"" the three members said in the statement. Shalala and Mucarsel-Powell were part of a congressional delegation which earlier toured the facility in February. ""During our last visit to Homestead, we witnessed children living in cramped, prison-like conditions,"" the joint statement said. ""The idea to force even more children into an already full detention facility is not only unsafe, but is cruel and violates basic tenets of human decency."" As part of an appropriations bill last year, Congress prohibited federal funds ""from being used to prevent a Member of Congress from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any U.S. facility used for maintaining custody of or otherwise housing unaccompanied alien children."""
Cory Booker's campaign releases first quarter fundraising numbers of 2020 campaign CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Rebecca Buck,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/cory-booker-fundraising-numbers/index.html,"(CNN) Cory Booker raised more than $5 million during the first quarter of his presidential campaign, the New Jersey senator announced in an email to supporters Sunday.
The number puts Booker well behind the leaders of the 2020 pack — including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who raked in $18.2 million during the first 41 days of his campaign; and Sen. Kamala Harris, who brought in $12 million over a longer period — as well as some lesser-known rivals, like Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke who announced he raised $9.4 million in the first 18 days of his campaign and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who announced raising roughly $7 million in his campaign's exploratory phase . ""I feel incredible,"" Booker said Sunday of his fundraising numbers during a stop in New Hampshire. ""We set goals for ourselves and we surpassed our own goals, we're seeing incredible energy and enthusiasm everywhere we go in this campaign."" Booker also touted a total of $6.1 million cash on hand, a sum some of his rivals, like Buttigieg and Harris, did not disclose. The figure suggests a relatively low burn rate for Booker; it also indicates that he transferred some money from his Senate account. But Booker's email reported that there remains more money left in that bucket available to be tapped at a later date. Are calls for 2020 candidates to reject big money hurting candidates of color? The numbers overall suggest that, while Booker's campaign should have no problem keeping the lights on, he is not among the fundraising powerhouses in this race, particularly in grassroots fundraising — a useful marker of enthusiasm at this stage. Read More Although Booker's campaign touted an average online donation of $34, it did not announce an average overall donation; and even as the campaign said that 82% of donors gave for the first time, it did not confirm the total number of donors to his campaign, as other campaigns have. During a swing through New Hampshire on Saturday, prior to his campaign's fundraising announcement, Booker downplayed the importance of his first quarter numbers. ""I think this election is not going to be decided by money,"" Booker said. ""We're going to raise the money that we need to run our plan."""
Enormous python captured at Florida nature preserve,us.cnn.com,Chandrika Narayan,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/florida-huge-python-captured-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The Burmese python is one of the largest snakes in the world. But even by python standards, this one was colossal.
Scientists caught a female python in the Florida Everglades that was more than 17 feet long, weighed 140 pounds and contained 73 developing eggs. The snake is the largest python ever removed from Big Cypress National Preserve , a 729,000-acre expanse of swampland west of Miami in South Florida, according to a statement Friday on the preserve's Facebook page . The picture with the Facebook post tells it all. It shows a team of four researchers, standing apart from one another, holding up the gigantic reptile. A spokeswoman for the preserve told CNN the snake was alive in the Facebook photo but was later ""humanely euthanized"" and its eggs destroyed. Read More While pythons of all sizes have been found in the Everglades, most of them are between 6 and 10 feet long. The largest one was over 18 feet long and weighed more than 100 pounds , according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Still, this latest find is impressive. Big Cypress' rangers credit research and new tracking technology with making it possible. ""Using male pythons with radio transmitters allows the team to track the male to locate breeding females,"" their statement says. ""The team not only removes the invasive snakes, but collects data for research, develops new removal tools and learns how the pythons are using the Preserve."" The Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia, but in recent decades the big snakes have become a slithering menace in Florida. The Everglades is a vast area with a tropical climate perfect for pythons to hide and thrive. State wildlife officials estimate there are as many as 100,000 pythons living in the vast swamps outside Miami. The snakes pose significant threats to native wildlife. To control their population, Florida even holds competitions encouraging hunters to remove as many of them as possible. Conservationists in Florida sometimes use radio telemetry to track Burmese pythons. Some 1,600 people registered for the inaugural Python Challenge in 2013, organized by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The searchers found only 68 snakes. In 2017, 25 hunters were paid to euthanize pythons under a $175,000 pilot program by the South Florida Water Management District. The pythons began turning up in the Everglades in the 1980s, most likely abandoned by pet owners when the snakes got too big to handle. Some pet pythons also may have escaped from a breeding facility destroyed during Hurricane Andrew in 1992."
Are calls for 2020 candidates to reject big money hurting candidates of color? CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Fredreka Schouten,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/battle-over-super-pacs-and-candidates-of-color/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A new fight has erupted in the battle over big money in the 2020 White House election: Outside groups that support candidates of color are warning that calls for presidential contenders to disavow super PACs risk cutting off a crucial avenue for engaging minority voters.
""We agree that money in politics is a problem,"" said Quentin James, the co-founder of The Collective PAC, a super PAC that has supported African-American candidates. ""But the way to solve that is not to put our hands behind our backs and try to fight this battle in 2020."" The pushback comes as the crowded Democratic field faces pressure from progressives to take stands to keep special-interest money out of the Democratic nomination process. Most of the 2020 candidates have rejected money from corporate PACs, and many have said they do not want single-candidate super PACs engaged in their races. One contender, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has gone further, refusing to even attend high-dollar fundraisers . Super PACs, a byproduct of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision and a related appeals court ruling, can raise money from virtually any source, including corporations, but they are barred from coordinating the spending with the candidates they support. Read More Their power was on display in the 2018 election: Just 10 mega-donors contributed a combined $436 million to influence federal races, a tally by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics shows. By contrast, an individual cannot donate more than $2,800 directly to a candidate for the primary or general election in 2020. James said trying to root out super PACs that support individual candidates ignores the reality some candidates of color face: They don't have access to traditional pools of donors or long experience building digital programs to reach grassroots contributors. His group and its arms raised a collective $6.5 million in recent years and provided early backing to Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum -- the 2018 gubernatorial candidates in Georgia and Florida, respectively. Abrams and Gillum took on establishment candidates to win their primaries and became the first black gubernatorial nominees in their states. They lost in the general election. The 2020 field includes two black US senators, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Sen. Cory Booker, along with a Latino contender, former House and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. All have said they do not want super PACs engaged in their races, although a Booker ally, San Francisco lawyer Steve Phillips, has launched one. Harris, the second black woman elected to the US Senate, has reported raising a solid $12 million during the first fundraising quarter of the year. But she was outraised by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who built a massive small-donor base during his 2016 presidential bid. Sanders raised $18.2 million in 41 days . On Sunday, Booker announced he raised $5 million during the first quarter — a number that puts him behind fundraising leaders. Castro has not released his totals but told CNN on Friday that he had not yet met the 65,000-donor threshold to join the early Democratic Party debates. New Democratic Party rules set minimum polling and donor requirements for candidates to qualify for the first two presidential debates this summer. Only a tiny fraction of Americans donates to politicians in the first place. A little more than 1.5 million people gave more than $200 to federal candidates during last year's midterm elections -- or less than half of 1% of the US population, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 'Yet another barrier' African Americans are an important voting bloc for Democrats. They accounted for nearly one in four voters who participated in Democratic primaries or caucuses in 2016, according to a CNN analysis of entrance and exit polls in 27 states. But the racial wealth gap -- white households have about 6.5 times the wealth of black households -- means fewer African Americans have the tradition of contributing money to candidates, said Kimberly Peeler-Allen, the co-founder of Higher Heights. Higher Heights operates a political action committee that supports black women running for office. ""When you have donors who don't have this institutional habit of giving politically -- whether they are giving $5 a month or maxed-out checks -- it makes the whole process of being able to fund candidates who will carry the voices of candidates of color forward, that much harder,"" she told CNN. Disavowing super PACs and other outside groups could set ""up yet another barrier"" for qualified candidates of color, Peeler-Allen said. But rejecting big money in politics increasingly has become a litmus test for progressives in the Democratic Party. Nine liberal groups last month issued an open letter to the 2020 Democratic presidential field, urging all candidates to reject candidate-specific super PACs. ""Single-candidate super PACs fundamentally take power and influence away from everyday people and put it in the hands of big-money donors,"" according to the letter. Signatories included the watchdog group Public Citizen and End Citizens United, a group dedicated to overturning the 2010 ruling. James and his wife, Stefanie Brown James, who co-founded The Collective PAC, have released their own open letter in response and have asked the progressive groups to withdraw their demands. ""One of the few sources of funding for the work to engage voters of color and support candidates of color has come from super PACs,"" they wrote. Politico first reported on the Collective PAC's letter. Taking the moral high ground on money ""sounds cool in a campaign speech,"" James told CNN. ""But that's not what's happening day-to-day. That's not how we were able to help Andrew (Gillum) win his primary."" Patrick Burgwinkle, a spokesman for End Citizens United, said his group objects to single-candidate super PACs because they can ""act as a shadow arm"" of a campaign, allowing candidates to circumvent federal donation limits. He signaled that his group would not object to outside political organizations working on broader issues, such as voter outreach. ""We believe voter engagement, registration, and turnout in communities of color is fundamentally important to a Democrat's ability to be successful in 2020,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""All candidates need to work and dedicate resources to build long-lasting relationships in communities of color."" Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, said the real solution is to ""democratize the funding"" for all candidates by publicly financing campaigns and encouraging small-dollar contributions. ""Super PACs are not a democratizing force,"" he said. ""They are an expression of the political power of concentrated wealth."" This story has been updated."
"Nipsey Hussle slaying: From police and lawmakers to street gangs, tributes continue to pour in",us.cnn.com,Eliott C. McLaughlin,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/nipsey-hussle-tributes/index.html,"(CNN) A week after Nipsey Hussle was gunned down in front of a store he owned in the Hyde Park neighborhood, Los Angeles on Sunday continued to honor the beloved rapper and ponder ways to keep his legacy alive.
A moment of silence was held at 3:20 p.m., the time police say the 33-year-old was shot a week ago at The Marathon Clothing store. It was organized by the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable. Rapper was more movement than musician ""Here was a young man who was not exclusively about the bling, flash, cash, cars, party, fun, and the fast life. Here was a guy who had his head screwed on right and was giving back to the community by investing in the community,"" Earl Ofari Hutchinson, the group's president, wrote in a column after his death. A gunman killed Nipsey Hussle on March 31, police say. A candlelit vigil at Alexander Hamilton High School in the Castle Heights neighborhood Sunday featured more than 200 of the school's alumni, fans of his music and other members of the community. The Grammy-nominated rhymesmith briefly attended school there before dropping out at age 15 to pursue his musical career. Read More Mourners placed candles and photos of the rapper on the school's steps. Gold balloons that hung in front of a school door spelled out, ""Farewell."" Several of the people who spoke at the vigil shared stories of meeting the rapper, who they say was always accessible, and they explained how his love for the community touched them. ""I had the pleasure of meeting him back in 2004,"" said Hamilton alum Tamiko Carson, according to CNN affiliate KABC. ""I was shopping at Target and we just started talking, and he was just such an amazing young man. The mark he left on this world, it will never be replaceable. There will never be another person who can match what he's done."" Former Hamilton High students hold a candlelight vigil for slain rapper Nipsey Hussle.

— Amy Powell (@abc7amy) April 8, 2019 Two mothers discussed the impact of Nipsey's death because they were raising black men of their own. The vigil ended with the release of blue balloons in honor of the rapper, as his song ""Dedication"" played in the background. In the song, Nipsey discusses his commitment to achieving his goals despite his circumstances. The tributes follow a coast-to-coast outpouring of love for the Eritrean-American rapper , who was respected not only for his artistry but for his devotion to the Crenshaw District where he grew up. He owned businesses there, invested in the community and counted several Los Angeles rappers among his influences and collaborators. Two of his mixtapes -- ""Slauson Boy Vol. 1"" and ""Crenshaw"" -- took their names from the area. The Marathon Clothing store sits near West Slauson Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard. Both police officers and rival street gangs were saddened by his death. Nipsey had reached out to the Los Angeles Police Department to request a meeting to discuss ways to curb gang violence and help children, police said following news that he'd been killed.

Street gangs, meanwhile, brokered a truce in Nipsey's honor, with a former leader of the Crips (and reportedly Nipsey's onetime manager), Eugene Henley, announcing on Instagram that they had organized a Friday march among ""Bloods, Crips with a like mind, that want to support and pay homage to one of our lost soldiers, one of our good brothers and teachers and leaders."" Nipsey was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips, and Eric Holder, who police accuse of killing the rapper, is believed to belong to a gang as well, though Police Chief Michel Moore declined to specify gang affiliations. The shooting came after a dispute between Holder and the rapper and does not appear gang-related, the chief said. Holder pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge of murder and two counts of attempted murder, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. He was also charged at his arraignment with possession of a firearm by a felon. JUST WATCHED Nipsey Hussle shooting shown on surveillance video Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Holder and Nipsey knew each other, and the suspect had approached the rapper several times March 31, interacting with him and other men in the clothing store's parking lot, Moore said. At one point, Holder left, returned with a handgun and ""purposely and repeatedly fired"" at the men, injuring two of them and killing the rapper , the chief said. Sorrowful tributes poured forth, with John Legend, J. Cole, Pharrell Williams, Congresswoman Karen Bass , Colin Kaepernick, Rihanna, Mayor Eric Garcetti, LeBron James, 50 Cent and Los Angeles Police Commissioner Steve Soboroff applauding what Nipsey gave to his community and to his craft. Steph Curry: Nipsey was 'just getting started' NBA star Russell Westbrook dedicated his historic Tuesday night performance to the ""Last Time That I Checc'd"" rapper, and Blood-affiliated artists YG and The Game also honored their friend and counterpart in social media posts.

Mueller witnesses worry about release of testimony CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,"Ben Geldon, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/inside-politics-forecast-april-7-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast.
1. Mueller witness worries From CNN chief national correspondent John King : Most of Washington is waiting to learn how much of the Mueller report will be made public, and whether Congress gets, as Democrats demand, access to the special counsel's interview transcripts and working files. But there is one group with perhaps a unique stake in how this transparency debate plays out: Current and former Trump administration officials who cooperated with the special counsel investigation. Their concern: that their accounts about the President's temper and work habits will infuriate the President if he gets to read them -- or sees media accounts about them. Read More ""Very high,"" is how one Republican source described the tension on this question. ""They cooperated and had to tell the truth. He is going to go bonkers."" That account is from a GOP source who in recent days has been in touch with several current and former officials who were interviewed by and shared documents with the special counsel. The source's take was backed up by a former senior administration official who spent hours being interviewed by investigators. This official, in a weekend exchange with CNN, said any ""fair and thorough"" account of what he shared would detail an effort ""to be truthful and explain the President's perspective."" But the official also conceded just the fact that so many White House aides cooperated gets under the President's skin and ""some truths about how"" he conducts himself would without a doubt make the President angry if he were to read them. 2. Iowa voters feeling the ""Bern""? Sen. Bernie Sanders isn't your typical Democratic presidential candidate -- he's not even officially a Democrat. But after weeks of big crowds, strong fundraising and high poll numbers, AP Washington bureau chief Julie Pace says it's clear he's a frontrunner for the nomination. ""His fundraising far surpasses his rivals, and the energy among his crowds was really palpable,"" said Pace, who spent part of the week in Iowa covering the Vermont senator. ""What's really interesting about Sanders is that he's not doing much different than he did in 2016,"" Pace said. ""With the exception of a few references to Trump, the remarks he's given could have been from a 2016 rally or any of his congressional rallies from years past. It really goes to the core of Sanders' belief in this campaign, which is that his 2016 effort was not a fluke and he will win by moving voters to where he is, not by changing his strategy."" 3. Democrats' 2020 money chase Sanders is leading so far in the money race but Washington Post chief correspondent Dan Balz said none of the candidates' numbers are particularly impressive so far. ""The Center for Responsive Politics noted this week that they all appear to be lagging past campaigns,"" Balz said. ""If you go back to 2007 in the first quarter, Hillary Clinton raised about $26 million. Barack Obama raised $25 million, John Edwards raised $14 million."" Sanders, by contrast, raised about $18 million in the first quarter. Sen. Kamala Harris was second with $12 million, followed by Beto O'Rourke with more than $9 million. Several candidates have yet to report their numbers, which must be submitted to the FEC by April 15. ""What this tells us is there is a lot of money on the sidelines,"" Balz said. ""And how much is this grassroots money really going to be there, and how will it be distributed?"" 4. Transgender troop restrictions take effect this week Also this week, the Trump administration's restrictions on transgender troops go into effect after the Supreme Court declined to stop it. ""The Defense Department wouldn't necessarily call it a ban, but it is a change in how transgender military people are treated,"" Vice News DC bureau chief Shawna Thomas said. ""What I'm most interested in seeing is what does it mean for those who are grandfathered in? There are some members of the military who will get to keep their jobs, but it's going to be much more difficult for them to commission, to ascend into other careers or to cross-train."" 5. Lawmakers to grill Pompeo on Khashoggi Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be back in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week -- and CNN's senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju said he should expect lawmakers to grill him on the US-Saudi relationship and the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. ""The administration has provided briefings to this committee in the past several weeks. Democrats and Republicans came out not satisfied by it,"" Raju said. Congress may decide to punish Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who intelligence officials blame for Khashoggi's murder. ""There is a bipartisan bill before this very committee to slap Saudi Arabia with sanctions,"" Raju said. ""The chairman of that committee, Jim Risch, has put the brakes on that for now as he's tried to discuss other alternative ways of going forward. But nevertheless, pressure is building even as the administration continues to side with Saudi Arabia because of economic concerns."""
Devin Nunes sending eight criminal referrals to Attorney General William Barr CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/devin-nunes-justice-department/index.html,"(CNN) California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he was planning to send eight criminal referrals to Attorney General William Barr as soon as this week.
Nunes, who investigated accusations of FBI and Department of Justice abuse while he was previously chairman of the intelligence panel, did not say who he would be referring in a Fox News interview on Sunday. Appearing on Fox's ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Nunes said five of the referrals are related to lying to Congress, misleading Congress and leaking classified information. The other referrals, Nunes said, are allegations of lying to the FISA court that approves foreign surveillance warrants, manipulating intelligence and what he described as a ""global leak referral,"" which Nunes said wasn't tied to one individual. ""We couldn't really send these criminal referrals over without an Attorney General in place, so we are prepared this week to notify the Attorney General that we are prepared to send those referrals over and brief him if he wishes to be briefed. We think they're pretty clear, but as of right now this is, this may not be all of them, but this cleans up quite a bit. We have eight referrals that we are prepared to send over to the Attorney General this week,"" Nunes said. Read More Criminal referrals from Congress to the Justice Department are effectively requests for a criminal investigation from the Justice Department and the FBI. When Republicans controlled Congress, Nunes launched a committee investigation into allegations the FBI and Justice Department abused the FISA process, including the release of a classified memo detailing his accusations. The referrals are the latest action Nunes has taken since losing his gavel -- and the subpoena power that comes with it -- in the new Congress. Nunes last month sued Twitter and several parody accounts , including @devincow, accusing the social media site of censoring conservatives."

Motel 6 will pay $12 million after several locations gave their guest lists to ICE,us.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/motel-6-immigration-customs-enforcement-settlement/index.html,"(CNN) Motel 6 will pay $12 million to settle a lawsuit that said several Washington state locations gave their guest lists to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to the state attorney general's office.
Between 2015 and 2017, seven Motel 6 locations in the state shared approximately 80,000 guests' personal information with ICE without requiring a warrant, Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office said in a news release this week . Trump's border shutdown threat left them in limbo. Here's what they want you to know The guest lists contained private information of all guests at the hotel, violating their expectation of privacy. The hotel chain's disclosures ""resulted in ICE's targeted investigation of many guests with Latino-sounding names,"" the statement said. Motel 6's actions led to ""significant harmful consequences, including the detention and deportation of many guests and the suffering of their families."" The hotel chain admitted during the attorney general's investigation that at least six of its Washington state locations shared guests' information with ICE, according to the news release. The investigation revealed a seventh location also gave information to immigration authorities. Read More ""Motel 6's actions tore families apart and violate the privacy rights of tens of thousands of Washingtonians,"" Ferguson said in the statement.

But the 2012 Republican presidential candidate did say in an i nterview with Fox Business Network in February that the Fed should be more worried about deflation than inflation right now. The Fed typically raises rates to combat inflation. Several economic and market experts -- as well as business leaders -- have expressed concerns that neither Moore nor Cain are the most qualified candidates to serve on the Fed. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon said on Thursday that they are ""not the right people"" to be on the Fed's board.

Some worry that Trump is trying to sway the Fed with his picks. The central bank was established to be an apolitical entity whose job is to try and ensure maximum employment and price stability by setting interest rates.

American ( AAL ) , the world's largest airline, said Sunday it will cancel about 90 flights daily through June 5. American had previously canceled flights through late April. ""By proactively canceling these flights, we are able to provide better service to our customers with availability and rebooking options,"" American said on its website . Customers that are affected will be contacted by American and given options for another flight. The airline has 24 737 Max jets in its fleet. American said it is still waiting for more information from the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, National Transportation Safety Board and other regulatory authorities before resuming flights. Aviation world faces moment of reckoning after 737 MAX crashes Boeing's 737 Max planes were grounded indefinitely in the United States on March 13 after two of the planes had fatal crashes. A Lion Air flight crashed in October and an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed on March 10 . Read More Other countries had already suspended the planes immediately following the Ethiopian Airlines crash. The causes of the crashes have yet to be determined, but the focus has been on an automatic safety feature that may have forced the nose of each plane lower when it incorrectly believed the plane was in danger of going into a stall. Boeing ( BA ) and the FAA said they are working on an upgrade of the 737 Max software to deal with that safety feature. Boeing said at the time of the grounding that it expected that update to be available ""within weeks."" Boeing also announced on Friday that it is cutting the production rate for all of its 737 planes from 52 a month to 42. CEO Dennis Muilenburg added that Boeing was creating a committee to review how it designs and develops jets in order to ensure the ""highest level of safety.""

The laughable attack on AOC's 'drawl' (Opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Raul A. Reyes,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/opinions/rep-ocasio-cortez-code-switched-reyes/index.html,"Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinions on CNN.
(CNN) The criticism never stops. On Friday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave a speech in New York City to the National Action Network, and her detractors pounced. A subsequent headline in the right-leaning Washington Examiner noted, ""AOC adopts Southern drawl to talk to black audience."" The article noted that Ocasio-Cortez -- known these days by her moniker ""AOC"" -- exaggerated and drew out vowels in what the reporter termed ""a distinct change from her usual pronunciation.""
The implication here is pretty simple: that AOC is somehow inauthentic or a phony because she altered her speech slightly in addressing a group of black voters and civil rights leaders. This latest line of attack against AOC is laughable. Code-switching, the practice of adjusting one's speech or vocal patterns depending on the setting, is not the exclusive province of politicians. Nor should it be the focal point of AOC's speech. This controversy simply shows how threatened some people feel by this freshman congressman, because they are willing to critique her for virtually anything. The GOP's terrifying tale of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Although it is a linguistic term, ""code-switching"" is something millions of Americans do regularly. It might mean reverting to your regional accent when you make a visit back home, or it can involve seamlessly switching between two languages, like when Latinos informally speak ""Spanglish."" People do it consciously and unconsciously, for a variety of reasons : to fit in with a group, to ingratiate themselves with others, or perhaps because they are comfortable doing so. To her credit, AOC was quick to clap back at her critics . ""Folks talking about my voice can step right off,"" she tweeted. ""Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture & had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what's up. My Spanish is the same way."" Read More AOC is certainly not the first politician to engage in code-switching. Reporters have noted how Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz, for example, have adapted their natural speaking tone or voice to various audiences. Clinton was mocked for the way she spoke before a black audience in Selma, Alabama in 2007, while Cruz has been known to have an on-again/off-again southern accent. That is not nefarious; that is politics. And the whole issue of ""authenticity"" is very much in the eyes of the beholder. Barack Obama was seen by some on the right as a radical secret Muslim , while other observers wondered if he was ""black enough."" New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responds to claim of 'Southern drawl' to black crowd What is unique about the criticism directed at AOC is how strong and unceasing it is. She has become the villain of the right in record time. And much of that criticism seems to be designed to obscure her actual message. When AOC was speaking at the gathering in New York, she said, ""I'm proud to be a bartender. Ain't nothing wrong with that... There is nothing wrong with being a working person in the United States of America."" This is an empowering statement based on her lived experience. But conservatives want to ignore AOC's idea that there is dignity in all work, so they lash out at her delivery, in this case, her code-switching. Then again, AOC is used to an extraordinarily high level of scrutiny, much of it personal. Commentators and lawmakers have criticized her upbringing , her clothes , her living situation , even the way she danced in an old video. AOC's reference to being proud of being a former bartender was in part a response to President Donald Trump's attempt to dismiss her as ""a wonderful young bartender."" Why has AOC become such a lightning rod for criticism? Simple: She is an outspoken, fearless young Latina with new ideas and sharp political instincts. That is very threatening to those in power , so they take every opportunity they can to disrespect the Boston University graduate and proponent of the Green New Deal. Attacking AOC personally means that her critics won't have to discuss her policy proposals, like taxing the super-wealthy or expanding access to health care. Stay up to date...

Sure, AOC is not the first politician to be subjected to pointless tests of so-called authenticity. Consider how frequently profiles of democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro mention that he is not perfectly fluent in Spanish, as if that matters. Nor is AOC perfect; she is new to Congress and likely is facing a learning curve just like other newly-elected lawmakers. Still, it is ironic that some of the same people criticizing her speech, her style, and her use of social media are the same ones defending outrageous, offensive conduct from the current occupant of The White House. Whatever you might think about AOC, she is not a bully, a racist, or an unindicted co-conspirator . She respects the norms of government and society. She is an intelligent, independent woman. And best of all, AOC really doesn't care what her critics think -- which, to them, is probably the most infuriating thing about her."
Devin Nunes sending eight criminal referrals to Attorney General William Barr - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/devin-nunes-justice-department/index.html,"(CNN) California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he was planning to send eight criminal referrals to Attorney General William Barr as soon as this week.
Nunes, who investigated accusations of FBI and Department of Justice abuse while he was previously chairman of the intelligence panel, did not say who he would be referring in a Fox News interview on Sunday. Appearing on Fox's ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Nunes said five of the referrals are related to lying to Congress, misleading Congress and leaking classified information. The other referrals, Nunes said, are allegations of lying to the FISA court that approves foreign surveillance warrants, manipulating intelligence and what he described as a ""global leak referral,"" which Nunes said wasn't tied to one individual. ""We couldn't really send these criminal referrals over without an Attorney General in place, so we are prepared this week to notify the Attorney General that we are prepared to send those referrals over and brief him if he wishes to be briefed. We think they're pretty clear, but as of right now this is, this may not be all of them, but this cleans up quite a bit. We have eight referrals that we are prepared to send over to the Attorney General this week,"" Nunes said. Read More Criminal referrals from Congress to the Justice Department are effectively requests for a criminal investigation from the Justice Department and the FBI. When Republicans controlled Congress, Nunes launched a committee investigation into allegations the FBI and Justice Department abused the FISA process, including the release of a classified memo detailing his accusations. The referrals are the latest action Nunes has taken since losing his gavel -- and the subpoena power that comes with it -- in the new Congress. Nunes last month sued Twitter and several parody accounts , including @devincow, accusing the social media site of censoring conservatives."
Enormous python captured at Florida nature preserve - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Chandrika Narayan,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/florida-huge-python-captured-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The Burmese python is one of the largest snakes in the world. But even by python standards, this one was colossal.
Scientists caught a female python in the Florida Everglades that was more than 17 feet long, weighed 140 pounds and contained 73 developing eggs. The snake is the largest python ever removed from Big Cypress National Preserve , a 729,000-acre expanse of swampland west of Miami in South Florida, according to a statement Friday on the preserve's Facebook page . After it was captured, the python was used by the researchers to collect data. ""Once they were finished collecting the data, the invasive python was humanely euthanized and the eggs were destroyed,"" said Rita Garcia, public information officer for the Big Cyprus National Preserve. Read More The picture with the Facebook post tells it all. It shows a team of four researchers, standing apart from one another, holding up the gigantic reptile while it was still alive. While pythons of all sizes have been found in the Everglades, most of them are between 6 and 10 feet long. The largest one was over 18 feet long and weighed more than 100 pounds , according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Still, this latest find is impressive. Big Cypress' rangers credit research and new tracking technology with making it possible. ""Using male pythons with radio transmitters allows the team to track the male to locate breeding females,"" their statement says. ""The team not only removes the invasive snakes, but collects data for research, develops new removal tools and learns how the pythons are using the Preserve."" The Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia, but in recent decades the big snakes have become a slithering menace in Florida. The Everglades is a vast area with a tropical climate perfect for pythons to hide and thrive. State wildlife officials estimate there are as many as 100,000 pythons living in the vast swamps outside Miami. The snakes pose significant threats to native wildlife. To control their population, Florida even holds competitions encouraging hunters to remove as many of them as possible. Conservationists in Florida sometimes use radio telemetry to track Burmese pythons. Some 1,600 people registered for the inaugural Python Challenge in 2013, organized by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The searchers found only 68 snakes. In 2017, 25 hunters were paid to euthanize pythons under a $175,000 pilot program by the South Florida Water Management District. The pythons began turning up in the Everglades in the 1980s, most likely abandoned by pet owners when the snakes got too big to handle. Some pet pythons also may have escaped from a breeding facility destroyed during Hurricane Andrew in 1992."
Trump's odd riffs (Opinion),us.cnn.com,"Pat Wiedenkeller, CNN",04-07-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/opinions/trumps-odd-riffs-weekly-opinion-roundup-wiedenkeller/index.html,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
(CNN) If the President was in the driver's seat last week, then the car seemed like it was having trouble, shuddering and fishtailing all over the road: A week after announcing he would try to destroy Obamacare again, on Monday night he said he'd wait till after the election. After repeatedly saying he was OK with releasing the Mueller report, now he wasn't. He dug in about releasing his tax returns (he won't) and went on odd riffs about his German-born (not true) father and carcinogenic windmills (not true) and declared, at the border on Friday, that America was ""full.""
The chaos is intentional, Julian Zelizer thought: Trump wants "" to use his mastery of the media cycle to totally control the agenda throughout the next two years, making it difficult -- if not impossible -- for Democrats to discuss their own ideas."" Michael D'Antonio , Trump's biographer, warned that the President's batty behavior was more than just a bizarre spectacle, it hinted strongly at mental decline. ""The talk coming from this President is frightening, destabilizing and bewildering ,"" he wrote. Dean Obeidallah , meanwhile, suggested that Trump should savor, while he can, his latest roasting on ""Saturday Night Live"" -- a sketch on how he seemed to have dodged the Mueller bullet. It won't last, Quote: : ""Trump's potential criminal and legal woes are not over. As (Robert) DeNiro's Mueller stated near the end of the sketch, ""P.S., can't wait to see what the Southern District of New York has in store for Trump."" On Friday, Trump visited the border town of Calexico, California, where he railed against a ""colossal surge"" in immigration -- and mistakenly referred to the Flores Settlement as decided by ""Judge Flores"" (it was named after Jenny Lisette Flores, who fled El Salvador as a teenager). Frida Ghitis was exasperated: He is presenting a humanitarian crisis -- Central American asylum seekers -- as an illegal criminal invasion, and demanding a wall, she observed. If the President really wanted a border solution, he would send money south to support ""well-vetted nongovernmental organizations that improve governance, rule of law, and economic development"" in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, she wrote. Read More Van Jones and Jessica Jackson, meanwhile, took a look at a rare bipartisan success on criminal justice reform, explaining why they're celebrating a three-month-old law signed by President Trump. Is Bernie Sanders really like Donald Trump? In the Washington Post, Dana Milbank went out on a limb and called Bernie Sanders the Donald Trump of the left : ""Fundraising and polls show that many Democrats think the best answer to an angry old white guy with crazy hair, New York accent and flair for demagoguery is, well, another angry old white guy with crazy hair, New York accent and flair for demagoguery."" SE Cupp countered that a more ridiculous comparison was hard to imagine: "" No one is like Donald Trump. He is, in ways that are both impressive and disturbing, inimitable, unprecedented, unique."" Top court blesses barbarity? Russell Bucklew, on death row in Missouri for murder, wanted to be executed using nitrogen gas instead of a lethal injection of pentobarbital. His lawyers argued that he had tumors in his throat, and could choke to death on his own blood under lethal injection. On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected his request. The 5-4 decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, shows the conservative court continuing to move in "" an exceptionally barbarous direction ,"" wrote Jill Filipovic , putting ""a legal veneer on judicially sanctioned torture and murder."" Inspiration and grief over Nipsey Hussle The shooting death on Sunday of hip-hop star Nipsey Hussle outside his Los Angeles clothing store drew a torrent of grief in the community where he had worked to create opportunity for others. ""You were about something..positive and for your community in every chance you had to speak..and because of that You inspired millions,"" tweeted Pharrell Williams . But there was another, troubling, thread that emerged, lamented Clay Cane : ""Sadly, social media is already being flooded by many trying to use Hussle as an example of the always popular, intellectually bereft, black-on-black-crime talking point."" The facile framing, he said, detracts from Nipsey's status and contributions -- the STEM program he helped launch and several other entrepreneurial and community-focused ventures aimed at lifting up his South LA neighborhood. "" Racializing crime perpetuates a stereotype"" and dishonors Nipsey, he wrote. Trump under pressure Two weeks after Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary declaring that the much-longer, still-unseen Mueller report largely exonerated the President, Congress is ratcheting up the pressure to see for itself. The House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize chairman Jerrold Nadler to issue a subpoena (when he wants to) for the full report and other evidence. It's a battle Nadler was born to fight , suggested Norman Ornstein in The New Republic. Michael Zeldin , a formal federal prosecutor, said Barr's decision to exonerate President Trump of any potential obstruction of justice allegations was out of line . ""There is nothing in the special counsel regulations that would appear to authorize the attorney general"" -- a political appointee -- to put his (and Rod Rosenstein's) spin on Mueller's own decision ""that he lacked sufficient evidence to make a criminal charging decision."" Barr should have given the full report to Congress, which can take up the question of obstruction in an impeachment investigation, he wrote. Barr told the House and Senate Judiciary committee chairmen he would send up the full report by mid-April -- as soon as he's done reviewing whether and how to redact it. OK, fine, wrote Elie Honig , a former federal prosecutor. But it gets dicey when Barr says he'll scrub the report of information that would ""unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties,"" as well as grand jury materials. Barr should ""put away his redaction pen"" in favor of transparency, Honig wrote. ""Anything less will raise one big question: What is Barr trying to hide?"" Taxing Trump Meanwhile, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday asked the IRS for six years of Trump's tax returns -- a request Trump will fight all the way to the Supreme Court, a source told CNN. In the Washington Post, Aaron Blake noted a report in Bloomberg that in February Trump asked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to fast-track his nominee for IRS chief counsel, Michael J. Desmond -- who had once advised the Trump Organization on a tax matter. Trump attempting to install ""people who have publicly taken his side"" is a recurring theme , Blake wrote. Michael McGough , writing in the Los Angeles Times, observed that Democrats were in ""search of skullduggery."" Biden's bad week ""Joe Biden has problems,"" wrote Roxanne Jones . Since last weekend, a series of women have told of uncomfortable, handsy encounters with the former Vice President -- and likely 2020 candidate. Joe Biden waited several days before he addressed the issue in a Twitter video, saying he would "" be more mindful about respecting personal space. "" But then, on Friday, he joked about his predicament to a largely male crowd of union electricians, causing Emily Peck to complain in an essay in HuffPost that he still didn't get it. Jones took note of the other problematic issues in Biden's personnel file -- the ones rooted in his long Senate career, like his treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings and his once-popular tough-on-crime views that ""mostly targeted black and brown communities and have perpetuated the racial disparities in today's justice system."" Biden will have to explain himself not just to women, but also to communities of color , Jones wrote. But there's another side to consider, wrote Marion Steinfels , Biden's deputy communications director during his 2008 run. She recounted the candidate grabbing her arm once during a plane takeoff and telling her a random story. She realized only later that he was distracting her from her flying anxiety. "" With Biden, it is not about objectifying women or asserting male dominance ; it's about doing what he can to encourage others and make them feel comfortable -- especially in stressful and overwhelming situations,"" she insisted. ""This is who he is."" Biden's case surfaces the challenges facing all the Democratic candidates as they navigate norms ""in an era defined by the #MeToo movement,"" and confront a ""generational divide, in which a rising cohort, characterized by its diversity and tolerance, is intolerant of conduct that was long commonplace,"" wrote Nancy Gibbs in Time. Don't count him out, cautioned John Avlon . "" There are plenty of compelling reasons for Joe Biden to get in the race of a lifetime , aiming to reunite his party and the nation."" Pete Buttigieg on God, marriage and Mike Pence While Biden was trying to get his pre-candidacy back on course, Pete Buttigieg was having a bit of bump in the polls. The South Bend mayor sat down to chat with CNN contributor Father Edward Beck about his religious journey, his views on the intersection of faith and politics -- and Mike Pence. Beck asked him about reports that the Vice President believes that God is behind his and Trump's leadership. Said Buttigieg: ""The idea that God wants somebody like Mike Pence to be the cheerleader for a President largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give God very little credit."" Read the whole Q&A here. Insecurity The White House was playing a game of ""high-stakes dodgeball"" in trying to explain away the White House's push for security clearances for at least 25 people over experts' objections, wrote CNN security analyst Samantha Vinograd . Pay attention, wrote Vinograd, who served 10 years in government, four of them in the White House. ""If red flags about an applicant are raised -- and later overruled by senior White House officials or the President himself -- that means that the very people supposedly charged with protecting our national security are knowingly taking steps that could damage it. The outstanding question is why.""

That is very threatening to those in power , so they take every opportunity they can to disrespect the Boston University graduate and proponent of the Green New Deal. Attacking AOC personally means that her critics won't have to discuss her policy proposals, like taxing the super-wealthy or expanding access to health care. Stay up to date...
Sure, AOC is not the first politician to be subjected to pointless tests of so-called authenticity. Consider how frequently profiles of democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro mention that he is not perfectly fluent in Spanish, as if that matters. Nor is AOC perfect; she is new to Congress and likely is facing a learning curve just like other newly-elected lawmakers. Still, it is ironic that some of the same people criticizing her speech, her style, and her use of social media are the same ones defending outrageous, offensive conduct from the current occupant of The White House. Whatever you might think about AOC, she is not a bully, a racist, or an unindicted co-conspirator . She respects the norms of government and society. She is an intelligent, independent woman. And best of all, AOC really doesn't care what her critics think -- which, to them, is probably the most infuriating thing about her."

He was arrested without incident Saturday afternoon, the statement said. Hurlburt was also taken into cusody after being released from the hospital. Authorities have been unable to determine a motive for either killing, the sheriff's office said, and the investigation remains ongoing."

National Library Week: 9 fascinating facts about librarians - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Sam Romano, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/national-library-week-facts-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Libraries in the US have long been community fixtures, providing gathering spaces along with public access to books and information.
And at the center of these hubs are your local librarians, juggling reference requests while helping patrons find reliable resources. In honor of National Library Week , which runs from April 7-13, here are some facts about librarians that might surprise you. 1. They serve more customers than your local movie theater According to the Institute of Museum and Library Services , around 1.3 billion people visit public libraries every year, more than the 1.24 billion movie theater admissions in 2017. These readers will probably tell you the book is better than the movie, too. Read More 2. There are more of them than you might think According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are about 126,800 librarians in the US. New York has the most, with 12,360 librarians. 3. They help spies Want to work for the Central Intelligence Agency? A library degree (and the ability to pass an intensive background check) might be your ticket in. At the CIA, you can earn up to six figures working in their library . 4. They help preserve your favorite music The Library of Congress has been preserving recordings in the National Recording Registry since 2002. Latest additions included hip-hop group Run-DMC's 1986 album ""Raising Hell,"" Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album ""Rumours"" and the soundtrack to ""The Sound of Music."" 5. Their job prospects are on the rise Employment of librarians is expected to grow 9% by 2026. Some 12,000 jobs are projected to open as communities look to librarians for a variety of information services. 6. They have left their mark on history Former FBI Director J.

It houses a 16th-century globe, an original copy of the Bill of Rights and a Honus Wagner baseball card largely considered to be one of the rarest in the world. 9. Working in a library used to be considered too intense for women At the end of the 19th century, library work was considered to be too overwhelming for women, and in 1900, the Brooklyn Public Library Association proposed building ""a seaside rest home for those who had broken down in library service."" Melvil Dewey, who invented the Dewey Decimal System, also believed women would have a hard time working in libraries because of their supposed poor health.

Trump's personal security breaches are a problem for all (Opinion),edition.cnn.com,Samantha Vinograd,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/opinions/presidential-weekly-briefing-trump-personal-security-breach-vinograd/index.html,"Samantha Vinograd is a CNN national security analyst.

(CNN) Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States, modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily.
Sam Vinograd Here's this week's briefing: There is nothing new about security breaches affecting US Presidents -- they have always been key targets of foreign intelligence operations. Foreign governments are eager to understand US Presidents -- their motivations, misgivings, and moods -- so that they can influence US policy. While US Presidents have long been plagued by security risks, they have historically done everything possible to guard against threats to their property, person, and personnel. What is new, however, is how knowingly President Donald Trump increases his personal insecurities, rather than trying to neutralize them. JUST WATCHED New audio released of woman in Mar-a-Lago security breach Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
New audio released of woman in Mar-a-Lago security breach 02:13 Read More ""Flukes"" are trending Earlier this week, Yujing Zhang breached security at President Trump's private club, Mar-a-Lago. Zhang was found with four cell phones, a laptop, an ""external hard drive type device"" and a thumb drive which a preliminary investigation found contained malicious malware, according to the criminal complaint. She has been charged with making false statements and entering a restricted area. It's notable that Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to the incident in very different ways. Trump said he was ""not concerned at all"" and called the security breakdown a fluke while Pompeo said it was a sign of the threat that China poses. This security breach comes just weeks after news broke that Cindy Yang, a Chinese-American businesswoman who founded the massage parlor chain where New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was arrested in a prostitution sting, allegedly advertised access to events like ""VIP activities at Mar-a-Lago."" Trump White House's self-inflicted security debacle Democrats are demanding a new FBI investigation into the company that Yang reportedly started, GY US Investments, and the two incidents. Both raise serious questions about security at Mar-a-Lago, where management -- not the Secret Service -- determines who is allowed access to the club. As a private property, Secret Service does not have full control over who accesses Mar-a-Lago. It is a commercial property that the President visits on a temporary basis (often). Mar-a-Lago management (which President Trump knows well, of course) is in charge of access at the property, and it is unlikely that they screen guests the same way that Secret Service would before guests access presidential properties like the White House or Camp David. Instead of visiting permanent presidential retreats like Camp David or simply staying in the White House, where Secret Service has full control over security, President Trump often chooses to visit Mar-a-Lago and his other properties. The potential for foreign agents to pose as guests raises serious counterintelligence concerns for the President and his family. For the right price (or membership fee ) almost anyone can get close to the President while he is at Mar-a-Lago and, at a minimum, observe him while he is there and not inside classified or restricted spaces at the club. There are a number of other soft targets at Mar-a-Lago. Compromised electronics can pose serious information security or surveillance threats, and there are real risks that people at Mar-a-Lago can compromise existing information infrastructure at the club by accessing computers, phones or more. President Trump is the commander-in-chief -- he could choose not to visit Mar-a-Lago, where he knows there are serious risks, or he could shut down the club while he is President. At the very least, he could suggest that Mar-a-Lago consult with the FBI on how to mitigate counterintelligence risks associated with members' access, considering what an prime target it is. Keeping members happy might keep the cash flow steady, but presidential security should be the priority, not an afterthought. Put down your phone The President's communications choices also signal that he's either not listening to counterintelligence experts or simply doesn't care what they have to say. Trump has resisted efforts to makes his iPhone activity more secure. And he continues to use his iPhones despite security experts telling him that foreign intelligence services are listening. Why Javanka's security clearances were vital to Trump Unless he was planning on a conference call, he is knowingly flouting experts' advice and letting foreign governments potentially listen to his private conversations -- conversations that our own government may not be allowed to listen to. Foreign intelligence services have historically tried to hack other leaders' devices to gain insights into their preferences, trigger points, and thinking. It doesn't help that the President chooses to use devices that are not as secure as they could be. And, while they have easier access to his personal phones and conversations, President Trump's Twitter trigger finger means that a lot more about him is public knowledge -- including his mood at various times of the day. It's one thing to like large audiences, it's another to have any extra eyes or ears on his personal communications. Clearance chaos The ongoing security clearance saga is another public reminder that the President has chosen to ignore experts' recommendations. Trump overruled intelligence officials and a White House lawyer when he ordered his chief of staff to grant his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner top-secret security clearance. Whistleblower Tricia Newbold said senior officials granted clearances to another 25 people who were initially denied over a range of disqualifying reasons, although it's unclear how many of those cases Trump personally intervened in. Democrats face a tough choice in battling Trump on executive privilege If Kushner misuses any intelligence he now has access to, or falls prey to manipulation at the hands of foreign governments, the President has no one to blame but himself. Kushner's access to top-secret material not only endangers security in the West Wing, it threatens the trust our alliances have in sharing sensitive material with us. Our intelligence partners in countries like the UK or Canada, for example, could choose to hold back on the intel they share with the United States if they fear those close to the President cannot responsibly handle classified information. If the President was really focused on promoting US national security, he would strip Kushner of his clearance, launch a review of all those who were initially denied, and rely solely on experts' recommendations going forward. It seems unlikely the President will undertake that plan of action. And we don't know if the President has directed his team to follow experts' advice when awarding new clearances -- even when it comes to his own personal friends and family. Seeing red With special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation -- or at least Attorney General William Barr's summary of it -- behind him, the President is propagating the conclusion that he is not a Russian asset and that anyone that says so is motivated by politics. But we don't know if the broader counterintelligence investigation into the President concluded when Mueller submitted his report to Attorney General Barr. And the Mueller investigation centered around the 2016 election -- so unless the FBI says the President is not the target of a counterintelligence investigation, we don't know if they still have concerns about his behavior. We don't know if the President is being manipulated (knowingly or unknowingly) by Russia, but we do know that he is doing things that make their mission against us a lot easier. Regardless of what the details of the Mueller report include, the US intelligence community assessed that Russia is trying to undermine trust in our authorities as well as our democratic process, and that they're using information warfare to spread disinformation and divisions. President Trump gets far more detailed briefings on Russian activities in a classified setting, yet he still continues to say and do things that help further those Russian operations against us. He encouraged paranoia about US election results, and continually trashes the US law enforcement community and the media. To top it off, hardly a day goes by without Trump tweeting something divisive or inaccurate. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Our adversaries have always adapted and evolved their tactics while we have historically tried to make their jobs as hard as possible. If President Trump doesn't prioritize national security and address the ways he's made himself an easy target, foreign intelligence services and the leaders they serve have a major leg up on us. Instead of reflecting on how he can make himself -- and by extension, all of us -- safer, the President seems intent on sticking by his bad decisions. He's signaling that convenience and comfort -- for him and his family -- trump securing his person and his property. President Trump's personal insecurities are showing -- and growing."
The bold women of 'Game of Thrones' have origins in Scottish history - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Sarah Minnear, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/entertainment/game-of-thrones-women-history-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Beginning April 14, the world will tune in to watch the Starks, Daenerys Targaryen's armies and some wayward Lannisters do battle with an undead army and a zombie dragon.
For most of the past decade ""Game of Thrones"" has awed viewers with its bold plotlines and political intrigue. But its fantasy world is not as mythical as it seems, and some of its most pivotal moments are rooted in history. Author George R.R. Martin often draws from the historical record, and there are a plethora of historical parallels in his ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series upon which the HBO series is based. The Dothraki's fearsome bloodriders mirror the indomitable force of Genghis Khan's cavalry. And the shocking Red Wedding was practically torn from the pages of Scottish history as it was based on the Glencoe massacre of 1692, in which Archibald Campbell's soldiers slaughtered members of the McDonald clan amid a bitter blood feud. 'Game of Thrones' is wrapping up and we have SO many questions we need answered Feuding is rampant in ""Game of Thrones"" and likely inspired in part by the Wars of the Roses in 15th-century England between the Lancasters and the Yorks -- and the feuding in Scotland, which was far more prevalent. Blood feuding, both in Scotland and in Westeros, evokes images of bloodthirsty men of the aristocracy, eager to exact retribution for slain family members. However, for every Rob Stark we have a Catelyn Stark, who took it upon herself to avenge her dead husband. Read More So what does history tell us about these bold women? Historian Keith Brown, Dean of Humanities at the University of Manchester, notes that the women of early Scottish history were seen as ""soft targets"" in the eyes of acquisitive neighbors -- or sometimes their own family -- and their ""best defense lay in marriage."" Yet these women could also wield power to avenge their families, not unlike Cersei Lannister, Margaery Tyrell and Sansa Stark. Janet Scott, the Sansa Stark of Ferniehirst Sansa Stark is coming into her own as a strong and savvy leader. Dame Janet Scott was certainly not a ""soft target"" during the vicious Scott-Kerr feud of the 1500s. She had a reason to resent the Kerr clan, just as Catelyn Stark hated the Lannisters or Daenerys Targaryen loathed Robert Baratheon. Her grandfather was stabbed to death in Edinburgh by a group of Kerrs in 1548 and her father was murdered that same year. Her mother was killed when the Kerrs locked her inside a tower and set it aflame. Ferniehirst Castle, home of Dame Janet Scott. Just as Sansa Stark remembers how Joffrey slaughtered her father, Janet Scott would never forget that the Kerrs were responsible for murdering her family. When Dame Janet grew older and became responsible for her frequently exiled husband's lands, she acted on this burning resentment by using the Scottish courts to harass a powerful lord named Robert Kerr. Scott obtained letters ordering Kerr to deliver crops to her. If he failed to respond, she threatened to ""put him to the horn,"" meaning Kerr would be declared an outlaw and potentially be banished. It was a brave step considering that Kerr once reportedly killed four men to avenge the theft of a sheepdog. This same feminine contempt for powerful men is seen in ""Game of Thrones"" when Sansa Stark taunts Ramsay Bolton before the Battle of the Bastards. Her words to him -- ""You're going to die today, Lord Bolton. Sleep well"" -- certainly mirror Janet Scott's attitude towards Robert Kerr. He came from a family that had taken so much from her, and she was not afraid to strike back. Henrietta Stewart, the Margaery Tyrell of Dunfermline Margaery Tyrell used her beauty to seduce and manipulate powerful men. Henrietta Stewart is another example of how historical women could be active participants in a blood feud. Her masterful manipulation of Scottish court politics rivals only ""Game of Thrones'"" Margaery Tyrell and the queen of thorns, Lady Olenna. Margaery knew how to use her charisma to advance her family's interests. For example, she frequently told Sansa Stark how happy she would be in Highgarden if she married Loras Tyrell. Although the union never happened, Margaery nearly succeeded in securing the north for the Tyrells. In 16th-century Scotland, Henrietta Stewart used similar tactics during a blood feud between her family and the Gordons. Dunfermline Abbey, home to Henrietta Stewart. Stewart's masterful politicking reached its height after a scuffle between her husband, George Gordon, and James Stewart (who, despite his name, was from a different family). In December 1590, things became heated when Gordon and James Stewart were both in Edinburgh, surrounded by considerable retinues and on the brink of violence. Henrietta Stewart used her charm, and her friendship with Queen Anne of Denmark, to persuade King James VI of Scotland to broker an agreement between the two parties, forcing the two noblemen to remain in the city. This stalemate spared the Gordons' lands from attack and gave her family a tactical advantage. It's clear evidence of how a woman can take a proactive role during a feud. Margaery Tyrell would certainly approve. Agnes Keith, the Catelyn Stark of Argyle Catelyn Stark, whose efforts to vanquish the Lannisters ended badly for her. In ""Game of Thrones"" Lady Catelyn Stark plots revenge after her husband Ned is betrayed and killed by the Lannisters. She spends the rest of her days hassling Lannister family members and recruiting armies to oppose them. Castle Doune in central Scotland, once home to the Stewart family. ""Game of Thrones"" has shot scenes there. And in Scotland in the 1500s, Lady Agnes Keith held a terrible grudge against the Gordons over the slaying of her husband, James Stewart. She made life difficult for George Gordon, especially during a quarrel involving fishing rights on the River Spey. Her persistence, like Catelyn Stark's, shows how widows didn't cower after the deaths of their husbands. Despite facing eventual defeat, both women proved to be a nuisance for their enemies. Isobel Sinclair, the Cersei Lannister of Caithness The ruthless Cersei Lannister. In her thirst to vanquish her enemies, ""Game of Thrones'"" Cersei Lannister inadvertently causes the death of her son and last surviving child, Tommen. It's not unlike what happened in Scotland in 1567, when John Gordon, the 11th Earl of Sutherland, and his wife were poisoned at Helmsdale Castle by Isobel Sinclair, whose family was feuding with the Gordons (everyone was feuding with the Gordons). The Castle of Mey in Caithness was once home to the Sinclair family. But in doing so, Sinclair accidentally poisoned her own son. Both Sinclair and Cersei were schemers who advanced their family's interests and power -- but at the cost of losing a child."
Finnish journalist speaks out after Trump administration cancels 'Courage' award,edition.cnn.com,Brian Stelter,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/media/jessikka-aro-state-department-reliable-sources/index.html,"New York (CNN) When Jessikka Aro found out that she was receiving one of the State Department's International Women of Courage Awards, the Helsinki-based journalist ""was just so happy,"" she said.
Aro called the recognition ""precious ... because my work has also cost me so much."" She has suffered harassment and cyberattacks since she started reporting on Russian propaganda activities in 2014. US embassy officials in Helsinki asked her last October if she would accept a nomination for the award. She thought it was a done deal in January. ""But then it was taken away,"" she said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources"" on CNN. Read More In the weeks leading up to the March 7 ceremony in Washington, Aro's award was rescinded. Foreign Policy magazine, which broke the story about Aro , quoted sources who said she was nixed because she repeatedly criticized President Donald Trump on Twitter. The yanking of her award ""really counters the whole idea of this award,"" Aro said. Someone inside the Trump administration, she implied, lacked courage. Aro said she was grateful for the Foreign Policy story because she had been in the dark about what happened. But she was ""horrified"" that her commentary about Trump was an apparent factor. She went through her past tweets -- like a February 17 reply to the president, when he called the media ""rigged,"" ""corrupt"" and an ""enemy of the people."" She replied to him that day and said ""the Kremlin doesn't need any troll factories as long as it has YOU trolling on behalf of it!"" ""I still stand by what I said and what I tweeted,"" she said. ""I think that President Trump's attacks against the media are disgraceful, and need to be also discussed on Twitter as well."" Speaking to a US audience, Aro said, ""I am really sorry for you guys over there if that really is the situation, if Trump or his administration have been infected with fear and self-censorship."" After the Foreign Policy story came out, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee obtained a set of emails between Aro and the State Department and called for the agency's inspector general to investigate the circumstances. New documents raise questions over State Dept. move to rescind honor for Trump critic A State Department spokesman originally claimed that Aro was ""incorrectly notified"" that ""she'd been selected as a finalist. This was an error. This was a mistake."" But the internal emails cast doubt on this version of events. The emails showed months of correspondence about the award and her expected trip to Washington. Things changed after an embassy official asked her to send a list of her ""social media handles."" Aro said the State Department's original claims were ""factually incorrect."" And that's why she is thankful that senators are looking into the matter. ""I really want to know: Who was the person who really gave the order to cancel my award? And what would he or she like to tell about her motivation in doing so?"" ""It doesn't really look like this process of canceling my award has followed the best practices and transparency policies of the State Department governance,"" Aro added. The State Department inspector general's office has not commented on the possibility of a probe. As for the reason why she was going to be recognized in the first place, Aro is now working on a book about so-called Russian troll farms. And she said she will continue training people to better recognize trolling and propaganda warfare efforts.

Buttigieg wants to 'change the channel' from Washington's 'mesmerizing horror show' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/buttigieg-change-the-channel-mesmerizing-horror-show/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Pete Buttigieg said Sunday he wants to ""change the channel from this mesmerizing horror show"" happening in Washington right now.
The presidential hopeful and mayor of South Bend, Indiana, appeared on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and said the US is ""going through tectonic, profound change"" and described ""an office that has a loss of vision and a loss of decency."" The mayor described ""this moment"" in American history, ""where it just might make sense for somebody my age, coming from experience in the industrial Midwest, non-federal, a different background, bringing something that will actually help Americans envision the world as it'll be in 2054, the year that I will reach the current age of the current President, and just change the channel from this mesmerizing horror show that's going on in Washington right now."" Buttigieg, who is 37, has formed a presidential exploratory committee, and if elected would be the youngest president in US history, the first married gay president and the first candidate to go direct from being mayor to being President. ""I'm about as different from this President as it gets,"" Buttigieg said."

Beto O'Rourke: Netanyahu a 'racist',edition.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/beto-orourke-israel-netanyahu/index.html,"(CNN) Former Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke offered sweeping criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, outright calling him ""racist"" and an obstacle to peace.
Speaking in Iowa as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination for president, O'Rourke said the US-Israeli relationship was among the most important ""on the planet"" and singled out Netanyahu. ""That relationship, if it is to be successful, must transcend partisanship in the United States, and it must be able to transcend a prime minister who is racist, as he warns about Arabs coming to the polls, who wants to defy any prospect for peace as he threatens to annex the West Bank, and who has sided with a far-right, racist party in order to maintain his hold on power,"" O'Rourke said. O'Rourke continued, saying he did not believe Netanyahu ""represents the true will of the Israeli people"" or the ""best interests"" of the relationship between the US and Israel. He went on to endorse a two-state solution to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. ""We must be able to transcend his current leadership to make sure that that alliance is strong, that we continue to push for and settle for nothing less than a two-state solution, because that is the best opportunity for peace for the people of Israel and the people of Palestine,"" O'Rourke said. ""It is the best opportunity for the full human rights of everyone who is living in that region."" Read More CNN has reached out to the Israeli Embassy in Washington for comment. O'Rourke made his comment to reporters after a rally where a voter asked about the conflict in the region. In the rally itself, O'Rourke offered similar criticism of Netanyahu, while also saying the Palestinian Authority had not acted in good faith. O'Rourke's comments joined a larger debate taking place in the US and Democratic Party about Israel and Netanyahu, whom President Donald Trump hosted in the White House just weeks before Israel is set to hold decisive elections in which Netanyahu is up for re-election. Trump has sought to seize on the issue, including by invoking a controversy in the House over anti-Semitism, while many Democrats running to challenge Trump in 2020 have rebuffed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a political group strongly supportive of Netanyahu. Trump signed a proclamation in March recognizing the Golan Heights as part of Israel, overturning longstanding US policy regarding the area and handing Netanyahu a significant foreign policy victory in the run-up to the upcoming election. A report from Haaretz quoted Netanyahu as telling Channel 12 News Saturday, ""A Palestinian state will endanger our existence and I withstood huge pressure over the past eight years. No prime minister has withstood such pressure. We must control our destiny."" Netanyahu went on to say, ""I will extend sovereignty but I don't distinguish between the settlement blocs and the isolated ones, because each settlement is Israeli and I will not hand it over to Palestinian sovereignty."" Netanyahu has tacked further right in the leadup to the April elections, including working openly to improve the electoral prospects of lawmakers with roots in a party banned in the 1980s for racism."
"Kirstjen Nielsen out as DHS secretary, says President Donald Trump",edition.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-homeland-security/index.html,"(CNN) Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security who has become a face of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration push, is leaving the administration, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Sunday afternoon.
""Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""I am pleased to announce that Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, will become Acting Secretary for @DHSgov. I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!"" Trump continued. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019 Nielsen did not resign willingly, a person close to her told CNN, but was under pressure to do so. Nielsen did not fight nor grovel to keep her job, the source said. Nielsen should be staying for a week of transition, another White House official said. McAleenan is a holdover from the Obama administration. He was sworn in on March 20, 2018, as commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. He is expected to serve as the acting secretary ""in the short term,"" meaning he is not expected to be in the position for the long term, according to a White House official. Read More Senior administration officials told CNN that Nielsen had a 5 p.m., meeting at the White House with Trump where she was planning to discuss with him the immigration and border issues and a path forward. She had no intention of resigning, according to one of the sources, but rather was going there with an agenda. Trump had grown increasingly frustrated with the situation at the border, which has seen an influx in migrants, predominantly from Northern Triangle countries. In California on Friday, a senior administration official tells CNN, Trump told border agents he wanted them to stop letting people cross the border, despite the fact that Central American asylum seekers according to US law can do so. Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable with the President becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests,"" a senior administration official tells CNN. ""I hereby resign from the position of Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), effective April 7th 2019,"" Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter. ""Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age, I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside."" READ: Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation letter from DHS secretary post Nielsen later tweeted that she ""agreed to stay on as Secretary through Wednesday, April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted."" Removing Nielsen and installing McAleenan as acting secretary presents issues for the line of succession. Putting McAleenan in charge skips over acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady, who also serves in the Senate confirmed role as the Undersecretary of Management, which raises questions about her future. A senior administration official told CNN that legally Grady is next in line and will have to go in order for McAleenan to assume the role of acting secretary. Another official, asked about this question, told CNN there are issues that need to be addressed before McAleenan can take over. In a series of tweets, Nielsen said, ""it has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women"" of DHS and repeated what she also said in her resignation letter that she ""could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service."" Nielsen has felt ""in limbo"" for the last week, a person close to her says, as she bore the brunt of the President's anger over the border. She's been increasingly on thin ice in the eyes of the President. She did not realize how dire it was when she left the US last weekend, but quickly did, as she abruptly returned. She did interviews -- including on CNN -- to try and improve the President's souring view of her, the source close to Nielsen said, but to little avail. ""Nothing she could do or say could change how the President started viewing her,"" the source close to Nielsen said. That said, she was prepared to be fired at any moment, but did not know going into Sunday's meeting it would be imminent. Democrats immediately reacted to the news. ""Hampered by misstep after misstep, Kirstjen Nielsen's tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start. It is clearer now than ever that the Trump Administration's border security and immigration policies - that she enacted and helped craft - have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border,"" said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson in a statement. Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, acknowledged Nielsen's challenges in a statement and expressed confidence in McAleenan and whomever the President nominated later. ""Secretary Nielsen served her country honorably as Homeland Security Secretary, despite facing numerous challenges including dire conditions at our southwest border,"" Rogers said. ""Although Commissioner McAleenan will have his work cut out for him, I am confident the department is in capable hands. I look forward to working with McAleenan in his new role and to learning who the president intends to nominate on a permanent basis."" Tumultuous tenure The departure comes just days after Trump suddenly withdrew the nomination of Ron Vitiello for Immigration and Customs Enforcement director , blindsiding the Department of Homeland Security and the Hill. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination had been pulled, a person familiar with the news said. The announcement Sunday also follows plans to cut aid to some Central American countries , marking a sudden reversal after Nielsen had days earlier visited Honduras to sign a regional compact agreement with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Nielsen has had a tumultuous tenure that saw Trump steadily ramping up pressure on his team to execute his immigration promises, which he believes is the single driving issue for his base of political supporters. Trump has vented privately that Nielsen hasn't adequately secured the border or enacted stricter immigration rules, even as she became the face of policies that administration critics called heartless and illegal. Incoming acting secretary of Homeland Security 'not an ideologue or fire breather' In recent weeks, administration officials have been sounding the alarm over the increase in migrants at the southern border, underscoring the change in demographics as one of the reasons for the host of challenges they're facing. McAleenan said late last month that the US was on pace to encounter more than 100,000 migrants in March alone, making it ""the highest month since 2008."" ""Right now, we have an emergency on our hands. We need to treat it as such,"" Nielsen told Chris Cuomo on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" Thursday. Nielsen, who served in President George W. Bush's administration, never overcame internal skepticism about her allegiance to Trump. She joined the administration as chief of staff to John Kelly, who was Trump's first Homeland Security secretary. When Kelly moved to the West Wing as chief of staff, Nielsen followed, becoming a deputy chief of staff tasked with helping Kelly bring rigor to a freewheeling staff. The role didn't gain her popularity, but it helped her gain enough of Trump's trust to elevate her to the Cabinet post. But at the agency that oversees border protection and immigration matters -- Trump's signature issue -- it was inevitable Nielsen would find herself in the President's crosshairs. After a previous Cabinet meeting during which Trump berated her for not acting strongly enough on preventing illegal immigration, Nielsen considered resigning, people familiar with the matter said at the time. She didn't then and went on to become one of the public faces of a controversial policy that separated families at the southern border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement on Nielsen's resignation, saying, ""It is deeply alarming that the Trump Administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the White House's liking."" Pelosi went on to say, ""The President's dangerous and cruel anti-immigrant policies have only worsened the humanitarian suffering at the border and inflicted vast suffering on the families who have been torn apart."" The President posted on Twitter shortly after announcing Nielsen's departure that the ""Country is FULL!"" and wrote there have been more apprehensions at the southern border ""than in many years."" He called on Congress to ""fix loopholes"" and reiterated his threat to close the border. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."
"The 5 BIG 2020 stories to watch, ranked",edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/2020-lookahead-joe-biden-town-halls/index.html,"(CNN) It's going to be another huge week in the 2020 race! Every Sunday night, I will determine the 5 BIG storylines you need to see to understand the week to come on the 2020 campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the #1 story is the most important of the coming week.
Tell your friends to subscribe to The Point newsletter to get these rankings delivered to your inbox! 5. The waiting is the hardest part Another week of waiting for and fighting over the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia appears to be on tap. Attorney General William Barr has said to expect the report, with redactions, by the end of the month -- most people assume it will be closer to the end of the month rather than the middle. A ruling Friday by a federal appeals court on the release of grand jury testimony seems to make more redactions likely, even as Democrats keep up their insistence that not seeing the full report is unacceptable. Read More ""There could be grounds for impeachment, there could be grounds for other actions, there could be things the American people ought to know,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (N.Y.) said on ""Face The Nation"" earlier today. Meanwhile, expect President Donald Trump to keep singing the same old song on the Mueller report. Tweeted Trump Sunday morning: ""Looks like Bob Mueller's team of 13 Trump Haters & Angry Democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the Fake News Media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt & dishonest Mainstream Media, they are a Joke!"" 4. The field just keeps getting bigger (and bigger) California Rep. Eric Swalwell is expected to join the Democratic presidential field as soon as this week, according to The Atlantic . Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.) is moving toward the race too. As is former Gov. Terry McAuliffe (Va.). And Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) got into the race this past week. Ryan was the 17th announced Democrat. And the field seems likely to go above 20 by the end of the month. (Don't forget about Joe Biden, who hasn't announced -- but is clearly running. More on him below.) Why so many candidates? First, because Trump is president -- proving that anything can happen in politics. Second, not all of these candidates think they will win but understand that running for president brings them a national spotlight -- for them personally or for an issue they care about -- they wouldn't get otherwise. 3. $$$, part 2 Most of the candidates we expected to raise a ton of cash in the first quarter -- Bernie Sanders ($18.2 million), Beto O'Rourke ($9.4 million), Kamala Harris ($12 million) -- have already released their reports. Which means that the numbers we see this week are coming from either a) second-tier candidates (and below) and b) top-tier candidates who have underperformed expectations in the money game. Cory Booker said Sunday that he had raised more than $5 million in the first quarter, putting him well behind the leaders of the pack. But he downplayed the importance of high dollar amounts, adding that his campaign team had met the first-quarter goal they had set for themselves. ""I think this election is not going to be decided by money,"" Booker said. ""We're going to raise the money that we need to run our plan."" We are still waiting on money totals from Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand -- among others. Warren's report will be the most closely scrutinized because she was expected to do quite well and early returns suggest she may have underperformed. 2. Town halls as far as the eye can see CNN is hosting 5(!) town halls with 2020 candidates this week, featuring Gillibrand, former HUD secretary Julián Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee as the headliners. (Longer shots Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang will also get a chance to answer questions from town hall crowds.) Gillibrand will start things off Tuesday, followed by Inslee on Wednesday and Castro on Thursday. And the task for each of the trio is similar: Find a way to stand out in a field currently dominated by better known and financed candidates. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
Here's the one-line takeaway each of the candidates want voters to have after their town hall: Gillibrand: An advocate for the rights of women during her Senate tenure Inslee: Climate change isn't an environmental issue. It's an everything issue Castro: The only Latino candidate in the race, and the Texan not named Beto 1. Can Biden (finally) stop the bleeding? The former vice president is still not in the 2020 race -- sounds like a post-Easter announcement right now -- but he had his worst week of his (un)campaign last week. In trying to put allegations of unwanted touching with women behind him, Biden put out three statements and a video message. Problem was, he never just said ""sorry"" in any of them, and inflamed the whole story Friday when he joked about his habit of violating peoples' personal space. The reaction of Biden and his team -- underestimating the problem and then failing to deal with it effectively (and quickly) -- should worry anyone who thinks the former VP is the party's best nominee. The question now is whether Biden can move on from this bad past 10 days. He has an event in Philadelphia on Thursday to discuss the opioid crisis but nothing until then. Does the media -- and Democrats -- move on between now and then? Or is Biden asked questions about his behavior around women on Thursday? And, if he is asked, does he have a better answer than he had last week?"
