It stirred no love nor longing in his heart; it came unattended with pleasant memories of a golden past - inspired no sentiment of any kind; all the finer emotions were swallowed up in fear. He tried to turn and run from before it, but his legs were as lead; he was unable to lift his feet from the ground. His arms hung helpless at his sides; of his eyes only he retained control, and these he dared not remove from the lusterless orbs of the apparition, which he knew was not a soul without a body, but that most dreadful of all existences infesting that haunted wood - a body without a soul! In its blank stare was neither love, nor pity, nor intelligence - nothing to which to address an appeal for mercy. ""An appeal will not lie,"" he thought, with an absurd reversion to professional slang, making the situation more horrible, as the fire of a cigar might light up a tomb.""
