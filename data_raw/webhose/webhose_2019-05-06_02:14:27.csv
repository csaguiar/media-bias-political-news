Donald Trump has secured the future of our American courts | TheHill - The Hill,thehill.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/437750-donald-trump-has-secured-the-future-of-our-american-courts,"Donald Trump has secured the future of our American courts By Ronna McDaniel, opinion contributor — 04/07/19 01:00 PM EDT The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill View Latest Opinions >>
Two years ago, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch said at his Senate confirmation hearing, “If judges were just secret legislatures declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk.”
Today, we celebrate the anniversary of his confirmation and honor the scores of jurists appointed by President Trump Donald John Trump Sanders set for five-state Midwestern swing Tax refunds through March down billion from last year Tariffs on 'Mexican cars' are just taxes on American consumers MORE who serve faithfully to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. President Trump knows this is a priority for voters. Before the 2016 election, 65 percent of voters said Supreme Court appointments were “very important” to their decisions. Ahead of the 2018 midterms, 76 percent of voters said the same. ADVERTISEMENT
President Trump kept his promise to the American people by choosing two strong jurists, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael Kavanaugh Juan Williams: McConnell's hypocrisy on the courts Donald Trump has secured the future of our American courts Larry Kudlow defends Herman Cain: A lot of sexual allegations 'don't necessarily pan out' MORE , for the highest court in the nation. That was just the beginning. His first term in office has been marked by a historic reshaping of the judiciary at an incredible pace. President Trump has delivered 93 federal judges so far, including two Supreme Court justices, 37 circuit court judges, 30 of whom were confirmed during his first two years, and 54 district court judges.
Under this administration, the number of circuit courts with Democratic appointed majorities has fallen from nine to seven. Last month, President Trump flipped the Third Circuit to a Republican appointed majority. He brought the Eleventh Circuit to an even split. The infamously liberal Ninth Circuit had 18 Democratic appointed judges, seven Republican appointed judges, and four vacant seats at the beginning of his term. Today, it has 16 Democratic appointed judges, and the Senate will soon confirm two of his nominees. Once the vacancies are filled, the largest circuit court in the nation will have an unprecedented 13 Republican appointed judges.
Looking ahead to 2020, Republican victories will be more important than ever for the future of our courts. Democrats see state Supreme Court races as targets to reclaim ground and shift the balance of power. In Ohio, Democrats are just two state Supreme Court seats away from gaining a majority, making it critical for voters to keep Republican justices on the bench. Republicans celebrated a big victory just last week in Wisconsin, where despite being widely outspent by special interest groups and political action committees, Brian Hagedorn was elected in a historic upset, replacing a liberal justice on the state Supreme Court.
It is more important than ever for voters to maintain this momentum in the years ahead. Just look at the alarming radical proposals Democratic presidential candidates embrace today. Look at their support for court packing, or adding judges to the Supreme Court. Look at their calls to abolish the Electoral College. Look at their attempts to destroy each of our long standing institutions every time they lose an election.
Our nation cannot afford to let them win. As we gear up for a historic presidential election cycle, let us spread the message of continued success of this administration on judicial nominees. Let us energize and mobilize our communities around what is at stake in protecting our principles. In 2020, we will keep President Trump in the White House, elect Republicans across the country, protect our nation from the fringe ideas of Democrats, and secure the future of our federal courts. "

Battle begins over Trump tax returns,thehill.com,mburke@thehill.com (Michael Burke),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/437746-battle-begins-over-trump-tax-returns,"Battle begins over Trump tax returns By Michael Burke - 04/07/19 12:58 PM EDT
Donald John Trump Trump to stage tax-day event in Minnesota Dem senator presses Pompeo: 'Do you believe our country is full?' Bipartisan senators offer bill to expand electric vehicle tax credit MORE ’s tax returns heated up Sunday as Trump's allies took to the Sunday show circuit to dismiss Democratic efforts to obtain the president’s taxes.
While Democrats are going all-in on their method of requesting Trump's returns through the Internal Revenue Service after he refused to release them voluntarily, even some Republicans who want to see the president's taxes are mocking Democrats' latest attempt to get them.
And acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney
Appearing on “Fox News Sunday"" days after the House Ways and Means Committee f ormally requested Trump’s taxes, Mulvaney said Democrats will “never” see Trump’s taxes.
""Nor should they. That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway,"" Mulvaney said.
He also accused Democrats of knowing they can't get Trump's taxes and called their pursuits a ""political hit job."" MIck Mulvaney says that the democrats will never see President Trump's taxes and that they know they won't #FNS pic.twitter.com/DDjFmjGz8f
Trump's personal legal team has already urged the IRS not to release his taxes, arguing that the Justice Department needs to weigh in on the legality of the request.
Sekulow doubled down on that approach Sunday, saying during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week” that Democrats do not have a “legitimate legislative purpose” for requesting Trump’s taxes.
He also accused Democrats of using the IRS as a “political weapon.”
“But this idea that you can use the IRS as a political weapon, which is what is happening here, is incorrect both as a matter of statutory law and constitutionally. We should not be in a situation where individual private tax returns are used for political purposes,” he said.
Democrats are not alone in wanting to see Trump's taxes. Multiple Republicans, including Sens. John Kennedy
Romney similarly said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he wishes Trump would release his taxes but called the Democratic approach ""moronic"" and predicted that Trump will ""win this victory."" ""[Trump] said he would be happy to release his returns. So I wish he’d do that. But I have to also tell you I think the Democrats are just playing along his handbook, which is, going after his tax returns through legislative action is moronic,"" he said. ""That’s not going to happen,"" Romney added. ""The courts are not going to say that you can compel a person running for office to release their tax returns. He’s going to win this victory.” Democrats defend themselves by saying they have an oversight responsibility and that Trump forced the Democrats' hand by breaking with tradition and not willingly sharing his taxes. Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that no other president in modern history "" has had to have their tax returns requested under 6103 because they’ve all voluntarily shared them.""
"" Just as President Trump promised as a candidate that he would share his tax returns. After he was elected he promised he would share his tax returns with the American people. And he’s refused to do so,"" Luján added. Trump has said in the past that he is willing to release his taxes but won't do so because he is under audit. The IRS says it does not prevent individuals from releasing their personal returns even when they're under audit.
Kildee, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that there is a ""real question"" of whether ""the president's personal financial interests impact his public decision making.""
""The unusual situation is not Congress using its authority to gain access legitimately under a very clear statute, the thing that's unusual is that Donald Trump has broken 50 years — nearly 50 years of tradition by not being transparent with the American people,"" Kildee said."

Mick Milvaney slapped down House Dems demands…
Gregg Re (FoxNews): Mulvaney vows Dems will ‘never’ see Trump’s tax returns, despite renewed push
“Oh no, never — nor should they,” Mulvaney told Bill Hemmer, who is filling in for host Chris Wallace, when asked if Democrats will ever see the president’s tax returns. “That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway.”
“They know one of the fundamental principles of the IRS is to protect the confidentiality of you and me and everybody else who files taxes. They know that,” Mulvaney said. “They know the terms under law by which the IRS can give them the documents, but political hit job is not one of those reasons.”

"Mark Levin: ‘If I DID vote in Israel, I’d vote for Netanyahu and the Likud party!’",therightscoop.com,SooperMexican,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://therightscoop.com/mark-levin-if-i-did-vote-in-israel-id-vote-for-netanyahu-and-the-likud-party/,"Mark Levin made it very clear where he stands with the Israeli vote coming up, and who he would vote for if he were voting in the election.
Here’s the clip below:
Here’s a transcript:
“…We had Barack Obama use the State Department and American tax dollars to try and defeat Benjamin Netanyahu last time around. We have the New York Times that has a daily drumbeat of anti-Israel, anti-Netanyahu stories by cretins, malcontents, miscreants, and that sort of crowd. We let me use my microphone to do the following: I don’t know the extend to this program reaches into the State of Israel but we are heard on podcasts throughout the world and including in Israel. And I just want to encourage the Israelis as strongly as I know how to vote for Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud Party. Benjamin Netanyahu has not only been a great leader for Israel but during the time when Obama was President he was the most important leader of the free world. He is a tremendous ally of this country, and he’s hated by the Left because he’s a strong leader. He’s hated by the Left because he’s made Israel a strong, economic country. He’s moved it towards the free market and away from socialism. He’s hated by the Left because the Israelis know how to defend themselves, and they’ve built up a military second to none in the Middle East. It was all fine when Israel was a victim country. It was all fine when the Arab states and the Muslim countries thought they could defeat Israel. But now that Israel has built itself into a mighty power in the Middle East, now they treat it as some kind of imperialist state. It’s nothing of the sort. And your Prime Minister in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has worked very closely with President Trump and as a result of that Jerusalem is recognized as the capital of Israel, as it is and always should be. The United States Embassy was moved from Tel Aviv to [Jerusalem]. The Iran deal, thank goodness for the United States and Israel, and the Arab states that are not radicalized, few and far between, the United States left the Obama nuclear Iran deal. I cannot believe that the people of Israel having witnessed these incredibly historic events, having benefitted from the rational, free market policies of their Prime Minister and his government, having benefited from the security decisions of their Prime Minister and his government, that they would dislodge him from office. It would be like the British after World War II voting out Winston Churchill. Benjamin Netanyahu is, for lack of a better parallel, Israel’s Winston Churchill, Israel’s Ronald Reagan, Israel’s Margaret Thatcher, if you get my drift in terms of policies. He is a strong statesman surrounded by little, political munchkins.
I feel the same way about President Trump. My admiration for Trump has been growing and growing over time as you know. I am extremely impressed with him. There are people who come on TV and radio who want to play games. They want you to think they are taking sides but not really taking sides. They want you to think they are for Trump but not really for Trump. And then they pass this off as being thoughtful, and objective, consciousness in terms of their viewpoints. They’re not. They’re positioning themselves. We are in the middle of a political civil war like we’ve never seen in modern times, between capitalism and socialism, between securing a border and having no border, between building up our military and eviscerating our military, between strengthening the rule of law and rejecting the rule of law, embracing the constitution and undermining the constitution. There’s a lot of good versus evil going on right now and a lot of it is in black and white. And I don’t mean race wise, I mean like ink, black and white. As Reagan would say no pastel colors. And to be sitting on the sidelines or playing games in order to promote your careers or promote your ego, “Uh, you know I like him….” No, now is not the time for that.
And I say the same to the Israelis: you’d be making a disastrous decision if you fell for one of these other candidates and their propaganda. You have a historic figure serving as your Prime Minister. Just like our President, they’re trying to take him out. They brought these phony indictments. They were timed to effect the elections. Who brings indictments five weeks before an election unless they are trying to effect the outcome? Isn’t that quite obvious? Or says they’re going to bring them. Over cigars and champagne for God’s sakes. And over free speech and the media for God’s sakes. What a bunch of crap. But you in Israel you’re going to decide your own fate, whether you have a strong leader or a nebbish, may I say with all due respect. I don’t vote in Israel. I am not a dual citizen. I am an American citizen. I vote right here. But if I did vote in Israel I’d be voting for Netanyahu and the Likud Party. There’s no question about it. Wouldn’t you ladies and gentleman? Wouldn’t you, you Levinites? I know you would…. “
It is definitely a historically important vote for Israel and Netanyahu. Total: 1.8K"

Squirrelly The reason I didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 was connected to his character issue. But because he didn’t have a political record we could examine and trust, we had nothing much else to go on. Yes, we knew he was a good businessman, but the character issue caused me to doubt if he really meant what he was saying during his campaign. In short, I didn’t trust him.
Well, he proved me wrong, thank God. He did mean what he said. So his “character issue” doesn’t mean much to me anymore, that’s a private matter that he and his family have to deal with. It has not in any way negatively affected his ability to do his job, even better than I could have hoped for. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote 6 hours ago"

While exploring a run for president in Nevada, Mayor Bill de Blasio endorsed a committee to study reparations for descendants of slaves and then went further — saying that the country needs ""a program of actual redistribution"" of wealth.
A progressive activist asked the mayor his position on reparations at an event in Las Vegas Friday following the endorsement of the compensation plan by other presidential contenders like Elizabeth Warren.
""There's no question that the issue of reparations has to be taken seriously,"" said de Blasio.
