Buttigieg pushes for massive fundraising haul to cement top-tier status,www.politico.com,MAGGIE SEVERNS,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/pete-buttigieg-fundraising-2020-1345001,"Pete Buttigieg is aiming to shake the Democratic presidential race with a massive fundraising total this quarter, staking his claim in the top tier of the primary and demonstrating staying power after rocketing to prominence two months ago.
Buttigieg is encouraging moneyed supporters to juice his campaign’s fundraising with a new bundling program, details of which were recently circulated to some donors and obtained by POLITICO. Members at different levels of the program pledge to raise anywhere from $25,000 to $250,000 for Buttigieg over the course of the primary campaign and receive special perks, including briefings with the candidate and senior campaign staff.

Buttigieg is asking supporters who join the program to bring in half of their total fundraising commitment by the end of next month — the end of the current fundraising period, after which campaigns have to disclose how much money they have raised since April 1. The aggressive timetable reflects the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s fast rise in the 2020 presidential race and the importance of maintaining forward momentum in a crowded primary. Buttigieg has regularly placed in the top five in primary polls since starring in a March town hall, and a big fundraising total would help prove he could avoid the fate of past flash-in-the-pan candidates and keep rising in the Democratic race.
Buttigieg’s fans, who include a growing number of well-connected Democratic organizers and donors, think he’s poised to make a splash.
“He’s getting surprisingly strong traction,” said Charles Adams Jr., a former U.S. ambassador to Finland who raised more than half a million dollars for President Barack Obama. Adams is co-hosting a June 1 fundraiser for Buttigieg in San Francisco that is almost at capacity for attendance, he said, and he has “decided to be principally helping Pete Buttigieg” in the race.
“It is Pete Buttigieg, to me, who is the most compelling, the greatest breath of fresh air and, I think, the most likely to excite and to mobilize voters,” Adams said.
Buttigieg entered the presidential race as a largely unknown long shot, with neither a network of big donors who had supported prior bids for office, like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had, nor a massive Bernie Sanders-style online following. But Buttigieg caught fire online in March and has quickly built a fan club of donors who are packing into frequent soirees for Buttigieg in cities across the country, including midlevel supporters attending “grassroots fundraisers” with lower ticket prices.
During the upcoming visit to the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, Buttigieg is scheduled to cram no fewer than four fundraising events into one day: He will stop in Oakland for a fundraiser whose hosts include former Facebook executive Chris Cox and wife Visra Vichit-Vadakan; head to a pair of events in San Francisco, including one that Adams and former U.S. Ambassador Jeff Bleich are helping host; and finish the day with an event south of the city in Hillsborough.
The furious pace of in-person fundraisers has set Buttigieg apart from some other Democratic candidates, including those who have preferred mining for digital dollars and others who have had trouble attracting widespread interest from Democratic donors. It has vaulted the mayor into competition with some of the top Democratic fundraisers: Biden organized a national finance structure for his campaign with regional fundraisers in each part of the country before he launched his bid. And Harris is in the process of building out a major bundling program for her campaign, with top fundraisers set to gather for a retreat in California in early June.
Observers expect Buttigieg, who raised $7 million during the first three months of the year, to be among the top fundraisers for the second fundraising period.
“It’s really quite remarkable that in a field of 25 candidates — in such an unprecedented, large field of many accomplished individuals — Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been able to galvanize audiences and hold the attention of the Democratic public,” said Robert Zimmerman, a New York-based Democratic fundraiser who has not endorsed a candidate but gave Buttigieg the biggest allowable donation, $2,800.
Two of Buttigieg’s upcoming San Francisco area events have ticket prices starting at $25 and go up to $2,800, with the higher ticket prices garnering access to special VIP receptions. The tiered pricing helps make Buttigieg’s events more accessible to younger and less wealthy donors — some of whom are new to face-to-face political giving — whom the campaign is courting alongside the traditional moneyed class.
Buttigieg’s new bundling program, for example, offers participants “mentorship and networking opportunities for both experienced and less experienced fundraisers to connect, strategize, and ideate,” according to the memo reviewed by POLITICO.
People who participate in the lowest tier of organizing pledge to raise $25,000 during the primary and at least $10,000 by June 30 — a fraction of the $125,000 that top-tier organizers for Buttigieg are asked to bring in by that date. They may raise money “through house parties and other ways to bring a wider group of donors into the campaign.”
“We are inclusive and want everyone to be a part of this effort,” the memo says. “Join us.”
Buttigieg’s top-tier bundlers — referred to as his “National Investors Circle” — pledge to raise at least $250,000 during the primary, with half coming before the end of this quarter. For those top fundraisers, there are several benefits listed on the memo, including quarterly briefings with Buttigieg, monthly briefings with senior campaign officials and access to “Speaker Series conversations” and other events.
The work to set up fundraising structures in the second quarter reflects how hard candidates across the presidential field are working to raise money since the initial burst of energy surrounding their campaign launches. Even Sanders, whose online fundraising netted him more than $18 million in the first quarter — the biggest total in the Democratic primary field — has recently hired a fundraiser, a first for his presidential efforts, to organize events at which Sanders can raise money from supporters in person for the first time.
Zimmerman cautioned that chasing small-dollar donors is as crucial as chasing big bundlers this election cycle and said he was in favor of Buttigieg’s two-pronged approach to raising small and big dollars alike.
“The reality is: Donors who max out at $2,800, there aren’t enough of them,” Zimmerman said."
Trump awards trophy at marquee sumo event in Tokyo,www.politico.com,MICHAEL CROWLEY,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/donald-trump-sumo-wrestling-japan-tokyo-1345011,"MOBARA, Japan — President Donald Trump presented a special Trump trophy to the winner of a sumo tournament in Tokyo on Sunday as he got a taste of one of Japan’s most treasured cultural institutions.
The honor given to Trump was part of a charm offensive Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe continued Sunday as he courted the president with three things close to his heart: wrestling matches, cheeseburgers and golf.
Story Continued Below
Call it sumo diplomacy.
The president, first lady Melania Trump, Abe and his wife, Akie, joined an estimated 11,500 fans who packed Ryogoku Kokugikan Stadium to watch oversize, muscular men battling in loin cloths.
At the end, Trump stepped into the ring and presented the eagle-topped “President’s Cup” to champion wrestler Asanoyama, making him the first American president to participate. Shoes aren’t permitted in the sumo ring, but Trump wore dark-colored slippers.
“That was something to see these great athletes,” Trump said before dinner at a Hibachi restaurant.
Trump’s four-day state visit to Japan is designed to demonstrate the strength of the bond between the nations. The president received a warm welcome as he arrived at Mobara Country Club, south of Tokyo, for a steamy morning round of golf with the Japanese leader. It was their fifth golf outing.
Abe is pulling out all the stops as he seeks to placate Trump amid growing U.S.-Japan trade tensions and the threat of auto tariffs. Japan is also contending with the continued threat of North Korea and Trump’s apparent dismissal of Pyongyang’s recent tests of short-range missiles that could reach Japan.
But minus several antagonistic tweets, Sunday was all about bromance and keeping Trump happy.
First it was the golf course, where Trump and Abe played 16 holes, joined by Japanese professional golfer Isao Aoki. Aoki, who is famous for his putting technique, was expected to present Trump with a putter he designed.
On the lunch menu: Double cheeseburgers made with U.S. beef.
Next, Abe introduced Trump to Japan’s ancient sport of sumo wrestling — something Trump has said he said he finds “fascinating.”
The president was welcomed to the stadium with loud applause and sat ringside at the match in a low-back, breaking the custom of sitting cross-legged on a mat. Once it was done, Trump climbed on stage to present his cup to wrestler Asanoyama, who clinched the tournament win on Saturday.
Trump read from a scroll, praising Asanoyama’s “outstanding achievement” and then hoisted the hefty cup, which the White House said stands 54 inches (137 centimeters) tall and weighs 60 to 70 pounds (27-32 kilograms), into Asanoyama’s arms with the help of an official.
Asanoyama was presented with a trophy by Abe and an emperor’s trophy as well.
The president’s attendance at the annual summer sumo tournament in Tokyo might have recalled memories of time he spent promoting the World Wrestling Federation. Trump sponsored major events, appeared in bits and was inducted into the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2013.
On Monday, Trump will receive another honor when he becomes the first foreign leader to meet with Japan’s new emperor, Naruhito, since he ascended to the throne on May 1. Trump and Abe will also meet in a more formal setting and participate in a joint news conference. In the evening, Trump will be guest of honor at a banquet hosted by the emperor at Japan’s Imperial Palace.
“We’ve had a great time, a great stay, and tomorrow is really the big event, a very important event in the history of Japan,” Trump said. “It’s over 200 years since something like this has happened so it’s a great honor to be representing the United States.”
The Abe-Trump bromance began even before Trump took office when Abe rushed to New York to greet the president-elect at Trump Tower. Japan is deeply dependent on the U.S. for security and Abe has tried to encourage Trump to maintain international agreements and keep pressure on North Korea.
Golf, in particular, has been a bonding activity for the leaders, who both love the game.
“We were able to exchange our views frankly in a cozy atmosphere. It was wonderful,” Abe told reporters as he returned to his official residence mid-day. He tweeted a selfie photo of him and Trump, smiling widely on the greens.
Trump tweeted that he’d had “Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo,” but also continued to stew about domestic politics, claiming that, “Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed - Death Wish!”
There has long been a tradition of American presidents and candidates holding their tongues about rivals while on foreign soil — but Trump is not one to abide by such norms.
Earlier, Trump had gone after one of his potential Democratic rivals, former President Joe Biden, saying he’d smiled when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse.”
He also downplayed North Korea’s recent series of short-range missile tests. He tweeted that the tests weren’t a concern for him — even though they most certainly are for Japan, due to the country’s proximity to the North.
“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump wrote in a message that appeared to undermine his national security adviser, John Bolton, who told reporters Saturday the tests violated U.N. Security Council resolutions.
The president also sought to manage expectations that he and Abe will make significant headway on trade issues when they hold more formal talks on Monday. Trump has been seeking a bilateral trade agreement with Tokyo since he pulled the U.S. out of the multinational Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement two years ago, though analysts expect no breakthroughs during Trump’s visit.
“Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!” he wrote, referring to Japan’s upcoming parliamentary elections.
The Trump administration has been threatening Japan with new tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts on national security grounds. Trump has suggested he will impose tariffs if the U.S. can’t wrest concessions from Japan and the European Union. In April, Japan’s trade surplus surged almost 18% to 723 billion yen ($6.6 billion)."
Why Trump’s Stonewalling Legal Strategy Will Keep Failing. Magazine,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/26/trump-tax-returns-subpoena-226987,"In the space of three days this week, two federal judges ruled decisively in favor of Congress’ right to subpoena personal financial and business records. The speed of the decisions—unusual in complex federal litigation—demonstrates a significant flaw in the administration’s “fight all the subpoenas” strategy. More importantly, it suggests that Trump’s strategy of categorically fighting all congressional subpoenas will undermine his ability to stonewall Congress in subsequent cases.
Already, one of the rulings has been appealed by the Trump administration, and a three-judge panel is scheduled to hear the case in July. In the meantime, however, we are witnessing profound legal decisions in defense of congressional power. If Trump’s stonewalling strategy was intended to run out the clock by forcing Democrats into interminable court fights, it appears so far to be having the exact opposite effect—almost like a little league game that gets called early because one team is scoring too many unanswered runs.
On Monday, federal Judge Amit Mehta issued a sweeping decision rejecting Trump’s personal challenge to a House Oversight Committee subpoena of his financial records from an accounting firm he has used. The main argument Trump advanced was that there was no legislative purpose for the subpoena.
Mehta made quick work of that argument, noting that courts have long held that they must presume Congress is acting to legislate. But Trump’s argument went further, claiming that Congress is engaging in “law enforcement” and that corrupt behavior by the president is not a “ proper subject of investigation .” Mehta cited Watergate as an obvious rebuttal.
Trump’s argument is doomed to fail in the courts because the Constitution gives the House the “full power of impeachment” and it could not exercise that authority without investigating presidential wrongdoing. Mehta found that it is “simply not fathomable” that “a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a president for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct—past or present—even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.”
Wednesday’s ruling by Judge Edgardo Ramos made equally quick work of Trump’s argument that subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One for his records lacked a “legitimate legislative purpose.” He found that argument “unpersuasive,” finding that it was “not the role of the judicial branch to question [Congress’] motives.” He denied every one of Trump’s requests.
What is remarkable about these sweeping rulings is not the results, which were expected, but the speed with which they were issued. Mehta issued his 41-page ruling just seven days after hearing arguments.
If Trump’s team is not alarmed by the speed and sweeping nature—not to mention the almost dismissive tone—of the two judgments against the president, it should be. Trump’s strategy on a variety of fronts has been to take extreme positions denying congressional authority to investigate the president. On Monday, for example, the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the president’s senior advisers are immune from subpoenas to testify about their official duties. Buried on Page 9 of the memo was an admission that the only court to consider this issue had ruled to the contrary. Hiding an unfavorable precedent in this manner might work on a first-year law student, but it won’t fool a federal judge.
Last week, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, arguing against having to produce the full Mueller Report and underlying materials, said the House Judiciary Committee lacked any “ legislative purpose ” for investigating Trump’s conduct as detailed in the Mueller report. He accused the House Judiciary of conducting a “pseudo law enforcement investigation.” Sound familiar?
The Achilles' heel of Trump’s strategy is that his extreme positions are not fact-specific or nuanced and are easily disposed of as legally groundless. Mehta noted that the “legal issues presented do not require the court to resolve any fact contests because the material facts are not in dispute.” Because Trump challenged the very right of Congress to investigate these matters, the only facts the court needed to consider were basic facts that no one could possibly dispute.
That stands in stark contrast to prior disputes between the executive branch and Congress. For example, the dispute over certain materials subpoenaed by Congress in its investigation of Operation Fast and Furious resulted in litigation that took eight years to resolve. But the Obama administration did not take the categorical, aggressive approach that Trump has. Obama’s Justice Department produced some witnesses and documents and fought over other documents over which it claimed privilege.
If Trump continues down this path—over former White House counsel Don McGahn’s refusal to appear before the House Judiciary, for example—expect to see more swift rulings swatting down his legal arguments in the coming weeks and months. No court is going to rule that the executive branch can categorically refuse to produce evidence and witnesses from a criminal investigation of the president of the United States to the House of Representatives.
Trump’s team no doubt believes that once its initial arguments fail, it will advance more nuanced arguments that seek to protect only a limited subset of material from disclosure. But as any experienced litigator knows, a judge’s impression of a party’s position is influenced by the history of the litigation. Because Trump’s lawyers have not even paid lip service to our constitutional system at the outset, judges will be less inclined to take their arguments seriously later on. In addition, the decisions issued by judges denying Trump’s challenges will influence other judges considering similar challenges brought by Trump against other congressional subpoenas.
Trump has appointed hundreds of federal judges, many of whom undoubtedly share his expansive view of executive power. One of his appointees, Neomi Rao, sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which will hear arguments about the Mehta ruling. But Trump has made it difficult for judges to show him the deference that courts might otherwise show the president.
For that reason, a savvy litigator would not roll the dice with the risky legal strategy Trump has advanced. A more sophisticated approach would be to make limited accommodations to Congress and advance very fact-specific objections to congressional subpoenas that would require a court to engage in a time-consuming inquiry to parse through. Trump’s current strategy lacks that sophistication.
As a result, his strategy is not only generating adverse results quickly, but it could very well convince a court that he is acting in bad faith. If that happens, the House could get the courts to do what it is ill-equipped to do itself: enforce compliance with congressional subpoenas. That could get congressional investigations, or even an impeachment inquiry, off the ground."
'Ghosted': GOP abandons female House hopeful despite talk of electing women,www.politico.com,LAURA BARRÓN-LÓPEZ,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/republican-women-candidates-house-1340540,"Before Leigh Brown ran for a vacant House seat in North Carolina earlier this year, she got plenty of encouragement from Republicans in Washington eager to grow the ranks of GOP women in Congress.
Then Brown jumped into a crowded Republican primary — and the people who had given her hope were nowhere to be found. Among those who disappeared, she said, was Rep. Elise Stefanik, who launched an initiative this year to elect more Republican women.
Story Continued Below
Brown finished a distant fourth place in the primary this month, losing the GOP nomination to the state senator who sponsored North Carolina’s controversial “bathroom bill” in 2016.
“That's a little frustrating to have initial conversations and then follow up and be ghosted,” Brown said in an interview with POLITICO. “I put my real estate business on hold. I've dinged my own reputation in order to put myself forward as a public servant, and then you find out exactly how lonely it is to run for office.”
Stefanik acknowledged Brown’s account during a brief exchange in the Capitol last week but declined to elaborate.
The Republican Party has ramped up its efforts to recruit female candidates for the 2020 election, following the brutal midterm that decimated the ranks of GOP women. But Brown’s experience highlights an enduring challenge for the party: translating widespread concern about the dearth of women in the House Republican Conference into significant campaign support and, ultimately, victories by female candidates.
GOP consultants and candidates acknowledge their recruitment and resources lag far behind Democrats. And no centralized group exists to provide hiring advice, social media guidance, press training, or messaging tactics to candidates. Democrats, on the other hand, have the behemoth EMILY’s List network, as well as groups focused on recruiting immigrants, women of color, female veterans and more.
“The support structure needs to be more than the idea that you can get some PAC dollars from random PACs out there,” Brown said. “I didn't know how to hire. I'm an outsider to this.”
Republicans are not blind to the problem. A growing number of outside GOP groups are dedicated to boosting female candidates since the House GOP’s official campaign arm doesn’t play in primaries. “Winning for Women” launched a new super PAC in response to the devastating losses Republicans suffered in 2018.
And after watching her party swear in a 29-member class of House freshmen that included 28 men, Stefanik repurposed her leadership PAC, known as E-PAC, to focus on backing women in primaries. She told POLITICO at the time that “we are at a crisis level for GOP women.”
But neither Stefanik nor Winning for Women supported Brown, who faced nine other Republicans in the North Carolina race — including three other women, each of whom finished with fewer than a thousand votes. The National Association of Realtors threw $1.3 million behind Brown as she presented a more moderate tone than her conservative opponents, and View PAC, a group focused on electing more GOP women since 1997, endorsed her.
Brown also spoke to Winning for Women before she filed and received strong encouragement. But once she announced her candidacy, she never heard from them again. Winning for Women’s super PAC said it has limited resources and stresses candidate viability.
Privately, sources said national groups shied away from the North Carolina race because of the election fraud scandal surrounding the district. The special election was called after a state board found evidence of illegal ballot harvesting in the 2018 election by an operative working for the GOP nominee.
Instead, a number of Washington Republicans, including Stefanik and Winning for Women, have coalesced around a different female candidate in another special North Carolina race this year: Joan Perry.
Perry’s success in an upcoming July 9 runoff will be the first real test of Republicans’ new efforts to propel female candidates through primaries. But Perry begins the race at a disadvantage: She finished with 15 percent of the vote in the April primary, behind the first-place candidate, Greg Murphy, who earned 23 percent.
If Perry fails, it will highlight the limits of Republicans’ cash-only strategy — and amplify the party’s woman problem heading into 2020.
“Donors are taking it seriously. Outside groups are taking this seriously. The party is taking it seriously,” said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for the Winning for Women Action Fund. “It would be awesome if the first election after the midterms, Republican voters chose a woman. It would send a strong message.”
Indeed, Republican leaders have made replenishing their ranks of female lawmakers a top priority in 2020. The issue could take on even greater urgency if Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, decides to run for an open Senate seat in Wyoming.
The party’s leader, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), has already contributed to New York state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who is running to unseat freshman Democratic Rep. Max Rose — even though the rest of the GOP field has yet to take shape.
“McCarthy has definitely been supportive of female candidates. I know that he likes to meet with as many of them as possible, which is a big job,” said Julie Conway, executive director for VIEW PAC.
Of the 13 Republican women left in the House, some have taken it upon themselves to help usher more female candidates into Congress. In addition to Stefanik’s PAC, Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) has been getting personally involved in primaries and launched a ""Suburban Caucus"" this year to craft an economic-driven agenda for female candidates running in suburban swing districts.
“I play in primaries. Some do; some don’t,"" said Wagner, who recently wrote a check to Perry and offers the first-time candidate advice, mentorship and encouraging voice mails. “I believe you have to offer them a full-package approach.”
During a recent political meeting near Capitol Hill, GOP leadership updated the caucus on its recruitment efforts and touted the number of female and minority candidates who are interested in running.
Yet according to recent data collected by The Associated Press, just 38 of 172 declared Republican House challengers for the 2020 elections were women, or around 1 in 5. That compares with 84 of 222 declared House Democratic challengers, nearly 2 in 5.
Part of the problem, critics say, is that there is little concert between the groups set up to help Republican women. And they limit where they get involved to vacant, open Republican-leaning seats or swing districts currently held by Democrats — while deliberately shying away from backing challengers to male incumbents.
“Why do you have all these groups working against each other?” asked one longtime female Republican consultant, offered anonymity to discuss internal party dynamics. “Why not all get along and be [like] EMILY’s List — and be recruiting women, mentoring people, electing women?""
The key to getting Republicans to commit to a cohesive effort to boost women candidates isn’t just convincing them that it’s good for the party’s image, but that women will make better candidates in general elections against Democrats, VIEW PAC’s Conway said.
""People need to put their thumbs on the scale during the primary to make the nominee be the person most likely to be able to win in November,” Conway said. “And the Republicans have not done enough of that.”"
The Spy Case That Made Adam Schiff a Russia Hawk Magazine,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/26/adam-schiff-russia-hawk-524-226983,"On September 25, 1984, three officials from the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco departed for San Francisco Airport to meet with their counterparts from Seattle and exchange confidential “pouched” diplomatic materials.
This exchange happened every other Tuesday, and each time, the Soviets were tailed by a van full of San Francisco-based FBI counterintelligence officials. Although the FBI knew the Soviets were aware of this surveillance, the Bureau didn’t try to conceal it either, according to the Los Angeles Times , which recounted this event from later court testimony.
But this Tuesday in 1984 was different. Normally, there were only two Soviet officials meeting the Seattle diplomats at the airport, not three. And in addition to the usual FBI surveillance team, the Bureau had assigned 20 more agents to track the movement of the third man, Aleksander Grishin, an accredited diplomat—and a Soviet intelligence officer.
When the Soviet officials entered the airport, with FBI agents watching, Grishin detached himself to make a call at a pay phone. Hundreds of miles down the coast, FBI counterintelligence agents working out of a makeshift base of operations in a Los Angeles motel listened as Svetlana Ogorodnikov, a 34-year-old Soviet émigré who had been on the FBI’s radar, picked up the phone in her Hollywood apartment. It was Grishin. Speaking in coded Russian, he asked if she had made arrangements with an “acquaintance” to fly to Europe that October. Ogorodnikov confirmed she had.
This was no ordinary FBI surveillance operation: The “acquaintance” Grishin referred to was himself an FBI agent—a man who, out of greed, desperation, and spite, had begun an affair with Ogorodnikov and agreed to sell classified information to the Soviet government. Eventually, this man—Richard W. Miller, a 47-year-old Los Angeles-based counterintelligence agent on the Bureau’s Soviet squad—would become the first FBI agent ever convicted of espionage.
And the man who would finally secure Miller’s conviction in 1990—after three trials over the course of six years—was a young U.S. attorney in Los Angeles: Adam Schiff.
Today, Schiff is more familiar as the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and one of the country’s most vocal critics of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia-connected figures during the 2016 presidential race—entanglements Schiff called, in a phone interview, “deeply unethical” and in some cases “fundamentally compromising.” To some observers, Schiff’s vehemence—he frequently appears on TV, and often gets attacked by on Twitter—seems politically opportunistic, or misplaced. But his toughness on Russia and his wariness of Moscow’s intelligence apparatus far predate Trump. In key ways, Schiff’s perspective on Russia was shaped decades earlier, during his prosecution of Richard Miller.
“I learned a lot about Russian tradecraft: how the Russians operate, who they target, the vulnerabilities they look for,” Schiff recalls. “They want people with access to information that is of use to them. They look for people who are sort of at the margins at what they do, that have financial problems, who have marital problems that they can exploit. And they found a very good target with Richard Miller.”
During his work on the case, Schiff was also in frequent contact with FBI agents investigating Miller—giving the future congressman an intimate look at, and respect for, the Bureau’s counterintelligence mission.
Since the release last month of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump and Russia, Schiff has made an increasingly assertive push for the counterintelligence information the FBI and Mueller’s team gathered about Trump-Russia, which was largely excluded from the redacted Mueller report. In a May 8 subpoena to Attorney General Bill Barr, Schiff demanded “all documents and materials, regardless of form or classification,” relating to the counterintelligence or foreign intelligence side of the investigation. (On May 21, Schiff and the Justice Department reached a tentative deal for Schiff’s committee to access these materials.) Schiff has also asked for a briefing by Justice Department officials on the FBI’s counterintelligence probe into Trump-Russia, which began before Mueller’s probe but whose current status is unclear.
Schiff accepts that Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Trump associates and the Russian government (though he has said there is “plenty of evidence of collusion.”) For the congressman, the Trump-Russia affair goes beyond the domain of the potentially prosecutable, and broaches the broader question of compromise —whether, say, one’s financial or personal entanglements can create improper levers of influence for a hostile foreign state. In the counterintelligence world, behavior need not be criminal to represent a threat to the country’s national security interests.
Schiff, unusually for someone in Congress, first learned this lesson decades ago. To fully understand why he has continued to ring the alarm on Trump-Russia, we need to travel back to Los Angeles in 1984, and the strange, sordid saga of Richard Miller.
***
Almost everyone who interacted with him professionally seemed to agree: Miller should never have become an FBI agent.
According to contemporaneous reporting and recent interviews with former FBI officials, Miller was slovenly and overweight, which earned him sanctions from his FBI superiors, designed to induce him into getting into shape. He was chastised by his bosses for selling Amway products out of the trunk of his car. He was known to pilfer comic books and candy bars from 7-Eleven, and consume them with abandon. At one point, he admitted to skimming from payments he was supposed to give to Bureau informants, and to selling FBI data to a local private investigator.
Miller’s home life was complicated. He lived alone during the workweek in a rundown house in Los Angeles and commuted back on the weekend to San Diego County, where his wife and eight children lived near a small avocado ranch that he tended. With Miller’s modest government salary, money was tight. His marriage was also suffering: In 1983, Miller, a practicing Mormon, was excommunicated from the church over an ongoing affair.
John Libby, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Schiff on the 1990 conviction, called Miller “a complete mess.” He was a “goofball” and an “idiot,” says a former FBI counterintelligence agent who worked the Miller case. Another former FBI agent who was involved in the investigation described Miller to me, variously, as a “moron,” a “misfit,” a “putz” whose “clothes looked like he slept in them,” and an all-around “terrible person.”
Miller “was a case of the FBI carrying its wounded too far,” recalls this person. “He screwed up everything he did.”
Miller came to the Soviet squad with no background in Russian language or culture, and no prior experience in counterintelligence. Many of the Bureau’s senior-most officials in Los Angeles, however, were important figures in the local Mormon community; re-assigning Miller to the Soviet squad was, ironically, part of an effort to keep an eye on him—to bring him back “into the FBI fold, and the Mormon fold,” Libby recalls.
It didn’t work. Miller once again failed to distinguish himself. Then, in May 1984, he met Svetlana Ogorodonikov.
Ogorodonikov was considered an outré and not entirely trustworthy figure in the local Soviet émigré community, which was largely populated by “refuseniks”—Jews who had fought for exit visas, and who were stripped of their Soviet citizenship upon leaving the country and banned from returning. According to Sleeping With The FBI , a 1993 book about the Miller case by Russell Warren Howe, Ogorodonikov’s husband, Nikolay, was Jewish, and the family used an exemption allowing Jews to leave the Soviet Union permanently to re-settle in Los Angeles.
Svetlana trained to become a medical technician; Nikolay worked in a sausage factory. But for the Ogorodnikovs, Los Angeles was strange and desiccated. The marriage soured. They were poor. They fought. They drank, especially Svetlana. Homesick, she decided she wanted to visit her family back in Russia, and to send the couple’s son to a Crimean summer camp favored by the children of Soviet apparatchiks. Both required special dispensation from Soviet officials, so, according to reports in the L.A. Tim es and conversations with former FBI officials, she started serving as a sort of social host and fixer to Soviet diplomats traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles—and to intelligence officers working undercover as diplomats, like Aleksander Grishin.
By the early 1980s, Ogorodnikov was running a Soviet film series that catered to local Russian speakers in Los Angeles. This part-time job not only helped her keep tabs on the community but allowed her to travel occasionally to the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco—the USSR’s West Coast spy base—where she picked up the films. Ogorodnikov served as a sort of clearinghouse for information about members of the Soviet émigré community in Los Angeles, which she passed on to her to consular contacts. According to the L.A. Times , she was once dispatched by Soviet consular personnel in San Francisco to help quash a mutiny of Soviet sailors at the Port of Los Angeles and even briefly initiated a search for a Soviet defector who was believed to live in Southern California.
By 1980, Ogorodikov’s frequent trips to the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco had piqued the interest of the FBI’s Los Angeles office. In 1982, she was approached by the Bureau, meeting regularly with FBI counterintelligence agent John Hunt, but he ended their relationship early the next year, claiming it wasn’t resulting in any valuable information. There were also questions about where her ultimate loyalties lay. And there might have been another factor at play: Ogorodonikov would later claim that she and Hunt were sleeping together, and Hunt would retire quietly around the time of Miller’s arrest in 1984. (Hunt denied the affair.)
Ogorodnikov wasn’t a trained spy, but U.S. officials believed her work showed she was acting as a Soviet intelligence asset. (“The Svetlana equivalent [today] is Maria Butina,” says Libby, referring to the U.S.-based Russian gun-rights activist, who in April was sentenced to 18 months in prison for being an unregistered Russian agent. “It’s literally the same MO.”)
In the spring of 1984, Ogorodnikov again reached out to Hunt at the main FBI office in Los Angeles, perhaps in an attempt to rekindle their relationship. Hunt continued to avoid her. But Miller, it appears, got wind of her calls and made contact. The two started meeting regularly; part of Miller’s job was to develop sources in the local Russian-speaking community. Things quickly moved from the professional to the personal.
According to reports in the L.A. Tim es, their first rendezvous, in May 1984, was at a beach in Malibu. They met again, soon afterward, at a park in Westwood—and this time had sex, in Miller’s car, which was parked next to a Little League baseball field. Miller and Ogorodnikov continued to sleep together thereafter, often at Miller’s home away from his wife and children.
In August 1984, Ogorodnikov made her pitch, telling Miller that she worked for the Soviet government, and that it would pay him for classified FBI documents he could provide, given his position on the Soviet counterintelligence squad. Miller asked for $50,000 in gold and $15,000 in cash, put in three separate safety-deposit boxes in different banks as payment, according to the L.A. Times.
The Soviets wanted proof that Miller could deliver. So later that month, Miller and Ogorodnikov drove north, to San Francisco, where her contacts at the consulate were based. It was a wild ride up. Ogorodnikov brought a container of cognac and margarita mix, taking slugs on the drive, and plied Miller—who never drank—with the cocktail. By the time they arrived in the Bay Area, both Ogorodnikov and Miller later said in court, they were well lubricated.
Miller deposited himself at a restaurant near the consulate, while Ogorodnikov walked inside. Before they separated, prosecutors later said, Miller gave her his FBI credentials, to prove his identity to the Soviets, and a copy of a classified FBI counterintelligence reporting manual, to prove his access to documents. After meeting nearby, Ogorodnikov and Miller drove to a motel out in the East Bay to continue their boozy rendezvous.
The trip set off, for the Bureau, the counterintelligence equivalent of a five-alarm fire. Miller’s bosses in Los Angeles and FBI officials in San Francisco had not been aware of Miller and Ogorodnikov’s dalliance—let alone his potential recruitment—but the San Francisco FBI officials quickly pieced the picture together. “Everything in the Soviet consulate was bugged,” recalls the second former FBI agent. “You couldn’t go into the bathroom there without us knowing about it. We immediately opened an investigation.”
FBI agents swarmed onto the case. Separate teams from San Francisco and Washington, D.C., headed down to Los Angeles to work with agents there. Taps went up on the Ogorodnikovs’ house phone and Miller’s phones. Bugs were surreptitiously placed in Miller’s car, according to media reports at the time.
Yet Ogorodnikov and Miller’s involvement deepened. After their trip to the Bay Area, Ogorodnikov, at the direction of KGB handler Grishin, started coaxing Miller to agree to meet with Soviet officials overseas—preferably a city in a neutral location, like Vienna, or better yet, one in the Eastern Bloc, like Warsaw, to deliver more documents. Ogorodnikov even took the unkempt Miller shopping for more dapper clothes, including a $675 Burberry trench coat and Italian dress shoes, the L.A. Times reported.
He never made the journey. In late September, Miller spotted the FBI surveillance that had been placed on him. Now ensnared, he went to his superiors and claimed that he was in fact acting as a double agent—an explanation that was wholly unconvincing to his FBI colleagues. In early October, Miller was arrested at his home in San Diego County. He broke down and confessed, at length and in detail, to his betrayal—but walked back his story days later, returning to his “secret double agent” alibi.
FBI agents also abruptly arrested Svetlana and Nikolay Ogorodnikov at their Hollywood apartment. “At one point,” recalls the first former FBI counterintelligence agent, hours into her post-arrest interview at the FBI’s Los Angeles offices, “Svetlana asked, ‘Are there two FBIs?’ And I said, ‘What do you mean?’ And she said, ‘Well, you guys are very serious,’” in contrast with Miller.
The FBI agent told Ogorodnikov that they were serious indeed.
***
Both Ogorodnikovs pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage midway through a June 1985 trial; prosecutors said Nikolay helped to support Svetlana’s scheme to ensnare Miller. Grishin, Svetlana’s KGB handler—who was named an unindicted co-conspirator—quietly left the country, shielded by diplomatic immunity. (Svetlana later recanted her confession, but never formally challenged her conviction.)
Miller, however, fought on. His first prosecution, which ended in November 1985, concluded in a mistrial, devastating the FBI. In 1986, at his second trial, he was convicted and given two consecutive life terms, plus an extra 50 years. But the conviction was later reversed on appeal; a higher court ruled that his polygraphs, which prosecutors drew on, were inadmissible as evidence.
Much had changed by 1990, when the third trial was set to commence. The judge who had overseen the first two trials had decided to recuse himself. The original prosecutors had also moved on from the U.S. attorney’s office. (One was later chosen to lead the Drug Enforcement Agency and tapped his former co-prosecutor as his deputy.) The Soviet Union was wobbling toward collapse. The Cold War was essentially over. But the prosecution of a serious episode of Cold War espionage was not.
Schiff, then a Los Angeles-based assistant U.S. attorney in his early 30s, was chosen by his superiors to lead the prosecution for the third trial. Libby accepted his request to join in prosecuting the case. It would be the future House Intelligence Committee chairman’s “first introduction to Russian tradecraft,” Schiff recalls.
Schiff had never found Miller’s double-agent story convincing. “It may be that Miller entered into this relationship initially feeling that he knew exactly what Svetlana was doing and why she was doing it. But he was happy to exploit the situation, and only later, as he became entangled with her, was willing to provide classified information [to her],” the congressman says now. Miller might have come across “in a clownish way,” Schiff argues, but was “really quite manipulative.”
This time, Miller had waived his right to a jury trial, hoping the new judge overseeing the case, who was known for his pro-defense views, might impose less jail time, or perhaps even acquit him entirely. Schiff and Libby, meanwhile, sought to ensure a life sentence for Miller, given what they perceived as the seriousness of his crimes.
The case was a “mammoth undertaking,” recalls Schiff, and “certainly the most important one for the FBI at the time.” During preparations for the trial, he says, he came in contact with “dozens and dozens” of FBI agents who had investigated Miller or worked alongside him, as part of what became, in essence, a crash course for Schiff in the Bureau’s counterintelligence mission and Russian espionage more broadly.
The FBI provided Schiff with a primitive portable phone (“which looked like . . . the nuclear football”), and the young prosecutor was in constant contact with his Bureau counterparts. “They would joke with me that they could tell when I got home at night,” recalls Schiff. “We would work together in the office, then I would be on the phone with them, driving home, with that portable. And then there would be a respite before I would call again after dinner.”
The trial commenced in the summer of 1990, less than a year after the Berlin Wall had fallen. Both Schiff and Libby recall the importance the Bureau attached to securing a conviction, and the attention and resources the case received from the FBI. Even though the evidence against Miller was strong, the prosecution presented some unusual challenges. “FBI agents are trained to detect when they’re being surveilled,” Schiff says. “Miller figured that he was under investigation, and before he could be arrested, he went to his supervisor and laid out what would be his defense.”
In Schiff’s closing argument, recounted in Sleeping With The FBI , he painted a damning portrait of Miller, enumerating the disgraced FBI agent’s compromise step-by-step. Whatever his initial motivations, Schiff said, in the end, Miller—scorned, resentful, sexually “infatuated” with Ogorodnikov—“betrayed his job, his family and the entire community that placed its trust in his hands” by passing classified documents to the Soviets. “This is a case of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order,” he said during this statement, according to the Los Angeles Times .
The judge agreed, in part. Although Miller was found guilty of espionage, the new sentence—20 years—was far less punitive than at the second jury trial, or what Schiff and Libby had hoped. “We fought against it,” Libby recalls. “I did not think it was fair at the time, and I still don’t think it was fair, given what Miller had done.” Still, Miller’s fate was secured. He was now the first FBI agent in U.S. history convicted of espionage.
***
Miller served a total of nine years and was released in 1994. According to Stanley I. Greenberg , one of Miller’s former lawyers, Miller trained to become a computer technician while in prison, moved back to Utah and remarried. He died about three or four years ago, Greenberg told me.
Svetlana Ogorodnikov was also released from prison in 1994. She later moved to Mexico and married a convicted drug trafficker she had met in prison, re-entered the United States illegally in 1999, and was later a witness in a bizarre torture and murder case, according to the Associated Press. Nikolay Ogorodnikov was released from prison in 1990.
Schiff has thought back to the Miller case over the past two and a half years. As in the 1980s in Los Angeles, during the 2016 presidential campaign the Russian government made a clear attempt to gain leverage over key figures, Schiff says—this time in Donald Trump’s orbit. “Just like in the 1980s with Miller, the Russians looked for people with access to information, and they used a variety of different modalities to entangle them,” Schiff says. “They’ll dangle financial opportunities; they’ll use other ways to exact information. … It does feel like an echo of the past.”
The offer by Russia-connected figures of politically damaging information about the Hillary Clinton campaign proffered to Donald Trump Jr.; former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s gambit to feed the Russian oligarch and Vladimir Putin confidant Oleg Deripaska private updates about the Trump campaign; the discussions, led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and with the candidate’s knowledge, about the construction of a Trump Tower in Moscow, which continued well into the 2016 campaign: These were evidence, Schiff says, of the Russian government’s latent capacity for leverage over key figures in the Trump orbit, including the president himself.
While some Trump associates might not have initially realized the road they were embarking on in engaging with Russian agents, to Schiff, their pleas of ignorance—like Miller’s—ultimately ring false. For example, Manafort, who spent years representing pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine, “had enough experience working with Russian interests to understand how they do business,” Schiff says. Manafort’s longtime business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who supported Manafort’s activities in Kiev and whom the FBI says has longstanding ties to Russian intelligence, “had his own experience to draw on,” Schiff continues. “So, I don’t think this was, in either circumstance, the case of a naïve person who was somehow duped.” (As part of the Mueller investigation, Manafort was convicted on bank fraud and tax fraud charges, and later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his lobbying work in Ukraine. Kilimnik, who is believed to be in Moscow, was also indicted by the special counsel’s office on obstruction of justice charges related to his work with Manafort.)
But Schiff argues that an action need not be criminally prosecutable—as in Miller’s case—to represent a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and therefore be worth investigation. This is why he has demanded that his committee receive all the documents tied to the underlying Trump-Russia counterintelligence probe. The broader matter, he says, is “whether Americans were acting as witting or unwitting agents of a foreign power.”
For Richard Miller, avarice and moral turpitude cracked the door ajar for future compromise. It was pried open by a Russian intelligence agent, who, sensing an easy mark, proceeded to ensnare Miller, until that compromise shaded into outright conspiracy.
The Mueller investigation could not establish that the Trump campaign took that momentous second step. But compromise takes place in a continuum. The counterintelligence world, unlike that of criminal justice, rarely traffics in absolutes. This will likely be, for Schiff, the paramount lesson of the Miller case, as the investigation of the Trump-Russia affair moves from the well-ordered confines of the prosecutor’s office and into what longtime former CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton called the wilderness of mirrors."
2020 election: Gillibrand zeros in on abortion in wake of new state laws,www.politico.com,ELENA SCHNEIDER,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/kirsten-gillibrand-abortion-laws-2020-1345012,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
IOWA FALLS, Iowa — When a voter urged Kirsten Gillibrand to take on abortion rights as her “personal fight,” the New York Democrat made it clear she needs no invitation.
A string of rigid anti-abortion laws championed by Republican state lawmakers across the country has created an opening in the presidential campaign for Gillibrand, who’s struggled to break out in the 23-candidate Democratic field. She’s seized on the national coverage of the new laws, traveling to Georgia’s Statehouse days after that state's Republican governor signed one and rolling out Facebook ads that call her a “champion” for American women “in the face of an onslaught of Republican attacks on reproductive rights.” Story Continued Below
Gillibrand took that pitch to Iowa this weekend, telling two dozen voters at one stop in a coffee shop that “a women should be able to decide when she’s having children, how many children she’s having and under what circumstances she’s having” them.
“This is a human right,” Gillibrand said, to a round of applause from a crowd mostly of female attendees.
But four months into her presidential run, Gillibrand is still struggling to carve out support. She’s averaging less than 1 percent support in national polling, and she landed in the bottom half of the field in first-quarter fundraising. Gillibrand also hasn’t yet crossed the 65,000-donor threshold set by the Democratic National Committee as one of two criteria to reach the debate stage in June.

“I do know that I’m a voice for all women in this country, and that my leadership on these issues matter,” Gillibrand said after a roundtable with women’s health care providers in West Des Moines. “Maybe more supporters will notice that, and that I’ve been working on it for the last decade.”
Gillibrand, who has already qualified for the first two DNC debates through polling, said she’s “very optimistic” about hitting the 65,000-donor criterion as well because her campaign “had a really good response over the last few weeks now that we’ve been telling people we do need their help,” she said.
Gillibrand has previously complained that the DNC’s criteria are “random and inaccurate.""""But it’s their choice,” she had added.
Gillibrand predicted this “all-out assault by the Republican Party” on abortion would change voters’ calculus for whom they might support for the Democratic nomination, adding that she’s led ""the debate, not just on reproductive freedom, but on whether we value women.”
Gillibrand put women at the center of her presidential campaign from the outset, calling herself a “young mom” during her presidential launch who would “fight for other people’s kids as hard as I would fight for my own.” She was the first presidential candidate to commit to a litmus test for judicial nominees by pledging to only nominate judges who consider Roe v. Wade as settled legal precedent. This weekend, Gillibrand rolled out a major policy plank: a “Family Bill of Rights,” a slate of proposals that focus on maternal health care, national family paid leave and universal prekindergarten.
Gillibrand has “actually put it all into a plan, so she might gain more traction from that,” said state Sen. Amanda Ragan, who attended the senator’s meet-and-greet in Mason City on Saturday afternoon.
The New York senator is also getting involved in local-level political fights on the issue: Last month, Gillibrand endorsed Marie Newman, a Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois who is challenging incumbent Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the few anti-abortion Democrats left in Congress. That puts Gillibrand at odds with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is supporting Lipinski. "

Ernst doesn’t see a trade deal happening this summer,www.politico.com,AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/joni-ernst-china-trade-deal-iowa-1345015,"Although Sen. Joni Ernst would love to see a trade deal with China this summer, she doesn’t see it happening just yet, she said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“This is a really difficult situation that the farmers are in,” the Iowa Republican told host Dana Bash. “And just to remind the viewers, 1 in 5 jobs in Iowa is tied directly to trade, most of that around the farming sector, our agricultural sector. So it is very tense times, but as we have heard from our farmers, they do want us to find a path forward with China.”
Story Continued Below
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that it would provide $16 billion to farmers who have been affected by retaliatory tariffs, with the majority of that funding going directly to farmers producing a wide range of crops and livestock.
“The tariffs are hurtful right now, but the president will continue negotiating,” Ernst said. “We hope that we can get a deal soon but, to put it best — I think it came from a farmer in Iowa after one of our farmer roundtables — he stood up and said, ‘I get why the president is doing this. What I don’t get is why we didn’t have a president that would stand up for us before this.’”
When asked if there’s a point at which Ernst will say enough is enough and call for Trump to remove the tariffs on China, Ernst added: “At what point do you say national security, the interests of our country, that’s enough? I think that our trade rep, the president, they understand those implications. They know better where we are with those negotiations. The president has asked those farmers to hang on just a little bit longer.”
“It is tenuous,” Ernst said. “It is hurting in the Midwest. It’s hurting all over the country with the tariffs. But at the same time, we do have to get China to the table. We have to stop them from stealing intellectual property. We have to stop them from forced technology transfers. All of that is detrimental not only to our economy, but to our national security.
“The president has called our farmers patriots. It doesn’t pay the bills, but we will see in the upcoming months how long we can sustain.”"
"Sanders: Trump, Kim Jong-Un ‘agree in their assessment of Biden",www.politico.com,AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/sanders-trump-kim-jong-un-biden-1345014,"President Donald Trump isn’t necessarily “siding with” North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, but the two are in agreement on former Vice President Joe Biden, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Chuck Todd on Sunday morning.
Late Saturday, Trump downplayed recent North Korean missile tests in a tweet , and also referred to Kim’s criticism of Biden, who recently announced his 2020 presidential bid.
Story Continued Below
“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump wrote. “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?” (The tweet was deleted and then reposted. Trump had misspelled Biden’s name in the first version.)
On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” host Todd referenced Trump’s tweet, and asked Sanders whether Americans should be “concerned that the president of the United States is essentially siding with a murderous authoritarian dictator over a former vice president of the United States.”
“Chuck, the president’s not siding with that,” Sanders said. “But I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden.”
“The president doesn’t need somebody else to give him an assessment of Joe Biden,” she added. “He’s given his own assessment a number of times. I think you’ve seen it. I’m sure you’ve covered it on your program. The president watched him and his administration with President [Barack] Obama fail for eight years. He’s come in in two and a half, he’s cleaned up a lot of the messes that were left behind.”
Sanders went on to say that Trump shouldn’t have to “deal with” North Korea at all, but that the previous administration failed on North Korea, Iran and trade and now it’s up to Trump to be “tough with these countries.”
“I think if anybody needs help with an assessment, it’s Joe Biden and whether or not he should be trying to get an upgrade when he failed to do the job in the No. 2 slot.”
Biden‘s campaign mocked the Trump tweet. ""I would say the tweet speaks for itself, but it’s so unhinged and erratic that I’m not sure anyone could even say that with a straight face,” a campaign official said Sunday.
Sanders is in Tokyo with Trump for the first official state visit since Emperor Naruhito assumed the throne. Trump will also meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
On Wednesday, Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said of remarks about North Korea made by Biden: “What he uttered is just sophism of an imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being, let alone a politician.” KCNA also called him “a fool of low IQ” and mocked Biden for thinking he is a popular candidate. ″This is enough to make a cat laugh,” the report said."

Get out of your comfort zone and find an adventure! Keeping that tradition alive, this year I’ll be in Greece indulging the history buff in me by exploring ancient ruins in Athens and Delphi. I love solo trips because you can meet some incredible people that expand your world outlook.”
How did you get your start in journalism? “It starts where all good stories start: an Applebee’s bar. I was serving at the restaurant to put myself through college and my manager’s sister, Tami Bloom, happened to be a news producer. She took a chance by giving a young eager kid from Jersey a PA job at Al Jazeera. The job came with tremendous opportunity. I worked with some of my news heroes, like John Seigenthaler, and met some of my greatest mentors, like Raelyn Johnson.”
What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading now or finished? And why? “I just finished reading Reza Aslan’s ‘God: A Human History.’ I find theology fascinating and loved this book because it tracks the development of religion through an anthropological lens.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “We don’t talk enough about the epidemic of youth homelessness in the LGBT community. One in eight Americans identify as LGBT but 40% of youth living on the streets or in shelters are LGBT. That number is frightening.”
How is the Trump presidency going? “I’ll let the American public decide how it’s going in 2020. But as a news producer, I know I’m taking less vacation time than ever and my phone has become an appendage.”
What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “Every summer I plant a garden that is booked themed. This year’s theme is The Odyssey and a palm tree is playing the role of Odysseus!”"

LAURA BARRÓN-LÓPEZ and MELANIE ZANONA : “‘Ghosted’: GOP abandons female House hopeful despite talk of electing women”: “The Republican Party has ramped up its efforts to recruit female candidates for the 2020 election, following the brutal midterm that decimated the ranks of GOP women. But [former candidate Leigh] Brown’s experience [in North Carolina] highlights an enduring challenge for the party: translating widespread concern about the dearth of women in the House Republican Conference into significant campaign support and, ultimately, victories by female candidates.” POLITICO
2020 WATCH -- ELENA SCHNEIDER in IOWA FALLS, IOWA: “Gillibrand zeros in on abortion in wake of new state laws”
Good Sunday morning. Blake Hounshell and Daniel Lippman here, manning the helm while Jake and Anna take a break. They’ll be back tomorrow.
ARTHUR VANDENBERG, a Michigan Republican who worked with Democratic President Harry Truman at the dawn of the Cold War, famously called for stopping “politics at the water’s edge.” Over the years, this remark has somehow morphed into an adage about how American politicians do behave, rather than an aspiration for how they should behave. Case in point: President DONALD TRUMP taking extraordinary swipes from Tokyo at JOE BIDEN, his putative 2020 rival, and Democrats more broadly:
-- @realDonaldTrump: “North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?”
-- @realDonaldTrump: “Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo. Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed -- Death Wish!”
-- ABC NEWS’ MERIDITH MCGRAW: “A Biden campaign aide responded after the tweet, saying, ‘I would say the tweet speaks for itself, but it’s so unhinged and erratic that I’m not sure anyone could even say that with a straight face.’ The same aide said of the president’s tweet correcting the spelling of Biden’s name: ‘The spelling error was not the main problem with the first one.’” ABC News
-- CHUCK TODD asked SARAH SANDERS about Trump’s Biden tweet on NBC NEWS’ “MEET THE PRESS” in her first appearance on the show -- TODD: “Can you explain why Americans should not be concerned that the president of United States is essentially siding with a murderous authoritarian dictator over a former vice president in the United States?”
SANDERS: “Chuck, the president’s not siding with that. But I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden. Again, the president’s focus in this process is the relationship he has and making sure we continue on the path towards denuclearization.”
-- DANA BASH spoke to SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IOWA) on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: “Let’s start with the president’s tweet. He’s in Japan, as I mentioned, as we speak, right across the sea, well within the striking range of any missile. And yet the president says North Korea test-firing missiles earlier this month did not disturb him. Do you find those missiles disturbing?”
ERNST: “I find them very disturbing and certainly wouldn’t trust Kim Jong-un. So, I think we need to keep our eyes on North Korea. I understand the president wants to maintain a relationship with North Korea, so that we can work with them. However, those strikes are disturbing.”
BASH: “And the fact that the president says they’re not while in the region, does it disturb you that that is the president’s action or maybe reaction?” ERNST: “Certainly. I think Japan does have reason to be concerned. And I am concerned as well. … So, understanding the president has a job to do in negotiating, but we do need to push back on North Korea and make sure that they are following U.N. guidelines.”
-- “Ernst doesn’t see a trade deal happening this summer,” by Aubree Eliza Weaver
-- WAPO’S SIMON DENYER and ASHLEY PARKER in TOKYO: “Before he left the United States, Japanese diplomats expressed indifference to the prospect of Trump unleashing a string of freewheeling tweets while abroad, saying that domestic politics is the president’s business. But in weighing on North Korea, as well as a Democratic political rival, in a single tweet, Trump yet again undermined the Japanese’s careful preparations, in which they hoped to flatter Trump into affirming the important relationship between Japan and the United States.” WaPo
THE PRESIDENT’S WEEK AHEAD -- MONDAY and TUESDAY: President Trump is traveling on his Japan trip. WEDNESDAY: Trump has lunch with Vice President Mike Pence. He also will meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. THURSDAY: Trump will speak at the U.S. Air Force Academy graduation ceremony. FRIDAY: Trump and First Lady Melania Trump host a reception to honor Gold Star families.
SUMO UPDATE … AP/MOBARA, JAPAN: “Trump awards trophy at marquee sumo event in Tokyo”: “The president, first lady Melania Trump, Abe and his wife, Akie, joined an estimated 11,500 fans who packed Ryogoku Kokugikan Stadium to watch oversize, muscular men battling in loincloths. … Shoes aren’t permitted in the sumo ring, but Trump wore dark-colored slippers.”
-- THE SCENE -- per pooler Katie Rogers: “Both couples ended up seated in chairs - not on the customary mats -- a few yards from the sumo ring. During the series of matches, POTUS, wearing a pink tie, leaned over several times to whisper to FLOTUS, who was wearing a red dress. He also turned at different points to PM Abe and other officials who appeared to be explaining what was happening. But largely, POTUS did not clap or react much when the wrestlers faced him, threw ceremonial salt or swayed from side to side. ...
“Behind him were several aides including Stephen Miller, Dan Scavino, and Mick Mulvaney. … A second, very large silver cup was brought out to a very large round of applause. This one is called the Prime Minister’s Cup. PM Abe awarded the huge cup to Asanoyama. As Abe struggled with the weight of the cup, the wrestler stepped forward to take it from him. The crowd laughed. Then the third cup, the President’s Cup, was unveiled to oohs and ahhs. POTUS then approached the ring to applause.
“He bowed slightly, the moved into the center of the ring. He read from a scroll, a ‘Certificate of commemoration Asanoyama.’ ‘In honor of your outstanding achievement as sumo grand champion I hereby award you the President’s Cup,’ POTUS said, adding the date under the Japanese era he called ‘Reiwa.’ (The crowd was excited to hear him say this word, which describes the era under the new emperor.)”
-- @johnrobertsFox: “.@realDonaldTrump phoned me this morning in Tokyo. He says while he and PM Abe will talk trade today and tomorrow, POTUS will wait until after the July elections in the House of Councillors (Japanese equivalent of the Senate) before really pushing for a deal.”

SUNDAY BEST -- MARGARET BRENNAN spoke to BETO O’ROURKE on CBS NEWS’ “FACE THE NATION” -- BRENNAN: “Do you think President Trump was right to send these fifteen hundred troops to the Middle East to counter the Iran threat?” O’ROURKE: “No. President Trump is escalating tensions, is provoking yet another war in the Middle East where we find ourselves already engaged in war in so many countries -- in Iraq in Syria in Yemen, not too far from there in Libya and in Afghanistan. So, we don’t need another war. We need to find a way to work with allies and partners and in some cases with our enemies.” The clip
-- MARTHA RADDATZ talked to MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG on ABC NEWS’ “THIS WEEK” -- RADDATZ: “We found this interview you did when you were only 18 years old in your local paper, when you talked in detail about wanting to go into national politics. ‘I think I could pull it off, it’s a tremendous challenge, a kind of sexy challenge but I want to give it a try.’ Seems like you knew you were going to do this your whole life.”
BUTTIGIEG: “I was always interested in public service. What I would not have guessed at the age of 18 was how much I would find purpose and meaning in local work. For a while, thought I was going to be a journalist, for a while thought I was going to be a scholar, I always felt drawn in some way to public service.” RADDATZ: “‘A sexy challenge.’ Has it been a sexy challenge?”
BUTTIGIEG: “Well, in a way if you’re a curious person, there’s nothing like it. That challenge is about as an engaging thing I could think to do with my life. And while this may not be a career for me, it’s certainly something that has been extremely exciting for as long as I’ve been involved in it, and where, most importantly, I think I can make myself useful. I mean, it’s not like [I] thought that, at the age of, 37, as a mayor, I would be seeking the American presidency.”
-- CHRIS WALLACE spoke to SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) on “FOX NEWS SUNDAY” -- on Trump working with Congress while they’re investigating him: “From President Trump’s point of view, I disagree with the idea that you can’t work with them while they’re doing things like this, you have to work with them. You can’t control, Mr. President what the Democrats do, but you can control what you do.”
-- Graham on Trump and North Korea: “I’ll give Trump the space he needs to deal with Kim but what I’ll remind the President that you have to deliver on this. This is one of the signature issues of your administration.”
HECKUVA JOB -- NYT’s NICOLE PERLROTH and SCOTT SHANE: “In Baltimore and Beyond, a Stolen N.S.A. Tool Wreaks Havoc”: “For nearly three weeks, Baltimore has struggled with a cyberattack by digital extortionists that has frozen thousands of computers, shut down email and disrupted real estate sales, water bills, health alerts and many other services.
“But here is what frustrated city employees and residents do not know: A key component of the malware that cybercriminals used in the attack was developed at taxpayer expense a short drive down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway at the National Security Agency, according to security experts briefed on the case.” NYT
THE TRUMP-PELOSI DYNAMIC -- “Trump’s allies insist he is winning in feud with Pelosi. Her backers say she showed up the president,” by WaPo’s Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey: “Pelosi’s allies said her taunting of Trump now is intentional, designed to get under his skin and elicit an angry reaction, according to officials close to her who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. …
“When a Democrat compared Trump to a fifth-grader, Pelosi responded that such a remark was an insult to fifth-graders, according to an individual who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the conversation. ‘Don’t say that. Children are wonderful!’ said the mother of five and grandmother of nine.” WaPo
NOTABLE -- “U.S. Ambassador Urges Jews in Germany to Wear Kippot and Not Conceal Identity,” by Jerusalem Post’s Benjamin Weinthal: “The U.S. government’s most high-profile ambassador in Europe, Richard Grenell, said Jews in Germany should not conceal their religious identity and urged them to wear kippot in defiance of a Sunday statement from Germany's commissioner to combat antisemitism to avoid kippot in public. Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, tweeted: ‘The opposite is true. Wear your kippa. Wear your friend’s kippa. Borrow a kippa and wear it for our Jewish neighbors. Educate people that we are a diverse society.’” Jerusalem Post
WHAT JARED IS READING -- “Qatar to attend the Bahrain conference,” by Barak Ravid in Axios: “Qatar informed the White House it will attend the conference in Bahrain on June 25 that will launch the economic part of the Trump administration’s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, according to U.S. officials. … The fact that the Qataris will attend the conference shows the U.S. managed to get a green light from the Saudis. This is a major achievement for the White House peace team led by Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is trying to get as many Arab countries to attend the conference, regardless of the Palestinians’ decision to boycott.” Axios
SO THEY DIDN’T HOIST UP THE SNOOP JOHN B? -- “Trump’s Targeting of Intelligence Agencies Gains a Harder Edge,” by NYT’s Michael S. Schmidt and Julian E. Barnes: “[I]n July ... the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that the administration was considering revoking the clearances of Mr. Comey, John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama; Michael V. Hayden, who was a C.I.A. director under President George W. Bush; and others. The White House said a month later that the president was ordering the revocation of Mr. Brennan’s clearance. But the White House never followed through with the complex bureaucratic work it would have taken to strip the clearance, according to a person familiar with the process.” NYT

CLIP AND SAVE -- “A Senator Wants to Have a Greater Impact. So He’s Leaving the Senate,” by NYT’s Carl Hulse: “In assessing his political future, [Sen.

Instead, he said, he intends to redouble his efforts in those areas in hopes of setting the stage for big changes should Democrats prevail next year, even though he won’t be back in the Senate himself. …
“Mr. Udall’s decision to not run again, discussed in an interview on Wednesday, showed how the gridlock infecting Congress and the wide political divisions in the country can frustrate even the most experienced lawmakers and make them rethink their careers. It also illustrates how overwhelming and time-consuming fund-raising for multimillion-dollar races can be, leaving lawmakers little opportunity for the work they are supposed to be doing.” NYT

Buttigieg: Trump’s fake injury ‘an assault on the honor of this country’ - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Bianca Quilantan,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/buttigieg-trumps-fake-injury-1345025,"Calling it “an assault on the honor of this country,” Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Sunday said “there is no question” that Donald Trump faked an injury to avoid serving in the Vietnam War.
“There is no question, I think, to any reasonable observer that the president found a way to falsify a disabled status, taking advantage of his privileged status in order to avoid serving,” the mayor of South Bend, Ind., told ABC’s Martha Raddatz on “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”
Story Continued Below
“You have somebody who thinks it's all right to let somebody go in his place into a deadly war and is willing to pretend to be disabled in order to do it,” he said. “That is an assault on the honor of this country.”
Buttigieg, who served as a Navy intelligence officer in Afghanistan, first accused Trump of using his “privileged status to fake a disability” on Thursday in an hourlong interview with The Washington Post.
Trump was exempted from military service five times at the height of the Vietnam War. He received four draft deferments for his time in college and one medical deferment for having bone spurs. In testimony before Congress, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen said of the medical deferment: “Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none.“
Buttigieg also criticized the Trump administration's decision to deploy more than 1,500 military personnel in an effort to deter Iran. He told Raddatz ""escalation is the last thing we need in the Middle East right now.""
Referring to his own military experience, Buttigieg slammed Trump’s consideration of granting pardons to some service members who have either been accused or convicted of war crimes. One of those who has been considered for a pardon is former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who stands accused of murdering an ISIS prisoner and indiscriminately shooting at civilians.
""The idea that being sent to war turns you into a murderer is exactly the kind of thing that those of us who have served have been trying to beat back for more than a generation,"" Buttigieg said.
""For a president, especially a president who never served, to say he's going to come in and overrule that system of military justice undermines the very foundations, legal and moral, of this country,"" he said."

O’Rourke feels 'really good' about 2020 campaign - POLITICO,www.politico.com,AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/beto-orourke-2020-campaign-1345020,"Despite recent headlines saying “Beto O’Rourke Blew It” and “The Beto Balloon Bursts,” the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said he feels “really good about the way we’re campaigning.”
“I’m going to people where they are in their communities,” O’Rourke said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday morning. “No me importa. I do not care how red or blue, rural or urban; I’m showing up to listen to them, and what they’re telling me is they want this country to come together around our shared challenges. So I’m listening to them more than I am to the headlines.”
Story Continued Below
O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman, has come under fire for a recent Vanity Fair cover story in which he was quoted as saying: “I want to be in it. Man, I’m just born to be in it.” While he has since said he meant he felt he was born to be a public servant, the article was perceived by many as reflecting a sense of entitlement that he was born to be president.
“Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan asked O’Rourke whether he thinks he can escape the backlash from that story and move past voters’ early impressions of him.
“The only way that I’m going to have any chance is to go everywhere, meet with everyone, leave no one behind and take no one for granted,” he said. “So that’s what I’m focused on.”
“Listen, there are going to be highs and lows in this campaign,” he added. “There have been in every campaign that I have ever run. But if we stay focused on the people — the very reason that we’re doing this in the first place — bringing them in and allowing them to contribute to the solutions to the challenges that we face, I don’t think there’s anything that can stop us.”
O’Rourke said that the country needs “to be able to bring in a new energy,” responding to Brennan’s suggestion that his campaign relies heavily on him being a younger candidate, especially when going up against fellow Democrats Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, who are in their 70s.
“We need to be able to bring in new voters,” he said. “We need to make sure that this democracy, so badly damaged, works for everyone. All I’m saying is that the way that I campaign — this relentless pursuit of people wherever they are, learning their stories, incorporating what’s most important to them in their lives into this campaign and into the service that I want to perform for this country — is what we need at this very divided moment. So that’s the way I offer my service going forward.”"

Graham isn’t worried about letting Barr declassify intelligence information - POLITICO,www.politico.com,AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/classified-information-bill-barr-lindsey-graham-1345018,"Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said Sunday he doesn’t see any threat to national security from President Donald Trump’s decision to allow Attorney General William Barr to declassify information from the Russia investigation.
“We’re not compromising national security here,” the South Carolina Republican said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We’re trying to create a system to make sure this never happens again.”
Story Continued Below
Last week, the White House announced: “The Attorney General has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation, in accordance with the long-established standards for handling classified information. Today’s action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the actions that were taken, during the last Presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions.”
Graham said that there are still questions that need answering, and giving Barr this power could help shed light on Russian influence during the 2016 presidential election.
“Did they have a lawful reason to surveil President Trump’s campaign? Did they lie to the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance] court,” Graham asked. “Every American should want to find that out.”
Critics worry that Trump’s move sets a dangerous precedent that could undermine the core missions of the government‘s intelligence and investigative agencies — and thrust them into political disagreements. Graham did not agree.
“The people who are worried about this are worried about being exposed for taking the law in their own hands,” he said.

"Illegal immigration remains biggest problem at border, Ron Johnson says - POLITICO",www.politico.com,AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/immigration-border-health-flu-ron-johnson-1345021,"Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson said Sunday he is worried about a recent flu outbreak and deaths at the southern border due to overcrowding but maintained that the larger issue continues to be illegal immigration.
“We’re all concerned,” the Wisconsin Republican said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “They had an outbreak of flu. The believe it might have been H1N1 — highly dangerous. The processing centers are back open, but they are grossly overcrowded because of the unbelievable situation on the border, the out-of-control nature of it.
“Just the last three weeks, on average, about 23,000 women, children and men are coming over across the border illegally as family units or as unaccompanied children — 22 to 23,000 a week,” Johnson said
“We’re almost eight months into this fiscal year and we’re up about 400,000 in total. If it continues at this pace, in one year, we’ll have about 800,000 unaccompanied children, people who cross the border illegally as a family unit — 800,000. So this is overwhelming our system, and we have to stop it. We have to change our laws to stop rewarding and incentivizing people who cross our border illegally.”
Host Margaret Brennan noted that Congress left last week for recess without allocating money to the border crisis and that Republicans agreed to strip funding from the disaster relief bill.
“Well, first of all, I have been advocating to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security and HHS get the $4.5 billion emergency spending request,"" Johnson said. ""They need that money. They need it desperately. So hopefully when we get back in session after the Memorial Day holiday, that funding will be quickly appropriated so that those individuals that are doing such a — they’re doing the Lord’s work down there.
""But again, we’re allowing this to happen,"" he added. ""It’s our broken laws that are sustaining this wicked business model.”"
California congressman defends war crimes suspect - POLITICO,www.politico.com,BIANCA QUILANTAN,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/california-congressman-defends-war-crimes-suspect-1345027,"Rep. Duncan Hunter, an advocate for pardoning a Navy SEAL who has been charged with war crimes, said he is guilty of doing one of the things Eddie Gallagher is accused of during his own time in the Marines.
“Eddie did one bad thing that I’m guilty of too: Taking a picture of the body and saying something stupid,” the California Republican said at a border-issues forum in Ramona, Calif., according to the Times of San Diego .
Story Continued Below
Gallagher, a special operations chief, faces homicide charges after being accused of committing crimes in Iraq in 2017; he is set to stand trial in June. In one case, he texted a picture of a dead 15-year-old ISIS fighter to another SEAL writing, “Good story behind this, got him with my hunting knife.”
Hunter told the forum he had taken pictures “just like that"" when he was overseas but didn’t share them.
“But a lot of my peers … have done the exact same thing,” he added.
Hunter’s comment comes after a New York Times report that said President Donald Trump may be preparing to pardon several service members — including those accused or convicted of murder or attempted murder — on or around Memorial Day. The Trump administration made expedited requests for pardon paperwork — including one for Gallagher, The New York Times reported.
Hunter said he “absolutely” would love to see Trump pardon Gallagher, the San Diego publication reported. In a USA Today column , Quote: : ""Gallagher cannot expect to receive even a semblance of a fair trial. A pardon by Trump is fully warranted.""
Hunter, who was first elected in 2008 to succeeded his father in Congress, is a retired Marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was reelected in November 2018 while being under indictment on charges of misusing campaign funds."
Trump meets Japan’s new emperor - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/26/donald-melania-trump-japan-emperor-1345028,"President Donald Trump on Monday said he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe talked about Iran amid rising tension between Tehran and Washington.
With Abe at his side during his Japan visit, Trump told reporters at Akasaka Palace in Tokyo that “nobody wants to see terrible things happen, especially me.” The U.S. president also said that “I do believe Iran would like to talk and if they’d like to talk, we’ll talk also,” adding that Abe has a “very good relationship with Iran.”
Japanese media has reported that Abe is considering a visit to Iran next month. The Kyodo News agency, citing unidentified government sources, said on Friday that Abe’s visit would be likely in mid-June. Earlier this month, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif visited Tokyo.
As bilateral talks opened, Trump said he and Abe “understand each other very well.”
Abe opened the event by telling Trump, “It was a tremendous honor for us to welcome you.”
With that and other flattery, Abe said the leaders would begin a summit to discuss North Korea and other “challenges of the international community.” Among other topics they were to discuss was the upcoming G-20 summit next month.
Trump said: “We are working on the imbalance of trade.” He added that the Japanese “are incredible people with a truly amazing prime minister who’s my friend.” And he also said he he expects “good things to come with North Korea” but acknowledged he could “be wrong“ about that.
Abe said he wanted a “very candid and productive discussion.”
The two spoke for about 17 minutes, with translators.
Trump, Abe and their respective teams were beginning their second lengthy day of meetings. They spent Sunday playing golf together, taking in a sumo match and having a couples dinner with their wives.
Earlier Monday, Trump and Japan’s Emperor Naruhito walked along a red carpet in the courtyard of the Imperial Palace after meeting.
Trump was the first world leader to meet Naruhito since he ascended to the throne on May 1.
The president was treated to a welcome ceremony full of pomp and pageantry.
Trump stood at attention alone atop a platform before he walked along a red-carpeted route to review troops. He also passed in front of a group of schoolchildren feverishly waving U.S. and Japanese flags.
Trump wore a red tie that matched the color of the carpet. He was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump. The two brought gifts for the new emperor.
The emperor presented the president with a traditional Japanese pottery and porcelain bowl. Trump gave the emperor with an American-made viola in a custom case handmade in West Virginia and a photo of U.S. composer Aaron Copland.
Melania Trump presented Empress Masako with a White House desk set featuring a fountain pen made from a red oak tree that stands on the grounds of Harvard University. The empress studied economics at Harvard.
The empress presented the first lady an ornamental box with a traditional Japanese design.
The foursome also exchanged photos. The Imperial Palace has a long-standing custom of the emperor and empress exchanging signed, framed photographs with their guests during state visits."

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print PARIS — Emmanuel Macron set out on Sunday to beat the far-right and win a popular mandate for his pro-EU platform during a European Parliament election.
He fell short on both counts.
According to early vote estimates, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) list is on course to win first place in the election, with roughly 24 percent of the vote versus around 22.5 percent for Macron's Renaissance list.
The National Rally was expected to be at the forefront of a nationalist-populist wave across Europe, in which far-right forces were projected to capture as much as one-third of seats in the European Parliament. Big gains were also expected for Matteo Salvini's far-right League in Italy.
But there were consolations for the French president's list. While Le Pen's group prevailed, it performed less well than it had in the 2014 European Parliament election and failed to capitalize on the anti-Macron Yellow Jacket movement, which plagued the president's second year in power with recurring street protests.
""The French people have clearly punished the president tonight, and taught him a lesson in humility"" — Jordan Bardella, lead candidate of the National Rally's list
None of that stopped the anti-EU party, which has rebranded itself since a 2017 presidential vote, from crowing about victory.
""The French people have clearly punished the president tonight, and taught him a lesson in humility,"" said Jordan Bardella, a 23-year-old Le Pen protégé who led the RN's list.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print This European election was not a contest with an overarching continental narrative, but a series of national and regional battles.
For the two main party groupings in the European Parliament (each losing seats and with less than a quarter of the vote), there will be relief that the results were not worse than they turned out. Here's POLITICO's guide to the biggest winners and losers:
Turnout Voter turnout rose dramatically, making the voting process the biggest winner, after 40 years of declining participation. Champagne corks will be popping in Brussels if national election authorities confirm Monday that the magic 50 percent turnout figure was reached (currently it is projected to hit 50.95 percent).
The main parties The center-right European People’s Party fell below 25 percent of the vote for the first time since 1989, and the Socialists are hovering at about 20 percent. That's their worst performance since European Parliament direct elections began in 1979.
The bright spots for the big parties came in Italy, where the Democratic Party pushed past the 5Star Movement to take second place and 19 seats. In Spain too, the Socialist party won a clear victory and grew to 18 seats. In Greece, the EPP-aligned New Democracy will win nine seats. By convincingly beating the far-left governing party Syriza, it has prompted Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to call a national election in June.
Salvini's crew Of the parties that grew, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini’s alliance is doing best — essentially doubling in size to 70-75 seats, but getting nowhere close to dominance in Parliament. His League colleagues will be lucky to lead the fourth-biggest group in Parliament. The liberal ALDE alliance also gained about 35 seats, thanks mostly to Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche movement, to hit 100-105 seats and take a clear third place.
Green wave The EU's ""Green wave"" is both real and geographically limited. Green parties finished second and third in countries including Germany, France, Finland and Luxembourg. Yet Green parties have won no seats in Southern and Eastern Europe. They won only two seats in Central Europe, from Austria, itself a decline on the 2014 Austrian result. Even so, a surge in support for the Greens in the U.K. means the group is likely to beat Salvini's alliance.
Euroskeptic march Euroskeptic parties had their best showing in Hungary where Viktor Orbán's ruling Fidesz party scored 53 percent, enough for 13 seats. Euroskeptics won 62 percent overall there. Fidesz will now need to decide whether to moderate and stay within the EPP, or to branch out and join a Euroskeptic party group. The outcome may affect the EPP’s bargaining power for top jobs like European Commission president. In Poland, Euroskeptics captured 53 percent of the vote. And across the Parliament, Euroskeptic parties look set to end the night with 235 seats.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print LONDON — The U.K.'s two main parties suffered major losses in the European Parliament election, as a polarized electorate swung behind the Brexit Party and the pro-Remain Liberal Democrats.
With ten of the U.K.'s 12 European electoral regions declared, the ruling Conservatives had lost 15 seats and taken just 9 percent of the popular vote, placing it fifth behind the Green Party.
But the opposition Labour Party also saw their vote crumble, losing eight seats and bleeding votes to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in pro-Leave areas, and to the Lib Dems in pro-Remain areas.
The Brexit Party, which was registered little more than three months ago, is the runaway winner, taking 28 seats so far, and leading in the popular vote with 32 percent. The Lib Dems, who support a second referendum and remaining in the EU, had been expected to make gains, but are set to exceed expectations. The party will finish in second place overall, having gained 14 seats and securing roughly 20 percent of the popular vote.
Coming days after the U.K.'s political crisis over Brexit finally forced the resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May, the results tell a story of a country still deeply divided along lines drawn in the referendum three years ago and promises to force the two traditional main parties to either extreme of the Brexit debate.
Score draw Thirty-five percent of the electorate registered a vote for parties with an uncompromising hard Brexit stance — Farage's party or his former outfit, UKIP. Another 35 percent voted for a national party backing a second referendum and remaining in the EU: the Lib Dems, the Greens, who took 12 percent, and new party Change UK, which took 3 percent.

Notwithstanding strong performances from nationalist parties — the SNP in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales, which back a second referendum but also draw support from Leave voters — U.K. polling expert John Curtice described the result as ""a draw"" between the forces of hard Brexit and Remain.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print BERLIN — Phew. Turns out the bark of Europe’s far right is worse than its bite.
Yes, illiberal parties did well in France and Italy, Poland, Hungary and beyond. But overall no better than expected, and in some cases worse so.
Bottom line: The populists’ finish isn’t that much stronger than in 2014.
That’s good news for Europe’s democratic parties and even better news for the European Union. The strategy of Europe’s centrists, from Merkel to Macron, to cast the election as a question of “Europe’s destiny” helped drive voters to polling stations.
Throughout the campaign, pro-EU parties warned that the scourge of Euroskeptic populism, in the guise of France’s National Rally, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), Italy’s League and many others, threatens to undo decades of European integration.
Even in France and Italy, where the populists did the best on the Continent, the results are below some expectations.
Europeans heeded those calls and turned out to vote in large numbers, with voter participation across Europe at about 51 percent, compared to 43 percent in 2014.
The strong participation helped temper the results for the Euroskeptics, who tend to benefit from low turnout because they're good at getting their own voters to cast a ballot.

Kim Jong Un courts others amid rift in 'great relationship' with Trump,www.politico.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/26/trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-1290897,"Continue to article content
President Donald Trump said he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “fell in love.” Analysts, however, say the latest developments are exposing the reality that the two countries remain far apart on the question of whether Pyongyang will give up its nukes. | Vietnam News Agency/Handout/Getty Images Foreign Policy Kim Jong Un courts others amid rift in 'great relationship' with Trump 'When all the fluff blows away ... there was no real meat there to grab on to,' said Jung Pak, a former senior CIA official. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump may think his “great relationship” with Kim Jong Un will ultimately result in a nuclear deal, but the North Korean leader is flirting with other suitors in an apparent attempt to pressure Washington into easing sanctions on his country.
The increasingly visible U.S.-North Korean rift threatens what Trump had hoped could be a signature talking point for his 2020 reelection campaign. Even administration officials aren’t promising any imminent breakthroughs, leaving Trump almost singular in his stated confidence, which he reiterated on Friday. Story Continued Below
“I think we're doing very well with North Korea. A lot of progress is being made,” he said, adding later, “I have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un.”
Trump was expected to discuss the subject Friday during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to the White House, although the subject did not come up during a brief session with reporters. The get-together comes the same week Kim met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and accused the United States of having a “unilateral attitude in bad faith,” which likely troubled Japan.
The country is invested in seeing Pyongyang stay at the negotiating table with the U.S., in hopes that a deal might curtail North Korea’s missile program and secure the return of abducted Japanese citizens.
Trump and Kim have already met twice, and Trump at one point declared the two “fell in love.” Analysts, however, say the latest developments, including Kim’s criticism of the U.S., are exposing the reality that the two countries remain far apart on the question of whether Pyongyang will give up its nukes.

“The rift was always there, but it was hidden underneath the fluff of high-level comments, including from Trump, that things were going great,” said Jung Pak, a former senior CIA official. “When all the fluff blows away ... there was no real meat there to grab on to.”
Trump this week has also had to grapple with a Washington Post report that Pyongyang presented his administration with a $2 million bill for its supposed care of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was imprisoned in North Korea on charges linked to pulling down a propaganda poster. Warmbier died soon after being returned to the U.S. in a comatose state. Trump has denied any money was paid.
North Korea’s rapidly progressing nuclear program has vexed U.S. presidents of both parties. Trump’s decision to meet Kim face to face last year in Singapore was nontraditional and historic, drawing headlines the media-obsessed Republican president loved.
A second summit, in Hanoi, Vietnam, this past February, was cut short after Kim essentially asked Trump for a significant easing of international economic sanctions for what Trump felt were not meaningful concessions on its nuclear program.
In the weeks since, Trump has nonetheless sounded positive notes about Kim and the talks — pointing out that the country has curbed its nuclear missile testing, for instance. But the North Koreans have instead grown increasingly critical of the United States.
Kim, who met Putin in the Russian city of Vladivostok, said he would give the United States until the end of this year to show some flexibility on sanctions, according to North Korean state media. He warned that “the situation on the Korean peninsula and the region is now at a standstill and has reached a critical point.”

Earlier this month, a North Korean foreign ministry official declared that it no longer wanted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo involved in the nuclear talks. The North Koreans blasted Pompeo for “reckless remarks” and questioned his maturity.
“I am afraid that, if Pompeo engages in the talks again, the table will be lousy once again and the talks will become entangled,” the official was quoted as saying by state media.
Pompeo has dismissed the North Korean demands. In an interview with CBS News this week, he said upcoming conversations would be “bumpy,” but that he “absolutely” still sees a path to full North Korean denuclearization.
The swipe against Pompeo was similar to North Korea’s past criticism of Trump national security adviser John Bolton. But the North Koreans have not singled out the U.S. president himself for criticism, suggesting that they are trying to divide him from his aides as part of a pressure tactic to persuade him to ease sanctions.
The derailed talks have yet to hurt Trump on the campaign trail.
Democrats jumping into the 2020 race have largely avoided the topic, which is a tricky one given the historically bipartisan failure to solve the North Korea crisis. Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who regularly polls in the top-tier of a crowded Democratic field, even applauded Trump's efforts to talk with Kim during a CNN town hall in February.
Recent reports that Kim has sidelined Kim Yong Chol, a spymaster and his point man on the nuclear talks, and may be replacing him with diplomatic figures, could lead to a potential breakthrough, some observers said.
“The real problem is the North Koreans haven’t been engaging in real negotiations,” said Joel Wit, a former State Department official who worked on past nuclear talks with Pyongyang. If Kim Yong Chol is replaced “with Foreign Ministry people who know the issues, that means the North Koreans are now willing to sit down and talk.”"
North Korea calls Bolton a ‘defective human product’ - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/27/north-korea-bolton-warmonger-1345029,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Monday called U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton a “warmonger” and “defective human product” after he called the North’s recent tests of short-range missile a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
The statement by an unnamed North Korean foreign ministry spokesman came as President Donald Trump continued his visit to Japan for meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in which the nuclear standoff with North Korea was expected to be high on the agenda.
Story Continued Below
Bolton told reporters in Tokyo on Saturday that there was “no doubt” that North Korea’s recent launches violated U.N. resolutions, and that sanctions against the North must be kept in place.
North Korea tested short-range ballistic missiles on May 4 and 9, ending a pause in launches that began in late 2017. The tests have been seen as a way for North Korea to pressure Washington to soften its stance on easing sanctions against it without actually causing the negotiations to collapse.
In the statement carried by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean spokesman said that the North was rightfully exercising its rights for self-defense with the launches.
“Demanding us to ban all launches using ballistic technology regardless of range is same with asking us to relinquish our rights for self-defense,” the spokesman said. “Bolton should not be called a security adviser who works to secure security, but an adviser for security destruction who destroys peace and security. It’s not that strange that crooked sound will always come out the mouth of a man who is structurally flawed, and it’s best that this defective human product goes away as soon as possible.”
The statement came as South Korea began its annual summertime defense drills involving thousands of civilians and troops that have been modified to exclude large-scale military exercises with the United States, which were suspended to create space for diplomacy with the North.
Last week, the KCNA called former Vice President Joe Biden “a fool of low IQ” and mocked Biden for thinking he is a popular presidential candidate. “This is enough to make a cat laugh,” the report said. Trump on Saturday tweeted his support for North Korea’s views on Biden’s intelligence, though he spelled Biden’s name wrong in the process."
"Trump breaks with Abe, says not bothered by NK missile tests",www.politico.com,politico.com,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/27/donald-trump-japan-trip-shinzo-abe-press-conference-1345031,"TOKYO — President Donald Trump said Monday that he is not “personally bothered” by recent short-range missile tests that North Korea conducted this month, breaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is hosting the president on four-day state visit full of pageantry
Standing beside Trump at a news conference after hours of talks, Abe disagreed with the U.S. president, saying the missile tests violated U.N. Security Council resolutions and were “of great regret.” Abe, who has forged a strong friendship with Trump and agrees with him on many issues, is concerned because the short-range missiles pose a threat to Japan’s security.
Story Continued Below
Trump was invited to Japan to be the first world leader to meet with its new emperor. Despite being far from Washington, he didn’t miss the chance to lob another broadside against former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democrats seeking to challenge Trump in next year’s presidential election. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un recently criticized Biden as having a low I.Q. and Trump told the world he agreed with the authoritarian leader’s assessment.
Abe is hosting Trump on a state visit designed to highlight the U.S.-Japan alliance and showcase the warm relations between the leaders. During hours of talks at Japan’s Akasaka Palace, Trump and Abe also deliberated over economic issues, including trade and Iran, but North Korea’s recent firing of short-range missiles emerged as an area of disagreement.
When asked if he was bothered by Pyongyang’s short-range missile tests, Trump said: “No, I’m not. I am personally not.”
The president has sought to downplay the significance of the missile tests, despite the fact that his own national security adviser, John Bolton, said over the weekend that they violated U.N. resolutions.
Trump continues to hold out hope of eventually getting Kim to agree to give up his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, despite two summits he’s had with the North Korean leader that produced no concrete pledge to denuclearize the peninsula.
Trump praised Kim, calling him a “smart man” who might have launched the missiles earlier this month to “get attention.”
“All I know is there have been no nuclear tests, no ballistic missiles going out, no long-range missiles going out and I think that someday we’ll have a deal,” Trump said, adding that he is in “no rush.”
Trump is correct when he said North Korea has not recently tested a long-range missile that could reach the U.S. But earlier this month, North Korea fired off a series of short-range missiles that alarmed U.S. allies in closer proximity to North Korea, including Japan. The tests broke a pause in North Korea’s ballistic missile launches that began in late 2017.
Abe reiterated his previous statement that the tests were carried out in defiance of the U.N.
“This is violating the Security Council resolution,” Abe said, adding that, as North Korea’s neighbor, Japan feels threatened. “It is of great regret. But at the same time between Kim Jong Un and President Trump a certain new approach was taken and that is something that I pay tribute to.”
Earlier Monday, Trump said he backed Abe’s interest in leveraging his country’s good relations with Iran to help broker a possible dialogue between the U.S. and its nemesis in the Middle East. Abe said he is willing to do whatever he can to help to reduce escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
Trump and Abe discussed the issue earlier Monday. Abe could visit Iran next month.
“Peace and stability of (the) Middle East is very important for Japan and the United States and also for the international community as a whole,” Abe said.
The leaders held hours of talks after the U.S. president — at Abe’s invitation — became the first world leader to meet Japan’s new emperor, Naruhito, who ascended to the throne May 1.
The meeting with Naruhito and his wife, Empress Masako, was preceded by a grand outdoor welcome ceremony at Japan’s Imperial Palace, where Trump walked solo across red carpets, reviewing Japanese troops as the guest of honor.
Trump’s official visit also included golf with Abe, presenting a trophy to a sumo wrestling champion and dinner in Tokyo with their wives. The visit came with hours of one-on-one time for Trump and Abe, who has been trying to remain on Trump’s good side despite disagreements between them on trade and other issues.
Trump didn’t hold back at the news conference when he was asked about Biden, declaring himself “not a fan.”
“Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-I.Q individual,” Trump said, adding that Kim probably based his assessment on Biden’s record and “I probably agree with him on that.”
U.S. officeholders usually avoid engaging in politics while on foreign soil, hewing to the adage that politics stops at the water’s edge. But Trump’s sharp attack on Biden, though his declaration of agreement with Kim, set aside that long-standing norm.
Trump and Abe largely glossed over their difference on trade, despite the potentially crippling tariffs on foreign autos that Trump is threatening to impose on Japan and the European Union. Trump declined to say what Japan would have to do to avoid those tariffs, but complained of an “unbelievably large” trade imbalance with the nation.
Still, he said he expects to reach trade deals at some point with both Japan and China, but wouldn’t rush it.
“I think we will have a deal with Japan. Likewise, I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future,” he said. Trump has tried to pressure China by slapping tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.

“Abe, who has forged a strong friendship with Trump and agrees with him on many issues, is concerned because the short-range missiles pose a threat to Japan’s security. ... Trump didn’t hold back at the news conference when he was asked about Biden, declaring himself ‘not a fan.’ ‘Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-I.Q individual,’ Trump said, adding that Kim probably based his assessment on Biden’s record and ‘I probably agree with him on that.’” AP

Herszenhorn: “The center-right European People’s Party clung to first position in Sunday’s European election but will have a slimmer plurality in the European Parliament after voters delivered big gains to far-right populists, liberals and Greens. Voter turnout surged across the Continent to exceed 50 percent for the first time in a quarter century — suggesting renewed relevance for the EU amid Britain’s so-far failed effort to quit the bloc, and mounting external challenges from Russia, China and the United States.
“Initial results and exit polls showed the EPP is likely to hold 179 seats — a sharp decline from the 216 it won last time. The center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) is expected to come second with 150 seats, down from 187. A new centrist-liberal coalition led by French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is predicted to come third, with 108 seats, followed by the Greens with 68 seats.

MEMORIAL DAY READS -- “U.S. Army’s Tweet Prompts Stories of Harmful Effects of Military Service,” by NYT’s Mihir Zaveri: “It was meant to be part of a social media tribute on Memorial Day weekend. On Saturday afternoon, the United States Army posted a video on Twitter featuring a scout in fatigues who said his service gave him the opportunity to fight for something greater than himself, making him a better man. In its next tweet, the Army opened the floor and asked: ‘How has serving impacted you?’ The post was shared widely and received thousands of responses. But many were probably not what the Army was looking for.
“Instead, the call-out provided what some felt was a rare platform to spotlight the darker consequences of military service for soldiers and their families, as tweet after tweet described lifelong health complications, grief over loved ones lost, sexual assaults gone unpunished and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. ‘The public just doesn’t hear about it,’ said Brandon Neely, 38, a former Army specialist who posted about his PTSD. ‘They don’t hear about the guys, these veterans, that don’t sleep, have night sweats, are irritated.

Female veterans — historically the memorial’s biggest donor pool — have pulled back over the years, and today they often focus more on their postmilitary life, and civilian identity, after taking off the uniform. And federal money, which has always been limited for memorials, has become increasingly stretched across an ever-expanding landscape of tributes, which are all looking for new donors.” NYT

“Rolling Thunder devotees gathered around [organizer Artie] Muller, believing the event had been saved. But all around him, the organizers behind Rolling Thunder were shaking their heads. They had not received a call from the White House. The Pentagon had not been in touch. The rally would still cost around $200,000 — far too much of which, the organizers believe, goes to parking lot rental and security.

Aside from a campaign swing right after announcing his candidacy, Biden has kept his head down while his rivals rush from state to state to state. Even when he has held public events, they have included only a handful of questions from voters or reporters.
“The light public schedule reflects the unique position of his campaign, advisers say: With near universal name recognition and high favorability ratings among Democrats, the former vice president does not need to introduce himself to voters like nearly every other candidate.

Democratic donnybrook could jeopardize must-win Senate seat - POLITICO,www.politico.com,JAMES ARKIN,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/27/colorado-senate-primary-cory-gardner-1343613,"DENVER — Democrats are struggling to nail down A-list recruits in Senate races across the country. But here in Colorado, they have the opposite problem: A field of candidates so big that the primary is turning into a total free-for-all.
In a spectacle that resembles Wal-Mart on Black Friday — or, for that matter, the Democratic presidential primary — nearly a dozen candidates are stampeding to take on Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), probably the most vulnerable Republican incumbent on the ballot next year. Other Democrats are weighing jumping in. And there’s neither a clear front-runner nor consensus among party leaders on the best standard-bearer in the must-win race.
Story Continued Below
The swarm of candidates filled a void left by just-departed Gov. John Hickenlooper, who was courted to run for the seat but decided to jump into the even more crowded race for president instead.
National Democrats tried in the past to anoint chosen candidates in key Senate contests to avoid precisely this situation. But that tactic backfired in recent years, when well-known former elected officials blew winnable races in battleground states. So in Colorado, Democrats are opting for a hands-off approach, allowing the primary to play out and hoping someone emerges from a crop of young, mostly untested candidates who is capable of knocking out a skilled GOP incumbent.
They're confident that Gardner is beatable no matter who wins or how bloody the primary is.
“Because Gardner’s so vulnerable and is so bad for the state, we are bursting at the seams,” said Colorado Democratic Party Chairwoman Morgan Carroll. “The party is strictly neutral, but we have a big field of folks that are champing at the bit to make sure he’s replaced.”
Republicans plan to take full advantage of the packed primary. They're trying to push candidates to the left and to tie the contenders to the presidential candidates and the administration of Gov. Jared Polis in the hopes of damaging them with unaffiliated and moderate voters.
“It shows that they don’t think they have a winner in the field,” Gardner said of the crowd running against him. “It’s going to grow. There’s going to be more of them.""
Of the dozen Democrats in the running, at least half are serious contenders for the nomination.
Mike Johnston, a former state senator, was the first to enter the race and is considered the early favorite. His bullet hole-pocked campaign office doubles as a community center in a neighborhood plagued by gang violence.
Another early candidate was Andrew Romanoff, the former state house speaker who challenged Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) from the left and blew a winnable race against Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) in 2014. But Romanoff is popular among liberals and Republicans are paying close attention to him.
Then there's a trio of former Obama administration officials whose profiles mirror those of successful House candidates in 2018. Dan Baer, a former State Department official and ambassador in Europe, would be the first openly gay man to serve in the Senate if elected, and touts his foreign policy experience as a sharp contrast with Gardner. John Walsh, a former U.S. attorney running as a “pragmatic progressive,” is endorsed by a handful of former Obama officials, including former Attorney General Eric Holder.
Alice Madden, a former state house leader and Department of Energy official, was the first top-tier woman to enter the race. Colorado has never elected a woman to the Senate, which Madden says gives her an edge in a field of mostly white men.
But at least three other women are considering running: secretary of state Jena Griswold and state Sen. Angela Williams both recently met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and state Sen. Kerry Donovan is considering a bid.
Johnston’s $1.8 million fundraising haul in the first quarter of the year nearly matched Gardner’s total. The next round of fundraising in July could further define the pack. But Washington and Colorado Democrats have no interest in picking sides.
“Our obsession over big-name Senate recruits has not proved to be a worthwhile strategy,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn). “Finding new faces who are willing to work hard and capture the imagination of voters is sometimes better than putting someone on the ballot that has big-name recognition.""
Gardner won by fewer than 2 points in 2014, and Hillary Clinton carried the state by 5 points in 2016. Last year, Democrats easily swept statewide races as they reversed a deficit of 50,000 registered voters in 2014 to an advantage of 50,000 registered voters.
Still, the primary isn’t until late June 2020, and candidates can’t begin collecting signatures to make the ballot until January. People running now could drop out, others could enter or a clear frontrunner could emerge.
Democrats avoided Senate primaries this year when Reps. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Joaquin Castro of Texas declined to run, clearing a path for Mark Kelly and MJ Hegar, respectively. Contested races would have been a major problem for Democrats in those red-leaning states, but in Colorado they're confident any nominee can be competitive.
Hickenlooper is another X factor. His presidential campaign is sputtering and he could change his mind and run for Senate instead. The popular two-term governor would likely quickly overtake the primary.
That decision is ""totally up to him,"" said Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who is running for president himself and once chaired the DSCC.
But “I’m not worried about the big field” in Colorado, Bennet added. “I think it will shake itself out.""
The vast field will offer voters an array of potential avenues to unseat Gardner. Not unlike the presidential primary, the overriding consideration may be electability over ideology.
“Coloradans are going to get very serious about who is the candidate that’s going to be actually best positioned to beat Cory Gardner in what’s one of the most important Senate races in the country,” Johnston said.
Johnston has statewide name ID after having run unsuccessfully for governor last year. Baer, meanwhile, touts his international acumen, saying to he has the ability ""toe to toe"" with Gardner, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Madden is leaning on her climate change credentials and voters who are ""very hungry"" to elect the state's first female. And Walsh argues his work as a U.S. attorney fighting opioids will help harness the ""fierce energy"" among voters.
Progressive activists in the state aren’t taking sides yet and shrugged off the prospect of a drawn-out and expensive primary leaving the nominee weak and broke heading into the fall against Gardner.
“When you’re the No. 1 state in the country [in the battle for Senate control], I don't think there's such a thing as limited resources,” said Ian Silverii, executive director of ProgressNow Colorado. “When it's over we're going to cream him.”

Trump finds himself increasingly alone on North Korea - POLITICO,www.politico.com,ANITA KUMAR,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/27/donald-trump-north-korea-1345034,"President Donald Trump is isolating himself from allies and even his own advisers on North Korea, eager to insist that his denuclearization efforts will be successful going into his 2020 reelection bid.
The widening gap was apparent Monday morning when Trump disagreed with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a joint news conference when asked about recent North Korean missile tests.
Abe had called the tests of several short-range ballistic missiles “quite a regrettable act” that violated a United Nations Security Council resolution, echoing language that Trump’s own national security adviser, John Bolton, had used on Saturday.
But the president on Monday, at the end of his short trip to Japan to meet the new emperor, insisted that he was not “personally” bothered by the tests and was “very happy with the way it’s going” in his efforts to engage North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Notably, Trump said he did not think the tests violated the U.N. resolution.
“My people think it could have been a violation,” Trump said. “I view it differently.”
It was a striking break that revealed Trump’s desire to retain a talking point he has long used at rallies — that he’s responsible for pulling America back from the brink of nuclear war with North Korea. It’s a stance that has been increasingly difficult to maintain as talks between Washington and Pyongyang appear to have broken down after two summits between the two countries’ leaders. It's also clear that Trump sees the issue almost singularly through the lens of his personal relationship with Kim.
Kim, Trump said, “is looking to create a nation that has great strength economically. … He knows that, with nuclear, that’s never going to happen. Only bad can happen. He understands that. He is a very smart man. He gets it well.”
North Korea’s missile tests were the first since 2017 after Trump threatened “fire and fury” if Pyongyang didn’t stop its nuclear weapons tests.
Since then, North Korea has paused its nuclear weapons testing, pushing the U.S. to ease sanctions in exchange for the minimal steps it has taken to denuclearize. Trump balked at such a deal in February and ended his second summit with Kim early.
Fearful of the threat that North Korea’s missiles posed to Japan, Abe has long courted Trump on the issue. On Monday, Abe praised Trump for breaking “the shell of distrust” with Kim and announced that he, too, would hold a summit with the North Korean leader. But even after saying the U.S. and Japan were “the same” on North Korea, he reiterated that North Korea had violated a U.N. Security Council resolution. “It is of great regret,” he said.
The divergent remarks came after Trump on Sunday appeared to brush back his own national security adviser on Twitter.
“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,” the tweet read.
The tweet came shortly after Bolton had confirmed for the first time that the administration had “no doubt” the missile tests violated international resolutions.
Trump has reportedly become frustrated with Bolton, a former ambassador to the U.N., particularly because of the brewing conflicts with Iran and Venezuela. But the break with Bolton was the clearest in Trump's remarks in Japan.
In recent weeks, Trump has privately joked about Bolton’s hawkish impulses — as a private citizen, Bolton advocated for a preemptive strike on North Korea and advocated for regime change in Iran. Publicly, Trump has even said that he “tempers” Bolton’s more aggressive instincts.
Trump also drew attention during his news conference with Abe for trumpeting a derisive comment Kim made about Joe Biden, Trump’s potential Democratic rival in 2020.
“Well, Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual,” he said, breaking with a tradition by U.S. presidents to not engage in politics on foreign soil. “He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that.”
Trump had doubled down on the remark earlier in the weekend with a tweet, writing he had “smiled” at Kim’s comment, speculating, “Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?”
Trump returns to Washington Monday after a four-day visit to Japan. He will return to Japan next month for a meeting of the globe’s top economies."
GOP megadonors accompany DeSantis on Israel trip,www.politico.com,LORRAINE WOELLERT,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2019/05/27/gop-megadonors-accompany-desantis-on-israel-trip-1029717,"Republican megadonors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson attended a signing ceremony with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in Israel Monday, according to a statement from the governor's office.
DeSantis signed a memorandum of understanding between between Florida Atlantic University and Ariel University in a ceremony attended by the Adelsons. The couple was not listed as members of the DeSantis delegation.
Story Continued Below
The universities will develop exchange and research opportunities for scholars and students.
DeSantis, who took office in January, has promised to be “the most pro-Israel governor in America,“ and the Israel trip, his first trade mission as governor, is part of a Republican appeal to the state‘s Jewish voters going into the 2020 presidential election.
The Florida effort is part of a larger GOP offensive aimed at breaking the Democratic Party’s hold on the Jewish vote and, in the process, shoring up the conservative evangelical base.
Adelson money is fueling that effort. In April, the board of the Republican Jewish Coalition, which receives substantial funding from the casino executive, met at Adelson’s Venetian resort, where they were briefed on plans for a $10 million-plus blitz geared toward attracting Jewish support for President Donald Trump.
Adelson has long been a DeSantis supporter and gave more than $800,000 to the governor's 2018 campaign. During that same cycle, the billionaire donated $5 million to the Republican Party of Florida, which was heavily involved in the DeSantis general election campaign.
DeSantis was nicknamed the “ billionaire whisperer ” by a Republican fundraiser because of his close relationship with top party financiers like Adelson.
DeSantis is scheduled to meet with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later this week.

In college, I studied photography and political science and then I worked my way up as the photography industry went through major changes – First I was a cashier/tech at a professional photo studio (which has since closed), then a staff photographer at The Journal Newspapers (since sold), then The Examiner (a daily newspaper now turned weekly political magazine), then The Washington Times (once a giant photo staff which dwindled until I was the very last photographer), followed by The Washington Post, and finally The Associated Press, where I have been for the past four years. ”
What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading now or finished? And why? “It’s been out for quite a while, but I finally finished ‘The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt,’ by T.J. Stiles. It’s over 700 pages, so it really gets in the weeds, but his life story is worth reading the details. As Stiles notes, at the time of Vanderbilt’s death, he ‘controlled one-twentieth of the American currency in circulation.’ That’s nearly a nickel of every single dollar in the entire country.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “I’ll need a new roof on my rowhouse pretty soon, and I recently went down a rabbit hole researching solar energy and green roofs. D.C. will substantially discount the cost of installing a green roof and solar panels, power companies will pay you for the energy you produce, and there’s currently a federal tax credit of 30% on all solar projects.”
How is the Trump presidency going? “For photographers, the Trump White House gives us a great deal of access to the President, and that has kept us quite busy over the last two years.”
What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “I grew up on the ‘tough streets’ of Adams Morgan in the 80s.”"
Why breaking up Facebook won't be easy,www.politico.com,MARGARET HARDING MCGILL,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/27/breaking-up-facebook-antittrust-1446087,"The idea of breaking up Facebook is gaining attention like never before — from the campaigns of presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to the stunning proposal from Chris Hughes, one of the social network's cofounders, to split the company apart to curb its “monopoly” power.
But busting up the nation’s tech giants would be much harder than making a campaign pledge. Corporate breakups are a huge, and rare, undertaking for the government, and a social media company like Facebook presents unique challenges that didn't exist with past antitrust successes like the dismembering of AT&T in the 1980s.
Here are some of the obstacles standing in the way of turning this rallying cry into reality:
1) Proving Facebook is a monopoly The social network is certainly big and powerful — with more than 2 billion users worldwide, a huge share of online advertising revenue and tentacles that include onetime rivals like WhatsApp and Instagram.
But it’s debatable whether Facebook meets the legal definition of a monopoly, a company with lasting, unchecked power to raise prices or exclude competitors. The answer could depend on how antitrust enforcers define Facebook's market — a question that has become less clear as the company has expanded.
Facebook argues it has fierce competition on all sides of its business. It's a giant of digital advertising, but is second to Google in global market share and faces competition from companies like Amazon, according to research firm eMarketer. It also competes with Apple and Snapchat as a messaging platform.
“Facebook is in an amorphous, fast-changing market,” said Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. That makes the monopoly question “convoluted and hard for the government to prove” compared with previous antitrust cases that centered on industries like oil or railroads, he said.
Facebook critics argue there's a monopoly case to be made against Facebook, because it dominates users' online attention and grabs control of their data. But Facebook is not the sole power in the social media market. And that makes it different from AT&T and its Bell System, which had a nationwide stranglehold on local telephone operators, long-distance service and telephone equipment before its breakup in the 1980s.
A decade later, the Justice Department struggled to prove that another big tech company — Microsoft — held a monopoly on personal computing through its control of Windows and Internet Explorer.
“AT&T was able to so thoroughly control the sector that nothing happened that it didn't want to see happen in terms of the introduction of new services,” said Phil Verveer, who worked on the AT&T case while at the Justice Department. “That was not the case with Microsoft, and it might not be the case with Facebook either.""
2) Deciding what to break up In past marquee antitrust cases, the road map for a breakup was relatively straightforward. The Standard Oil case, decided by the Supreme Court in 1911, saw that company split up largely along geographic lines. AT&T was a heavily regulated company with separate businesses for long-distance and local telephone lines, making the lines of division clear.
Facebook doesn't have such easily identifiable boundaries. Social networking works only through reaching as many people as possible and connecting them with others, making the idea of separating parts of the business much more complex.
“In the internet age, those kinds of options just don't exist,"" said Andrew Schwartzman, an attorney with Georgetown’s Institute for Public Representation.
Critics like Warren and Hughes have talked up the idea of cleaving off Instagram and WhatsApp, which Facebook acquired in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Even though they appear to consumers as distinct apps, however, they are already deeply integrated with Facebook. Instagram, for example, uses the same advertising technology as Facebook.
What's more, CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced the two platforms will be enmeshed even more tightly with the core social network, an effort he said will make the services easier to use and more secure. It could also make them even harder for regulators to unwind.
“There may well be sound business reasons to do it,” Schwartzman said of the changes Zuckerberg announced, ""but certainly one benefit of that would be it would make it harder to break them up.""
3) Antitrust cases take time and money The Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against AT&T, and its unsuccessful battle to break up Microsoft, were yearslong affairs that started under one presidential administration and ended in another. That means whoever wins the White House in 2020 could well be out of office before a potential case against Facebook is decided or settled.
The AT&T case began in 1974 and ended in 1982, after which the government spent another two years implementing an agreement that split up the company into eight smaller entities.
The government spent another decade in the 1990s and early 2000s waging an antitrust war against Microsoft for anti-competitive behavior, arguing that its operating system and internet browser should be separated. But by the time the court approved a settlement in 2002, requiring changes to the company's business practices but leaving Microsoft intact, the penalties did not have much impact, Verveer said.
“Technology will change, business models will change, consumer preferences will change,” he said. “You could end up at the end of a long process with something that frankly doesn't make very much difference because the world has moved on.”
That's one reason some Facebook critics, including former DOJ antitrust official Gene Kimmelman, argue that imposing restrictions on how social media companies use data could be a more effective strategy than breaking them up.
A lengthy lawsuit against Facebook would also consume a lot of resources at the DOJ, which might have to hire outside attorneys and other experts as it did in the Microsoft case. The expense could even require additional appropriations from Congress, Schwartzman said.
“It is a really daunting enterprise,” Schwartzman said. “The likelihood the Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission would be able to undertake such an activity is remote.”
4) The legal bar has gotten higher Courts have become more conservative when it comes to antitrust doctrine since the 1970s, experts say, requiring the government to prove that anti-competitive behavior has a real economic impact on businesses or consumers. That's widely considered a tougher standard.
Because of judicial skepticism about the ""breakup solution,"" antitrust enforcers in the Obama administration tended to pursue so-called behavioral remedies for companies getting bigger through mergers, said Kimmelman, who now heads consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. Those allow a merger to proceed with certain restrictions, without attempting to spin off parts of a company.
He pointed to the Microsoft antitrust case. In that proceeding, an appeals court overturned a judge's original decision to separate the operating system and browser, saying the Justice Department had not shown enough evidence to justify the move.
If the government tries to force Facebook to give up WhatsApp and Instagram, it would have to argue the market would be more competitive if those acquisitions had never taken place. But it's tricky to convince a court based on speculative outcomes about the two services, the Mercatus Center's Thierer said.
WhatsApp and Instagram “might have failed entirely. They might have succeeded on their own. We don't have any idea how these markets would have shaken out,” he said. “The evidentiary burden on these things is very difficult because we don't know how history would have played out differently.”
5) Limits on the president’s power No president can simply decree that a company be dismantled. The antitrust review process is meant to be a regulatory and legal one.
That issue has already haunted President Donald Trump's administration, which had to rebut accusations that his distaste for CNN motivated the Justice Department's unsuccessful attempt to prevent Time Warner from merging with AT&T. Trump had promised to block the deal on the campaign trail, calling it ""too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” and he frequently lambasted Time Warner-owned CNN as a font of ""fake news.""
The government ended up losing its court fight, allowing the deal to go through. But the accusations of White House interference in the antitrust arena offered a preview of questions the next president may face in tackling big tech companies.
Warren has made clear that in her administration, regulators would handle such issues. But she pledged to appoint people in those roles ""who are committed to using existing tools to unwind anti-competitive mergers,"" including Facebook's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp.
“Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,” Warren wrote in a Medium post , which also called for breaking apart Google and Amazon.
One of her 2020 Democratic rivals, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, warned she is treading on questionable — even Trumpian — territory.
“I don't think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here,” Booker said."

“Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you,” Trump tweeted. “I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, and helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!
Story Continued Below
“Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing,” Trump wrote in a second tweet. “That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!”
Biden, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, played a central role in getting the 1994 bill passed. It has loomed over his presidential bid, with critics saying the bill generated mass incarceration that disproportionately affected minorities.
Biden has defended the bill and his role in passing it and has denied that it resulted in mass incarceration. Former President Bill Clinton apologized in 2015 for signing the bill into law, saying he “made the problem worse.""
Biden has already been criticized by other 2020 presidential contenders from his own party for his support of the bill, including Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who called Biden's work on the bill ""a huge mistake"" on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday."
De Blasio: I get under Trump’s skin,www.politico.com,aweaver@politico.com (Aubree Eliza Weaver),05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/05/27/de-blasio-i-get-under-trumps-skin-1029719,"The mayor has the lowest favorability ratings in the 2020 Democratic presidential field. | AP Photo De Blasio: I get under Trump’s skin Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio may not be soaring in the polls, but he says he has one thing going for him that his fellow 2020 Democratic candidates don’t — he’s been watching President Donald Trump for years and knows all of his tricks.
“I know something about Donald Trump that’s different from the other candidates, because I watched him for decades,” de Blasio told Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday morning, speaking of his fellow New Yorker. Story Continued Below
“I understand his game plan. I understand his tricks and his strategies, and I do get under his skin. I called him on the first day of my campaign, I called him ‘Con Don’ because he is a con artist. That’s how he’s gotten ahead.”
However, de Blasio is struggling in another aspect of the presidential race. He has the lowest favorability ratings in the 2020 Democratic presidential field, with 76 percent of New York City voters saying they didn’t want him to run for president, an April Quinnipiac University poll showed. Also, 65 percent of statewide Democrats said they would be unhappy if he secured the nomination next year, according to a Marist College poll .
But he isn’t going to let that slow him down.
“Voters are going to get to know me, as is true in every election,” de Blasio said. “I’ve had two elections in New York City and won both overwhelmingly. So the people in my city decided they wanted this leadership because it puts working people first. That’s what I do, and people ultimately, after they hear all the facts and look at all the choices, they want someone who knows how to support working people.”
“I’ll tell you, and I’ve found this with polls over and over again,” he added. “If I believed the polls and listened to the polls in all my other elections, I might have just stayed home. But it’s not where you start, it’s where you end. So much of the time, the polls don’t tell us the truth. When people get to know you and see what you’re about, that’s what they respond to.”

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print LONDON — Britain, welcome to Europe.
Nigel Farage’s upstart Brexit Party — which ran away with 32 percent of the vote and is set to gain 28 seats in the European Parliament — has blown the United Kingdom's political system to pieces. And paradoxically, it's made it more “European” in the process.
With the Conservatives and Labour Party bleeding support , and big gains for Farage, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, the two-party system looks like it might be on its last legs — replaced by the multiparty pluralism that drives politics in much of Europe.
As hard as it may be to concede for those determined to buy into the myth of British exceptionalism, the U.K. is following in its neighbors’ footsteps.
Austria, Estonia and Germany — to name just three — have all reckoned with the rise of an extremist party in national politics. And across the EU, traditional catch-all parties of the center right and center left have also seen massive drops in support. New cleavages that cut across class divides have boosted the popularity of political startups on their flanks — be they populist far-rightists, radical centrists ( à la Macron), radical leftists ( como Podemos), Green parties, or even separatists.
The more immediate implications of this European election for the U.K. is the collapse of its two big mainstream parties.
Welcome to fragmentation, polarization, volatility and the erosion of traditional party loyalties.
This is not the first time, of course, that a populist, radical-right, British insurgency led by Farage has topped a European poll and sent a big bunch of MEPs to make as much mischief (and as much money) as possible in Brussels and Strasbourg: In 2014, the U.K. Independence Party (may it rest in peace) won 27 percent of the vote.

POLITICO Playbook: Giuliani wants to be Trump’s No. 1 campaign hatchet man,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/05/28/giuliani-wants-to-be-trumps-no-1-campaign-hatchet-man-440162,"Rudy Giuliani plans to meet with the president and his campaign in the coming weeks to discuss pivoting to this new role. | Alex Wong/Getty Images DRIVING THE DAY SCOOP -- DARREN SAMUELSOHN: “‘My Rudy’: Trump’s lawyer wants to be the campaign’s No. 1 hatchet man”: “Get ready for more Rudy. Done sparring with Robert Mueller, Donald Trump’s personal attorney is now training his attacks on the president’s reelection rivals. Giuliani plans to meet with the president and his campaign in the coming weeks to discuss pivoting to this new role, which he expects will also include making policy and political connections for the 2020 effort.
“‘We’ll see where they have holes and where they need help,’ Giuliani told POLITICO. ‘I’m available to do a lot of it.’ Giuliani has long served as an all-purpose attack dog for Trump — to mixed results. The president and some of his top aides have occasionally cringed at the lawyer’s frequent off-script messaging and rambling TV appearances that can spark one or more unexpected news cycles. ‘Handling Rudy’s f--- ups takes more than one man,’ a White House staffer told POLITICO in January.” POLITICO
-- IT’S NOT SURPRISING Giuliani wants to find a way back into the political limelight. He seems to relish the back-and-forth with reporters and cable news circuit. For as often as Giuliani likes to spitball with reporters, others in Trump’s orbit are having to play cleanup. It’s hard to see Trump’s inner circle of campaign aides looking to Giuliani as the missing link in their well-laid plans. Trump’s campaign team is building a much more conventional political operation to compete in 2020 -- more structure, more traditional fundraising, less freelancing.

“Throughout his visit, though, Mr. Trump acted like a man who could never be fully present. From start to finish, his stay in Japan was defined more by his focus on politics at home than diplomacy abroad, expressed as a running refrain posted online seemingly every time he was left alone with his screens.” NYT … POLITICO slideshow of 27 pics of Trump’s Japan trip

“The attack on science is underway throughout the government. In the most recent example, the White House-appointed director of the United States Geological Survey, James Reilly, a former astronaut and petroleum geologist, has ordered that scientific assessments produced by that office use only computer-generated climate models that project the impact of climate change through 2040, rather than through the end of the century, as had been done previously.” NYT

“Attendance at the former vice president’s launch rally paled next to some of his rivals. In his first Iowa visit, he didn’t match the crowds that greeted Elizabeth Warren or even the less well-known Pete Buttigieg in their initial visits. So far, he’s kept his events to smaller venues where there’s little danger of empty seats.
“In the eyes of Biden’s progressive critics — as well as President Donald Trump, who has publicly mocked him for it — the seeming lack of excitement or teeming masses at his events is a leading indicator of a lack of passion for his candidacy.” POLITICO

Sanders is making dozens of calls each week to elected officials, labor leaders and party chiefs, according to his aides. In between his rallies, he regularly meets with politicians behind closed doors. And surrogates including Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the co-chair of his campaign, are aggressively courting House members to get on board.
“All of that is standard fare for a top-tier presidential campaign, but it represents a major shift for Sanders. His willingness to step up his efforts to win institutional support is the latest sign that he recognizes that shunning the Democratic establishment might work for a long-shot outsider campaign, but won’t cut it if he truly wants to win the nomination.” POLITICO

BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “Nation’s first opioid trial could set precedent for massive pharma payouts,” by Paul Demko: “A trial kicking off in Norman, Oklahoma, on Tuesday will provide an unprecedented examination of how the country spiraled into a devastating opioid epidemic — and could indicate to what degree drug companies accused of fueling the crisis will be held responsible in hundreds of other lawsuits still pending across the country.
“Most of the litigation against opioid makers and distributors — involving states, cities, counties and tribes — is wrapped up in a single massive lawsuit overseen by a federal judge in Ohio. But the Oklahoma lawsuit against two manufacturers of prescription painkillers will be the first to reach trial and could establish a precedent for damages paid to communities ravaged by opioids.
“The Oklahoma trial, which will be broadcast online, is expected to last for much of the summer, putting a national spotlight on the opioid crisis, which is still killing 130 people in the United States every day. The testimony will focus on how much manufacturers of highly addictive painkillers are to blame for getting patients hooked on opioids through misleading medical claims and aggressive marketing practices.” POLITICO

-- THE DAILY BEAST’S ASAWIN SUEBSAENG: “For years, [One America News Network] has tried to supplant Fox as a dominant force in conservative media. For the past two years, it has prolifically churned out glowing coverage of the Trump administration and its achievements. OAN’s top executives have beseeched the president on Twitter to forget about Fox and to signal-boost them instead. And in the first year of Trump’s presidency, the network produced a commercial mocking CNN’s ‘Facts First’ apple-and-banana ad campaign, and declaring OAN the ‘Real News.’
“The overt flattery seems to be paying off. Fox News is still the president’s favorite media behemoth. But OAN’s team has been catching his eye. This year, Trump has tuned in more often than ever to OAN, two sources close to him say. There’s been a conspicuous uptick in his public promotion of OAN’s segments, including on his personal Twitter account. And, it appears, he’s even pitching the network to those roaming the halls at Mar-a-Lago.” Daily Beast

Bernie Sanders' extreme makeover,www.politico.com,HOLLY OTTERBEIN,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/bernie-sanders-extreme-makeover-1343956,"Bernie Sanders was notorious in 2016 for refusing to ask Democratic power brokers for their support. While Hillary and Bill Clinton were lighting up their phone lines, elected officials grumbled they never heard from Sanders or his campaign.
He also lacked the campaign infrastructure to compensate: “We had no political shop,” said Mark Longabaugh, one of Sanders’ top strategists that year.
This time around, the candidate with an aversion to schmoozing and a reputation as a loner in the Senate is bowing to a side of politics he's long despised. Sanders is making dozens of calls each week to elected officials, labor leaders and party chiefs, according to his aides. In between his rallies, he regularly meets with politicians behind closed doors. And surrogates, including Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the co-chairman of his campaign, are aggressively courting House members.
All of that is standard fare for a top-tier presidential campaign, but it represents a major shift for Sanders. His willingness to step up his efforts to win institutional support is the latest sign that he believes that shunning the Democratic establishment might work for a long-shot outsider campaign, but won’t cut it if he truly wants to win the nomination.
""He is trying to talk to anyone and everyone who he thinks might have a desire to support the campaign at some point in time,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ 2020 campaign manager. “We want to make sure the doors are open.”
Sanders’ willingness to work the phones isn’t the only indication he’s running a more traditional in-it-to-win-it campaign. He recently hired a fundraiser — a position he didn’t have in his 2016 bid — and is planning in-person “grassroots” fundraisers that could draw larger donors. In addition to his standard big rallies, Sanders is mixing in more intimate town halls in Iowa, where voters demand up-close-and-personal contact with candidates. And he has at times weaved his life's story into his speeches, another standard campaign practice that he eschewed four years ago.
Compared with himself in 2016, when he rarely courted influential politicos, Sanders is a chatterbox these days. The people who’ve received his calls say he sometimes talks about why he’s the best person to beat President Donald Trump. Other times he veers toward policy. Occasionally, if he’s known the person long enough, he’ll ask for an endorsement.
Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, is one of the people who’s heard from Sanders. They appeared together last month at an Ohio town hall sponsored by her union, which endorsed Clinton in 2016.
“Look, Bernie really wants to be president. And I think what he's doing is the work of relationship-building,” Weingarten said. ""We're far away from an endorsement and there's a lot of other [candidates] in the race ... but I do think that Bernie has spent time not only being the iconoclast he is and being the independent soul he is, but also working with allies to work for a better country.”
Sanders is wooing natural allies as well as people unlikely to get on board his campaign. He’s placed calls to everyone from Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry to United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard, according to people familiar with the conversations. Fetterman, a progressive, backed Sanders in 2016; the SEIU sided with Clinton, though a faction of the union’s members supported Sanders. And Gerard’s members showed up in force to Joe Biden’s campaign kickoff.
One of the more promising places Sanders has looked for support is the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which he helped create in 1991. Khanna, a member of the group, said he’s spoken to about 10 others in the caucus about Sanders' campaign and his hope they'll endorse it.
Sanders aides say the strategy isn't to clinch the most endorsements: He just needs enough that he can point to a respectable level of support from the party and not be written off as too far outside the mainstream.
""He was completely shut out of any institutional support in 2016,” Khanna said. “Now, I believe, he will have a critical mass of institutional support to get his message out and win the race. He doesn’t need to have the most institutional support. He just needs to have enough.""
Even if Sanders could persuade some power brokers to hold off on endorsing any candidate in the primary, particularly if they lean toward Biden, it would be something of a victory.
In many of his calls, Sanders makes the electability argument — that he can take down Trump in a general election — a big question mark in the eyes of some Democrats given his democratic-socialist profile.
Some Democrats who’ve watched Sanders since 2016 said that a major difference between now and then is he has a built-out political team helping him seek endorsements. His political director is Analilia Mejia, a former New Jersey political director of an SEIU local, and his deputy political director is Sarah Badawi, who worked as a top strategist at the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.
The change hasn’t gone unnoticed. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said Sanders showed up to a 2015 meeting with top union leaders by himself. Typically, presidential candidates come with at least a few aides in tow.
“It's my view that he had to spend a lot more energy himself on the campaign itself previously,” Nelson said.
Jeff Weaver, a longtime adviser to Sanders who managed his campaign in 2016, said the leftward shift of the Democratic Party has made more people receptive to Sanders' outreach.
“Last campaign, Bernie Sanders started as a relatively unknown person on the national stage. Secretary Clinton was widely known and had locked up the support not just of national Democrats but of party folks in the states as well,” he said. “Now it’s a new day. The party has changed dramatically in the last four years, to say the least, and there’s a lot more openness to Bernie.”
So far, Sanders is in the middle of the pack in the race for big-name endorsements, trailing other top-tier contenders such as Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a fellow Vermont Democrat who backed Clinton in 2016, endorsed Sanders the day he launched his second campaign. Leahy said Sanders didn’t approach him in 2016 because he had already made clear he was behind Clinton. Sanders is also backed by five members of the Democratic National Committee, as well as Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman.
Sanders has also announced 15 endorsements from state lawmakers in New Hampshire and South Carolina, and his staff has said it will unveil supporters in Iowa and Nevada in the future.
Even if the Democratic leaders they’re courting don’t support Sanders now, his allies hope the efforts will ease tensions should he become the nominee. Sanders is polling second, behind only Biden, in most surveys.
""When you're going to want to pull the party together, it makes it much easier because you've established relationships,” Longabaugh said. “They don't see you as a three-headed monster anymore.”

Joe Biden is the front-runner by every measure — except enthusiasm,www.politico.com,MARC CAPUTO,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/biden-energy-crisis-1345359,"He’s dominating in the polls, his fundraising is going gangbusters and he’s showing broad support from key political players in the early presidential states.
So where are the big energetic crowds, the lines around the block to get into Joe Biden’s events?
Story Continued Below
The question is no small matter in a party still recovering from a bitter 2016 defeat — a loss marked by a lack of enthusiasm for an establishment nominee in several critical states.
Attendance at the former vice president’s launch rally paled next to some of his rivals. In his first Iowa visit, he didn’t match the crowds that greeted Elizabeth Warren or even the less well-known Pete Buttigieg in their initial visits. So far, he’s kept his events to smaller venues where there’s little danger of empty seats.
In the eyes of Biden’s progressive critics — as well as President Donald Trump, who has publicly mocked him for it — the seeming lack of excitement or teeming masses at his events is a leading indicator of a lack of passion for his candidacy.
“I started to think the polls were wrong about Biden because it’s not what we’re seeing on the ground,” said Aimee Allison, founder and president of She the People, a national network devoted to promoting women of color.
“Inspiration is the X-factor and we’re waiting for the inspiration from Biden,” she said. “When the inspiration isn’t there, the turnout from the core of the Democratic base — women of color — isn’t there. And then we lose.”
To Biden’s campaign, attendance figures are a meaningless metric. Focusing on crowd size is Trump’s game, it says, an emphasis on style over substance that attempts to turn audience engagement into an argument about the 76-year-old Biden’s energy level.
Crowd size, after all, is an imperfect metric to measure a campaign’s vitality. While it can be a revealing indicator, it still lacks the scientific underpinning of polling or the fixed-dollar figures associated with fundraising. Nor does it account for the judgment of elected and influential Democrats across the country.
Just as critics doubted Biden’s popularity before he got in the race, his campaign is confident he’ll have the crowds when he needs them.
""We're seeing enormous enthusiasm for Joe Biden's candidacy across the country, beginning the very first day of the campaign when he got over 100,000 contributions — 65,000 of which were brand new to our lists — from all 50 states,” said Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo.
Even so, since announcing his candidacy more than a month ago, Biden has yet to draw anything near the 20,000 people who showed in Oakland to cheer on Kamala Harris when she announced, or the 13,000 who turned out in Brooklyn for Bernie Sanders’ launch.
Last Saturday, when Biden held a rally for his headquarters’ opening in Philadelphia, his campaign estimated the crowd size was 6,000 — a count that some local observers thought might be generous. One local elected Democrat who supports Biden privately told POLITICO the rally was smaller and less energetic than expected.
The event fell far short of the size his surrogates predicted in one of the nation’s largest Democratic cities. Just before Biden formally announced his candidacy last month, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who helped organize a fundraiser for Biden, had loftier expectations.
“He’s enormously popular here,” Rendell, a former Philadelphia mayor, said in a late April interview. “We could get tens and tens of thousands of people … For one rally, I think we could do that.”
The crowd size was similar to what President Barack Obama drew at a 2016 rally for Hillary Clinton at the same venue. As a candidate, however, in April 2008, some 35,000 people flooded Independence Mall to see Obama — before he was the nominee.
Trump — for whom crowd size borders on obsession — seized on Biden’s Philadelphia launch, mocking the former vice president two days later at a rival Pennsylvania speech in which he exaggerated the smallness of the crowd.
“We have thousands of people … look at the thousands and thousands of people we have,” Trump said at a Montoursville rally, for which his campaign declined to release an estimated crowd count. “They said [Biden] had 600 people ... I’d say 150.”
It’s not the first time Trump has needled Biden over crowd sizes. In 2018, when the president and Biden held dueling Nevada rallies in the homestretch of the midterm campaign — and Trump’s Elko rally had more attendees than Biden’s Las Vegas rally — Trump used the occasion to point to Biden’s prior presidential race defeat and joked that Biden “was thrilled that’s one of the biggest crowds he’s ever had.”
It’s not just the size of Biden’s events that are modest, he’s also holding far fewer of them than his primary competitors. Since his launch, he’s visited Iowa only once. And while Democrats crisscrossed early presidential primary states during the long Memorial Day weekend, Biden took it off. (On Tuesday, he travels to Houston where he and his wife, Jill, will join an American Federation of Teachers town hall.)
There are signs that the theme could become more prominent as the campaign progresses. One of the president’s top surrogates, Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, said Biden won’t have the energy to campaign full time once he gets off “the French workweek campaign schedule” that the Democrat is currently on.
“He wants to make America bored again. It’s like he wants to put his audience to sleep,” Gaetz said.
“Trump’s rallies are big and raucous and enthusiastic. And the reason that matters is that in today’s politics, people want to be part of something,” Gaetz said. “Joe Biden’s rallies looks like an event where you would give a gold watch to the Democrat for a lifetime of service.”
James Carville, one of the masterminds behind Bill Clinton’s campaigns for president, said those criticisms miss an essential point about the kind of no-frills-no-thrills campaign he is running.
“He’s never been a candidate who has run on excitement. He has run on ‘you can trust me. I’m a good guy. My heart is in the right place. I’m human. You know me. I’m well-liked,’” Carville said. “Their theory of the case is people are tired of the circus. And it takes an experienced hand to settle everything down to get us back to some era of sanity.”
To that end, some Democrats say Biden’s sometimes listless crowds aren’t cause for concern, but merely reflective of the part of the electorate backing him: older, middle-of-the-road Democrats who are more likely to turn out to the polls than to boisterous megarallies.
Polk County Democratic Chair Sean Bagniewski said there weren’t lines around the block for Biden during his Iowa visit, but that at a local Democratic Party dinner, the former vice president’s campaign dominated local chatter.
“The polls are picking up the people who might not be going to the rallies, might not be going to the meetings. But the polls can still be right,” Bagniewski said. “The rank and file can be reliable Democrats. They’re the people who have been around for awhile.”
Brian Fallon, former spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said the Biden campaign isn’t going for big crowds and passion and is instead underpinned by “a very pragmatic argument. It’s not an argument designed to electrify. It revolves around electability ... It’s not the type of message that inspires a movement. It’s very practical.”
There’s also the matter of Biden’s long tenure in politics. Crowds that flooded to Buttigieg or Beto O’Rourke in this cycle did so in part because they’ve never seen the candidates before.
Tad Devine, who was part of Sanders’ insurgent 2016 campaign against Clinton, added that Biden doesn’t need the big crowds the way Sanders did in the previous race because the former vice president doesn’t need to show he’s a legitimate candidate — he’s the front-runner.
“Biden’s not a crowd candidate. He’s not Obama. He’s not Bernie,” Devine said. “Drawing big crowds is more important for Beto [O’Rourke] or Mayor Pete to get into the mix.”

"Amid censorship fears, Trump campaign 'checking out' alternative social network",www.politico.com,BEN SCHRECKINGER,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/trump-campaign-twitter-1345357,"They've been banned from Facebook, purged from Twitter and blocked from Instagram. Some of them have been barred from setting foot on the continent of Australia. But you can still find them all on the fledgling social media network Parler.
The Twitter-like platform was initially hatched last year as a tool for digital news outlets to claw revenue back from big social networks like Facebook. But as those platforms purge some of the internet’s most inflammatory supporters of President Donald Trump over posts deemed dangerous or offensive, Parler has carved out a niche among these banned right-wing influencers — like Gavin McInnes, Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos.
Story Continued Below
As conservative distrust of social media giants rises to the top of Washington’s political agenda, Parler has also gained the notice of some bona fide Republican leaders: Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and Utah Sen. Mike Lee both began posting on the site this month.
According to one person close to Trump’s campaign, the president’s team is considering setting him up with an account on the site. A senior Trump campaign official said that there was no imminent plan to have the president join the platform, but that Parscale is scouting Parler. “It’s something he's aware of and is checking out,” the official said of Parscale. “We don’t currently have a plan to make a big move to the platform.”
Having Trump’s imprimatur would give the platform overnight cachet and satisfy calls from his social media-savvy supporters for the president to stick it to the Silicon Valley companies with which he maintains a strained, symbiotic relationship.
""Donald Trump should just switch social media platforms altogether because everyone will follow him,” said Candace Owens, a pro-Trump activist close to Trump’s campaign team. Owens, who is black, was recently banned from Facebook — and then swiftly reinstated with an apology from the company — for posting “Black America must wake up to the great liberal hoax. White supremacy is not a threat. Liberal supremacy is.”
Owens — who recently departed the conservative youth group Turning Point USA — introduced Parler to the pro-Trump grassroots with a December tweet that began, “Wow. Everyone just found out about the new Twitter. Just want to say that I WAS THE FIRST CONSERVATIVE TO JOIN.” Her tweet in turn linked to a tweet from the chairman of X Strategies, a conservative communications firm, promoting Parler.
Parler’s founder, John Matze, said the Owens tweet swamped his site with 40,000 new users, causing its servers to malfunction. (He also said that X Strategies approached him after the tweet. The firm now does public relations work for Parler.)
Parler is the french word for “Speak,” and is pronounced “par-lay.” But as its user base has grown, Matze has seen that Americans tend to pronounce the word phonetically, as in “parlor,” evoking the room in a house where friends might sit down to chat.
Matze and Owens said they first encountered each other late last year in New York at the Gatestone Institute, a think tank that was formerly chaired by Trump’s national security advisor, John Bolton, and is known for its hostility to Islam.
Owens was there to speak, and Matze was working on integrating Parler with Gatestone’s website. Matze, who leans libertarian in his personal views, had not set out to cater to Trump supporters. Originally, he had conceived of Parler as a commenting plugin with social features that media outlets could integrate into their websites as a way to capture more engagement with their content themselves — rather than letting the bulk of engagement and ad dollars flow to established social media platforms.
He said he expected left-leaning digital publishers to become core partners. But as large social media platforms have responded to calls to curb extremism on their sites with bans of several far-right figures and other, more opaque measures like “shadow banning,” conservative users have become increasingly distrustful of the likes of Facebook and Twitter.
This has created an unexpected opening for Parler with pro-Trump users, though it is still far from challenging large social networks. Many aspects of its user interface, such as its search function, remain clunky. And its user base remains miniscule in the grand scheme of things.
Matze said the site had about 100,000 users in total. Twitter, by comparison, claims 326 million.
Activity on the site appears to be devoted mostly to a small universe of Trump-friendly discussions. On a recent Tuesday, trending topics on the site included “#IslamExposed,” “#IllegalImmigrants,” “#BuildThatWall” and “#WomenForTrump.” Even among Trump’s most avid online supporters, many have never heard of Parler. At the moment, the two outlets that appear to use the site most actively are Breitbart News and the Epoch Times, a newspaper associated with Falun Gong — a Chinese spiritual movement on the outs with China’s ruling Communist Party — that has attracted notice for its pointedly pro-Trump editorial line.
Given its limitations, even those sympathetic to Parler remain skeptical of its prospects. Will Chamberlain, who recently relaunched the conservative publication Human Events with a focus on social media censorship, said that though he plans to post his outlet’s content to Parler, he does not expect it to displace the reigning platform for news. “I think Twitter has a natural monopoly,” he said. “I think there are profound network effects.”
And even by the standards of free speech Twitter alternatives, Parler is small. Another platform, Gab, founded in 2016, claims a million users. “Parler is a ghost town,” said Gab’s founder Andrew Torba.
Like Parler, Gab takes a laissez-faire approach to offensive speech and has been a magnet for those banned from other platforms. Its users include white nationalist Richard Spencer and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The perpetrator of a 2018 mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue was also a Gab user. There are even questions about whether Gab’s frog logo is an homage to Pepe, the cartoon frog symbol of the alt-right, though Torba has said the frog is an allusion to the Book of Exodus. Gab’s popularity with the virulently racist alt-right has tainted Gab’s brand, stymying its prospects for growth into a mainstream platform even as it amassed a large user base.
While Parler’s founder does not want to be limited to a far-right user base, much of the content posted on Parler falls into categories deemed offensive and discouraged by the large platforms — such as anti-Islam and anti-feminist sentiment. In one post typical of the site, a user with the handle @liberalismiscancer, shared a meme criticizing the burka, the body covering worn by some Muslim women, along with the comment, “Where are my fellow feminists why is the oppression of women ok if it's in the name of ISLAM ? Why are Moslems treated differently free from criticism.”
Matze said he still hopes to attract users of all political persuasions. ""We're pretty much bipartisan from our standpoint,” he said. “I really don’t want to take a stance at all on the political side of things. However it seems extremely relevant right now for conservatives at least to build a platform where they can build trust. They feel extremely abused by social media.""
Matze said he plans to bypass these issues by using the FCC’s definition of obscenity to determine what posts cross the line, and to leave up anything that does not meet that threshold, while giving users tools to personally filter out content they do not want to see.
Ongoing fights about the sorts of speech and users that tech giants permit on their platforms have returned to the fore in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the White House posted an online survey seeking to collect information about possible political discrimination by these platforms.
The senior Trump campaign official said that the campaign is also using its financial leverage with social media platforms like Facebook to push back against perceived bias. “We're a significant advertiser so we make sure our viewpoint is heard,” the official said. Trump’s campaign has spent roughly $5 million so far this year on Facebook ads, far more than any of his Democratic rivals, according to a New York Times analysis .
Despite this heavy ad spending, distrust of large social media platforms has loomed large in the strategic thinking of Trump’s team. In October, POLITICO reported that Trump’s 2020 campaign was investing heavily in efforts to reach supporters directly, such as via text message, in order to bypass the platforms.
Earlier this month, Matze swung through Washington, where he ran into Parscale at the Trump Hotel. The Trump campaign manager posted a photo of himself with Matze and Elise Rhodes, a vice president of client relations at X Strategies, to Parler.
While in town, Matze also met with Lee, the libertarian-minded senator, and sold him on Parler’s free speech ethos.
Lee was so taken he decided to set up an account. Matze said he offered to help Lee’s staffers set up an account for him, but the senator insisted he did not want his staff to have access to the account, because he wanted to post directly to it himself.
A spokesman for Lee, Conn Carroll, said he could not confirm the specifics of the conversation, but did confirm that Lee personally posts to Parler himself.
Lee has posted a handful of times in recent weeks on the site -- though he hasn’t exactly been unleashed. When a user named “Anon, yo!” called Lee a “typical RINO fake congressman” for not sponsoring term limits, Lee responded, “I’ve cosponsored term-limits every year I’ve been in the Senate.” This elicited an apology from “Anon, yo!” to the senator.
Matze said he hopes the site will foster civil discussion, and that he has seen users wish each other good night at the end of evenings of heated debate. That civility though, may be a function of the fact that most of the platform’s heavy users share a broadly similar worldview. And it is not clear whether an initial user base that is so invigorated by arguing with liberals — a recent trending topic was “#Triggered” — will find as much satisfaction on a platform dominated by their fellow travelers.
Michael Morrison, a conservative activist who operated a Twitter parody account of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez until being banned from that platform, said many right-leaning social media figures are treating Parler as a backup. They are attracting modest followings on the platform in case they are banned from the larger social networks.
“Obviously I’d like to see it build up,” he said, “For now, it’s a small, nice, conservative community."""
Nation's first opioid trial could set precedent for massive pharma payouts,www.politico.com,PAUL DEMKO,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/opioid-trial-pharma-payouts-1344953,"A trial that kicked off in Norman, Oklahoma, on Tuesday will provide an unprecedented examination of how the country spiraled into a devastating opioid epidemic — and could indicate to what degree drug companies accused of fueling the crisis will be held responsible in hundreds of other lawsuits still pending across the country.
Most of the litigation against opioid makers and distributors — involving states, cities, counties and tribes — is wrapped up in a single massive lawsuit overseen by a federal judge in Ohio. But the Oklahoma lawsuit against a single manufacturer of prescription painkillers is the first to reach trial and could establish a precedent for damages paid to communities ravaged by opioids.
Story Continued Below
In opening arguments Tuesday, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter accused Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals — the lone remaining defendant in the case — of creating “ruinous destruction” by flooding the state with highly addictive painkillers.
""It's time to hold them responsible for their actions,"" Hunter told Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman, who will decide the case instead of a jury.
But Johnson & Johnson attorney Larry Ottaway countered that Oklahoma is distorting facts to wrongly blame the company for the addiction crisis and questioned whether it can get a fair trial in state court.
“When they make the charge that the people at Janssen set out to addict kids, it is only fair that we bring before the court what Janssen actually does to educate kids,” Ottoway said.
The Oklahoma trial, which is being broadcast online, is expected to last for much of the summer, drawing renewed attention to a health crisis that is still claiming 130 U.S. lives a day. The testimony will focus on how much manufacturers of highly addictive painkillers are to blame for getting patients hooked on opioids through misleading medical claims and aggressive marketing practices.
The trial will be closely watched by the hundreds of parties participating in the larger multi-district litigation overseen by U.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster, who has been pushing for a massive settlement before the first of those cases go to trial in the fall.
“It’s going to be one of the first times that there will be evidence presented in an open forum about how we got to where we are,” said Joe Rice, co-lead counsel in the federal litigation targeting drugmakers and distributors in Ohio. “That’s a big question that a lot of people in the health community want to know. … Why and how did we get here?”
On Sunday, Oklahoma announced an $85 million settlement with Teva Pharmaceuticals, leaving Janssen as the only defendant.
The larger federal litigation overseen by Polster involves well over 1,000 lawsuits from governments and groups who argue they’re owed tens of billions of dollars in damages for the fallout from the addiction crisis. Unlike the Oklahoma trial, those cases will involve Purdue Pharma, the makers of OxyContin, which more than any company has been blamed for flooding the country with painkillers.
The first of those trials is scheduled to begin in October. There are also dozens of cases winding their way through state courts that could be affected by the outcome of the Oklahoma trial.
Still, the Oklahoma case may not be an ideal vehicle for assessing the broader opioid litigation landscape because it targets just a single company.
Purdue and its owners, the Sackler family, settled with Oklahoma in March for $270 million, an amount some state lawmakers and public health experts condemned as too meager. The biggest chunk of that settlement, $200 million, will be used to establish a new addiction treatment center at the University of Oklahoma. Another $60 million will be paid to attorneys involved in the case, and just $12 million will filter down to cities and towns struggling to deal with the addiction epidemic.
Oklahoma Attorney General Hunter stressed that the settlement was the best option because of the threat that Purdue would declare bankruptcy and the state might end up with nothing. But that means Oklahoma’s attorneys will have to make the potentially trickier case that other, less notorious players in the opioid pipeline created a “public nuisance” in the state by pushing misleading medical claims.
“A big question in the lawsuits is how far liability should extend,” said Abbe Gluck, director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School. “It’s a test case about the broader web of defendants that are involved in this lawsuit precisely because Purdue is not in it.”
Johnson & Johnson contends that Oklahoma’s lawsuit is trying to pin the blame on the company for a public health catastrophe it isn't responsible for creating. The drugmaker argues federal regulators at the FDA approved labeling for its products and that they account for a tiny share of the overall opioid market.
“ Janssen will continue to defend itself, because the claims raised against it in the Oklahoma litigation have no basis in fact or the law — and that will be made clear during trial,” said John Sparks, Oklahoma general counsel for Janssen.
But even if the trial that started Tuesday isn’t perfectly representative of the sprawling legal fight against opioid companies, the proceedings are likely to influence how the hundreds of other lawsuits play out, experts said.
“Any time there’s a resolution by way of settlement or by way of a verdict, it’s a piece of information that goes into everybody’s evaluation of every other case,” said Rice, the attorney involved in the multi-district litigation. “Whether it’s good or bad depends on what the numbers are and who it is.”
Andrew Pollis, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said a big judgment against Johnson & Johnson could push other defendants to settle rather than take their chances at trial.
“That would portend even worse news for the industry in a case in which Purdue Pharma is actually at the table,” Pollis said. “If it’s bad without Purdue, it’s going to be even worse with it.”
The closest precedent to the sprawling opioid litigation is the tobacco lawsuits of two decades ago. Those cases eventually resulted in a master settlement of more than $200 billion in damages across 46 states.
Doug Blanke, who was a key player in Minnesota’s separate lawsuit against the tobacco companies, pointed out the major national settlement came shortly after the companies agreed to a nearly $7 billion settlement with the state following a five-month trial.
“When we got that result, that was the big driver for what became the national settlement, which came along six months after ours,” said Blanke, now director of Mitchell Hamline School of Law’s Public Health Law Center in Minnesota. “Whoever becomes the benchmark going to trial really can drive things.”
Blanke cautioned, however, any settlements resulting from the opioid lawsuits must be targeted at the problem. Just a fraction of the tobacco settlement has been directed toward smoking cessation and prevention efforts, while states have used the money to fill budget gaps and support unrelated projects.
“They used it to do other things that I’m sure were perfectly worthy — balance the state budget or build a building somewhere — but for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with the reasons the lawsuit was brought,” Blanke said. “Let’s make the punishment fit the crime here.”"

With the losses of 2018 in the rearview mirror, it’s obvious we have not fully internalized the lessons of 2016. Zito and Todd break down the voters of the 2016 Trump coalition, giving a clear road map to what is needed for the movement -- and party -- today. It’s a timely reminder that the working-class voter is on loan to conservative Republicans, and we would all be wise to promote policies that fight to keep them.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “It’s getting more attention recently because of action in the states, but the shift in abortion politics is worth noting. Many assume that millennials will be just as pro-choice as their feminist grandmothers, but the reality is millennials are more pro-life than any generation before. Some chalk this up as a reaction to just how extreme abortion policies have gone in celebrating late-term abortions, even allowing a born-alive baby to die on the table. That’s certainly part of the explanation. But also look at how much more information is now easily available about the abortion procedure itself -- from the recent success of the movie ‘Unplanned’ to pregnancy resource centers across the country that offer free ultrasounds, so that women can see life inside their bodies and make the choice to bring their baby to term, raise him or her themselves or seek adoption.

Supreme Court won't hear case on transgender school bathroom policy -,www.politico.com,NICOLE GAUDIANO,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/supreme-court-transgender-school-bathroom-policy-1345367,"The Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to hear a case challenging a Pennsylvania school district’s bathroom policy allowing transgender students to use bathrooms of their choice.
The conservative Alliance Defending Freedom represented a group of students in the case, Doe v. Boyertown Area School District , alleging that the district’s policy violates student privacy. ADF has represented students and school districts in similar lawsuits across the country.
Story Continued Below
The Supreme Court's decision leaves standing the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals unanimous ruling last year that the Pennsylvania school district can continue allowing transgender students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The court later revised its ruling, toning down language that said federal law protects that right.
Michael Levin, counsel for the school district, said the Supreme Court recognized the case wasn't worthy of further review and ""understood the false narrative that is being repeated by the Plaintiffs that their privacy rights were violated.""
""The Boyertown Area School District provides private bathrooms and locker rooms to all students who do not feel comfortable sharing such (spaces) with others, transgender or cisgender,"" Levin said in a statement. ""The school district’s approach to offer separate and private bathrooms, locker rooms and private spaces to students who desire greater privacy is the common-sense approach that the Plaintiffs claim that they want.”
The ACLU represents Aidan DeStefano, a student at Boyertown Area Senior High who is transgender, and the Pennsylvania Youth Congress, a coalition of LGBTQ youth leaders and youth organizations.
The ACLU tweeted: “Our client Aidan was accepted as the boy he is — this should be every student’s experience. This is a victory for trans students and educators nationwide.""
The group added, “Trans students are not a threat. This move means school districts can continue to allow trans students to participate in school activities, and use restrooms and locker rooms, that match their gender.”
But the ADF said in a statement that the high court should have reviewed the case. “Students struggling with their beliefs about gender need compassionate support, but sound reasons based on common sense have always existed for schools to separate male and female teenagers in showers, restrooms, and locker rooms,” said ADF Senior Counsel and Vice President of Appellate Advocacy John Bursch.
Bursch said he hopes that the court will take up a similar case in the future ""to bring much needed clarity to how the lower courts should handle violations of well-established student privacy rights.”
ADF filed a petition with the Supreme Court in November asking it to review the ruling upholding the policy. The petitioner they refer to as “Joel Doe” was “embarrassed and confused” when encountering a transgender student in the locker room, according to the petition. He was “marked down in gym class” for failing to change his clothes, and “he eventually felt forced to leave the school entirely,” the petition states.
The school district, responding in January , argued no students are required to share a restroom or locker room with transgender students and the school district has a “compelling interest” in protecting transgender students. The ADF failed to show that the lower courts abused their discretion in finding that the school district’s policy does not violate Title IX, the federal law that protects against sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs, the school district stated.
The notion of whether federal law protects against discrimination based on gender identity has sparked lawsuits nationwide.
A separate case brought by Virginia teenager Gavin Grimm previously reached the Supreme Court. But it was sent back down to a lower court in March 2017 after the Trump administration scrapped an Obama-era directive that protected bathroom access under Title IX."
Supreme Court won't review abortion law signed by Pence -,www.politico.com,ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/abortion-pence-indiana-supreme-court-1345366,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked an Indiana law barring abortions based on a fetus' sex, race or disability, while allowing a separate state measure requiring fetal remains to be buried or cremated to take effect.
The justices declined to review a lower court's decision overturning a law restricting when and why an abortion could be performed. Vice President Mike Pence signed the measure into law in 2016 when he was Indiana governor, and it was blocked by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals last year.
Story Continued Below
That case is the latest abortion challenge the Supreme Court's new conservative majority has passed up. However, it doesn’t indicate whether the court will eventually take up a challenge to Roe v. Wade, as a spate of conservative states including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri approve laws meant to directly challenge the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide.
In an unsigned opinion, the justices wrote that the state has a ""legitimate interest"" in the disposal of fetal remains. They reversed the 7th Circuit decision blocking that provision, reinstating Indiana's measure without first holding a hearing.
Indiana argued the prevalence of prenatal screening has led many women to opt for abortion when fetal abnormalities like Down syndrome are detected. Supporters of abortion rights said the law was unconstitutionally intrusive, defying Supreme Court precedent protecting a woman's right for an abortion until the fetus is viable outside of the womb, generally considered to be around 24 weeks.
""A woman, not the legislature, gets to decide whether an abortion is the right decision for her and her family,"" said Ken Falk, legal director with the ACLU of Indiana, who represented Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky in the case.
A spokesperson for Pence, while commending the court's decision over fetal remains, said the administration remained ""hopeful"" that the high court would one day take up a legal challenge addressing state bans on abortion that are based on sex, race or disability.
""Countries across the globe prohibit selective abortion — and the United States should do the same,” Alyssa Farah, press secretary for the vice president, said in a statement.
Although Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with the court's decision to refuse the case, he wrote in a fiery concurring opinion that the justices may eventually consider the constitutionality of similar laws.
""Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana’s,"" he wrote. ""But because further percolation may assist our review of this issue of first impression, I join the Court in declining to take up the issue now.""
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she would have declined to take up both parts of the Indiana case. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissenting opinion, disagreed with the majority's ruling on the fetal remains question.
The Supreme Court internally wrangled over the Indiana case for an unusually long time. The case, Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, was first listed on the justices' docket in January.
Reaction to the court's decision from groups opposing abortion was mixed, given the split decision over different parts of the Indiana law.
The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List and its research arm Charlotte Lozier Institute thanked the court ""for affirming today that nothing in the Constitution or precedents of this Court prohibits states from requiring that the remains of human children be treated better than medical waste."" However, they said it was ""gravely disappointing"" that the court did not take up the ban on abortion based on sex, race or disability.
The groups' statement also praised Pence for his long history of shaping anti-abortion policies that are now considered mainstream in the Republican party.
Abortion rights advocates criticized the court for upholding the fetal remains provision.
“Today the Court let another unwarranted restriction on abortion stand,"" Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. ""While this ruling is limited, the law is part of a larger trend of state laws designed to stigmatize and drive abortion care out of reach.""
The high court has declined to hear two other abortion challenges in the current term, the first since Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the bench. A divided Supreme Court in February temporarily blocked a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. However, the court may take up the Louisiana case for a full review later this year.
Justices in December declined abortion rights case concerning whether states can cut Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from their Medicaid programs."

— The revelation that hackers used an NSA-developed exploit in the ransomware attack on Baltimore and other cities is sparking turmoil in Congress, industry and elsewhere.
— Recent House Appropriations Committee reports on fiscal 2020 spending bills demonstrate lawmakers’ priorities for the Defense, State and Veterans Affairs departments.
— Another company left a huge tranche of documents exposed online. This time it was First American Financial Corp.
HAPPY TUESDAY What exactly is a when-wolf ? Although, as commenters on that article pointed out, it’s probably not a real idea.
Driving the Day ENTERNALBLUE’S OUT OF THE BAG — The NSA originally created an integral component of malware unleashing chaos on U.S. cities, The New York Times reported late last week. The U.S. intelligence community’s largest agency first lost control of the malware, named EternalBlue, in 2017. Since then, EternalBlue has been used by digital criminals around the world, including on the cities of San Antonio, Allentown and Baltimore. A particularly devastating cyberattack hit Baltimore on May 7, freezing city computers and disrupting services. Officials have refused to pay the $100,000 ransom.
The ongoing gridlock has prompted congressional lawmakers and local officials to request briefings on the spy agency tool run amok. However, the FBI still isn’t certain whether the Shadow Brokers, the group that leaked EternalBlue, is made up of disgruntled insiders or foreign spies. Meanwhile, the NSA reportedly never thought about informing tech giant Microsoft that it had uncovered vulnerability and held onto the secret for over five years before the breach occurred.
Former NSA chief Navy Adm. Mike Rogers , who ran the organization during the leak, told the Times in March that the agency shouldn’t be blamed for the damage its caused. “If Toyota makes pickup trucks and someone takes a pickup truck, welds an explosive device onto the front, crashes it through a perimeter and into a crowd of people, is that Toyota’s responsibility?” he asked. “The N.S.A. wrote an exploit that was never designed to do what was done.” Microsoft countered that in that metaphor, the NSA’s exploit was the bomb itself. But the Times story itself also has gotten blowback from some information security experts about how much to blame the NSA.
ON THE MILITARY AND DIPLOMACY SIDE, BILL REPORTS CONT’D — Last week we gave you a look at some cybersecurity provisions in House Appropriations Committee reports on the annual fiscal 2020 spending bills for domestic-focused agencies. Here are some from the defense- and foreign policy-focused measures.
— Defense: The committee report on the Defense spending bill urges the Pentagon to ""collaborate with colleges and universities"" to focus on recruiting potential cyber candidates in their junior or senior years to get them started on obtaining security clearances early. It complains about late submission of cyberspace activity budget documents. The report tells the department to consider research and development into cybersecurity applications of blockchain technology.
For the Army, ""The Committee remains concerned about cyber and electronic warfare vulnerabilities of the dismounted soldier at the tactical edge,” the report reads. “The Committee encourages the Secretary of the Army to continue to develop sensors and prototyping efforts for a lightweight, low-power device that can perform cyber and electronic warfare for situational awareness and force protection for dismounted soldiers.""
— Military Construction and Veterans Affairs: DOD would also get commandments in the Military Construction and VA bill, including one directing quarterly reports showing how the department is ensuring that industrial control systems in construction projects are secure. The department would have to conduct a review of conditions at cyberspace operations operations facilities at military installations. The committee orders a report on energy resilience in part because of its important to military united with cyber responsibilities.
For both departments, ""The Committee is concerned about the pace at which implementation of cybersecurity best practices are occurring at the Department, especially as VA and DOD continue to integrate electronic health information.""
— State and Foreign Operations: ""The Committee remains concerned with cyber-attacks by Russia in Europe and Eurasia, including reported efforts to disrupt critical infrastructure in Ukraine and elsewhere,"" and seeks a report on improved cooperation with allies in the region, the State and Foreign Operations committee report states. The bill provides $10 million to strengthen allies' ability to fight cybercrime and protect intellectual property.
The committee blocks funding ""to support the use or establishment of email accounts or email servers created outside the .gov domain or not fitted for automated records management as part of a Federal government records management program in contravention of the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014."" It also directs the administration to notify Congress if he has ""credible information"" that a nation receiving U.S. aid has contributed to ""the malicious cyber-intrusion capability of the Government of North Korea."" Should the State Department begin a new IT project, the report says it must consider whether it improves the department's ability to withstand cyberattacks.
THAT’S A BIG UN — First American Financial Corp. left 885 million records exposed on its website, Krebs on Security reported late last weekend. The documents, related to mortgage deals going back to 2003, and include Social Security numbers, bank account numbers and drivers licenses images. “The company took immediate action to address the situation and shut down external access to the application,” First American said. “We are currently evaluating what effect, if any, this had on the security of customer information.” Krebs on Security found no evidence to suggest criminals harvested the data.
DE-SPICE-IFICATION — NSS Labs reached a settlement involving a pair of lawsuits with CrowdStrike and as part of that deal retracted a negative rating of the CrowdStrike’s Falcon security product. “NSS’s testing of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform was incomplete and the product was not properly configured with prevention capabilities enabled,” NSS wrote in an apology . “In addition to the results having already been acknowledged as partially incomplete, we now acknowledge they are not accurate and confirm that they do not meet our standards for publication.” CrowdStrike had sued NSS Labs over the rating, and NSS had sued CrowdStrike and other major cybersecurity companies in a lawsuit over an Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization protocol, but the settlement now excludes CrowdStrike from the second suit.

Driving the Day CISSNA OUT, CUCCINELLI IN: Cissna, who’d been hanging by a thread since early April, will depart this coming Saturday to make way for Cuccinelli II, the Washington Post’s Nick Miroff, Josh Dawsey and Maria Sacchetti report.
Cissna took a fairly hard line at USCIS, but Stephen Miller, the de facto White House immigration czar, wanted Cissna out; Cissna may have signed his own death warrant when, “in a conference call during a debate over asylum laws in 2018, Cissna said ‘Enough!’ to Miller, who he believed was pressuring government officials to ignore immigration laws,” according to Miroff, Dawsey and Sacchetti.
Cuccinelli, whose combative TV appearances endeared him to President Donald Trump, arrives with a truckload of baggage. As Virginia attorney general, Cuccinelli waged culture war more or less nonstop, at one point trying to resurrect the Old Dominion’s law against sodomy (years after the Supreme Court had ruled anti-sodomy laws unconstitutional). “Ken Cuccinelli is an outspoken immigration hawk,” observes Vox’s Dara Lind. (Example: He’s suggested that states assert war powers to counter undocumented immigration.) “But he’s not an immigration policy expert.”
Cuccinelli faces long odds on confirmation , because in addition to being opposed by Senate Democrats he’s “disliked by senior GOP figures, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . McConnell has vowed to block Cuccinelli from getting confirmed for any position, blaming him for leading a 2014 effort defying McConnell that promoted insurgent candidates running against sitting Republican incumbents. And Cuccinelli signed a letter drafted by conservative activists two years ago calling on McConnell to step aside.” More here from the Post and here from Vox.

COURT BLOCKS BORDER WALL FUNDING: “ A federal judge has partially blocked President Donald Trump’s plan to fund construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border,” POLITICO’S Josh Gerstein reports. “The preliminary injunction issued Friday immediately halts a $1 billion transfer of Pentagon counterdrug funding to cover expansions and enhancement of border barriers.”
“The court order also appears to jeopardize another $1.5 billion of the $8.1 billion the administration planned to use for border construction,” Gerstein writes. “However, Oakland, Calif.-based U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam’s order only limits construction in specific border areas in Texas and Arizona and does not prevent the administration from tapping other funding sources to advance those projects.”
Trump sounded off on Twitter during his visit to Japan, saying his administration would seek an “expedited appeal.” The president said the decision was made by an “activist Obama appointed judge” and that the decision favored “crime, drugs and human trafficking.” More here .
Movers and Shakers EPSTEIN VICTIMS WANT ACOSTA ON THE STAND: The victims of billionaire pedophile Epstein asked a federal judge to compel Acosta to appear before them in open court, the Miami Herald’s Julie K. Brown reports.
“The request for a hearing is one of a litany of possible remedies proffered by the victims, who have been waging a decade-long legal battle to put Epstein in prison for his crimes and to hold prosecutors — mainly Acosta — accountable for violating their rights,” Brown writes.
A federal judge ruled in February that Acosta violated the Crime Victims’ Right Act in 2008, when he was U.S. attorney for Florida’s southern district, by failing to disclose to Epstein’s victims the terms of a plea deal that resulted in Epstein serving only 13 months of an 18-month sentence, with daily furloughs to go to his office. More here .
Around the Agencies DOL TO CLOSE 9 JOBS CORPS CENTERS: DOL agreed to shutter nine Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers on Friday at the request of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, POLITICO’s Catherine Boudreau reports. “Perdue, in a letter to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, said the move will help the Forest Service prioritize its ‘core natural resource mission to improve the condition and resilience of our nation’s forests, and step away from activities and programs that are not essential to that core mission,’” Boudreau writes.
In a written statement , DOL said the remaining 16 Civilian Conservation Centers will be replaced by new contract operators or by a partnership overseen by DOL. (To be clear, Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers are a subset of all Job Corps centers, which number 131 in total.) The announcement added that the “new operators will implement new policies and approaches that will offer students the skills they need to earn an independent living and succeed in meaningful in-demand jobs.” More here .
Swamp Watch BROWNING-FERRIS GOES TO BAT FOR EMANUEL: NLRB Member William Emanuel should be permitted to participate in a joint employer case on remand from the D.C. Circuit, one of the plaintiffs said last week, arguing it is unclear that his work for a former law firm poses an actual conflict of interest, Law360 reports.
“According to Browning-Ferris Industries of California Inc.,” writes Law360, “Leadpoint Business Services Inc. — the party said to be represented by Emanuel's former firm Littler Mendelson PC — hadn't been part of its petition to review the NLRB's finding that it was a joint employer with Leadpoint. Littler didn't appear before the D.C. Circuit in the matter, and the firm's last filing on behalf of Leadpoint before the board in the case had been in November 2015, Browning-Ferris said Thursday.” Emanuel has recused himself from a variety of NLRB cases to avoid conflicts of interest, including last week’s high-profile decision barring a union vote at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn.
But it isn’t clear that Emanuel’s participation or non-participation in the Browning-Ferris remand matters much anymore, because the NLRB is already at work on a regulatory repeal of Browning-Ferris that it proposed in September. More here .
At the Border TRANSPORTING MIGRANTS: “The United States is for the first time sending illegal border-crossers to other cities for processing, transporting more than 3,000 each week from southern Texas and Arizona to other locations as the government struggles to deal with surging numbers of nearly 100,000 migrants a month crossing the southern border,” POLITICO’s Anita Kumar reports.
“The Trump administration is flying migrants to San Diego and Del Rio, Texas, and busing them to El Centro, Calif., and Laredo, Texas, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official familiar with the plan,” Kumar writes. “There, they are being processed — which includes photographs, health screenings, fingerprints and background checks — before they are often released and told to return for a court hearing at a later date.” More here .

The White House TRUMP PROPERTIES FIRE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS: Trump’s eponymous golf clubs are beginning to get rid of more undocumented workers after adopting E-Verify this year, The Washington Post’s Joshua Partlow and David A. Fahrenthold report. According to the Post, as many as 17 undocumented workers were recently let go at Trump’s course in Colts Neck, N.J. (although the Post could not independently verify all of them).
“The dismissals … show that the Trump Organization’s adoption of E-Verify has led to further shedding of workers, after the company had already purged about 20 undocumented workers this year,” Partlow and Fahrenthold write. “All 12 of Trump’s U.S. golf courses are now enrolled in the program, according to the government’s online database of E-Verify users; in December, only three were enrolled.” More here .

FRA decision on freight train crew sets off fight,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-transportation/2019/05/28/fra-decision-on-freight-train-crew-sets-off-fight-440660," Quick Fix — The FRA’s abandonment of a rule which would have required two man crews on freight trains has triggered debate between rail unions and their critics.
Story Continued Below
— DOT is moving forward with two rulemakings on automated vehicles, starting with collecting input from the public.
— Sam Graves (R-Mo.) , the top Republican on the House Transportation Committee, shot back at a Seattle Times story that was critical of his stance on the recent Boeing crashes.

“It won't be a stylish marriage, / I can't afford a carriage. / But you'll look sweet, / Upon the seat, / Of a bicycle made for two.”
Rail DEBATE RAGES OVER FREIGHT CREW SIZES: The FRA’s decision to abandon a rule that would have mandated two-person freight train crews has triggered a fight between rail workers unions and their critics (much of which has gone down in your host’s mentions. I’m not complaining, it’s interesting!).
SMART Transportation Division, an AFL-CIO affiliated union which represents rail workers, says the announcement will hurt safety, particularly because it preempts state laws on crew sizes. “President Donald Trump, DOT Secretary Elaine Chao and FRA Administrator Ron Batory have taken sides, and it's with the railroads that want to eliminate operating crew members to the detriment of rail safety,” said national legislative director of SMART John Risch. The union is considering legal action, he said.
But Marc Scribner, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that the original proposed rule was a “giveaway to railroad labor unions, who fear that future automation will make their members’ jobs redundant.” He claims that the argument for a two person train crew is part of a long history of protecting “featherbedding” or make-work jobs.
Automobiles DOT ADVANCING AV REG PROCESS: DOT is scheduled to publish two advanced notices of proposed rulemaking on autonomous vehicles Tuesday, our Tanya Snyder reports . One is from NHTSA, seeking comment on how to remove regulatory barriers to testing the crash avoidance features of automated driving systems in cars without manual controls. The other is from FMCSA, and asks for input about how to safely introduce automated trucks.
HAPPENING NEXT WEEK: A conference to seek public comment on vehicle-to-everything communications, Tanya writes. The June 3 meetup will aid DOT “in identifying areas of common ground that can assist deployers and investors in V2X technologies in advancing the use of the 5.9 GHz spectrum for traffic safety and congestion mitigation,” according to a Federal Register notice. The federal government has sent mixed signals lately about whether it plans to continue holding the 5.9 GHz band for the exclusive use of vehicle safety technologies.
TRUMP TAKES ON AVS: Trump talked self-driving cars during his trip to Japan over the weekend. “I guess self-driving cars are becoming a bigger and bigger thing. What do you think? Yeah? That’s the future,” he said. “If you say that’s the future, I’m OK with it. It seems very strange when you look over and there’s nobody behind a car going 60 miles an hour … but when you say it, I’m good with it.” Trump was praising Toyota for its investments in the U.S., including work with Uber on developing self-driving cars.
Aviation GRAVES HITS BACK: Graves took to Twitter Friday to criticize a Seattle Times story from earlier in May which he said had insulted him. The story, written by Dominic Gates on May 15, had delved into the question of pilot error in the recent Boeing 737 MAX crashes, which Graves has focused on as a possible cause. He’s said that pilots trained in the U.S. would have been able to prevent the crashes with basic training and stick-and-rudder skills, even without specific training on the anti-stall feature at the center of crash probes.
Gates’ story implies that Graves, a pilot with a commercial rating, was repeating talking points written by two U.S. pilots in a report commissioned by Boeing investors. But the House Republican has consistently focused on pilot error in his comments about the crashes, inclding immediately afterward.
The Times story does, however, note that two flight simulator sessions contradict Graves’ contention that better-trained pilots would have escaped the situation. And it Quote: s an unnamed veteran U.S. airline captain as being “disappointed” with the Republicans’ comments.
“My views that came under attack in a recent @seattletimes article by @dominicgates are based on my 38 yrs experience as a pilot, my review of accident reports & talks with gov’t official, pilots, engineers. To insinuate otherwise is wrong and insulting,” Graves wrote on Twitter. He said he wasn’t given the chance to comment, and shared an unpublished letter to the editor.
ADD ANOTHER INVESTIGATION TO THE PILE: The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a probe into how much Boeing told shareholders about problems with the 737 MAX, Bloomberg reported . The story says that the agency’s enforcement division is conducting the investigation, and that the agency is also looking at the company’s financial statements to ensure that they’ve appropriately reflected the potential impacts of the problems with the plane.
Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren took Boeing to task over the weekend as she was talking about the power of big corporations. “Boeing was self-inspecting its own planes,"" said the Massachusetts Democrat at an event in Iowa. ""How’d that work out?""
Regulations COMING SOON: Customs and Border Protection is aiming to issue a new rule expanding its use of facial scanners and other biometrics technology on foreign travelers later this summer, our Stephanie Beasley reported Friday. The interim final rule, expected in July, would allow CBP to expand its collection of foreign nationals' biometric information beyond the airports and other ports of entry currently participating in pilot programs, as well as extending the agency’s authority to use facial recognition.
In the auto world, DOT is proposing to move forward with a long-sought rule that would allow automakers to get rid of side mirrors, using cameras or interior screens instead. Other rules coming soon, Tanya reports , include a pilot program allowing states to conduct their own environmental assessments of infrastructure projects, proposals to revise trucking hours-of-service provisions, and more.
Infrastructure LINDSEY'S TAKE: Trump ally Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wants the president to push ahead with an infrastructure plan, and not let Democrats “goad” him into “not doing good things for the country.” Graham told ""Fox and Friends"" Friday that Trump “has got to do infrastructure."" It's yet to be determined whether the White House will push forward with an infrastructure plan after talks with Democrats broke down spectacularly last week, but given that Trump has signalled repeatedly that he wants Congress to take the lead on the issue, seems unlikely.

Avoiding a Democratic kiddie table debate,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-score/2019/05/28/avoiding-a-democratic-kiddie-table-debate-633066," Pro Campaign subscribers Quick Fix — The DNC and NBC News agreed on a rule that would evenly divide top-tier candidates in the first Democratic debates in June, hoping to avoid the prospect of an undercard debate.
Story Continued Below
— The NRSC and Senate Leadership Fund vowed to not work with any consultant who works with a primary challenger to a GOP senator.
— A crowded field of Democrats vying to face GOP Sen. Cory Gardner in Colorado — nearly a dozen in total — presents the party with a rare, wide-open primary in a high-profile Senate race.
Good Tuesday morning. Email
Days until the Mississippi gubernatorial primary election: 69
Days until the NC-03 and NC-09 general elections: 105
Days until the Louisiana gubernatorial primary election: 137
Days until the Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia general elections: 161
Days until the 2020 election: 525
TopLine THE DEBATE STAGE — Top-tier candidates will be randomly and evenly divided during the first Democratic debates on June 26 and June 27, avoiding the prospect that one night could have had a pileup of higher polling candidates.
""The final list of debate participants (after any tie-breaking procedure is executed, if necessary) will be divided into two groups: candidates with a polling average of 2 percent or above, and those with a polling average below 2%,"" the rule, which was first reported by me and Steve Shepard , reads. ""Both groups will be randomly divided between Wednesday night and Thursday night, thus ensuring that both groups are represented fairly on each night.”
Currently, just eight candidates poll above 2 percent and would make it into the first group: Joe Biden, Cory Booker , Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris , Amy Klobuchar , Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren . 19 total candidates have qualified (and Jay Inslee functionally secured his spot by hitting both thresholds on Friday, Daniel Strauss and I reported first).
One candidate whose not there yet? Sen. Michael Bennet . Nevertheless, he vowed to stay in the race through Iowa and New Hampshire, even if he ultimately doesn’t make the first debate stage. “I think we’re going to get there on polling and we’re working hard to try to get to the 65,000. It’s not easy,” he said in an interview with POLITICO’s Burgess Everett and Marianne LeVine . “It’s a challeng.e ... I haven’t spent the last 10 years of my life running for president and I haven’t spent the last 10 years on cable television.""
— But let's get ahead of ourselves, and start thinking about the qualifications for future debates. The debates in July have the same qualifications as the June debates, but future debates will likely have a higher threshold. “Conversations about the criteria are ongoing, but the DNC could add a paid staff requirement, in addition to raising the polling and fundraising benchmarks,” The Hill’s Jonathan Easley reported after interviewing DNC chief Tom Perez. ""We clearly have to adjust the thresholds, and if you look at history, that's what has happened over time,"" Perez told Easley. ""People have to demonstrate progress and those that do will stay on the debate stage. Those that don't, won't."" Perez also told Easley that the candidates, or someone from their camp, will be involved when the DNC randomly selects the June debate lineups.
Presidential Big Board THE CASH DASH — Buttigieg is pushing wealthy supporters to juice his campaign with a new bundling program. “Members at different levels of the program pledge to raise anywhere from $25,000 to $250,000 for Buttigieg over the course of the primary campaign and receive special perks,” POLITICO’s Maggie Severns reported. “Buttigieg is asking supporters who join the program to bring in half of their total fundraising commitment by the end of next month — the end of the current fundraising period, after which campaigns have to disclose how much money they have raised since April 1.”
— With roughly a month to go before the next big FEC filing deadline, presidential campaigns are running ads on Facebook to try to attract small dollar donors. Pros can read my weekly Facebook ad roundup for more .
PROFESSIONALIZING IT — Scrappy upstart no more: Sanders’ campaign has all the trappings of a top-tier candidate, a change of pace from 2016. “Sanders is making dozens of calls each week to elected officials, labor leaders and party chiefs, according to his aides. In between his rallies, he regularly meets with politicians behind closed doors,” POLITICO’s Holly Otterbein reported . “All of that is standard fare for a top-tier presidential campaign, but it represents a major shift for Sanders. His willingness to step up his efforts to win institutional support is the latest sign that he recognizes that shunning the Democratic establishment might work for a long-shot outsider campaign, but won’t cut it if he truly wants to win the nomination.”
HEARD, NOT SEEN — Biden has run a “limited-exposure campaign,” The Washington Post’s Annie Linskey and Chelsea Janes wrote. “Aside from a campaign swing right after announcing his candidacy, Biden has kept his head down while his rivals rush from state to state to state. Even when he has held public events, they have included only a handful of questions from voters or reporters.”
BACK IN THE RING — Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is hoping her long standing support abortion rights will propel her struggling presidential campaign. “I do know that I’m a voice for all women in this country, and that my leadership on these issues matter,” Gillibrand said in Iowa, per POLITICO’s Elena Schneider . “Maybe more supporters will notice that, and that I’ve been working on it for the last decade.”
STAFFING UP — The majority of senior staffers on “top-tier” campaigns are women, The Wall Street Journal’s Joshua Jamerson reported.
Down the Ballot FOOD FIGHT — Senate Republicans are taking a page out of the DCCC’s book, pledging to blackball any consulting firm that works for a primary challenger. “It is a zero tolerance policy and we will not work with any vendors who work for campaigns or outside groups challenging incumbent Republican senators,” Kevin McLaughlin, the NRSC executive director, said in a statement, per POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt . SLF also said in a statement it would do the same thing, while a spokesman for GOP megadonors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson said the duo “stands by Thom Tillis .”
THE MAP LINES — The Supreme Court stayed two lower court rulings that would’ve required congressional maps to be redrawn in Michigan and Ohio while it prepares to rule on if partisan gerrymandering is constitutional. “The twin orders on Friday afternoon included no dissents, though a majority is required for the justices to grant a stay of a lower-court ruling,” Steve wrote . “GOP-led legislatures in both states had anticipated the Supreme Court action and had made few moves toward redrawing their congressional maps thus far.”
TOO MANY COOKS? — Democrats have nearly a dozen candidates trying to challenge Gardner, with about half of them being serious candidates. That’s a change of pace from the past, where national Democrats would try to coalesce around one candidate. “But that tactic backfired in recent years, when well-known former elected officials blew winnable races in battleground states,” POLITICO’s James Arkin and Burgess reported. “So in Colorado, Democrats are opting for a hands-off approach, allowing the primary to play out and hoping someone emerges from a crop of young, mostly untested candidates who is capable of knocking out a skilled GOP incumbent. They're confident that Gardner is beatable no matter who wins or how bloody the primary is.”
NC-09 FOREVER — Leigh Brown, the Republican who finished a distance fourth in the NC-09 GOP primary earlier this month, said she felt abandoned by national Republicans who encouraged her to run, including New York Rep. Elise Stefanik ’s group. “That's a little frustrating to have initial conversations and then follow up and be ghosted,” Brown told POLITICO’s Laura Barrón-López and Melanie Zanona . “I put my real estate business on hold. I've dinged my own reputation in order to put myself forward as a public servant, and then you find out exactly how lonely it is to run for office.”
WHAT!? — Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) told an audience that “he’s guilty of the same behavior that led to Navy SEAL Chief Eddie Gallagher being charged with war crimes — posing with a dead combatant,” the Times of San Diego’s Ken Stone reported. “Eddie did one bad thing that I’m guilty of too — taking a picture of the body and saying something stupid,” Hunter said at a forum.
CODA — FACT OF THE DAY: Republican candidates and campaign committees have spent more than $4 million at Trump properties since his inauguration, per The Hill .

A recent instruction from the Trump administration ordering immediate implementation caught some states flat-footed.
 The anti-vaccine movement is targeting school policies , arguing that the government has no right to force parents to vaccinate their kids before they enter school.

Driving the Day CHANGING INSTRUCTIONS: States are attempting to comply with an Obama-era rule aimed at tackling disparities in special education after the Trump administration changed course and said states must do so immediately. Last year, the Education Department told states it was pausing implementation of the rule known as “significant disproportionality” by two years.
— Still, the issue is far from resolved . A court fight over the rule continues and the Trump administration hasn’t ruled out the possibility it will propose a new regulation entirely.

K-12 SCHOOL VACCINATION POLICIES TARGETED BY ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT: The argument that the government has no right to force parents to vaccinate their kids before they enter school is a new one among individuals opposed to vaccines — and there are signs it’s gaining steam.
— While Trump administration health officials and most Republicans in Congress still back mandatory vaccination, opposition is growing among Republicans in state legislatures. Among some of these officials, this libertarian demand for medical freedom has displaced the traditional GOP view that it’s a civic responsibility to immunize your kids to prevent the spread of disease.
— In states where legislators have advanced serious efforts to tighten restrictions, such as Maine, Washington, Colorado and Oregon, nearly all of the opponents are Republicans who’ve taken a medical freedom stance. Read more from Arthur Allen in POLITICO.

School Choice TENNESSEE GOVERNOR SIGNS TRUMP-BACKED SCHOOL CHOICE BILL: School choice advocates were applauding after Republican Gov. Bill Lee on Friday signed legislation that creates a new education savings account program that families in select Tennessee counties can tap into to pay for private school tuition and other education expenses.
— Passage represents a big win for supporters of education savings accounts. Tennessee already had a separate education savings account program, but it targets families of students with special needs. According to the school choice group EdChoice, six states have education savings account programs, but Nevada’s is inactive.
— Trump urged passage of the bill , and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was on the ground encouraging more school choice measures in the state. Lee signed the bill despite stiff opposition from Democrats.
— Meanwhile, in Arizona, lawmakers have sent to GOP Gov. Doug Ducey’s desk legislation that would allow Navajo children in the state to use funds from Arizona’s education savings account program to continue to attend a private school in New Mexico. Read more from The Associated Press.
— Both measures were backed by DeVos’ former school choice group, the American Federation for Children.
Higher Education SPOTLIGHT ON TEXAS’ AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM: Texas has long been a key battleground in the ongoing fight over the future of affirmative action in higher education. Under the state’s top 10 percent plan implemented in 1998, about 10 percent of the top students from each of the state’s high schools is automatically accepted in state-funded universities. After that, administrators employ what they consider a “holistic” admissions process, which takes race into account “only as one factor among many.”
— But what about Texas’ high schools? Looking at two decades of data, researchers have determined that the hope that the policy would increase the range of high schools that sent students to the state’s flagship universities was not fulfilled.
— “At least in the case of the Texas Top 10% Plan, the guarantee of admission to the top 10 percent of their high school class neither changed the group of high schools that sent students to the Texas flagships nor maintained racial diversity that kept up with the changing demographics of the state,” Daniel Klasik, a professor at George Washington University who conducted the work with Kalena Cortes at Texas A&M University, tells Morning Education.
— This study was presented last month at the AERA 2019 Annual Meeting in Toronto.
— Recently, the group Students for Fair Admissions led by longtime anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, re-filed a lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin in Texas state court, alleging the school's use of race violates the state’s constitution. In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled the plan was constitutional following a challenge by the same group.

"Trump, Abe to ‘accelerate’ trade talks",www.politico.com,politico.com,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2019/05/28/trump-abe-to-accelerate-trade-talks-440650,"With help from Megan Cassella Editor’s Story Continued Below
— President Donald Trump today wraps up a four-day trip to Japan with optimism that both sides are making “great progress” in trade talks and hopes that a deal will be reached “very, very soon.” But it’s likely talks won’t heat up until after a July election in Tokyo.
— The newly revived U.S. Export-Import Bank could be at the center of a battle between the White House and conservative Republicans as administration officials look to strengthen the trade-finance agency to rival China’s export credit agencies.
— Trump’s Huawei crackdown could hurt small wireless providers in rural parts of the country that are already suffering from the blowback of his trade agenda. And the Chinese telecom giant is using it as a pressure point to soften the restrictions.
IT'S TUESDAY, MAY 28! never imagined she’d see a story tying free tacos al pastor and Huawei. But here it is . Got any trade tips to start off this post-Memorial Day week? Let me know: srodriguez@politico.com or @sabrod123 .
Driving the Day TRUMP, ABE TO ‘ACCELERATE’ TRADE TALKS: Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe indicated on Monday that the U.S. and Japan will speed up trade talks as Tokyo faces increased pressure to reach a deal in the next six months to avoid auto tariffs.
“We should achieve early outcome based upon the trustful relationship between our two nations. We shall accelerate the pace of discussion. We agreed on that,” Abe said in a joint press conference with Trump.
“We hope to have even more to announce on the trade very, very soon,” Trump added.
Trump also hinted that an announcement on “some things” tied to trade could come in August. However, Abe did not specify that was the timeline in mind.
One caveat: Trump made clear earlier in the weekend that much of the trade negotiations will not take place until after Japan’s House of Councillors election in July.
What was accomplished: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer joined Trump on the trip, in the biggest sign that trade would be a central topic of discussion. Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Saturday following a sit-down with Lighthizer that both sides still have differences to work through, Reuters reported . But they both agreed to try to reach a deal quickly, Motegi said.
U.S. agricultural goods, particularly beef, are “heavily in play” in the negotiations, Trump posted on Twitter. A deal with Japan could bode well for American farmers struggling with the effects of Trump’s trade agenda and who are on the outside looking in after the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Elephant in the room: Earlier this month, Trump proclaimed imported autos are a threat to U.S. national security and delayed a decision to slap tariffs on autos for six months to give time for negotiations with Japan.
Abe was directly asked whether Trump gave any assurance that he will not impose tariffs on cars in six months, to which Trump said: “I want to hear his answer too.” Abe only noted that Motegi and Lighthizer are discussing the subject and reiterated that he’s agreed to accelerate talks.
A look inside Abe’s thinking: Abe has become known for courting the president with golf and grand dinners — and this trip was no different . But to understand why Abe — who rose to power as a nationalist — has chosen a charm offensive, it’s important to understand the insecurity that has arisen in Japan in the face of expanding regional powers like China.
Government officials and academics told POLITICO’s Michael Crowley that Abe will do what he must to ensure he maintains a strong U.S.-Japan alliance. More here .
TRUMP: ‘NOT READY’ TO MAKE CHINA DEAL: Trump once again said he’s in no rush to wrap up trade negotiations with Beijing, despite the chance of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, from June 28-29. “We're not ready to make a deal,” Trump said at press conference with Abe. “But I think, sometime in the future, China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal.”
CANADA TAKES MINI STEP ON USMCA WHILE TRUMP PROJECTS OPTIMISM: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government on Monday introduced a procedural motion to start consideration of the new North American trade pact in Canada’s House of Commons. Adoption of the motion is necessary before Canada can vote to ratify USMCA, the timing of which Canadian officials are still weighing. Vice President Mike Pence heads to Ottawa later this week to update the Canadians on the Trump administration’s efforts to get the deal through Congress.
Trying for peace? Trump on Monday backtracked from his comments last week that he won’t work with Democrats until they drop their investigations of him, saying USMCA can still be a bright spot in his legislative agenda.
“I think that we will work with them. We have a USMCA. We have a deal with Canada and Mexico that everybody wants, I think. It's all done. And I think they probably want to be doing that,” Trump said Monday in Japan.
“I would imagine that Nancy Pelosi will approve that,” he added of the speaker, whom he insulted last week and whose support he needs to get a USMCA vote in the House. “I would think it would be very hard not to, but we'll see,” Trump added.
EX-IM BANK’S CHALLENGES AREN’T OVER: Trump administration officials view the Export-Import Bank — which now can approval deals worth more than $10 million — as a valuable weapon in the U.S. trade arsenal, especially in the face of heightened tensions with China. But conservative Republicans on the Hill don’t agree, and that could again threaten the export credit agency.
The bank could shut down after Sept. 30 if Congress does not approve a new reauthorization bill. Meanwhile, calls are increasing for Ex-Im to receive more resources to better rival Chinese competitors, which have financed tens of billions of dollars in new projects around the world.
Some experts and officials say Congress should make Ex-Im’s credit exposure cap — currently $135 billion — three to four times larger. But the White House declined to say if Trump would support a big increase in the bank’s credit exposure cap. Doug Palmer has more .
HUAWEI BLACKLIST COULD DEAL ANOTHER BLOW TO TRUMP COUNTRY: The effects of the Trump administration’s recent decision to ban companies from doing business with Huawei could fall hardest on a sector of the economy that has already been reeling from trade tensions: American agriculture.
The decision to put the Chinese telecom giant on a trade blacklist is causing panic among small wireless providers, many of whom are in rural areas that have already borne the brunt of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like soybeans and pork. And while farmers have so far continued to stand by the White House, growing anxiety has led the administration to devote tens of billions to direct payments to ag producers.
Paging middle America: Huawei has made inroads over the years selling network equipment to providers in remote and rural parts of the United States. Wireless company filings with the FCC indicate Huawei gear has gone into networks in states like Missouri, Wyoming, Kansas and Montana.
While the administration has for now put in place a 90-day reprieve for doing some types of business with the company, a full ban remains a possibility. And if imposed, it would mean many smaller operators would be forced to invest in replacing Huawei equipment with more expensive alternatives. POLITICO’s John Hendel has the story here .

Quick Fix — President Donald Trump is becoming the sole defender of North Korea’s recent missile launches, saying he doesn’t believe they violated a U.N. resolution.

— The acting defense secretary takes off today for a week-long trip to Asia.
— The White House is again invoking an emergency to go around Congress, this time fast-tracking weapons sales to Middle Eastern countries.
HAPPY TUESDAY
North Korea ALONE AGAIN, NATURALLY: It wasn’t all selfies and sumo wrestling during Trump’s four-day visit to Japan. Despite words of caution from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Republicans in Congress and even national security adviser John Bolton, Trump continues to brush off North Korea’s missile launches, reports POLITICO’s Anita Kumar.
Toward the end of his visit on Monday , Trump said he’s “very happy with the way it’s going,” after Abe said the firing of the short-range missiles was “quite a regrettable act” and was in violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution.
“My people think it could have been a violation,” Trump countered. “I view it differently.”
And on Saturday, Trump tweeted: “North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me.”
North Korea, by the way , called Bolton a “war monger” and “human defect,” for saying North Korea’s launches violated the resolution, The Associated Press reports .
“Bolton told reporters in Tokyo on Saturday that there was ‘no doubt’ that North Korea’s recent missile launches violated U.N. resolutions, and that sanctions against the North must be kept in place.”
Iran WEAPONS TO THE MIDDLE EAST: Members of Congress reacted angrily Friday after the Trump administration announced it was declaring an emergency situation in the Middle East in order to fast-track arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE without congressional consent, per your Morning D anchor.
The decision covers 22 pending transfers of munitions, aircraft parts and other supplies ""to deter Iranian aggression and build partner self-defense capacity,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. ""These sales will support our allies, enhance Middle East stability, and help these nations to deter and defend themselves from the Islamic Republic of Iran.""
""There is no new ‘emergency’ reason to sell bombs to the Saudis to drop in Yemen, and doing so only perpetuates the humanitarian crisis there,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn). ""This sets an incredibly dangerous precedent that future presidents can use to sell weapons without a check from Congress.""
You can see details on the weapons sales, all dated May 24, here .
AND TROOPS TO THE MIDDLE EAST: The Pentagon on Friday announced new deployments of about 900 personnel as tensions increase with Iran, your Morning D anchor writes .
Trump and acting Shanahan said 1,500 will be deployed, but it’s actually only 900. The tours of another 600 troops already in the region are being extended.
ABE COULD HELP: During a joint news conference on Monday, Trump said he was open to Abe acting as a go-between for Washington and Tehran.
“In this context, in order to make contribution for the peace and stability of the region, we would like to discharge whatever we can do,” Abe said. “So whatever it is possible for Japan to do, we absolutely would like to do this going forward.”
Navy FULL STEAM AHEAD: Trump on Tuesday visited the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp at Yokosuka, Japan, and brought up his favorite Navy issue.
“And I won’t tell you this because it’s before my time by a little bit, but they have a $900 million cost overrun on this crazy electric catapult. I said, ‘What was wrong with steam?’”
Trump polled the audience aboard the ship — which does not use catapults to launch aircraft — on whether they preferred steam catapults or the new Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System installed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford. Most shouted steam. When one person shouted “electric,” Trump joked that “he works for the enemy.”
“I’m going to just put out an order: We’re going to use steam. We don’t need — we don’t need that extra speed. You know, they were saying — one of the folks said, ‘No, the electric works faster. But, sir, we can only get the plane there every couple of minutes.’ So, really, what they did was wrong.
“And we make mistakes, but, generally speaking, we get it right. But when we make them, we have to correct it. So we’re going to put out an order: We want to use steam.”
Note: Trump has been making this claim for two years now, and the Navy has either declined to comment or"

Quick Fix Story Continued Below
— A climate change-focused Democratic debate is gaining traction on the campaign trail and elsewhere in the party, with nearly two dozen Democratic lawmakers adding their support in interviews with POLITICO last week.
— EPA scientists expressed significant concerns with the agency's decision to exempt areas of Wisconsin from smog limits, according to new emails reported by The New York Times.
— A federal judge partially blocked the president's border wall plan in a lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition.
WELCOME TO TUESDAY! Hope everyone had a relaxing holiday break. Bracewell's Frank Maisano knew that in 1868, Gen. John Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, first designated May 30 as Memorial Day. For today: Which former House Budget chairman also served in a total of four Cabinet-level and White House positions? DEBATE TEAM: Support is growing for a presidential debate focused primarily on climate change as Democrats seek to differentiate themselves on an issue that is a top priority for the party's voters. At least five presidential candidates have endorsed the idea first proposed by Gov. Jay Inslee, and nearly two dozen Democratic lawmakers endorsed the idea in interviews last week, Pro's Anthony Adragna reports.
A climate-focused debate may force Democrats to confront disagreements over thorny issues like the role of natural gas and nuclear power in combating climate change, although some moderates say they are eager to see a wider discussion of the issue that has so far been dominated by the left.
""I actually think the politics has been pretty clouded of the Republicans portrayal of the Green New Deal as every Democrat's solution,"" said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), a member of the more centrist New Democrat Coalition who has not yet endorsed a presidential candidate. ""I think the planet would be better served if we had an honest discussion about what Democrats are really talking about.""
The Democratic National Committee is non-committal on the idea . And some lawmakers told Anthony they're concerned it would only reinforce internal Democratic divisions. ""If you're going to try to get everybody [united], you need to be talking about all the things that people care about,"" said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.). Read more .
By the way: The DNC and NBC News recently adopted a rule to evenly divide top-tier candidates across two nights in the first Democratic presidential primary debates in June. Democrats getting at least 2 percent support in the polling average will be randomly and evenly split between the two nights, which will each feature 10 candidates, POLITICO's Zach Montellaro and Steven Shepard report .
Around the Agencies OFF ROADING: The Interior Department said in a court filing Friday it will appeal a judge's ruling that blocked the land swap that allowed the department to build an access road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, Pro's Alex Guillén reports . A judge previously ruled in March that Interior failed to explain why it had reversed course on the policy after the Obama administration rejected the road. Interior said Friday it will appeal that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.
EMAILS: STAFFERS OBJECTED TO EPA'S SMOG MOVE: New emails show EPA scientists raised objections to last year's move by former Administrator Scott Pruitt to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog, The New York Times reports . Pruitt's decision in the spring of 2018 was a reversal from EPA's own earlier recommendation, and came at the same time then-Republican Gov. Scott Walker was campaigning on promises to bring a planned $10 billion Foxconn factory to the area where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.
Hundreds of emails and internal documents released Friday to the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin under the Freedom of Information Act show agency scientists complained ""that conclusions in support of the decision, which could not be supported by data, were being demanded by top Trump administration officials,"" the Times reports.
""I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,"" Jennifer Liljegren, an EPA physical scientist, wrote in an email dated April 11, 2018. ""I will need the wordsmithing of the legal and policy experts if we are really going to do this — I am still in disbelief.""
— The Times also reported this weekend on the Trump administration's efforts to undermine the science on which climate change policy rests across federal agencies. Most recently, the shift has been evident at the United States Geological Survey, where James Reilly has ordered scientific assessments use only computer-generated climate models that project the impact of climate change through 2040, instead of through the end of the century.

TO THE NORTH: Energy Undersecretary Mark Menezes and other senior Energy Department officials headed to Vancouver on Monday for the Clean Energy and Mission Innovation ministerials, bringing together energy ministers from more than 20 countries ""to accelerate progress toward a clean energy future.""
U.S. officials will hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the event to discuss ""advancement of clean energy through technology and innovation globally,"" according to DOE. Side events today will focus on nuclear energy and energy storage, according to the agenda .
Beyond the Beltway JUDGE HALTS BORDER WALL AFTER GREENS SUE: A federal judge partially blocked President Donald Trump's plan to fund construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border Friday, issuing a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition that immediately halts a $1 billion transfer of Pentagon counterdrug funding to cover expansions and enhancement of border barriers. But the order only limits construction in specific border areas in Texas and Arizona and does not prevent the administration from tapping other funding sources to advance those projects, POLITICO's Josh Gerstein reports .
NEW REPORT EXAMINES 2050 PATHS: The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions will release today the results of a year-long effort with the RAND Corporation and the University of Maryland's Joint Global Change Research Institute to look at the potential pathways for decarbonizing the U.S. economy by 2050.
The report outlines three different scenarios for reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050 — one where there is ""strong international pressure"" in the form of carbon tariffs; another where U.S. states implement ambitious climate policies; and one where ""increased urbanization, generational shifts, and technological breakthroughs lead to strong market demand for low-carbon consumption products and services.""
""The individual scenarios are interesting, but what's most valuable are the insights you draw as you construct them and as you look across them,"" said C2ES President Bob Perciasepe, a former EPA deputy administrator, in a statement. ""One of my key takeaways is that companies understand the urgency and magnitude of this challenge and are committed to working with others to deliver durable solutions."" Read the report .
2020 Watch KLOBUCHAR PROMISES 'OVERHAUL' OF RFS WAIVERS: Sen. Amy Klobuchar , long a proponent of the Renewable Fuel Standard, promised over the weekend to make substantial changes in how the program issues exemptions to small refiners, calling EPA's current program ""misguided."" Klobuchar, who is making a swing through Iowa, also said she would seek a legislative change to allow year-round sale of 15 percent ethanol fuel, a move that failed to advance out of committee last Congress.

Pelosi video prompts bipartisan outrage,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2019/05/28/pelosi-video-prompts-bipartisan-outrage-440651,"With help from Alex Panetta, John Hendel and Margaret Harding McGill. Story Continued Below
— Pelosi video engulfs Facebook: The doctored video of the House speaker is fueling already heated debates about election security, disinformation and tech’s liability shield.
— Plus, Canada v. Facebook: An expected Zuckerberg-Sandberg no show in the Canadian Parliament has lawmakers there contemplating a contempt vote.
— Rural telecoms seek Huawei exit : Small wireless providers say a must-pass defense bill could be the ticket as they seek funding to replace Chinese equipment.
BACK TO WORK, BEACH BUMS! IT’S TUESDAY; WELCOME TO MORNING TECH. Get ready for a sweaty, swampy week — we’re all about to have several consecutive bad hair days.
Tech of the Town FACEBOOK’S PELOSI PROBLEM — Outrage over the doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — and Facebook’s decision not to remove it — shows no sign of dying down. The speaker’s daughter, Christine Pelosi, took to Twitter on Sunday to demand an end to Facebook’s legal immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And tech journalist Kara Swisher, in a Sunday op-ed in The New York Times, accused Facebook of “abrogating its responsibility as the key distributor of news on the planet” and said 230 has become “a shield to protect behemoths from any sensible rules.”
— ‘Sad omen’: Lawmakers of both parties are calling the Pelosi video a wakeup call. Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), speaking on CBS’ “ Face the Nation ,” warned that disinformation campaigns are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. “This wasn’t even a deepfake,” Hurd said. “Soon, I think within months, we’re going to be able to see this deepfake technology continue to grow … and we’re not prepared.” Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the Homeland Security committee, described the Pelosi video and other doctored content as a “sad omen of what is to come in the 2020 election season.” He added: “It is also time for social media companies to act responsibly after they were caught flat footed in 2016. They are on notice. The American people know the integrity of our democracy is at stake, and that it's time to act.”
OVER IN THE STATES — Nearly all of the nation’s state attorneys general are urging congressional leaders to amend Section 230 to give them more power to prosecute illegal activity online. They call the 2018 carveout for sex trafficking a start but say much more needs to be done. “The abuse on these platforms does not stop at sex trafficking,” they write. “Stories of online black market opioid sales, ID theft, deep fakes, election meddling, and foreign intrusion are now ubiquitous.” Read the full letter here .
AND, FACEBOOK GHOSTS CANADA — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg will defy a summons to appear today at a hearing of Canada’s House of Commons ethics committee, according to multiple reports . The company will instead send Kevin Chan, head of public policy for Facebook Canada, and Neil Potts, its director of public policy. Committee chair Bob Zimmer, a Conservative lawmaker, previously told POLITICO Pro Canada’s Alex Panetta that he wanted the top execs there to discuss privacy violations. He said if they don't show, “the committee has signaled that they would move a motion to hold them in contempt of Parliament. That means the entire 338 MPs vote on it in the House of Commons.”
— How this plays out : It’s still up to the ethics committee to decide whether to pursue a contempt motion. Such motions could, in theory, carry a prison sentence — though such a penalty is almost never imposed. But Zimmer said it could cause a reputational hit: “It would be a public spectacle.”
— Darkening views: Canadian policy makers sound increasingly frustrated with the tech giants. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a Paris speech this month that “people are losing trust in digital institutions.” Canada’s innovation minister called for “ clear, meaningful penalties ” for violating laws and regulations as he outlined data policy priorities last week.
RURAL TELECOMS PIN HOPES ON DEFENSE BILL — Small telecom companies seeking federal assistance to replace equipment from China’s Huawei have a new target: the National Defense Authorization Act. The must-pass defense policy bill is expected to advance this summer and may become a vehicle for the rural funding push. “The NDAA is going to be critical,” Carri Bennet, general counsel of the Rural Wireless Association, told John. As POLITICO has reported , the Commerce Department’s decision to blacklist Huawei is causing panic among small wireless providers, many of them in Trump-friendly parts of the country, which have Huawei gear in their networks and say they’ll face big costs to rip it out and replace it.
— Keep your eye on S. 1625 (116) , from Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and others that would slate $700 million to help these companies. Bennet said that number will fall short (she estimates her own group’s members need $800 million to $1 billion, prompting her to wonder, “Do they know something we don’t?”) but said it’s a good launching off point. A summary of the Senate’s NDAA effort already lists 5G investment as a priority.
REDO ON RETRANS? — Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) continues to negotiate with GOP Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) to overhaul the regulatory system that allows broadcasters to be paid when their content goes to cable and satellite (a system known as retransmission consent). “We’re working,” Eshoo told John. “The whole issue of retrans is something that both Mr. Scalise and I have had a longtime interest in, and so it goes back more than one Congress.” She added she hopes to have a bill ready by next week’s hearing on the media marketplace led by Energy and Commerce telecom subcommittee chair Mike Doyle (D-Pa.).

Business investment slowed by 1.3 percent over the 12-month period ending in April, the smallest gain since the end of President Obama’s second term.
Story Continued Below
The bull case for the Trump economy holds that the tax cuts on business will unleash a sustained capital expenditure boom that will drive 3 percent growth for the next few years. That does not appear to be happening, hence downgrades of second quarter growth prospects to the sub-2 percent range.
The trade battle with China is obviously having an impact , raising pressure on Trump to get a deal. Per Reuters: “Data on Thursday showed a measure of factory activity hit an almost 10-year low in May.”
Far right gains in Europe — The center-right European People's Party hung on to power in European Union elections over the weekend but will have a smaller plurality as voters rewarded far-right populists, Liberals and Greens. Turnout surged over 50 percent for the first time in 25 years.
Per our David Herszenhorn : “While voter turnout was a bright spot for the Brussels establishment, any celebration was tempered by the steep losses for the mainstream center-right and center-left parties that have led the EU since its founding. … Gains by the far right suggest the bloc will continue to struggle with a populist insurgency for years to come.” Results graphic.

MORE ON MARKETS — Wedbush’s Steve Massocca emails on a stock market that has traded water for nearly a year and a half: “I think the more it appears we are in a longer rather than shorter trade war that will be bad for the market (although significantly worse for Asian exchanges as we have seen).
“What fuels this trade war, politically, are good economic numbers and the market relative to Nov ’16, all still very positive. However, if those items become jeopardized then Trump might have political issues with continuing the war. Also Trump has to face voters in 2020, whereas Xi just points a tank at you if you complain.”
THE TRUMP CONUNDRUM — Steve Rattner in the NYT : “In its present state, the economy will … be helpful to the president. All told, Mr. Trump’s vote share would ordinarily be as high as 56.1 percent. But that’s before factoring in his personality. As recent polls show, if the election were today, he would lose to most of the Democratic hopefuls by a substantial margin; in the case of Joe Biden, by nearly eight percentage points.”
MM sidebar: You’ll recall that MM wrote a few weeks back about economic-political models suggesting Trump SHOULD win handily in 2020. But if anyone can bust these models, it’s Trump.
HUAWEI CEO DEFIANT — “In an interview with Bloomberg Television , the billionaire founder of China’s largest technology company conceded that Trump administration export curbs will cut into a two-year lead Huawei had painstakingly built over rivals like Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj. But the company will either ramp up its own chip supply or find alternatives to keep its edge in smartphones and 5G.”
FED SEAT UPDATE — Cap Alpha’s Ian Katz: “Reported candidates so far include Judy Shelton, a conservative economist and former adviser to the Trump campaign who told the Wall Street Journal that she would like to see ‘more market-determined rates.’ Paul Winfree, a former Trump domestic policy adviser who’s now at the Heritage Foundation, has also reportedly been under consideration.
“And Bloomberg has reported that Derek Kan, an undersecretary at the Transportation Department, is in the mix. Even if the White House officializes a nomination soon, which isn’t at all certain, the confirmation process would probably take months. We don’t see any new board members getting confirmed until at least the fall.”
WHY BUSTING UP FACEBOOK WOULD BE HARD — Our Margaret Harding McGill and Steven Overly: “The idea of breaking up Facebook is gaining attention like never before — from the campaigns of presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to the stunning proposal from Chris Hughes, one of the social network's cofounders, to split the company apart to curb its ‘monopoly’ power.
“But busting up the nation’s tech giants would be much harder than making a campaign pledge. Corporate breakups are a huge, and rare, undertaking for the government, and a social media company like Facebook presents unique challenges that didn't exist with past antitrust successes like the dismembering of AT&T in the 1980s.” Read more .

“Corporate news also supported markets. Shares in Fiat Chrysler and Renault jumped over 10 percent each after the Italian-American company on Monday proposed a merger with the French rival. The deal would create the world’s third-biggest automaker and save billions needed to invest in the race to make new electric and autonomous vehicles.” Read more .
WHY MARKETS MAY BE WRONG TO RELY ON TRUMP, POWELL PUTS — Bloomberg’s Chris Anstey: “While the consensus of investors and stock strategists remains that the U.S. and China will reach a deal that ends the escalation in trade restrictions between the world’s two largest economies, a vocal minority has been warning about woeful over-optimism
“One of those Cassandras has been James McCormick, global head of strategy at NatWest Markets in London, who’s been monitoring markets for the better part of three decades.

Deere & Co., CNH Industrial NV and other makers of the tractors and combines used to plant and harvest American crops are already facing weak demand from farmers as a result of a five-year slump in the agricultural economy.
“That downturn is worsening this year as China buys less soybeans and other crops from the U.S., and manufacturers pay more for the steel and other materials they import to build their machines. … During the first three months of 2019, U.S. agricultural exports to China were 40% below the same period last year” Read more .

The opaque process is coming under renewed scrutiny given Mr. Draghi’s dominant role in Europe’s economic recovery since he assumed office nearly eight years ago.” Read more .
THE COST OF THE U.S.-CHINA TRADE WAR — Bloomberg’s Ben Holland and Cedric Sam: “Bloomberg economists Dan Hanson and Tom Orlik have mapped out the main scenarios. Their headline conclusion: If tariffs expand to cover all U.S.-China trade, and markets slump in response, global GDP will take a $600 billion hit in 2021, the year of peak impact.” Read more.
BAIR ON BAILOUTS — Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair in WaPo: “While these massive bailouts were intended to help the real economy, they worked primarily to the benefit of Wall Street. They may have kept the financial system sputtering along, but the rationale — that bailing out the financial sector would help everyone else — didn’t materialize. Rather than making big bailouts the norm, we should work to make sure that they never happen again. They were a terrible idea — a feat we should not repeat.” Read more .

Democrats will call up the bill during this afternoon’s pro forma session, though it's unclear which Republican lawmaker — if any — will make the trek to D.C. to halt the bill, according to multiple aides. The bill, which includes long-overdue aid to nearly a dozen states, already easily cleared the Senate last week. But a lone objector in the House — Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) — held up passage on the other side of the Capitol by demanding an official roll call tally. Roy is back in Texas today, his office confirmed to us, and won’t be around to halt proceedings this time. Still, most aides expect another Republican, possibly one of Roy’s colleagues in the Freedom Caucus, to appear in the chamber today. If Republicans block the bill today, Democrats could try again at the next pro forma on Thursday. Democratic summary of the bill here .

IN COLORADO, TOO MANY COOKS: Sen. Cory Gardner might just be the most vulnerable Republican on the ballot in 2020. But Colorado Democrats are staring down a field of nearly a dozen young, mostly untested candidates that, so far, hasn’t revealed a frontrunner.
This time, D.C. Democrats won’t pick sides , opting instead for a hands-off approach they hope will produce a battle-hardened candidate who can pick up this must-win seat. It’s a gamble though, because a dragged-out, costly primary could end up weakening the nominee in the real fight against Gardner. More from James Arkin and Burgess. https://politi.co/2QuCiM5

JUDGE INTERJECTS ON BORDER WALL: A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the White House from diverting Pentagon dollars toward a border wall without Congress’s approval. In the late Friday ruling, District Judge Haywood Gilliam cited Congress’s control over spending, “even when that control may frustrate the desires of the executive branch.”
Gilliam is overseeing two cases related to the Trump administration’s attempt to circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency at the border. This one was filed by the Sierra Club and a coalition of immigration advocacy groups. More from the Los Angeles Times’ Tony Barboza: https://lat.ms/2I2SaSj

DUNCAN HUNTER ADMITS POSING WITH DEAD ENEMY: Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) told a town hall in his district that he once posed for a photo with a slain man in combat when he was a U.S. Marine, according to the Times of San Diego. Hunter, who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, was speaking in defense of former Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, who has been accused of multiple war crimes, including killing civilians. Gallagher also posed for a photo holding up the head of a teenage fighter he’d killed.
“Eddie did one bad thing that I’m guilty of too — taking a picture of the body and saying something stupid,” Hunter said. Hunter said he’d taken pictures “just like that when I was overseas” and added that “a lot of my peers” had done the same. More context from Washington Post's Eli Rosenberg: https://wapo.st/2JItdyY.

So-so on state returns — Gold Star next steps — States get moving,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2019/05/28/so-so-on-state-returns-gold-star-next-steps-states-get-moving-440649," Quick Fix — House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) doesn’t sound keen on trying to obtain President Donald Trump’s state tax returns, an ability he would have under a measure likely to become law in New York.
 The Senate’s next steps on the retirement legislation that includes a key fix to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act aren’t totally clear.
— Big states doing big tax things: On the red side, the Texas legislature just passed a big property tax overhaul. From the blue side, Illinois just approved a constitutional amendment potentially paving the way for a progressive income tax.
WELCOME TO an abbreviated week of Morning Tax, where we hope everyone had a good holiday.
The way way back machine: It was on this date back in 585 BCE that a solar eclipse predicted by the Greek scientist Thales led to a truce in a longstanding conflict between the Lydians and Medes — an event that has both helped calculate other important dates, and still raises questions about how it actually went down.
We have questions about how all the tax news is going down. Send us tips.
 EH, WE’LL SEE: New York lawmakers passed that measure, at least in part, so that Democrats would have another avenue to get some insight on Trump’s finances while the president keeps fighting Neal’s efforts to obtain six years’ worth of his federal returns — and as that fight appears destined for federal court.
But Neal doesn’t seem too convinced that the window that could be soon offered by New York is worth looking into, as The Hill’s Naomi Jagoda reported — comparing that measure and his push to get Trump’s federal returns via his powers under the Revenue Act of 1924 as “green apples and red apples.”
“The difficulty is that we don’t have control over state taxes,” Neal said, noting that “for the moment, we’re still proceeding on our own path.”
WHAT’S NEXT? On the question of next steps for the House retirement package, H.R. 1994 (116) , that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) blocked before Congress broke for Memorial Day, the answer Senate aides gave on Monday was essentially “don’t know.” The retirement bill would roll back all of the changes the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115) , made to the so-called Kiddie Tax, which has caused problems most controversially for children receiving survivor benefits because a service member parent died on duty. Cruz wouldn’t let the measure pass because the House took out a provision expanding tax advantaged 529 accounts to include homeschooling costs.
Cruz is no stranger to lonely legislative fights, and he’s also a longtime supporter of homeschooling. And while the Senate could choose to spend floor time on the retirement measure, Cruz will likely be under a good deal of pressure to enact a fix for Gold Star families as soon as possible. (That is certainly one of the reasons that only three House Republicans voted against the retirement bill, despite plenty of anger on that side of the Capitol about how Democrats handled the 529 measure.) For his part, Cruz also noted to CNN that he was a co-sponsor of S. 1370 (116) , an already passed Senate measure that more narrowly targets the TCJA’s tax increase for Gold Star families.
NOT SURE ABOUT THIS: The tension was real between Trump and Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe on trade, The Associated Press reported, despite the two leaders’ best efforts to keep it below the surface. Trump and Abe agreed to press ahead with trade talks, even as the president continues to hold the threat of auto tariffs over Japan and complained on the trip of the United States' “unbelievably large” trade deficit with Japan.
At the same time, the Japanese government is worried about a range of indicators, including exports, and its second downgrade of economic expectations just this year led to increased speculation that Abe might press the brakes on this fall’s planned sales tax increase. Bloomberg noted that a quarter of the economists it surveyed believed the newest downgrade could push Japan to do just that, amid what it also called global growth struggles and rising trade tensions.
 JOIN THE CLUB: South Africa this Saturday will become the latest country to put a carbon tax into place , after President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the new levy into law over the weekend. The tax was about nine years in the making, Reuters reports, noting that mining, steel and electricity interests in one of Africa’s largest polluters had successfully delayed the carbon levy at least three times since 2010. At the same time, Climate Action Tracker dubbed South Africa’s carbon tax, which will be implemented in a couple shifts, “wholly insufficient.” The first phase will run until the end of 2022, with a second phase scheduled to last from 2023 to 2030.

Around the Nation JUST MADE IT: Texas Republicans muscled through a sweeping revamp of the state’s property tax system just before lawmakers called it quits until 2021, The Texas Tribune reports. The bill, which Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign, would allow cities and counties to raise property taxes by 3.5 percent or more only if voters approve. (A separate cap would affect school districts.) Only existing properties would count toward that calculation. Currently, voters can petition for a referendum to stop a property tax district from raising 8 percent more in revenue than the previous year. The legislation would also create an online database to allow homeowners to track how much more their property tax bill would be under proposed rate changes.
But wait, there’s more: Texas lawmakers passed a bill on Friday that would cap the sales tax that can be charged when purchasing a yacht, and the savings would be pretty substantial — some $60,000 on a boat worth $1 million, The Houston Chronicle reports. A Democratic backer of the bill said the measure was aimed at boosting the Texas boating industry, which he said had taken a beating since Florida capped the sales tax on yachts back in 2010.
TAKE IT AWAY, VOTERS: The Illinois House approved the constitutional amendment to allow a progressive income tax, which cleared the state Senate at the start of the month, with only a couple votes to spare, the AP reported. (The vote was 73-44, but the measure required a supermajority.) Gov. J.B. Pritzker, himself a billionaire, has repeatedly said that 97 percent of state residents would see no changes in their income taxes under a new graduated system, which would only affect people making at least $250,000 a year and which his administration says would raise some $3 billion a year.
Voters are now set to take up the issue next November. And as Bloomberg noted, the income tax push comes as Illinois faces steep budget deficits and the lowest credit rating of any U.S. state.

Facebook’s Zuckerberg faces summons after ditching hearing,www.politico.com,ALEXANDER PANETTA,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/canada-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-1475782,"Global frustration with Facebook was laid bare during an international hearing in Canada on Tuesday as lawmakers from several countries blasted top executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg for ducking a request to appear at the session.
Lawmakers were so peeved by the no-show that a panel in Canada's House of Commons took the rare step of approving an open-ended summons for the duo: Next time either Zuckerberg or Sandberg set foot in Canada, they will be required to appear before a parliamentary committee with jurisdiction over tech issues. If they don't, Canadian lawmakers are threatening a vote to hold them in contempt of Parliament.
""I am sick to death of sitting through hours of platitudes from Facebook and avoidance tactics,"" said United Kingdom MP Jo Stevens , one of many foreign lawmakers who attended the hearing. ""I want the boss here to take responsibility.""
Stevens bemoaned that Tuesday was the second time Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder, chairman and CEO, brushed off an invitation to appear before a legislative body, after he had failed to attend a parliamentary hearing in London late last year.
""He wouldn’t come to answer our questions in London at our Parliament, so we have come across the Atlantic to make it easier for him,"" Stevens added. ""And we can only conclude he is frightened of scrutiny.""
Facebook in recent years has angered world leaders around the globe, who have criticized the company for seeming to dodge responsibility for its role in the economic, social, and political destabilization that social media platforms have caused — all the while, piling up billions of dollars in profits.
Lawmakers from nearly a dozen countries used Tuesday's forum in Ottawa to press tech companies about privacy violations, hate speech, and the spread of misinformation.
The Canadian hosts earlier this month had requested that Zuckerberg and Sandberg, Facebook's COO, attend the hearing. But the company instead sent two senior executives in their place.
“It’s abhorrent that he's not here today and Ms. Sandberg is not here today,” said Bob Zimmer, a Canadian Conservative MP who chairs the Commons committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, which hosted the session. The panel approved issuing an open-ended summons for the duo without objection.
“As soon as they step foot … into our country, they will be served and expected to appear before our committee,"" Zimmer added.
He emphasized that if Zuckerberg or Sandberg come to Canada and ignore the summons to appear before lawmakers, the next move would be a vote on a motion to hold the duo in contempt of Canada's Parliament. If the motion were to pass, jail time could be the result, though that penalty has not been applied in recent memory.
Zimmer's displeasure was shared by numerous members of Parliament from Canada's other political parties.
Charlie Angus, a member of the left-wing New Democratic Party who presented Tuesday's motion to serve the Facebook executives with an open-ended summons, said he was unaware of a previous example of Canadian lawmakers taking such a step.
Angus said he used to believe tech companies could regulate themselves, but has since lost faith. “I’m a recovering digital Utopian,"" he said.
Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, a member of Canada's governing Liberal Party, ridiculed Zuckerberg's recent op-ed in the Washington Post in which he promised to talk to lawmakers about Facebook's efforts to safeguard data.
“If he was an honest individual writing those words, he’d be sitting in that chair,” Erskine-Smith said.
Lawmakers from Singapore, Germany, Estonia, Morocco, Chile and Ecuador, among other countries, also took part in Tuesday's hearing .
The two Facebook executives who did show up — one based in Canada, the other in the U.S. — defended the company and promised to comply with new ethics standards and to collaborate in the development of future ones around the world.
""We actually do go over and above the law,"" Kevin Chan, head of public policy at Facebook Canada, said during one heated exchange.
But Tuesday's hearing was the latest indication that anger with Facebook could soon eclipse the company's ability to control it.
French President Emmanuel Macron has been critical of Facebook and other tech giants for, among other perceived failings, the amount of taxes it pays in Europe . Macron has launched a ""Tech for Good"" initiative , and his administration has placed regulators inside Facebook to monitor how the company works to combat hate speech. Macron and Zuckerberg met in early May to discuss that effort.
After video of a massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, circulated on Facebook, the country's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said ""it’s critical that technology platforms like Facebook are not perverted as a tool for terrorism, and instead become part of a global solution to countering extremism.”
Macron and Ardern have since teamed up to issue a ""Christchurch Call"" aimed at preventing violent extremist and terrorist content from being circulating online. (Facebook has backed that initiative.)
U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has also criticized Facebook and other social media companies for not doing enough to stop online bullying and harassment . Last month, when the U.K. rolled out proposed new laws that would force those firms to take steps to combat harmful content, the prime minister said that ""online companies must start taking responsibility for their platforms, and help restore public trust in this technology.""
As harsh as the rhetoric around Facebook can be in the United States, the company still enjoys a certain amount of domestic deference as an American success story. But leaders outside of the U.S. often treat the firm as an unwelcome import.
Beyond America's borders, Facebook lacks the lobbying expertise it has built up in its home country, and often finds itself struggling to navigate local political landscapes, loyalties and alignments.
In a sign of potential trouble ahead for the company, lawmakers heard Tuesday from prominent tech critics, including Roger McNamee , an early investor and adviser to Facebook and author of the book “Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.”
McNamee said hate speech and conspiracy theories are central to the algorithms at the heart of Facebook's business model, despite the potential for that kind of content to undermine democracy. He urged lawmakers to take drastic steps to address the problem and to consider deploying their ultimate response: shutting down social media platforms that fail to take adequate countermeasures, and allowing new competitors to take root.
Barring such action, he urged lawmakers to ban web tracking, scanning of email and documents, and third-party commerce in data, and argued for micro-targeted ads to be taxed to make them economically unattractive.
“If your goals are to protect democracy and personal liberty, you have to be bold,"" McNamee added. ""You have to force a radical transformation of the business model of internet platforms."""
Avenatti pleads not guilty to defrauding Stormy Daniels,www.politico.com,LOUIS NELSON,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/michael-avenatti-not-guilty-stormy-daniels-1345499,"NEW YORK — The pugilistic and embattled attorney Michael Avenatti pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he defrauded his most famous client, porn star Stormy Daniels.
Avenatti barely spoke during his 10-minute appearance before a federal judge in New York, except to answer a few brief procedural questions. His lawyer entered the plea on his behalf on charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.
Story Continued Below
Bail was set at $300,000. Avenatti, who surrendered to federal authorities in the early morning, agreed to have no contact with Daniels while the case is pending.
Later Tuesday, Avenatti is scheduled to appear before two more judges, including one handling separate charges that Avenatti tried to extort millions of dollars from Nike, the sportswear company.
Avenatti rose to fame representing Daniels in her battle to be released from a nondisclosure deal she’d signed regarding an alleged affair with President Donald Trump. He made scores of appearances on cable news shows criticizing the president, who has denied that an affair occurred.
Avenatti was indicted last week on charges that he cheated Daniels out of $300,000 she was owed for her book, “Full Disclosure,” which was published in October.
According to the indictment, Avenatti emailed a letter — purportedly from Daniels — to her literary agent with instructions that payments from her $800,000 book deal should be deposited into an account he controlled. Prosecutors say Daniels never authorized the letter and was unaware of it.
Avenatti then used the money to pay business and personal expenses, including the costs of hotels, airfare, dry cleaning and his Ferrari, the indictment said.
The charges related to Daniels are the third criminal case brought against Avenatti.
In late March, charges against Avenatti were announced on the same day in New York and Los Angeles.
In New York, he was charged with trying to extort up to $25 million from Nike by threatening to expose claims that the company paid the families of high school basketball players to get them to attend Nike-sponsored colleges.
In Los Angeles, he was charged with stealing millions of dollars from clients, including much of the $4 million owed to a paralyzed man, along with dodging taxes, defrauding banks and lying during bankruptcy proceedings. When the charges were enhanced last month, federal authorities seized a private jet Avenatti co-owned.
Avenatti has repeatedly asserted that he is not guilty.
If convicted, he faces a potentially long prison sentence as the charges carry the potential for hundreds of years in penalties."
How Kamala Harris would protect abortion rights,www.politico.com,ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/how-sen-kamala-harris-would-protect-abortion-rights-1476696,"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Tuesday unveiled a broad platform to protect abortion rights that's modeled on the Voting Rights Act, arguing that strict new abortion bans passed in states including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri demonstrate the need for more federal guardrails. The plan depends, however, on a Congress highly favorable to abortion rights.
What would the plan do?
Harris would require states that have demonstrated a pattern of abridging abortion rights to seek preclearance from the Justice Department before enacting any new laws affecting access to abortion. Those laws would be legally unenforceable without preclearance from the federal agency.
Preclearance would only be granted to laws that do not violate either Roe vs. Wade or the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill in Congress Harris has co-sponsored that would bans states from interfering with the ability of a health care provider to offer abortion services or interfering with the ability of a patient to access an abortion.
How would it work?
Harris' proposal replicates the model of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which made states with a history of voter suppression run their new voting laws by the Justice Department for preclearance before they could go into effect.
Harris argues that even though the Supreme Court struck down the formula at the heart of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, rendering the enforcement mechanism toothless, her plan would be upheld because it's based on states' abortion rights records over the previous quarter century. A series of federal court rulings against a state's state abortion restrictions would land it in the preclearance category. The formula for determining which states need preclearance would also be periodically reviewed and updated.
The current situation puts the onus on abortion rights advocates to sue to block state restrictions one by one. Under Harris' plan, the onus would instead be on states to prove to the Justice Department that each new law does not violate the standards set by Roe and the Women's Health Protection Act.
What are the weaknesses in the proposal? Harris' plan depends on electing a Congress favorable to abortion rights, which is far from a given. Democrats face a difficult Senate map in 2020 and have struggled to recruit strong candidates in a number of key states. To pass Harris' proposals, Democrats would have to flip more seats than are needed to win a bare majority, since a handful of moderate caucus members, including Sens. Bob Casey and Joe Manchin, are unlikely to support them.
Additionally, the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to the Voting Rights Act's preclearance formula — and that was before President Donald Trump expanded the court's conservative majority. Even with more updated criteria, there is no guarantee a similar system for abortion rights would not meet the same fate at the high court.
Finally, the Justice Department's willingness to grant states clearance to pass abortion restrictions could vary widely based on the president and administration in power. Harris' plan notes that there will be ""guardrails, such as public determinations and requiring reviews"" that would ""ensure DOJ enforces the law even under an administration that’s hostile to women’s rights"" but does not specify how those mechanisms would work. Still, the plan notes that either patients or doctors would have standing to sue if the Justice Department does not fully enforce the law.
What have other Democrats proposed? Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) released a pledge earlier this week to repeal the Hyde amendment barring federal funding for abortions, enshrine Roe v. Wade 's protections into federal law, make federal funding available to ensure access to abortion in every state and only nominate federal judges committed to upholding Roe .
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has also promised to work for the passage of a law that guarantees legal abortion nationwide, repeal the Hyde amendment and undo the Trump administration's rule allowing employers to opt out of providing insurance coverage for contraception.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a plan , that would need congressional approval, to block states from enacting abortion restrictions and to repeal the Hyde amendment. She would also roll back the Trump administration's Title X rule that cut funding to Planned Parenthood.
Who would it help? Harris' plan would guarantee abortion access to the tens of millions of women in the 18 states that would ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is struck down by the Supreme Court, and to millions more women in other states that have attempted to pass abortion restrictions of various kinds over the last couple decades.
Who opposes it? Conservative lawmakers, anti-abortion advocacy groups and officials in states that have passed abortion restrictions would certainly challenge this plan as an excessive federal intrusion into local matters."
Amash accuses Barr of selling Trump's 'false narrative',www.politico.com,QUINT FORGEY,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/amash-william-barr-false-narrative-1345523,"Rep. Justin Amash, who earlier this month became the first Republican member of Congress to call for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, took aim at Attorney on Tuesday — charging that the nation’s top law enforcement officer has “used his position to sell the president's false narrative to the American people.”
In a 25-post Twitter spree , the Michigan lawmaker accused Barr of having “deliberately misrepresented” the findings of Robert Mueller’s investigation in a March 24 letter to Congress summarizing the special counsel’s findings.
Amash wrote online Tuesday that Barr’s letter “selectively Quote: s and summarizes points in Mueller’s report in misleading ways,” and asserted that “the public and Congress were misled” as a result of the attorney general’s initial four-page summary.
Amash admonished Barr for not complying with Mueller’s request — articulated in a March 27 letter from the special counsel to the attorney general — to release the introductions and executive summaries of Mueller’s report.
The congressman also blasted the head of the Justice Department for subsequently testifying before lawmakers that he was not aware of dissatisfaction among members of Mueller’s team with his handling of the report’s rollout.
“Barr has so far successfully used his position to sell the president’s false narrative to the American people,” Amash tweeted . “This will continue if those who have read the report do not start pushing back on his misrepresentations and share the truth.”
Amash on May 18 joined with many national Democrats in calling for Trump’s removal from office, writing online in a series of tweets that the president “has engaged in impeachable conduct.”
The conservative House Freedom Caucus, of which Amash is a founding member, formally condemned him last Monday for the stance.
Amash took to Twitter again last week for another multi-message streak that invoked the president, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, McGahn, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
“Mueller’s report describes a consistent effort by the president to use his office to obstruct or otherwise corruptly impede the Russian election interference investigation because it put his interests at risk,” Amash wrote online Thursday.
“Some of the president’s actions were inherently corrupt,” he added . “Other actions were corrupt — and therefore impeachable — because the president took them to serve his own interests.”
Barr has launched his own investigation to explore the origins of the FBI‘s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and Trump last week granted him sweeping new powers to make classified documents public.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Amash‘s tweets Tuesday ."
Biden aide rips Trump's overseas insults - POLITICO,www.politico.com,msn.com,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/joe-biden-donald-trump-insults-1345826,"Joe Biden's team fired back at President Donald Trump for insulting the former vice president while on foreign travel, saying Trump's endorsement of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's put-down of Biden is “beneath the dignity of the office.”
""To be on foreign soil, on Memorial Day, and to side repeatedly with a murderous dictator against a fellow American and former Vice President speaks for itself,” Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement timed within minutes of Trump’s return to the White House.
Story Continued Below
Biden and Kim engaged in a war of words over the past week, with Kim calling the former vice president and 2020 Democratic frontrunner “a fool of low IQ” in an article published by North Korea’s state-run news service.
In the midst of a state visit to Japan, Trump fired off a tweet siding with Kim’s assessment of Biden's intelligence. Trump wrote that he “smiled when [Kim] called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse,” spelling Biden’s name wrong initially before correcting himself. “Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?” he asked.
Trump’s hot-and-cold relationship with the North Korean dictator has trended warmer since the pair met for the first time last summer to discuss denuclearization in the communist country. His latest comments — which came over Memorial Day weekend — departed from precedent that presidents leave domestic political tiffs at home while traveling abroad and were condemned even by members of Trump’s own party along with Biden's fellow Democrats.
Trump's Biden barbs were coupled with a downplaying of North Korea's recent missile tests, which broke with concerns expressed by his national security adviser and Japanese leaders.
He later underscored his alignment with Kim in a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that,” Trump declared.
Bedingfield lambasted Trump‘s remarks as “part of a pattern of embracing autocrats at the expense of our institutions — whether taking [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s word at face value in Helsinki or exchanging ‘love letters‘ with Kim Jong Un.”
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) also admonished the president on Tuesday for his friendly relationship with the two strongmen.
“One thing I will say on that,“ Hoyer responded when asked about Trump‘s most recent attack on Biden. “It appears that Mr. Trump has had two major campaign advisers: Mr. Putin in the last election, and Kim Jong Un in this election.“
Trump has shown an outsize willingness to criticize Biden more than any other Democrat running for president. His advisers have protested his jabs at Biden, urging him to stay out of the Democratic primary and to avoid looking threatened by the former vice president.
A Biden campaign official said the delayed timing of the statement, the campaign's first official response, was intentional because Biden wanted to respect “the sacred purpose of Memorial Day, remembering those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.”
Trump‘s 2020 messaging chief swatted back at Biden‘s camp later Tuesday, accusing the former vice president of hypocrisy following remarks he made in February at the annual Munich Security Conference.
“That’s rich coming from Joe Biden, who bashed President Trump while standing on foreign soil earlier this year in Germany,“ tweeted Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Trump‘s reelection campaign.
In that speech to international leaders, Biden — who had not yet announced his presidential candidacy — criticized the Trump administration‘s immigration and trade policies, and lamented to the audience “the struggle for America's soul.“

“We will set the pace for this nation right here,” he added.
But de Blasio, who launched his longshot bid for the White House earlier this month, waited five years to back the idea. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams introduced the legislation in early 2014, when he was a member of the City Council, and the mayor didn’t tout it until his State of the City speech this year as he was mulling whether to run for president.
Asked about the delay, de Blasio said his pro-worker agenda needed to be spaced out over time, beginning with an expansion of mandated paid sick days in 2014, when he first took office, and an affordable housing plan two years later.
“One of the things that is a real dynamic in government is you move an aggressive agenda but you still have to sequence that agenda,” he said. “Now, having gotten all those other powerful changes and reforms, it was time to move to this.”
There isn’t much de Blasio has to do other than sign the bill, which had its first hearing Tuesday in City Hall.
“Time off is not a luxury; it is a necessity, one that many don’t have,” Williams said at the rally, ahead of the Council hearing on the bill. “The environment is right to get this done.”
He said only about half of low-wage workers in New York receive paid personal time off, compared to about 90 percent of higher-wage employees.
The bill applies to private employers with at least five workers and would cover full-time and part-time staff. It mirrors the scope of the city’s paid sick days law.
Employees would begin to earn one hour of paid personal time for every 30 hours worked immediately after starting a new job. They would eventually get 80 hours off — two weeks for full-time workers — that they could access after 90 days of employment, according to a bill summary provided by Williams’ staff.
Unused time would be carried over to the following year, and employers could require up to two weeks before staff takes leave.
De Blasio said nearly 1 million New Yorkers do not have any paid vacation time.
Maurina James, a domestic worker of 25 years, spoke at the rally, saying she was unable to take time off while caring for other people’s children.
“Over the years, I grew tired and resentful,” she said. “I could never take a break without leaving pay. I had to choose between attending a PTA meeting and getting a full salary.”
Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, said the bill would negatively impact small business owners.
“[It] is a great goal. But the reality is you see vacant storefronts in every single neighborhood, small business owners are very challenged right now and we should be talking about what we can do to help them,” he said. “Help them stay open, create jobs, create good jobs — not talking about another mandate that’s going to be funded 100 percent by small business owners.”"
Cuomo open to sports betting talks with Legislature,www.politico.com,nniedzwiadek@politico.com (Nick Niedzwiadek),05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/05/28/cuomo-open-to-sports-betting-talks-with-legislature-1030138,"Continue to article content
The Cuomo administration continues to have concerns that authorizing casinos and other operators to offer sports wagers outside of a physical gambling hall would violate the state constitution’s general prohibition on gambling and would necessitate a constitutional amendment | JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images Cuomo open to sports betting talks with Legislature
ALBANY — Gov. Andrew Cuomo cracked open the door on a proposal to expand sports betting outside the confines of brick-and-mortar casinos during a radio interview on Tuesday.
“It’s possible,” Cuomo told WAMC radio host Alan Chartock before adding that there's a litany of other pressing issues to take up before the legislative term ends in June.
“The time is short and the list is long, so I would counsel the legislative leaders to get the priorities done, because these priorities are not easy.”
The Cuomo administration continues to have concerns that authorizing casinos and other operators to offer sports wagers outside of a physical gambling hall would violate the state constitution’s general prohibition on gambling and would necessitate a constitutional amendment. Legalization proponents fear that doing so would leave New York behind states like New Jersey because of the time it takes to get a constitutional amendment passed.
“Our position on constitutional concerns has not changed, but we remain in discussions with the Legislature,” Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement.
A Senate committee earlier this month advanced an amended version of NY S17 (19R) to allow online sports betting for the state’s commercial and tribal casinos. The revised bill, however, does not allow for racinos, OTBs or horse race tracks to offer such wagers, which has upset those industries but was an attempt to assuage previous constitutional concerns.
The upper chamber passed a sports betting bill last year only to run aground in the state Assembly.
The state Gaming Commission is working on regulations that would allow the four upstate casinos, and those on tribal land, to offer sports betting at their facilities, but supporters of the legislation say that New York would miss out on the vast majority of the potential market if bettors are forced to travel to gamble in person, rather closer to where they live."

Acosta and his staff have been losing these decisions so often that they’ve stopped bothering to appeal, said current and former DOL officials.

"Cancer patients, survivors advocate for bill to end non-medical vaccine exemptions",www.politico.com,aeisenberg@politico.com (Amanda Eisenberg),05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/05/28/cancer-patients-survivors-advocate-for-bill-to-end-non-medical-exemptions-1030216,"Dinowitz said Tuesday he will know by the end of the week if the legislation makes it to the June 3 agenda. | Getty Images Cancer patients, survivors advocate for bill to end non-medical vaccine exemptions
A group of young New Yorkers either in treatment for cancer or in remission called on the state Legislature Tuesday to pass a long-stalled bill to end non-medical exemptions for vaccinations amid a seven-monthslong measles outbreak.
People with compromised immune systems — who can't be immunized — rely on their communities to get vaccinated for preventable, highly contagious diseases like measles and whooping cough. Without a law that ends non-medical exemptions, those who spoke during a news conference in Manhattan said they are at an increased risk of catching a disease like measles and lack a strong immune system needed to fight it off.
“We don’t deserve to be punished. We didn’t do anything wrong,” Teela Wyman, a 26-year-old law student and stage 4 lymphoma survivor, said through tears, with a yellow mask covering her nose and mouth. “This is such a small thing. These diseases are preventable. The tradeoff between not giving kids vaccines and giving them vaccines is the difference between us being able to be normal people and live normal lives and not be afraid of dying because somebody went and sneezed on one of us.”
The bill has stalled in the Assembly health committee and Senate Democrats so far don’t have the appetite to pass it alone. However, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he supports a bill to end the non-medical exemptions.
“This is a public health crisis and it’s worse in New York than any other state,” Cuomo told WNYC’s Brian Lehrer. “And I think we should pass a bill. You have a right to your religious beliefs, you don’t have a right to infect my child.”
Michael Singh, a stay-at-home dad from Queens Village, said Tuesday his son King “could basically die from picking up something that is preventable.”
The 5-year-old has two blood conditions and needs to be schooled at home to avoid catching a cold or a more serious disease; his 1-year-old and 3-year-old siblings cannot attend day care or school because it could be detrimental to King, the boy's father said.
“I don’t want to get the measles,” said the 5-year-old, who already suffered from leukoencephalopathy, or brain swelling — a condition measles can also trigger.
“We’re just petrified of the measles because we don’t know what the hospitalization would be for that, and the cost of it too,” Singh said. “It’s hard for a parent to homeschool their child … especially with the current outbreak. We don’t want to take that chance.”
Toby Pannone, a 15-year-old Brooklynite who underwent treatment at age 3 for neuroblastoma — a form of cancer mostly affecting children — said neighbors have a responsibility to each other.
“Being a member of a community means having certain rules and limitations. We have speed limits, and we wear seatbelts so that everyone can be safe and healthy,” Pannone said. “Another rule should be a requirement to get vaccinated, because vaccines don’t just protect you, they protect everyone around you.”
Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz (D-Bronx) told POLITICO last week that he asked Assembly Chairman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan) to put the bill on the agenda for the panel’s next meeting, which will take place next week.
Dinowitz said Tuesday he will know by the end of the week if the legislation makes it to the June 3 agenda.
“Whooping cough, measles, so many diseases don’t have to happen in the 21st century,” he said, his voice rising. “We have to do everything we can to keep people safe, and one way to do that is to make sure that when children go to school, they are not going to be exposed to diseases, some of which we thought were eradicated years ago.”"
Iran-linked campaign impersonated GOP midterm candidates online -,www.politico.com,TIM STARKS,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/iran-fake-accounts-facebook-twitter-1479189,"Facebook and Twitter said Tuesday that they have pulled down a network of accounts spreading disinformation that originated in Iran, including some accounts that impersonated 2018 Republican congressional candidates.
Acting on a tip from cybersecurity company FireEye, Facebook said it removed 51 bogus Facebook accounts, 36 pages followed by 21,000 users, seven groups joined by 1,900 users and three Instagram accounts followed by 2,600 people. Twitter said it removed 2,800 accounts.
The revelations from the cybersecurity firm and Facebook's actions serve as a reminder that other governments and foreign adversaries are taking a page from the Russian playbook that disrupted election.
It appears that at least in some cases the Iranian campaign used the fake accounts to distribute anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian messages.
""In addition to utilizing fake American personas that espoused both progressive and conservative political stances, some accounts impersonated real American individuals, including a handful of Republican political candidates that ran for House of Representatives seats in 2018,"" FireEye wrote in a blog post.
Among the candidates impersonated on Twitter were Marla Livengood, who lost in the 9th district of California to Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.), and Jineea Butler, a 2018 candidate who lost her race for New York’s 13th district to Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.).
The Iranian campaign also succeeded in tricking U.S. and Israeli publications into publishing fake letters to the editor and blogs, according to the report.
""Personas in this network have also had material published in U.S. and Israeli media outlets, attempted to lobby journalists to cover specific topics, and appear to have orchestrated audio and video interviews with U.S. and UK-based individuals on political issues,"" the firm said.
While FireEye said the accounts promoted Iranian interests, it didn't tie them to a group it blamed for another disinformation campaign last year.
Facebook was more explicit in its statement about the disinformation campaign.
""We conducted an internal investigation into suspected Iran-linked coordinated inauthentic behavior and identified this activity,"" the company said in a blog post. ""We’ve shared our analysis with law enforcement, policymakers and industry partners.""
Twitter, however, voiced displeasure with FireEye, while noting it was still investigating.
FireEye ""has issued a report and chosen not to share information or insights with Twitter prior to publication, which is outside standard, responsible industry norms,"" a company spokesperson said. ""Responsible disclosure should include notification and information sharing to protect against informing bad actors. Going public without these elements harms the credibility of the security research community, whose insights we support and appreciate.""
But one of the affected campaigns feels like Twitter should have done more to remove the fake accounts.
""A strident opponent of nuclear weapons in Iran, Marla is shocked that Twitter was either unwilling, disinterested or too inept to protect users from obvious false information,"" Scott Winn, a consultant for the Livengood campaign, said in a statement to POLITICO. ""Twitter users deserve better.""

Biden dominates Dem rivals in new early primary polls -,www.politico.com,MARC CAPUTO,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/joe-biden-polls-2020-1345827,"Joe Biden is dominating the entire field of Democratic opponents in two key early states, according to new polls that show his lead is even bigger in targeted head-to-head matchups against other high-ranking candidates.
The two polls of likely Democratic primary voters, completed last week by Tel Opinion Research, a Florida-based firm, show the former vice president with a 21-percentage point lead over the second-place candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, in New Hampshire and an even bigger Biden lead over him of 27 points in South Carolina .
Most other candidates polled in the single digits or didn't register at all. Unlike most public polls, respondents were asked an open-ended question about which candidate they preferred, and were not read a full list of the roughly two-dozen Democrats running for the nomination.
But that doesn't mean Biden's big lead is solely a function of name recognition. In head-to-head matchups between the top two vote-getters, Biden’s lead grew to 55 points over Sanders in South Carolina and 44 points in New Hampshire — a state that the neighboring Vermont senator won in his insurgent 2016 bid against Hillary Clinton.
The surveys also showed that Biden’s name ID of nearly 100 percent among likely voters in both states was nearly as high as that of the other candidates, who were recognized by at 8 in 10 voters or more. Biden, however, was better-liked by voters in both state polls.
Taken together, the results could indicate that Biden might have more staying power in the Democratic primary, even though the race is in its early stages.
“What this shows is Joe Biden has a lot more strength behind his candidacy than just name ID because voters know who the other candidates are, too,” said Ryan Tyson, a Florida -based pollster who typically surveys for Republicans and conducted the poll on behalf of a nonprofit business group called Let’s Preserve the American Dream.
“Biden’s current lead in these surveys is not just because there are so many people in the race,” Tyson said. “He’s not just winning in the open-ballot test with a crowded field of candidates. He’s crushing the others in the head-to-heads.”
In the New Hampshire head-to-head matchups, Biden’s 66 percent to 22 percent lead over Sanders was larger than his 58 percent to 29 percent advantage over Elizabeth Warren, who represents neighboring Massachusetts as a senator.
Biden led Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, 63 percent to 21 percent.
In the South Carolina head-to-heads, Biden leads all three of his main rivals by 52 points or more: 70 percent to 15 percent lead over Sanders, 71 percent to 10 percent advantage over Buttigieg and 67 percent to 15 percent over Warren.
The results of Tel Opinion polls resemble other surveys in the two primary states, but the polling method differs in some cases. Tel Opinion had larger samples than many — 600 in South Carolina and New Hampshire each, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points — and respondents were randomly called off a list of voters who had cast ballots in one of three previous primaries in each state. They were then asked if they said they were likely to vote in next year's primary.
The New Hampshire poll was conducted May 20-22, and the South Carolina poll was conducted May 22-24.
In the open-ended ballot test in South Carolina, Biden received 37 percent support to Sanders’ 10 percent, followed by Warren (8 percent), California Sen. Kamala Harris (7 percent), Buttigieg (3 percent) and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2 percent), with 32 percent unsure. In New Hampshire, Biden led the field with 33 percent support, to Sanders’ 12 percent and Warren’s 11 percent, followed by Buttigieg (7 percent) and Harris (7 percent) with 28 percent unsure.
These are the first early state primary polls by Tel Opinion, which has polled extensively and successfully in Florida in recent years. Before polling South Carolina and New Hampshire, Tel Opinion surveyed Florida —which has a later primary, on March 17 — and found that Biden had a gargantuan lead in the nation’s largest swing state as well, pulling 39 percent of the vote in the crowded field with Sanders in a distant second at 16 percent.
In all the polls, Biden leads the others in every category of voter: young, middle-aged, old, white, black, male, female, well-educated and less-educated.
Biden’s appeal among African-American voters is particularly strong in South Carolina, where his being the loyal no. 2 to the nation’s first black president appears to be paying dividends. Even though he’s facing two African-American candidates in Harris and Booker, Biden gets 40 percent support from black voters in the open-ended ballot test — slightly more than among all voters.
After polling Florida, heavily white New Hampshire and heavily African-American South Carolina, Tyson said his surveys indicate that something major might have to happen in the race to change the trajectory — starting with the debates next month in Miami.
“Someone is going to have to open up the power tools on Biden at some point, and thus far the ‘tools’ being used through earned media don’t seem to be denting him, at least not yet,” Tyson said. “Are we projecting him as the winner? Hell no. We’re saying the road is long. But Joe Biden might be the person who kills himself off. Something major, some major shift, might have to happen.”"
Biden rolls out plan to hike teacher pay in low-income schools -,www.politico.com,NICOLE GAUDIANO,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/biden-teacher-pay-universal-pre-k-1479288,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled a wide-ranging K-12 and early education plan , targeted to increasing teacher pay, providing universal pre-K and leveling the playing field between rich and poor school districts.
The former vice president aims to close a massive funding gap between majority white and non-white school districts by spending $45 billion on federal grants to low-income districts under the Title I program. That would be nearly triple the current level.
The additional money would first be used to ensure teachers in low-income districts receive “competitive” pay, provide 3- and 4-year-olds with access to preschool and ensure districts put in place “rigorous coursework across all their schools, not just a few.”
School districts would be allowed to use the funds to meet other local priorities after those conditions are met. The plan also says Biden would work with states to provide universal pre-kindergarten for all 3- and 4-year-olds.
“Everybody’s going to tell you how much they value education,” he said at a town hall meeting with teachers in Houston on Tuesday night. “I’ve got an expression I use: Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value.”
Biden, now considered the Democratic field’s front-runner , rolled out his plan during the forum, which is part of an elaborate teachers union endorsement process led by the American Federation of Teachers. He was joined by his wife, Jill Biden, who has spent more than three decades in education.
His rollout follows broad education proposals unveiled by other candidates, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who also called for tripling Title I funding for low-income schools and for setting a minimum starting salary for teachers of $60,000. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) proposed spending $315 billion over 10 years to boost teacher pay, while former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has called forgiving teachers a tax credit of up to $10,000.
The Biden plan outlines a host of other ideas, including doubling the number of mental health professionals in schools at a cost of $2.5 billion a year, funding for public school infrastructure improvements, fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act within 10 years and school vocational training.
During the forum, he discussed eliminating tax breaks, but didn't specify how that would be applied to financing this plan.
He said he would spend $32 million a year to expand community schools that provide ""wraparound support"" for students and their families.
Biden also pledges to “defeat the National Rifle Association” to make schools safer by pushing legislation he helped author as a senator in 1994 to ban “assault”-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. The ban expired in 2004.
While taking questions from the crowd, Biden said he's for free community college and against for-profit charter schools, saying ""it siphons off money for our public schools, which are already in enough trouble.""
When a 10-year-old girl asked him about divisions in this country, he said addressing that is part of the reason he's running for president and then told her: ""I'll bet you're as bright as you are good-looking."" She told him her favorite subject is journalism so he led her to the back to meet the press corps.
""The reason we are who we are is called a free press,"" he said, standing behind the girl while putting his hands on her shoulders. ""Continuing to denigrate it is dangerous.""
AFT president Randi Weingarten introduced Biden as one of the ""best friends working people have ever had"" in federal office and called him the union's ""go-to guy"" during the Obama administration, even on occasions when the union disagreed with the administration's positions.
Responding to his plan, National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen García said that “as the eyes of the nation turn to the 2020 presidential campaign, the country is hungry to elect a president who will not only do what is in the best interest of public education but also ensure that students have the schools they deserve.”
Biden’s plan makes note of the wave of teacher strikes across the nation, praising teachers who have “heroically” organized walkouts and other actions to “stand up” for pay, benefits and resources for their students.
In addition to increased pay, he pledges to invest $1 billion a year to help teachers earn additional certifications in high-demand areas, such as special education, and pay teachers for additional work, such as serving as mentors. He would help educators pay off student loans by fixing and simplifying the existing Public Service Loan Forgiveness program
""How do we increase the professionalization of how you’re treated unless we pay you what you are remotely entitled to?"" he asked during the forum.
Biden also calls for improving teacher diversity by supporting more innovative approaches to recruiting teachers of color and building “the best, most innovative schools in the country” in low-income communities and communities of color.
He pledges to provide grants to school districts to create and implement plans to diversify their schools, and he says he would reinstate Obama administration guidance that “supported schools in legally pursuing desegregation strategies and recognized institutions of higher education’s interests in creating diverse student bodies.”
The Trump administration last year rescinded Obama-era guidance on the use of race in college admissions, and nixed documents encouraging schools to increase diversity through approaches such as school zoning."
"Seth Moulton discloses PTSD, unveils military mental health proposal - POLITICO",www.politico.com,Alex Thompson,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/seth-moulton-ptsd-mental-health-1345848,"Rep. Seth Moulton, a Marine veteran who is running for president, will introduce a plan Tuesday evening to expand military mental health services and will disclose that he sought treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder after his combat deployments during the Iraq War.
“I had some particular experiences or regrets from the war that I just thought about every day, and occasionally I’d have bad dreams or wake up in a cold sweat,” the Massachusetts Democrat told POLITICO in an interview ahead of a Tuesday night event in Massachusetts that will begin a Veterans Mental Health Tour in early-primary states. “But because these experiences weren’t debilitating — I didn’t feel suicidal or completely withdrawn, and I was doing fine in school — it took me a while to appreciate that I was dealing with post-traumatic stress and I was dealing with an experience that a lot of other veterans have.”
Story Continued Below
Moulton arrived home in 2008 and sought counseling in 2009, trying a few therapists before finding one he connected with and met with weekly.
“I got to the point where these experiences weren’t haunting me every day,” he said. “They’ll always be there and there will always be regrets that I have, but I got to a point where I could deal with them and manage them. It’s been a few years now since I’ve woken up in a cold sweat in bed from a bad dream or felt so withdrawn from my friends or whatever that I would just go home and go to bed because I miss being overseas with the Marines.”
Moulton said he continues to see a therapist at least once a month “just to check in the same way that I go to the doctor for a checkup even when I’m not sick, just because I think it’s healthy.”
Moulton said he hoped that opening up about his experience would help ease the stigma that veterans and nonveterans alike feel when confronting mental illness.
“I just want people to know they’re not alone,” he said. He has not taken psychiatric medication but said such treatment “is totally acceptable if that’s part of your diagnosis.”
His policy proposal would require “mental health checkups” in addition to annual physicals for active-duty military and veterans. It would also mandate a counseling session for all troops within two weeks of their return from a combat deployment. And it would provide money for yearly mental health screenings for every high schooler in the country. The campaign proposal has not yet been set in legislative text.
Moulton’s disclosure also marks the first time in the modern era that a presidential candidate from a major party has revealed he or she had received mental health treatment. In recent years, historians have discovered that at least two presidents — John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon — privately took psychiatric medication while serving in the Oval Office, and there is strong evidence that Abraham Lincoln had depression.
“Just because other presidents haven’t talked about this openly doesn’t mean that presidents haven’t dealt with these issues in the past,” Moulton said.
But fear of political fallout ensured that such maladies and treatments have been kept secret.
Sen. George McGovern’s 1972 presidential campaign was thrown into chaos after reporters discovered that his running mate, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, had been hospitalized for depression and treated with electroconvulsive therapy. McGovern pushed Eagleton off the Democratic ticket, but the tumult surrounding his vice presidential pick contributed to his overwhelming defeat by Nixon.
In the decades since, campaigns have sometimes tried to undermine opponents by raising questions about their mental health. In the 2000 Republican presidential primary, then-Sen. John McCain released medical records after a whisper campaign that he was unstable as a result of his years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He also tried to defuse the issue by laughing it off: “Those voices in my head,” he joked to Maureen Dowd of The New York Times. “STOP THOSE VOICES!”
Some politicians below the presidential level have been able to openly discuss mental health treatment and still win their elections. Former Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota told voters before winning his first term in 2010 that he had been taking antidepressants . Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said he had PTSD after serving in Iraq.
But the presidency comes with a different level of power, in particular with authority over the nuclear arsenal. Asked what he would tell any voter worried about his stability in the Oval Office, Moulton said, “I think dealing with this has made me stronger, and I think it’s good to have a president who has had to make life-or-death decisions before and live with the consequences.”"
Kamala Harris gets real,www.politico.com,CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/kamala-harris-pocketbook-democrat-1345346,"Joe Biden is offering a return to normalcy. Elizabeth Warren aims to bring big corporations to heel and prop up the working class. Bernie Sanders wants a political revolution.
Kamala Harris’ one-sentence rationale for wanting the presidency is less clear.
To the extent the former California attorney general and district attorney has defined herself, it’s as the tough-minded prosecutor with the backbone to litigate the case against Donald Trump. Yet her law enforcement credentials have been met with some resistance from progressive Democrats, and at times she’s seemed to shy away from her record.
Harris, who has now begun fleshing out her policy agenda, told POLITICO in an interview that she’s looking to offer something tangible to voters. She’s pitching herself as the kitchen-table realist of the field, the candidate who eschews lofty speeches and understands the day-to-day financial struggles of regular Americans and, bottom line, wants to put more money in their pockets.
Harris’ plans include big raises for public school teachers, a proposal to pay women equally to men and a tax plan that calls for a $500 monthly credit for families earning less than $100,000 a year. Her paycheck agenda, which one adviser described as a platform of “big tangible solutions,” centers on how Americans are experiencing the economy and is aimed at people whose wages aren’t keeping pace with the cost of living. She’s trying to reach voters who are too often left out of the conversation, with an emphasis on women — and women of color.
Harris said she thinks about the issues she’s taking on in the context of “literally looking at people through the prism of their lives—not some plate glass windows.""
""It’s about solving the problems that keep people up at night,” she said.
""It’s about the value of work and dignity of work and paying people their value — understanding that people are working hard, but they still aren’t able to get through the month and make it with dignity,"" Harris added. ""And it’s about meeting people where they are.""
Another adviser compared her positioning with the other Democratic candidates more bluntly: Harris is calling for direct payments to families to ease their paycheck-to-paycheck burdens. It's a simple message they hope will set her apart as a proactive “doer” focused more on delivering immediate results than waiting around for broad, systemic overhauls. “She’s not creating liberal trickle-down policy,” the adviser said. “She’s focused on bottom-line economics, not abstract economics.”
Harris’ big challenge will be breaking through on policy in a way that captivates voters and tells a broader story — about herself, but also what she’s trying to accomplish. Ben LaBolt, a veteran of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, credited Harris’ tough stance against Trump, calling it smart. “Democratic voters are looking for a candidate that can take the fight to Trump and win,” LaBolt said.
He noted that Harris had breakout moments during Judiciary Committee hearings when she grilled then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Attorney General William Barr to the point that they appeared to trip over their answers.
But LaBolt suggested it won't be as easy for Harris to stand out on policy. “As the Clinton campaign learned, it is difficult for pragmatism to match or drown out Trump’s provocation in the headlines — and driving powerful and memorable moments to communicate our message will be more powerful than white papers this cycle,” he said.
Harris is betting that her focus on issues people worry about at “3 a.m.” — “when you wake up in a cold sweat”— will pierce the noise. Her next opportunity in front of a national TV audience comes Tuesday night in an MSNBC town hall in South Carolina. Her faith that the approach will catch on is based partly on her own experience and partly on what she's heard over and over on the campaign trail.
The teacher pay idea, for example, wasn't planned as a standalone proposal but turned into one because Harris heard from so many educators.
Harris' platform has taken shape over several months. She laces her stump speech with statistics and anecdotes diagnosing economic disparities: Nearly half of American families are one unexpected $400 expense away from financial distress, she often says, and in 99 percent of the counties in America, a minimum-wage worker can’t afford market rate price of a one-bedroom apartment.
She describes how her late mother, a breast cancer researcher, sat at the kitchen table and shuffled through bills after Harris and her sister had gone to bed. “She was focused on the demands of what it means to keep all the trains moving on time,"" Harris said of her mother, who split with her husband early in her daughters' lives and took charge of raising the children.
Harris’ policy remedies take a page from Democrats who ran during the 2018 midterm election cylce, when pocketbook issues such as jobs, health care, prescription drug costs and infrastructure resonated with voters in swing districts. Her pitch aims to strike at primary voters who want direct action more than changes that could take generations to bear fruit. She's keeping it simple and avoiding talk of radical change even when the plans include significant changes to government.
But if she makes it far enough, Trump is certain to yoke Harris to ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal,"" no matter how she talks about them. She endorsed both proposals early on, amid a rush by some Democratic hopefuls to align with what was thought to be — at least at the time — a sharp leftward turn of the party to align more closely with the energy of the base.
Still, Harris and her team believe she won’t be perceived as a Sanders- or Warren-like figure. They’re hoping her positioning could find favor with — or at least not alienate — voters in a face-off with Trump, who is trying to paint all Democrats as radicals and socialists.
“When I see a tax cut, or teacher pay, or equal pay, those are actually issues that are very important to Democratic primary voters, but also can communicate to swing voters” in the general election, said Neera Tanden, who served as policy director on the campaigns of Obama and Hillary Clinton and is now president of the Center for American Progress. “Democratic primary voters want to see candidates who can appeal to swing voters.”
Harris’ plans call for spending $315 billion over 10 years to boost teacher salaries, which amounts to a raise of $13,500 for the average teacher, a 23 percent increase in base pay. Another plan would mandate that companies prove they aren’t discriminating against women and would fine corporations that don’t close their pay gaps between women and men. If Congress doesn’t act on the gender-pay plan, Harris pledged she would take executive action as president to force federal contractors to comply. She also has promised to take unilateral action on sweeping gun control measures that have stalled in Congress.
A Harris adviser said her upcoming policy plans will fall into three categories: wages and pay, bills and the cost of living, and economic and social justice. Harris said she also plans to release criminal justice reform and immigration proposals.
Harris has long tried to present herself as pragmatic, particularly on issues in her law enforcement wheelhouse, such as dealing with first-time offenders, tackling human trafficking and negotiating a settlement with big banks during the mortgage crisis. But when she arrived in the Senate two years ago, there were still vast areas where she remained a blank slate. Since then, she’s compiled a portfolio on economic issues that she's rolled into her presidential campaign.
She’s proposed a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year—$500 a month—to address the rising cost of living, a separate refundable tax credit for people who spend 30 percent or more of their income on rent and utilities and a bill to help low-income families pay for rising sewer and water bills. On health care, Harris is running on Medicare for All, focusing her remarks on the out-of-pocket deductibles more than premiums.
In the interview, Harris sought to ground her policies in a broader governing philosophy. She stressed that Americans’ hardships are largely the result of policies written over many decades and designed to favor the wealthy at the expense of working people. She blamed those in power for the lack of meaningful commitments on more affordable childcare, universal pre-K and paid family leave. Even the tax overhaul Trump signed, Harris said, was pushed by Republican lawmakers and interest groups that long pre-dated Trump.
“The spirit behind the tax bill—that is not new. It’s not an aberration,” Harris said.
“A large part of what I do, and I try to do, is to actually see people,” she added, turning her attention to Trump. “And that requires having some curiosity and concern about the condition of the lives of people other than one’s self. And then when you ask the questions and you hear the stories, seeing what the opportunities are to actually bring solutions.”"
‘Goddamned steam’: Trump’s carrier obsession sets up collision with Navy and Congress,www.politico.com,WESLEY MORGAN,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/trump-aircraft-carriers-steam-1473984," is ratcheting up the pressure on the Navy to return to the days of steam-powered catapults for launching jets from aircraft carriers — a multibillion-dollar shift that could take nearly two decades to achieve and would likely spur a clash with Congress.
Trump has spent two years criticizing the Navy's decision to switch to an electromagnetic launch system for its newest class of aircraft carriers, citing delays in rolling out the technology and complaining that “you have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out.” But he kicked his old-tech obsession up a notch during his visit to Japan, telling U.S. service members he plans to order the Navy to outfit all its new carriers with steam catapults.
""So I think I’m going to put an order: When we build a new aircraft carrier, we’re going to use steam,” Trump told sailors and Marines aboard the amphibious assault shift USS Wasp at a Navy base south of Tokyo, speaking late Monday night U.S. Eastern time. He renewed his complaint that the new technology could be unreliable during battle. “We’re spending all that money on electric, and nobody knows what it’s going to be like in bad conditions.”
The president was blunter during a May 2017 interview with Time magazine, in which he boasted that he had told his military commanders: “[You’re] going to goddamned steam.”
The Navy opted not to comment on Trump’s latest remarks, instead referring all questions to the White House. The White House, in turn, did not respond to questions on whether Trump will formally order the Navy to abandon its new Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System.
Declining to comment or deferring to the White House have been the standard Navy responses to Trump’s periodic remarks on catapults, even as the admirals have stood by the new technology. Naval experts told POLITICO that this time feels different, however. They also point out that with the next several carriers already being built with electromagnetic catapults, at costs of $11-13 billion per ship, it could be 15 years before the Navy would even be able to launch a new steam-equipped carrier — even if Congress were to approve the change.
Trump's comments “seem much more interventionist than he has been on this issue in the past,” said Bryan Clark, a retired Navy officer who served as a senior adviser to the chief of naval operations.
Even if Trump were to order a return to steam, “there’s a lot of gears that have to turn in the Pentagon to turn the president’s desire into a requirement,” added Clark, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.
He noted that the next two Gerald R. Ford-class carriers the Navy is building, the Kennedy and Enterprise, are too far along in construction for what would amount to “a redesign” of the whole carrier. That's because the Ford-class vessels lack steam piping running the length of the ship, and they also plan to use electromagnetic power for other future systems, such as lasers and rail guns.
“Ten years down the line is when you could conceivably change back to steam catapults,” with the construction of the next carrier after the Enterprise, Clark said. That unnamed carrier is not yet under construction and is expected to reach the fleet in 2032.
It could take even longer than that, said Thomas Callender, a Heritage Foundation senior research fellow who was a Navy officer and then a senior Navy Department civilian. “If you’re serious and were to try to abandon the electromagnetic system … it would be 15 years from now, and it would wind up costing even more money to do that major redesign of the aircraft carrier,” he said.
The Navy “can’t just go back and build another Nimitz-class carrier, which was designed in the late ’60s,” Callender said. “The Navy has committed to this plan and going back is going to cost more in the long run even if you have better reliability initially” with steam, as Trump hopes.
But Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy flight officer, suggested Trump may be on the right track as far as cost-cutting. “It’s not a bad thing to try to go back to a cheaper method,” he said. “The Navy believes that over the 50-year life of the ship, it will be cheaper to operate the Ford class, but that’s unproven.”
It’s “a good thing when you have a commander in chief take an in-depth interest in an aspect of the military,” added Hendrix, who is now a vice president of the Telemus Group.
Even so, “there is going to be pushback,” Hendrix predicted. And some of that resistance will come not directly from the Navy but from a skeptical Congress, said Clark and Callender.
While “Congress will continue to criticize the electromagnetic system alongside the president” because of cost overruns, Clark predicted, in the end lawmakers “will say what the Navy says, that this system is the future.” That’s because the electromagnetic systems could make it easier to launch new generations of unmanned aircraft and eventually even power high-tech self-defense weapons.
“No one is seriously talking about swapping EMALS with steam catapults — not even the U.S. Navy, which has studied EMALS extensively and believes EMALS has significant advantages over steam,"" said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), using the Navy acronym for the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System. ""Overhauling the Ford-class carriers for steam catapults would require a complete redesign of the Ford and the reconstitution of the industrial base for steam catapults, creating significant delays and cost overruns.
""This is not a feasible proposal, and I don’t anticipate Congress going along with this proposal and providing the funding to revert and refit the Ford class.”
Trump has sought sailors' views on the system before. On the Wasp, which does not use catapults of either type, Trump asked the crew which type of catapult they prefer. He was met mostly with shouts of ""steam,"" and joked that one crew member who shouted in favor of the electric system ""works for the enemy.""
That's in contrast to the response Trump got when he raised the issue last Thanksgiving during a public call with members of the carrier USS Ronald Reagan. The ship's commanding officer, a career fighter pilot, offered an extended defense of electromagnetic catapults that Trump acknowledged as ""a very good answer.""
General Atomics, which builds the electromagnetic system, declined to comment on Trump’s latest remarks.
Since Trump's criticism began two years after a visit to the USS Gerald R. Ford, top Navy officials have stood by their choice of the new electromagnetic system. James Geurts, assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition, told senators in November that the Navy had logged more than 740 launches using the new system aboard the Ford.
""We are feeling pretty confident on both of those systems,"" he said, referring to the electromagnetic system and the new Advanced Arresting Gear, a high-tech successor to the old hydraulic system that helps warplanes slow down as they land on a carrier's deck.
""Are we gonna be glad we went with EMALS and the Advanced Arresting Gear?"" Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) asked him, using the Navy acronym for the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System.
""Yes, sir,"" Geurts said, noting that future carrier air wings will need the system to launch heavier aircraft.
On the other hand, a Government Accountability Office report released this month said the electromagnetic catapults and new arresting gear are still undergoing testing and that ""the reliability of those systems remains a concern.""
Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said as recently as March that he's sticking by the new system. The electromagnetic catapult ""is the most advanced, versatile, & cost-effective launching system,"" he tweeted . ""It's a game changer for carrier based operations that is so simple to use, no Einstein is needed."""
‘Dumb lies’: Comey hits at Trump’s FBI claims,www.politico.com,MATTHEW CHOI,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/james-comey-trump-fbi-lies-1345850,"James Comey, the former FBI director and frequent presidential punching bag, derided President Donald Trump on Tuesday for perpetuating what he called “dumb lies” about the bureau and the origins of the Russia investigation.
“There was no corruption. There was no treason. There was no attempted coup,” Comey wrote in a Washington Post op-ed . “Those are lies, and dumb lies at that. There were just good people trying to figure out what was true, under unprecedented circumstances.”
The op-ed comes after Trump accused the FBI of spying on his 2016 campaign as part of a conspiracy to sabotage his candidacy. Attorney General William Barr told Congress during a hearing in April that he believes “spying did occur” by U.S. intelligence figures against Trump in the lead-up to Election Day.
Trump escalated his accusation with numerous calls for an investigation into the FBI, granting Barr the authority to declassify intelligence regarding the investigation in a move that garnered fierce criticism from Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, accused the two of conspiring to “weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies.”
Comey said that the 2016 investigation into the Trump campaign came after a legitimate tip and was the nature of the FBI’s work.
“We didn’t know what was true,” he wrote. “Maybe there was nothing to it, or maybe Americans were actively conspiring with the Russians. To find out, the FBI would live up to its name and investigate.”
Comey also pushed back against Trump’s claim that FBI agents were sympathetic to Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president. Trump has repeatedly pointed to former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who exchanged messages disparaging Trump, as evidence that the agency was out to get him. But Comey responded in the op-ed that Strzok drafted the letter Comey sent to Congress in which he wrote the agency had reopened an investigation into Clinton’s emails during the twilight of the campaign — a move Clinton largely blames for her defeat.
Comey echoed his familiar criticisms of the president, calling him a liar who doesn’t care about the consequences of his actions. Trump fired Comey in May 2017 in the hopes of stymieing investigations into his ties with Russia. That dismissal led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller — himself a former FBI director — to look into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, as well as possible obstruction of justice by the president.
“We must call out his lies that the FBI was corrupt and committed treason, that we spied on the Trump campaign, and tried to defeat Donald Trump,” Comey wrote. “We must constantly return to the stubborn facts.”"
How Joe Biden would address K-12 and early childhood education,www.politico.com,MICHAEL STRATFORD,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/joe-biden-2020-k12-education-policy-1296863,"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled his first major education plan of the 2020 presidential election — targeted at increasing teacher pay, making pre-school universal and boosting investments in K-12 school support services like mental health.
In rolling out the proposal , Biden’s campaign emphasized former first lady Jill Biden’s more than 30 years as an educator, most recently as an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College.
“Educators deserve a partner in the White House,” the Biden campaign’s education plan said. “With President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, they’ll get two.”
What would the plan do?
The centerpiece of Biden’s proposal is a tripling in the federal funding that’s allocated to low-income school districts under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is currently funded at about $16 billion.
His campaign said that increased funding would be targeted at eliminating the funding gap between majority white and non-white school districts and the disparity between wealthy and low-income school districts.
“This new funding will first be used to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, three- and four-year olds have access to pre-school, and districts provide access to rigorous coursework across all their schools, not just a few,” the plan says.
Biden would pay teachers to take on additional work like serving as mentors and coaches. His plan would provide funding to help teachers earn an additional certification in a “high-demand area – like special education or bilingual education.”
Biden’s plan also would rely on the existing Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to help alleviate the burden of student loan debt on teachers. Biden will make sure the program, which has been plagued with problems, “is fixed, simplified, and actually helps teachers.”
In addition, Biden called for more robust spending on mental health services for students. The proposal seeks an unspecified “unprecedented investment” in school mental health professionals that would double the number of school psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers and other health professionals.
Biden also proposed allowing students to use Pell Grants to pay for college classes while they’re still in high school. The Obama administration began a pilot program for using Pell to cover the cost of those “dual enrollment” programs.
What have other Democrats proposed?
Biden is the latest Democrat to offer a sweeping education proposal as candidates in the crowded 2020 presidential primary field eye the coveted endorsements of the nation’s teachers unions.
Sen. Bernie Sanders’ K-12 education plan focused on reversing racial and economic segregation and similarly called for tripling Title I funding for low-income schools. Sen. Kamala Harris has promoted a bold proposal to boost teacher pay across the country. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren has vowed that she’ll nominate a former public school teacher as her education secretary."

The tax break has been extended again and again, and Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) have introduced bills to make it permanent, which have attracted many co-sponsors.
— The tax credit “has worked as intended and when you find something that works, the best thing to do is let it work,” Chuck Baker , the trade group’s president, said in written testimony submitted last month to the House Ways and Means Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee. But the bill has been held up in the House along with other tax extenders as Congress weighs whether to include other, non-business tax cuts as a part of the package and whether and how to offset the cost of the legislation, Sullivan wrote in an email to PI.
MORE NEW BUSINESS: Bayer has hired four former Democratic congressional aides — Anne MacMillan , Benjamin Klein , Eric Rosen and Nicole Venable — at Invariant to lobby on “the importance of agricultural chemicals and biotechnology in farming,” according to a disclosure filing. The hire comes as Bayer reshapes its Washington lobbying team following its acquisition of Monsanto . Bayer also hired Todd Strategy earlier this year and has parted ways with lobbying firms such as Greenberg Traurig , Raffaniello & Associates and the Stanton Park Group . And the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies has hired Jason Rosenstock of Thorn Run Partners to lobby on a variety of matters.

HOSPITALS BATTLE MEDICARE FOR ALL: “Democrats who've made ‘Medicare for All’ a top health care priority are running up against their toughest opponent yet: their own neighborhood hospitals,” POLITICO ’s Adam Cancryn and Rachel Roubein report. The multibillion-dollar industry has emerged as the most formidable foe of single-payer health care. It’s helped assemble a coalition of health care lobbies that has launched social media campaigns attacking Medicare for All and its most high-profile proponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), while fighting narrower Democratic proposals to expand federal health coverage over concerns any change would slash hospital revenue.”
— “That’s created a dilemma for Medicare for All champions who cast themselves as crusaders against a broken health care system full of greedy insurers and drug companies, yet remain wary of taking on hospitals that rank as top employers in many congressional districts and are seen by the public as life-saving institutions. ‘We’re not cutting out hospitals, we are keeping the existing hospital system,’ said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.),” who’s helping to lead the push for Medicare for All. Full story .
PROSECUTORS INVESTIGATING GIFT TO TRUMP INAUGURAL COMMITTEE: “Real estate mogul Franklin Haney contributed $1 million to President Donald Trump ’s inaugural committee and all he’s got to show for the money is the glare of a federal investigation,” The Associated Press ’ Richard Lardner reports. “The contribution from Haney, a prolific political donor, came as he was seeking regulatory approval and financial support from the government for his long-shot bid to acquire the mothballed Bellefonte Nuclear Power Plant in northeastern Alabama. More than two years later, he still hasn’t closed the deal.” His donation is being scrutinized by federal prosecutors in New York as part of a wider investigation into the inaugural committee’s finances.

Don Jr. warns Roy Moore: Stay out of Alabama Senate race,www.politico.com,JAMES ARKIN,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/don-jr-roy-moore-alabama-senate-1346089,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday warned Roy Moore not to run for Senate again in Alabama, calling him the only candidate who could lose the race for Republicans.
Moore lost the 2017 special Senate election to Democrat Doug Jones after the former judge faced allegations of decades-old inappropriate sexual interactions with young girls. He has expressed interest in running again next year, and many Republicans expect him to mount another campaign for Senate, a worst-case scenario for the party’s hopes of winning back the seat. Story Continued Below
“You are literally the only candidate who could lose a GOP seat in pro-Trump, pro-USA ALABAMA,” Trump Jr. tweeted at Moore on Tuesday. “Running for office should never become a business model. If you actually care about #MAGA more than your own ego, it’s time to ride off into the sunset, Judge.”
Trump Jr. was responding to a tweet in which Moore taunted Rep. Bradley Byrne, one of the Republicans running to face Jones next fall. Byrne told The Hill that he expects Moore to enter the race soon but didn’t think he could win the nomination because of the baggage from his previous run. poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/355/1155968404_6042392432001_6042394724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true
“What is Bradley so worried about?” Moore tweeted. “He knows that if I run I will beat Doug Jones.”
Republicans in Washington have vowed to oppose Moore and think the former judge would put the Alabama race in jeopardy again. Jones won by less than 2 percentage points in 2017 and is the most vulnerable incumbent senator on the ballot in 2020. Earlier this year, Jones taunted Moore about running again, saying, “Let’s just do it again.” "
McConnell: Republicans would confirm a justice during 2020 election - POLITICO,www.politico.com,MATTHEW CHOI,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court-1346094,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Republicans would fill an opening on the Supreme Court if there were a vacancy next year — in contrast with 2016, when he stated his fierce opposition to confirming a justice in the last year of a president’s term.
At a Paducah (Kentucky) Area Chamber of Commerce lunch, McConnell was asked about how he would handle an opening if a justice were to die in 2020, when President Donald Trump is up for reelection. McConnell confidently replied, “Oh, we’d fill it.”
CNN first reported McConnell’s remarks, which were broadcast on WPSD-TV .
The Senate majority leader’s stance contrasts with his handling of President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Scalia was an ardent conservative voice on the court, and Garland was a relatively moderate choice who had garnered the praise of Republicans in the past.
But McConnell declared that Obama, a Democrat, would not choose the next justice, saying that voters should have a say through their choice of the next president. He and Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to the White House that they wouldn’t take up Obama’s nomination, and Garland never got a confirmation hearing.
The move infuriated Democrats, who argued McConnell was robbing Obama of his duty to nominate a justice. After taking office in 2017, Trump filled the seat with Neil Gorsuch. In 2020, Republicans will still control both the White House and the Senate.
This is not the first time since the 2016 battle that McConnell has entertained the possibility of filling a seat in an election year. Shortly after the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last fall, McConnell said on “Fox New Sunday” that his resistance to confirming Garland was following the tradition of not filling a vacancy when the Senate and the presidency are controlled by different parties.
“We didn’t attack a nominee,” McConnell told Fox News’ Chris Wallace at the time.
A McConnell spokesman deferred to the Senate majority leader‘s past comments on the topic.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman wrote on Twitter : “Props to the McConnell team for saying the quiet part out loud (and on the record)! They spent 3 years pretending he blocked Garland because of some kind of historical precedent. They finally admitted it's because Garland was nominated by a Democrat.“
Schumer was more succinct and pointed in his own tweet : “Senator McConnell. is a hypocrite.”

GOP impeachment champion gets a hero's welcome back home,www.politico.com,MELANIE ZANONA,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/amash-townhall-impeachment-1346100,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Rep. Justin Amash is a lonely man in Congress, the sole Republican to back Donald Trump’s removal from the Oval Office. But back home on Tuesday night, the Michigan lawmaker got the red-carpet treatment in his first face-to-face encounter with voters since his call for impeachment.
During a packed town hall in Grand Rapids, attendees in the mostly friendly audience gave Amash several standing ovations and heaps of praise for his solo rebellion against Trump.
“I don’t agree with many of your stances, but I applaud your courage and your morality that seems to be lacking in [Washington]. So, thank you,” one woman in the crowd said, drawing cheers.
Tuesday’s town hall marked Amash’s first public appearance since he declared on Twitter earlier this month that Trump committed impeachable offenses and obstructed justice — a remarkable act of defiance, even for a longtime Trump critic, that has put his congressional career on the line while provoking Trump and the GOP.
It was unclear how many audience members planned to vote for Amash. Several former Amash supporters stood up to denounce the five-term congressman and express their ire over his constant rebukes of Trump, reflecting a broader frustration in the GOP.
Amash has drawn two primary challengers, including state Rep. Jim Lower, a pro-Trump candidate who vowed to use his support of the president as a key issue in the campaign.
But Amash is swatting down concerns about the potential effects on his political future, telling the crowd he “has a duty to keep the president in check.”
“It doesn’t matter to me that some people won’t support me,"" he said. ""You have to do the right thing regardless.""
Amash, who explains all his congressional votes on social media, said he felt it was important to explain his pro-impeachment stance to his constituents. It took the 39-year-old attorney a month to read and analyze the Mueller report before he came to that conclusion.
On Tuesday, hundreds of people packed into a high school auditorium, where one person wore a red Amash campaign T-shirt and another sported a “Mueller Time” T-shirt. Some audience members snapped selfies and shook hands with Amash before the event.
Amash, who has largely avoided the media spotlight over the past week and a half, spent two hours — an hour longer than the town hall was supposed to last — reiterating his support for impeachment, defending his conservative record and taking shots at the president and congressional leaders of both parties.
He also explained why he is still a Republican — it’s harder to get on the ballot as an independent — and fielded several questions on other issues, such as infrastructure, the opioid crisis and climate change.
Not everyone in the crowd was happy with Amash. At one point, a woman wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat told Amash she was disappointed in the lawmaker and could no longer support him. The audience tried to boo her down, with some members in the crowd growing rowdy, forcing Amash to ask people to be respectful.
In another testy exchange, a woman who said she once volunteered for Amash’s campaign accused the lawmaker of political grandstanding and abandoning his district.
“I’ve changed my position on you,"" the woman, Anna Timmer, said. ""You’ve spent the last two years failing to do your job, which is to directly represent the popular will of your constituents.”
“That’s not my job. … My job is to uphold the Constitution,” Amash responded.
“Those are not mutually exclusive,” she shot back.
Amash is no stranger to bucking his party. The Michigan lawmaker rode the 2010 tea party wave to Congress, where the libertarian and fiscal conservative has built a political brand as being a thorn in the side of GOP leadership and has made protecting civil liberties his chief priority.
Amash helped found the hard-line Freedom Caucus as a way to challenge the party’s establishment. And he has become famous in Washington for his “no” votes, opposing everything from massive spending bills to routine measures.
Amash once lost a coveted seat on the House Budget Committee for bucking Republicans.
“If you go against the speaker of the House, and you’re in the majority, you’re toast. And that’s why people don’t do it,” Amash said.
But his penchant for crossing party lines has taken on new meaning in the era of Trump — and potentially put his congressional career in jeopardy.
Lower, who was already planning on running against Amash, accelerated his announcement after the Amash’s impeachment comments. Now, Lower plans to make his support of Trump a central part of his campaign.
“It will probably be the No. 1 issue, whether I wanted it to or not,” Lower told POLITICO.
While Amash beat back a primary challenge from an establishment candidate in 2014, he faces a far more uncertain political future in the age of Trump, in which fealty to the president has often become a litmus test in the GOP.
Amash has been frustrated that his Republican colleagues have moved in lockstep with Trump, even on positions once anathema to the GOP, such as supporting executive orders to shape immigration policy or legislation that adds to the ballooning federal deficit.
“Under the current administration, spending has skyrocketed. And Republicans, unfortunately, haven’t said that much about it,” he said. “I haven’t changed. … I’m a principled, constitutional conservative who has stayed consistent, regardless of whether we’ve had President Obama in office or President Trump.”
Amash also said some of his GOP colleagues agree with his view on the Mueller report but haven’t had the courage to speak out against Trump.
“A lot of people think I’m right about the Mueller report. They just won’t say it. A lot of Republicans,” Amash said.
Amash has repeatedly defied Trump, voting against the president’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for a wall on the southern border, opposing Trump’s travel ban and questioning Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen in a public hearing instead of attacking him like his GOP colleagues did.
But backlash in GOP circles over his impeachment comments has been swift and fierce. Trump ripped into Amash on Twitter, calling him a “lightweight” and a “loser,” while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) accused Amash of seeking attention.
And the DeVos family, who are well-known and powerful megadonors in Michigan, ended their support for the lawmaker.
Not even Amash’s fellow members of the House Freedom Caucus have come to his defense. The group decided to uniformly oppose his impeachment stance, though it stopped short of kicking him out of the caucus.
Amash, who stopped showing up to House Freedom Caucus meetings this year, threatened to quit the caucus last year because it wouldn’t stand up to Trump, even when the president attacked one of its members. Another GOP Trump critic, former Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, lost his primary race to a pro-Trump challenger last year after Trump got involved in the race.
It’s unclear whether the president will get involved in Amash’s race, though some Republicans think it’s likely.
But others think Amash has his eyes set on running for higher office — and his impeachment comments have only further fueled rampant speculation.
Libertarian groups have been trying to draft Amash to mount a third-party challenge against Trump in 2020, which could draw votes from Trump in Michigan, a key battleground state that Trump barely won in 2016.
Amash kept his options open Tuesday.
“I’ve said many times, I don’t rule things like that out,” Amash said. “If you’re fighting to defend the Constitution, if you find a way to do that that’s different and maybe more effective, then you have to think about that.”"

John Bolton tweeted he had arrived in the Emirates for meetings Wednesday “to discuss important and timely regional security matters.”
America recently deployed an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf over a still-unexplained threat it perceives from Tehran. The U.S. also pulled nonessential diplomats out of Iraq and sent hundreds more troops to the region.
Meanwhile, Emirati officials allege four ships off their coast were sabotaged. Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have launched drone attacks on Saudi Arabia.

House GOP grapples with abortion messaging after Alabama law,www.politico.com,LAURA BARRÓN-LÓPEZ,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/house-republicans-abortion-alabama-1346087,"Republicans wanted to weaponize abortion against vulnerable Democrats in 2020, but a wave of strict bans across the country has upended their strategy, leaving them scattered and mostly mute.
Before Alabama passed its law, Republicans had made clear they would make abortion a central issue in the next election. They had homed in on a host of state laws expanding access to abortion, seizing specifically on a New York bill that Republicans inaccurately claimed would legalize “infanticide.”
The party hoped a relentless anti-abortion message coupled with attempts to tag Democrats as socialists could help them regain the House majority. This year alone, House Republicans have tried 50 times to force a vote on “born alive” legislation — which mandates medical care for babies who survive attempted abortions — in an attempt to corner Democrats in swing districts through procedural floor tactics. (Third-trimester abortions are extremely rare and a 2002 law guarantees babies born at any stage of development full legal rights.)
But Republicans have gone mostly quiet since Alabama’s governor signed a bill into law that all but bans abortion — even in cases of rape and incest — and punishes doctors who provide the procedure with up to 99 years to life behind bars.
Dozens of Republican offices contacted by POLITICO did not respond to questions on the abortion law, including all the House lawmakers in the Alabama delegation. Out of the 13 female Republicans in the House, only two responded to POLITICO’s request for comment on whether they support Alabama's bill. One directly answered whether they support the law and one member deflected to Democrats.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and his two staunchly conservative top deputies are also split on Alabama’s law, reflecting a larger rift within the caucus that leaves Republicans exposed on a topic they wanted to dominate in 2020. The divide and muted response comes after similarly strict laws have passed in Georgia and Kentucky. And Missouri's last abortion clinic announced Monday it expects to close this week.
Some in the GOP fear that the Alabama law hands Democrats new ammunition to label the GOP as extreme and will turn off moderate and independent female voters who fled the party in 2018 while firing up the liberal base. Republican members have been urged by some in leadership to steer clear of the political firestorm by pivoting their responses to what they view as extreme abortion laws pushed by the opposing party.
Shortly after the Alabama bill passed, McCarthy, a California Republican who some anti-abortion advocates on the far right have long viewed suspiciously, sought to distance national Republicans from the law.
“It goes further than I believe, yes,” McCarthy told reporters days after the law passed. “I defend my pro-life position for my whole political career.” McCarthy added that he believes in exceptions for “rape, incest or life of the mother” and “that is what our platform says.”
A week later, he shifted, calling it a ""personal position,"" adding that members ""have to stake out their own personal position."" President Donald Trump also distanced himself from Alabama, though his steady stream of conservative judge confirmations helped spur the wave of anti-abortion bills — designed by lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates to force the Supreme Court to revisit Roe v. Wade.
By contrast, Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee, went out of his way to put some daylight between himself and McCarthy. Scalise offered tacit support for the Alabama law, saying he supported an anti-abortion measure during his time in the Louisiana legislature that didn’t include exceptions for rape or incest.
“I voted for the bill that banned abortion except in the case of protecting life of the mothers,” said Scalise (R-La.), a former chairman of the Republican Study Committee. “That was the only exception.”
The mixed message comes at a time when Republicans are eager to use abortion against vulnerable freshman Democrats in competitive seats, seizing on controversial remarks made by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D-Va.), who was defending a bill in his state that makes it easier to get a third-trimester abortion when the health of the mother is at risk.
The conservative Republican Study Committee — the largest GOP caucus in the House — circulated talking points to its members about how they should defend the lack of exceptions for rape and incest in the Alabama law and other state bills, according to Vice News.
“Committing a second violent act with abortion to a woman who has already been victimized by an act of rape or incest could physically or psychologically wound her further,” the document states. “Every single child should be afforded the opportunity to live, regardless of how they were conceived.”
Democrats are already seizing on the memo, characterizing it as an “attack on women.”
“In a sea of offensive attacks on women, this is really something. Justifying the Alabama legislature's draconian, misogynist abortion ban by pretending you're doing it to protect rape victims is disgusting,” tweeted Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).
“The @GOP has surrendered their party to a barbaric fringe who would criminalize abortion and punish women and doctors. They're on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of politics,” tweeted Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL pro-choice, an abortion rights advocacy group.
And not every Republican Study Committee member is on the same page. Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), whose office was the only one to provide an answer to questions about Alabama, does not support the state’s law, according to her spokesperson Rebecca Card.
“Because Alabama’s state law does not provide exemptions for rape and incest, [Brooks] believes it goes too far,” said Card, who added that Brooks is a “pro-life"" member. “She does not support RSC’s talking points backing Alabama’s law.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the highest ranking female Republican as head of the GOP’s messaging, dodged a question about the Alabama law. Her office provided a statement directing attention toward Democrats, calling them “the extreme party on the issue.”
“Support for partial-birth abortion, late-term abortion and infanticide are the litmus tests on which [Democrats] are building their party for 2020,” Cheney said in a statement provided to POLITICO. “Republicans in Congress and in state houses across the nation are taking steps to defend life and fight the barbaric positions the Democrats are advocating.”
Democrats do no support infanticide, which is illegal. The Illinois legislature voted Tuesday evening to repeal spousal consent requirements and the states partial-birth abortion ban, further fueling the national debate. A majority of Democrats say they support the federal law which does not allow partial-birth abortions – a political, not medical term, coined in the mid-90s.
Cheney isn’t the only member avoiding the question. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which recently criticized Rep. Cheri Bustos, head of Democrats’ campaign arm, for cancelling a fundraiser with anti-abortion advocate Democrat Dan Lipinski, also did not respond to a request for comment on Alabama’s law.
Others, when pressed for their position on Alabama, ducked questions and said they hadn’t read all the elements of the abortion law or said it wasn't a national issue.
""It's really a state by state issue,"" said Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), dismissing the question. ""I'm not ready to go there yet.""
“I need to vote,” Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) said when asked about the law last week. “I haven’t read up on all the provisions.”
Hartzler and Upton's office did not respond to request for comment."
Pentagon briefing drought nears 1-year mark amid Iran tension - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Michael Calderone,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/pentagon-press-briefing-iran-1346093,"The mood in the Pentagon briefing room was tense Friday when officials went on the record for the first time to blame Iran for recent flare-ups in the Middle East.
Two high-ranking Pentagon officials told reporters that U.S. intelligence had linked Iran to attacks on oil tankers near the Persian Gulf and in Baghdad’s Green Zone. The duo, speaking after weeks of anonymous leaks, did not provide any direct evidence or reveal sources who could back up the claim.
“That sounds like WMD,” Task & Purpose reporter Jeff Schogol said, referring to the case the George W. Bush administration made for war before the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
One of the pair, Vice Admiral Michael Gilday, replied that officials had learned through “intelligence reporting” that Iran was responsible, according to a transcript of the session, which was on the record but not on camera. Schogol, who wasn't named in the transcript but confirmed his questions, responded, ""So, we have to take your word on it?”
The Pentagon press corps has chafed for months at what reporters see as a sharp decline in access to information, including limited access to officials during trips. Celebrities such as Kiss rocker Gene Simmons and actor Gerard Butler have showed up in the briefing room, but Friday will be a year since the Pentagon held an on-camera briefing with any department spokesperson.
Last week’s exchange, which came amid escalating tension with Iran and the deployment of additional troops to the Middle East, showed frustration spiking in the Pentagon press corps. Reporters are growing concerned that the U.S. will end up in a military confrontation without the Trump administration ever having to sufficiently — and publicly — defend its case for it.
“We’re talking about some sort of strike on another country and nobody knows why,” said one Pentagon reporter who was not authorized to speak publicly.
“This is not just about having things on camera,” the reporter added. “But the reason we push on-camera is we want people to publicly stand by their decisions to send other people’s children into harm’s way.”
Defense Department spokesman Tom Crosson said that while spokespeople have not taken questions on camera, other department officials have in recent months. “It depends what your definition of a briefing is,” he said, adding that traditional briefings with spokespeople could return at some point.
More broadly, he defended the department’s engagement with the media, noting last week’s off-camera briefing on Iran, and said a contingent of journalists is traveling with acting in Asia.
The White House has defended its own scaling back of traditional on-camera news briefings by highlighting how often President Donald Trump takes impromptu questions from the news media. And critics of the briefings say they are generally an opportunity for the administration to push talking points.
Those justifications haven’t quelled frustrations among White House reporters over the rarity of on-camera briefings — it’s been 79 days since the last one — especially since Trump’s comments on Iran sometimes seem at odds with what others in his administration are saying.
Reporters who have pushed for more briefings are still pursuing other avenues of reporting, particularly at the Pentagon, where they have more freedom to roam the building and knock on doors than journalists at the White House do.
But they say regular briefings on camera force the administration to put names and faces to its policies. There's a record of Bush administration officials touting flimsy Iraq intelligence in briefing rooms, on TV news shows and, infamously, at the United Nations.
The sessions also allow for a series of questions and clarifications that might have helped “avoid the confusion we’ve had in the past two weeks about the Iran news,” Defense One Executive Editor Kevin Baron said.
“No reporter is sitting in the briefing room waiting for a camera to turn on,” he said. “But details about Iran troop movements are not supposed to come from leaks and background whispers.”
Pentagon reporters have made their displeasure known on Twitter.
“Gene Simmons delivers briefing at Pentagon podium that has not seen a spokesperson in almost a year,” veteran CNN correspondent Barbara Starr tweeted on May 17.
Days later, her CNN colleague Jim Sciutto tweeted , in response to news that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had canceled a trip, that “in a normal world, there would be an on-camera pentagon briefing in which reporters could ask our military leaders why and the American public would get answers.”
The briefing room is getting some unconventional use these days, reporters say, for happy hours and farewell parties for colleagues. A second Pentagon reporter told POLITICO: “It’s become kind of like a glorified events room as opposed to a briefing room.”"
DNC to raise polling and fundraising bars for 3rd debate – Tokyo Daily News,www.politico.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/abc-univision-democratic-debate-1346099/,"Home / WORLD NEWS / DNC to raise polling and fundraising bars for 3rd debate DNC to raise polling and fundraising bars for 3rd debate 1 hour ago WORLD NEWS
Democratic candidates partake in an ABC News-hosted debate in 2015. | Jim Cole/AP Photo
ABC News, in partnership with Univision, will host the third Democratic presidential debate in September, the Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday, saying it was raising both the polling and fundraising bars for candidates to qualify.
The debate is set for Sept. 12 and could extend to a second night, Sept. 13, if enough candidates meet the threshold to participate. The location and moderators have not yet been announced. Story Continued Below
Like the first two Democratic presidential debates — which are set for next month on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo and for July on CNN — the September debate and a fourth, to be held in October, will cap participants at 10 per night.
But it will be more difficult for the nearly two dozen 2020 Democratic hopefuls to make the stage. COUNTDOWN TO 2020

Unlike the first and second rounds of debates, when candidates must cross either a donor or polling threshold to qualify, candidates will need to surpass both bars to make the stage for the third and fourth debates. For the September event, candidates will have to hit 2 percent in four qualifying polls, versus 1 percent in three polls for the first debates, and they will need 130,000 individual donors, up from 65,000.
Although the polling threshold increase is modest, it could represent a significant barrier for many candidates who have struggled to hit that mark in early polling.
According to a POLITICO analysis , just eight candidates have received more than 2 percent of support in four early polls: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas.
Only polls published between June 28 (the day after the first round of Democratic debates) and Aug. 28 will count toward qualifying for the third debate in September.
Most campaigns have released little information about the number of individual donors they have, besides announcing when they cross the 65,000-donor mark. Sanders, Buttigieg, Harris and Warren have all publicly said they’ve surpassed 130,000 donors.
Other candidates who may have already exceeded that threshold include O’Rourke (who said he had 112,000 unique donors in his first day ) and Biden (who had 96,000 donors in his first day ).
Erin Hill, the executive director of ActBlue, a Democratic online fundraising platform that will verify donations, said in a statement that “candidates who will be prepared to take on Trump in the general should already be working to build programs that can bring in 130,000 donors by the second round of debates.” This article tagged under:

How Trump’s new immigration chief went from Breitbart pariah to Fox favorite,www.politico.com,GABBY ORR,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/mark-morgan-trump-immigration-breitbard-1346088,"Mark Morgan just took over a job that few people in President Donald Trump’s orbit wanted him to get. It’s also a job few people wanted to take.
On Tuesday, Morgan started as the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a role he’s expected to take over permanently in the coming weeks. The appointment caps a remarkable political comeback for an Obama-era official who alienated both Border Patrol officials and conservative activists and was even labeled a “disgrace” in a Breitbart op-ed accusing him of “running scared” on immigration enforcement.
Morgan, a former Marine who ran U.S. Border Patrol at the end of the Obama administration, has clawed his way back with a series of Fox News appearances in which he lavished praise on the president, including an early January appearance Trump watched in which Morgan defended Trump's push for a wall along the southern border. ""The president is right,"" Morgan told Fox host Tucker Carlson.
But while the segments won Trump over, Morgan remains an unwelcome figure to some White House allies and to some of the immigration officials he is set to lead. While Morgan’s defenders point to his law enforcement background and say he is respectful and highly capable, the early grumbling about his appointment underscores the intense pressure Trump officials continue to face on the highly politicized issue of immigration. Trump has purged several of his top immigration officials in recent months, saying he wanted to go in a “tougher direction.” But filling those positions with uniformly lauded candidates has proved difficult.
Conversations with sixteen current and former officials who spoke with POLITICO about the president’s choice to lead ICE revealed serious skepticism. Many aren’t convinced Morgan is a genuine immigration hardliner and that his Fox News hits were merely opportunism. Others wonder whether Morgan — a former FBI investigator with limited immigration experience — understands the complexities of domestic immigration enforcement. He’ll also have to go to great lengths to earn the trust of the immigration officials he once turned off during his time as Obama’s Border Patrol chief.
“I have never seen a person do a 180 so quickly,” a former ICE official said of Morgan’s comments on Fox. “If you look at the public statements he was making when he first came on as head of [the Border Patrol], and you look at the stuff he’s been saying on Fox News you’re like, where did this guy come from?”
""It’s the complete opposite,"" the person added.
To those who have worked with Morgan — and might again — the timing of his return to the public sector is no coincidence.
Just days after an appearance on Fox Business’ “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” in which Morgan commended Trump for telling Mexico to “get off the sidelines” and send assistance to the border, he was informed that the White House was seriously considering him for the top spot at ICE, according to an administration official with knowledge of the conversation. The same official said Morgan was recommended to Trump by Tom Homan, who retired as acting ICE director in April 2018 but still speaks with the president often.
But unlike Homan, who rose to acting ICE director after a lengthy career in immigration enforcement, Morgan will be entering an insular environment as an outsider once he’s permanently confirmed by the Senate. He’ll also have to fend off calls from Democratic activists to abolish his agency altogether.
“Mark is going to have to let ICE know that he’s 100 percent on their side on his first day and even if he does that, he still has a long road ahead before he fully overcomes the stigma of being ex-FBI,” said a former DHS official who spoke with Morgan recently.
Morgan and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Morgan’s first stint in immigration enforcement began and ended in controversy.
When President Barack Obama tapped Morgan to lead USBP in 2016, the 21-year FBI veteran became the agency’s first outsider chief. Though Morgan had worked on an FBI-led Hispanic gang task force at the bureau’s Los Angeles field office, and temporarily served in internal affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, he lacked the traditional qualifications that his predecessors had obtained as Border Patrol agents out on the front lines.
“Institutionally, it was kind of difficult for [the USBP] to look at somebody who hadn’t come up through the ranks,” said a former DHS official who worked with Morgan. “He’s a professional, but he was walking into a very difficult situation.”
Some CBP employees thought of Morgan “as the internal affairs guy” during his time as Border Patrol chief, according to the former ICE official, who said his tenure was marked by “a lot of door-closing” and frustration throughout the agency.
Peter Hermansen, who served in USBP for two-plus decades before retiring, said his friends at the FBI had warned him that there “was a tinge of arrogance” about Morgan and that “he wasn't particularly super well liked in the FBI community.” But in his limited dealings with him, Hermansen said he found Morgan ""very receptive to what we were doing and how we were doing it.""
Some former colleagues said Morgan was also a good listener, showed a genuine appreciation for his peers — “He made one comment to me that he even loved the Border Patrol more so than his fellow FBI agents,” recalled Ron Colburn, who served as deputy chief of the Border Patrol in the mid-2000s — and successfully modernized internal affairs at CBP.
“He’s got tremendous personal integrity, he’s a very hard worker. … I was sorry he did not remain in the position of chief of the Border Patrol,” said Gil Kerlikowske, an Obama appointee who first hired Morgan to manage internal affairs when he was head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
However, Morgan never won over Brandon Judd, the Trump-friendly head of USBP’s powerful labor union. A trove of recently unearthed emails show Judd chastising Morgan shortly before Trump took office for trying to “drag the Patrol through the mud.”
“You’ve politicized your position more than any of your predecessors,” Judd wrote to Morgan at the time, according to emails published by Axios this month. Judd, who did not return a request for comment, turned the National Border Patrol Council’s executive board against Morgan as well — a development that led to Morgan’s involuntary departure from the Trump administration in Jan. 2017. Judd, however, has denied directly asking Trump to fire Morgan.
“The chief Obama gave us is a disgrace,” read a Breitbart op-ed by the NBPC board in late November 2016. The blistering critique focused on a comment Morgan had made in congressional testimony in which he told lawmakers he supported “comprehensive immigration reform.”
According to the union, his statement was “directly contrary to President-elect Trump’s comments while on the campaign trail.”
Morgan was fired two months after the Breitbart op-ed published — a move he described at the time as “heartless” and “void of any decency,” according to leaked emails . Two people close to Morgan said the emails suggested he still has enemies inside or close to the Trump administration, making him bound to face similar challenges as ICE director to those he encountered during his time at USBP.
“He had no idea who leaked them, but it’s clear that someone doesn’t want this to happen,” said the formal official who speaks with Morgan often, referring to his confirmation.
At ICE, Morgan's FBI past may pose some challenges because of a sharp rivalry and distrust between the two agencies. The FBI, as the nation's top law enforcement agency, frequently overlaps with ICE’s domestic enforcement efforts.
""There are certain parts of the country where FBI and ICE do not have a functional partnership,” said one of the former DHS officials.
A former ICE official said the feuding most often stems from jurisdictional issues: “The FBI thinks that they run everything, they’re the FBI, right? And so there’s a lot of back and forth between the two. 'Well that’s our case,' 'no that’s my case,' 'no that’s our case.’""
The same official said ICE officials feel the FBI and DOJ too often receives the attention for bringing prominent cases, even if the tip originated from an ICE referral.
“DOJ always gets the credit, and the people at [ICE] are always pissed about that,” the person said.
An ICE spokesperson told POLITICO: ""ICE often works hand-in-hand with FBI, particularly on criminal investigations and provides important support to the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces.""
Morgan has also faced charges of opportunism, with critics pointing to his appearances on Fox News — a channel Trump watches daily and has been known to pull talent from for senior roles inside his administration. Between January and May of this year, Morgan appeared on either Fox News or Fox Business 80 times, according to The Huffington Post, and often on programs hosted by Trump’s favorite hosts: Carlson, Dobbs and the “Fox and Friends” trio.
“He really liked being on TV and Fox kept inviting him back so he kept saying things a little more crazier to keep getting invited back on. Things kind of spiraled and pretty soon he realized that he was on a short list for [the ICE] nomination,” said the former ICE official.
“Why not go for it?” the official added.
But Morgan’s prolific on-air presence didn’t exclusively land him the nomination. Three people familiar with the process said he was chosen, in part, because Trump had exhausted his other options.
The president dumped his original nominee, Ronald Vitiello, amid a broader DHS shake-up in mid-April and tapped deputy ICE director Matthew Albence to take over in the interim. Albence was favored by top administration officials, including top White House immigration aide Stephen Miller, to remain in the post permanently. But he was passed over after telling people he plans to retire within a year.
Other ICE officials who might have once been interested in taking over the agency were reluctant to put their names in the hat after witnessing the personal threats that Homan and his family endured during his tenure. Trump’s sudden reversal on Vitiello’s nomination, which came without much notice to his own officials and Capitol Hill, also turned off some potential candidates.
“Ron’s a good man, but we’re going in a tougher direction,” Trump abruptly informed reporters before leaving for a trip to the border on April 5.
So Trump and acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan eventually landed on Morgan, whose “depth of experience” they described as an asset to the department.
“He will do a great job!” Trump tweeted at the time of the announcement, which surprised White House aides and DHS officials.
“Kevin McAleenan is a supporter of Morgan’s [and] speaks very well of him,” said Alan Bersin, who served as CBP commissioner under Obama. McAleenan worked with Morgan when he was deputy commissioner of CBP at the end of the Obama administration.
One outstanding question is the timing of Morgan’s formal nomination. The White House has not formally submitted Morgan’s nomination to the Senate, preventing it from scheduling a confirmation hearing, and Trump previously declared that Albence would remain in place as acting director ""pending the confirmation"" of Morgan. The ICE spokesperson deferred to the White House in response to a question on this matter. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the meantime, Morgan will run the agency in an acting capacity, working to ingratiate himself with the staff. On his first day, Morgan held a video teleconference with field agents ahead of a town hall on Wednesday.
""I can assure you, he's all in for ICE,” said the ICE spokesperson. “Even though he comes from the outside, he comes with more than 30 years of service for the United States government. He truly believes that there's a crisis at the border and he's willing to do what he can to work with Congress and to protect our national security.”"

Then we were divided on everything from war, to the women's movement, to civil rights, across the board. But our politics is broken.
“I’m not going to get down in the mud wrestling with this fella. I’m not going to do it. I don’t want to get into it. Everybody already knows who he is.”

WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT … Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL on the potential for a SUPREME COURT VACANCY, via CNN’s Ted Barrett: “Speaking at a Paducah Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Kentucky, McConnell was asked by an attendee, ‘Should a Supreme Court justice die next year, what will your position be on filling that spot?’ The leader took a long sip of what appeared to be iced tea before announcing with a smile, ‘Oh, we’d fill it,’ triggering loud laughter from the audience.
“David Popp, a spokesman for McConnell, said the difference between now and three years ago, when McConnell famously blocked Judge Merrick Garland’s ascension to the Supreme Court, is that at that time the White House was controlled by Democrat and the Senate by a Republican. This time, both are controlled by the GOP.” CNN
-- YA MIGHT NOT LIKE IT, BUT … This is broadly consistent with where McConnell has been on this issue. Here he is on March 1, 2016 (hat tip: NBC’s Frank Thorp, who dug this up): “You’d have to go back to 1888 when Grover Cleveland was in the White House to find the last time a vacancy created in a presidential year was confirmed by the party opposite the occupant of the White House. So this vacancy will not be filled this year.”

“During a packed town hall in Grand Rapids, attendees in the mostly-friendly audience gave Amash several standing ovations and heaps of praise for his solo rebellion against Trump. … Amash, who has largely avoided the media spotlight over the past week and a half, spent two hours — an hour longer than the town hall was supposed to last — reiterating his support for impeachment, defending his conservative record and taking shots at the president and congressional leaders in both parties.” POLITICO

MICHAEL CALDERONE and ZACH MONTELLARO: ""ABC, Univision to host 3rd Democratic debate"": ""ABC News, in partnership with Univision, will host the third Democratic presidential debate in September, the Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday, saying it was raising both the polling and fundraising bars for candidates to qualify.
""The debate is set for Sept. 12 and could extend to a second night, Sept. 13, if enough candidates meet the threshold to participate. The location and moderators have not yet been announced.
""Like the first two Democratic presidential debates — which are set for next month on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo and for July on CNN — the September debate and a fourth, to be held in October, will cap participants at 10 per night.
""But it will be more difficult for the nearly two dozen 2020 Democratic hopefuls to make the stage. Unlike the first and second rounds of debates, when candidates must cross either a donor or polling threshold to qualify, candidates will need to surpass both bars to make the stage for the third and fourth debates. For the September event, candidates will have to hit 2 percent in four qualifying polls, versus 1 percent in three polls for the first debates, and they will need 130,000 individual donors, up from 65,000.""

OUCH … NYT’S JENNIFER SZALAI REVIEWS MICHAEL WOLFF’S NEW BOOK: “In ‘Siege: Trump Under Fire,’ Michael Wolff Chats With Steve Bannon While the Establishment Burns”: “There are salacious details in this book — many of which Trump’s critics will want to eat up — though with so many unnamed sources, Trump’s compulsion for hyperbole and Wolff’s own journalistic record, it’s hard to know which tidbits to trust. It makes more sense to read ‘Siege’ less as a news report and more as a rhetorical gambit — a twisted bid to burnish Bannon’s anti-establishment legacy.”
-- NYT’S MARK LANDLER: “Two years ago, the author Michael Wolff parlayed his access to one of President Trump’s most powerful advisers, Stephen K. Bannon, into ‘Fire and Fury,’ a rollicking, behind-the-scenes account of Mr. Trump’s chaotic White House. The book sold more than four million copies, despite lingering questions about its accuracy.
“Now, Mr. Wolff is back with a sequel, ‘Siege: Trump Under Fire,’ which appears to rely just as heavily on Mr. Bannon. But the author’s source left the White House in August 2017 and has watched Mr. Trump’s circuslike presidency from afar since. That gives the disclosures in Mr. Wolff’s latest book a secondhand feeling — and one of his most sensational claims drew a quick, emphatic rebuttal. …
“But Mr. Wolff’s account of the purported draft indictment contained several puzzling elements. He Quote: d the title of the draft as ‘UNITED STATES OF AMERICA - against - DONALD J. TRUMP Defendant,’ while the usual formulation would be to use the abbreviation ‘v.’ for versus, not ‘against.’ All of the indictments secured by the special counsel use ‘v.’” NYT
BEHIND THE SCENES -- “Trump Undercuts Bolton on North Korea and Iran,” by NYT’s Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman: “President Trump was grousing about John R. Bolton, his national security adviser, at his Florida club not long ago. Guests heard the president complaining about the advice he was getting and wondering if Mr. Bolton was taking him down a path he did not want to go.
“For a president who runs hot and cold on nearly all of his advisers, private carping may not mean that much. But in recent days, the disconnect between Mr. Trump and his national security adviser has spilled over into public, sowing confusion around the world about America’s foreign policy, particularly on matters of war and peace.” NYT
STILL ON THE JOB … @AmbJohnBolton: “Just landed in the UAE. Looking forward to meeting with our Emirati allies tomorrow to discuss important and timely regional security matters.”
-- … AND SINGING A NEW TUNE, via WSJ’s Rory Jones in Abu Dhabi: “The White House isn’t planning a military offensive response to a U.S. assessment that Iran was behind recent attacks on tankers off the United Arab Emirates, national security adviser John Bolton said Wednesday, mirroring a conciliatory tone taken by President Trump toward Tehran.
“The national security hawk said the U.S. responded to Iran’s alleged actions by deploying 1,500 troops and military equipment to the Persian Gulf as a deterrent. The White House is ‘trying to be prudent and responsible’ in attempting to avoid war with Tehran, Mr. Bolton told reporters on a visit to the U.A.E. capital of Abu Dhabi.

ROY MOORE TO RUN AGAIN? -- “Alabama’s Roy Moore previews a potential 2020 comeback,” by NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard: “Former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore Tuesday previewed potential plans to run again for the U.S. Senate seat that he lost in upset fashion to Democrat Doug Jones in the state’s 2017 special election after multiple women accused him of past sexual misconduct.
“‘He knows that if I run I will beat Doug Jones,’ Moore tweeted after Republican Congressman Bradley Byrnes, who entered the Alabama Senate race this spring, warned voters against picking the controversial former judge as the party’s nominee again.
“Donald Trump Jr., whose father appeared at a rally on behalf of Moore days before that 2017 election, tweeted his own response to Moore, blasting the former judge for considering another bid after losing to Jones by 21,000 votes. ‘You’re literally the only candidate who could lose a GOP seat in pro-Trump, pro-USA ALABAMA,’ he wrote, adding, ‘If you actually care about #MAGA more than your own ego, it’s time to ride off into the sunset, Judge.’” NBC News

“Sanders said his campaign is working on a plan to require large businesses to regularly contribute a portion of their stocks to a fund controlled by employees, which would pay out a regular dividend to the workers.

The idea is in its formative stages and a spokesman did not share further details.

The Moneyball Fix for Immigration Policy Magazine,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/29/moneyball-fix-immigration-policy-226988," wants to overhaul the U.S. immigration system so that it stops favoring visa applicants with U.S. family ties, and instead gives priority to highly skilled applicants and those with job offers. The proposal is based on the assumption that immigrants’ educational credentials—what the administration calls “merit”—will lead to increased U.S. wages and immigrants who better integrate into U.S. culture.
Immediately after it was announced, the proposal drew criticism from all sides . Many Republicans don’t think it goes far enough to combat illegal immigration, while others on the right want total immigrant admissions to be cut. Many Democrats, meanwhile, don’t want to roll back the system’s humanitarian, family-oriented principles that have worked well over decades, and also want to resolve the status of America’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.
The whole idea of “merit” is a lightning rod in a highly charged issue. But there’s a smarter way for both sides to think about who we let in, and why. The Trump administration is on to something when it says we need a new way to evaluate immigrants, one that predicts their future success as Americans. Indeed, considering future immigrants’ contributions is now commonplace in immigration policies around the world . But the Trump administration’s idea of how to do this is too basic. Many Democrats, for their part, are too quick to dismiss any kind of evaluation as anti-humanitarian: Done right, it actually would consider family and other humanitarian factors, and likely set new arrivals up for greater success in their new country.
Call it Immigration Moneyball. Just as baseball was revolutionized with a multidimensional data-driven system for evaluating and selecting players, the U.S. can analyze far more information than it currently does to decide which immigrants will best thrive in American society and contribute to the economy—something people of all political persuasions want to see.
Right now, both sides are viewing immigrants in entirely one-dimensional ways. Imagine a system that instead considered immigrants more fully as individuals—rather than simply as skilled workers, unskilled workers or family members, as our current immigration framework does. It might, for example, find merit in whether applicants made previous visits to the United States as a student, tourist or temporary worker. Imagine a system that also tracked people’s exits from our airports, harbors and train stations, and then assigned value to an immigrant’s previous on-time departures. The system might find “merit” in youth, in fluent multilingualism, in training or work experience in trades that are in special demand at the moment, or in advanced degrees from American universities. It could prioritize immigrants who pledge to settle in rapidly depopulating regions for their first 10 years after arrival; admits could even be matched to locales likely to produce their successful employment and integration.
Imagine if all this was considered alongside whether immigrants have family in the U.S. to receive them, help them adjust and help them find work. That, too, is a predictor of likely success: Research suggests that family migrants with close existing family ties have similar economic outcomes to migrants admitted on labor visas that screen for credentials and contracts. In this light, family represents a powerful form of merit, too. And importantly—because welcoming people in need is a core tenet of American culture—the criteria might include whether admission will rescue them from countries subject to severe poverty, violence or natural disasters.
We now have the tools to discover what qualities and factors actually make immigrants most likely to succeed in the United States—and then assess would-be immigrants based on those criteria. To call the approach “Moneyball” is oversimplifying, of course; immigration, unlike baseball, doesn’t deliver easily countable runs and wins, and an immigrant’s success can and should be defined in many ways. It could mean law abidance, employment, economic mobility, business ownership, patents filed, sense of belonging or political participation.
What qualities matter most will largely be up to the government in power to decide. While we can debate what constitutes successful integration, it would be better if we actually collected and consolidated information about the extent to which admitted immigrants are making progress in these different ways. If we did, we could see which attributes known at admission best predict these different forms of success, and adjust our criteria accordingly in the future. Right now, we don’t know.

For decades, baseball was managed according to hunches and instinct. For a sport that collects more statistics than any other, much of its recruiting and game-day decision-making was based on a highly subjective je ne sais quoi .
This all ended when the Oakland Athletics began incorporating evidence-based, analytical reasoning into decision-making, an approach documented in Michael Lewis’ 2003 book, and now adopted to some extent by every Major League team. Early adopters held a major advantage before the rest of the game caught up.
Today, U.S. immigration policy looks a lot like baseball once did. Most people orient their policy preferences around their gut feelings about foreigners. Many on the left view immigrants as either hard workers who will reinforce shrinking populations or vulnerable people who must be welcomed in the spirit of humanitarianism. On the nationalist right, many view immigrants as opportunists or even (as the president himself has suggested) criminals, who come to exploit the resources of rich countries, and whose presence threatens the national culture. The debate has mostly been argued from the extremes (see fearmongering about the gang MS-13, and calls to #AbolishICE) and become unmoored from sober reasoning.
The truth is, as countless studies have shown, immigrants on average are powerful generators of economic growth, who are disproportionately employed, innovative, entrepreneurial and law-abiding—and who, on average, quickly integrate and do not compete with American-born workers for jobs, except at the lowest wages. Immigration advocates have repeated these findings more than a pitcher rehearses his windup.
But the current system is also operating with a clunky, outdated selection strategy. This is where critics have an important point: The system we have really is relatively indiscriminate , and unconcerned with predicting good outcomes.
Like baseball teams, governments and researchers already collect extensive data about admitted and prospective immigrants in every dimension of public debate: employment and welfare consumption; criminality and civic engagement; language attainment and educational achievement. Name it.
But the government doesn’t use or consolidate all this data. It hasn’t crunched the numbers to determine the full range of qualities and factors that help an immigrant succeed and contribute—how much, for example, English-speaking skills upon entry matter for longer-term workforce participation, and whether younger skilled immigrants contribute more tax dollars before retirement than older skilled immigrants with more established expertise.
Furthermore, rather than evaluate the entirety of an admission applicant’s qualifications, the U.S. government—like many others—limits their consideration to a few factors and an arbitrary interview at an embassy. Visa types are designated by the primary “purpose” of entry, as if immigrants are either workers or family members, refugees or students. It reduces each immigrant, a person with unique potential and confluence of skills, attributes and needs, to a single, artificial classification and then files her or him into a line. While particular H1-B visas, for example, might prioritize immigrants who have a specific skill and job, they take no account of humanitarian concerns, or whether that immigrant has family in the U.S.
The result is a system that ignores many indicators of immigrants’ potential. It’s like a university that selects students based on their future major, and little else.
Think about this: Would you rather grant admission to an engineer based on no other information, or to an engineer who speaks fluent English, has a sister in Detroit, and was once a high school exchange student in Omaha? The answer seems obvious.
Perhaps less obvious, would you rather grant admission to a qualified engineer without family ties or demonstrated familiarity with the U.S., or to an agricultural worker who speaks proficient English, has a sister in Detroit and was once a high school exchange student in Omaha?
More difficult, would you rather admit that agricultural worker with family ties and English skills or one with a contract offer already, who has agreed to settle in a rapidly depopulating region, but who doesn’t have family in the United States?
An admissions system informed by statistical reasoning and criteria adjustable to current needs would be able to answer these questions, selecting optimal applicants for temporary or permanent visas based on reliable predictions about the applicants’ productivity and social contributions, as well as the state of the U.S. economy at the time.
Backed by such reasoning, the engineer or agricultural worker doesn’t just look good; we will have evidence-based assurances that she is likely to actually be good.
***
Does all this require an overhaul of the existing admissions system? Yes. In addition to verifying the data we already collect from applicants, we’d need to collect more—and then build the capacity to quickly process admissions decisions. We will also need a system that processes exits as well as entries and studies immigrants’ progress once they are admitted.
Once built, the system can be adjusted according to new legislation, government research or employer recommendations with little lag time. Imagine if there were a shortage of nurses or programmers . Imagine if fertility rates dropped and social security nears insolvency. Imagine if there was a pool of immigrants already with American university credentials who were qualified for open jobs. All of these are known actualities, and a more advanced system would enable quicker adjustments.
Such a new system can also help the country incorporate more visas for circular migration that permits immigrants to regularly or seasonally enter the United States for specific work purposes and then return to their country of origin. If government agencies ever synchronize their data, renewing a visa for these and other temporary immigrants can be more like renewing a driver’s license, subject to a variety of quick checks. This will all reduce the incentive to cross the border without authorization or overstay a visa. Today, employers with low-skilled or seasonal labor needs often rely on undocumented workers, who cannot return to the U.S. if they return to their country of origin and are barred from returning for 10 years thanks to “unlawful presence” rules.
The idea that what we know about immigrants when they apply for admission predicts their ultimate social and economic contributions is one that has informed immigrant admissions in places like Australia and Canada, whose “point-based” systems evaluate applicants based on similar skill-oriented criteria. But even the Canadians—whose points-based system is the world standard—do not include criteria like family guarantors or attempts to match immigrants with certain regions.
As with any immigration policy, there will be political hurdles. Critics on the left will worry that algorithms will replace the current system, which dedicates about two thirds of all visas to family admissions. But algorithms can be weighted or overridden to continue to prioritize spouses and minor children without counting them toward quotas. And they can also be programmed to recognize more extended members of American families, who have been less likely to be admitted over the past couple decades.
Critics on the right might worry that such a meritocratic system will lead to even greater annual flows of immigrants in light of new modes of entry. However, the qualifications for entry can be raised or lowered to hit annual flow targets, and quotas—if desired—can still be applied. It is also worth acknowledging that the foreign-born represent about 15 percent of the American population—about half the share in places like Switzerland (30 percent) and Australia (29 percent), and still lower than New Zealand (23 percent), Canada (22 percent), Austria (19 percent), Sweden (18 percent), Ireland (17 percent) and elsewhere.
Other critics may worry that a system based on algorithms and points may be less transparent than the current one, and may be more subject to bad-faith inputs driven by racism or xenophobia. As I have argued before, a side effect of established points-based systems has been preference for white applicants and others from countries with stronger education systems. Giving credit for previous visits to the U.S. can have the same effect because it is easier to get visas from Western countries. But this would be offset if family ties were substantially taken into consideration. The system could also assign “merit” to people who hail from countries underrepresented in the United States—among the purposes of the diversity visa lottery that the Trump administration has proposed cutting . Furthermore, the current system is hardly transparent anyway. Consular officers and immigration judges possess enormous arbitrary power, and there are reports of line-cutting.
Ideally, a system like this should appeal to many on both sides. It will render a sense of control to those on the right, and justify maintaining current a steady flow of newcomers as the left envisions.
As in baseball, there will be plenty of exceptions, when advanced reasoning still fails to predict good outcomes. Not every immigrant will create as many jobs as Elon Musk; some will commit crimes (likely at lower rates than American citizens, according to U.S. government data). And as in baseball, there will be holdouts who don’t want to modernize the immigration system and maintain current flows, whether because of persistent prejudice or deep-seated mistrust. But as in baseball, such small-mindedness will ultimately lose.
Trump has gotten away with strategies as simplistic as a steel wall and tactics as barbaric as separating children from their parents because the debate has become symbolic and subject to our most basic instincts, which are currently calling for humanity or control.
The best way to simultaneously humanize immigrants and control their admission is to shift to a system that considers their humanity in the most complete way possible."

How did you get your start in your career? “After law school, I began my D.C. career by spending a year on Capitol Hill with Sen. Ted Kennedy’s Committee on Labor and Human Resources, which was an invaluable Washington, D.C., learning experience given the caliber and experience of the senator’s long-serving aides on the committee and in his personal office.”
What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading now or finished? And why? “Just finished ‘Astoria’ by Peter Stark, which is about the long-forgotten attempt by John Jacob Astor to settle the Pacific Northwest. Even though I’m a history buff, it is a story with which I was unfamiliar, and I think it resonated with me, particularly today, with its dual-track saga of pioneers facing incredible physical hardships both traveling across the Rockies and sailing the rough Pacific in their attempt to reach and settle what is now Oregon as the story powerfully underscores the raw perseverance that was required just to survive. It is a great classic story of human ambition meeting head on the realities of nature.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “Mental health care support in the workplace. I’ve been passionate about mental health care-related policy issues, and while much progress has been made in recent years, removal of stigma in the workplace and related support is one of the remaining areas where more can be done in the U.S. Efforts in the U.K. are hitting a tipping point and hopefully will help pave the way for more robust efforts here in the U.S. Having started my D.C. career in his father’s office, it has been wonderful to see now what Patrick Kennedy has been doing on this front with his efforts at the Kennedy Forum to carry on and champion that fight.”
What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “Despite my spending the bulk of my last 20 years running around Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, I'm much more at home enjoying the slower pace of my hometown, Richmond, and at our family farm down in southern Virginia. As a side note, spending much of my early years at that farm driving around Ford trucks and tractors also undoubtedly is the reason for my affinity for Mustang rental cars when I’m on the West Coast.”"
Mueller to make public statement on his Russia probe - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Politico Staff,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/mueller-to-make-public-statement-on-his-russia-probe-1346420,"Special counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday said he did not want to testify before Congress about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, setting up a potential clash with House Democrats.
But Mueller also sparked a new round of impeachment calls after stressing, this time in person, that he could not clear President Donald Trump of obstruction charges.
His remarks were the first time the public had heard from Mueller after two years, 199 criminal charges and 37 indictments. Mueller, who said on Wednesday that he was resigning and closing down the special counsel’s office, delivered the statement more than two months after he submitted his 448-page final report on the 22-month Russia investigation.
“I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner. I am making that decision myself,” Mueller said in remarks on camera at the Justice Department.
“Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report,” he added. “The report is my testimony.”
But Mueller — inadvertently or not — seemed to hand off to Congress the issue of whether the president should be held accountable for attempting to obstruct the Russia probe. Mueller’s report lays out several instances of attempts to stymie federal investigators without saying whether those actions rose to the level of a crime.
“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” he noted. “We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.”
In explaining his decision, Mueller seemed to nod to Congress’s power to launch impeachment proceedings.
“The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” said Mueller, who did not take questions.
The rare statement came amid negotiations between Mueller’s team and the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees for him to testify publicly about his findings — talks that have faltered in recent weeks as Mueller has sought clarity from the Justice Department on the boundaries of his would-be testimony.
Mueller's remarks will likely now put the onus on House Democrats to decide whether they want to subpoena Mueller to talk, a move that would put the two sides on a legal collision course.
Democrats sent mixed signals about their plans after Mueller spoke. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Mueller ""needs to testify before Congress,"" but House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler was more cagey.
""Mr. Mueller told us a lot of what we needed to hear today,” he said at an afternoon press conference.
Several Democrats said on Wednesday that Mueller was effectively handing things off to Congress, raising anew the specter of impeachment. Nadler, who was given a heads up before Mueller’s statement, said in a statement afterward that it now “falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump — and we will do so.” But pressed specifically about impeachment at his press conference, Nadler would only say that “all options are on the table and nothing should be ruled out.""
Others were more direct.
Justin Amash, the lone Republican lawmaker advocating for launching impeachment proceedings, tweeted: “The ball is in our court, Congress.”
Most Republicans appeared unmoved, however. ""It is time to move on from the investigation and start focusing on real solutions for the American people,” said Republican Doug Collins, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.
The White House was notified on Tuesday night that Mueller might make a statement on Wednesday and was not caught off-guard by the announcement. President Donald Trump monitored the comments from the White House, and tweeted later that “nothing changes” as a result of Mueller’s comments.
“There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you,” he tweeted.
Trump’s personal attorney Jay Sekulow said Mueller’s announcement “puts a period on a two-year investigation that produced no findings of collusion or obstruction against the President.”
Sekulow’s statement contrasts with what Mueller actually said on Wednesday, when he again outlined the findings that were out in two separate volumes of his final report. The first section outlined the campaign’s contacts with Russia but determined “that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy” between the two sides, Mueller said. The second section discussed Trump’s efforts to interfere in the Russia investigation but declined to either indict or exonerate Trump on possible obstruction of justice charges.
Mueller said that because of longstanding DOJ policy that a sitting president could not be indicted, it was “not an option” to charge Trump. But Mueller alluded to “a process other than the criminal justice system” that the Constitution provides to accuse a president of “wrongdoing.”
It was a signal many Democrats took to mean the impeachment process. Indeed, Mueller also said that one reason his team did not charge Trump was because it would be “unfair” to accuse the president of a crime “when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.” Impeachment proceedings would offer both sides a chance to make their arguments in Congress, and render a decision.
Some lawmakers even changed their stance on impeachment after hearing Mueller’s remarks.
“Robert Mueller’s statement makes it clear: Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately,” tweeted Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is running for president.
Others called the statement an impeachment referral in all but name.
“This is as close to an impeachment referral as you could get under the circumstances,” said Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who is also vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Wednesday’s statement caps a back-and-forth between Mueller and his boss, Attorney General Bill Barr, who handled the initial presentation of Mueller’s report.
Justice Department officials confirmed to POLITICO last month that Mueller wrote a letter to Barr in March complaining that a four-page memo Barr wrote characterizing Mueller’s primary findings “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the Russia investigation.
Mueller sent the letter to Barr on March 27, three days after Barr issued his four-page summary. The missive cited “public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.”
Mueller appeared to back away from that language on Wednesday. He said he “certainly” does not question Barr’s “good faith” in deciding to make most of the full report public all at once rather than heeding Mueller’s request to release certain portions of the report immediately after the investigation concluded.
“We conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the attorney general, as required by department regulations,” Mueller said. “The attorney general then concluded that it was appropriate to provide our report to Congress and to the American people.”

Driving the Day LET’S RELITIGATE: First, the nuts and bolts on the report from the nonpartisan CRS, via Pro Tax’s Brian Faler, which found that the TCJA, H.R. 1 (115) , had a vanishingly small impact all around — business investment ticked up, but not dramatically so. Regular workers didn’t see much in the way of wage growth, and the law sparked “a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy,” according to Jane Gravelle and Donald Marples.
The response: It was quick and furious from the left on Twitter, with Democratic lawmakers , congressional aides and others saying that CRS had confirmed what they said from the start — that the TCJA was a giveaway to the rich that didn’t help workers lower down the income ladder and, oh by the way, didn’t come close to paying for itself.
“Republicans tried to sell the American people a bill of goods to justify hundreds of billions of giveaways for corporations and the wealthy,” as Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, put it — noting that CRS found that the TCJA was paying for about 5 percent of its costs and sparked a lot of stock buybacks.
WHAT SAYS THE RIGHT? A couple of tax analysts from more right-leaning groups said they didn’t necessarily disagree with the data in the CRS report, but more with the conclusions the authors reached. For instance, Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute maintained that CRS downplayed the TCJA’s impact on the economy, which he noted spiked up to 3 percent even in the ninth year of an expansion. “That is not a coincidence, especially this far into an economic expansion,” Riedl said. (That, of course, could also raise questions about whether that sort of tax cut would be needed so deep into an expansion.)
BOTTOM LINE: Those responses basically underscore that not much has happened to sway people’s initial judgments on the TCJA, and it could still take awhile for a final reckoning.
“A little more than a year out, I don’t think there’s going to be much information that’s going to change people’s minds,” said Kyle Pomerleau of the right-leaning Tax Foundation, noting that administration figures like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were in the distinct minority in saying that the tax law would pay for itself.
Or as Ernie Tedeschi, who worked at Treasury under former President Barack Obama, put it : “It's very difficult to know even in retrospect what the effects of the TCJA were on GDP. But most of the sober approaches I've seen have been broadly consistent with CBO's original estimate of +30bp to real GDP growth in 2018.” (Thirty basis points equals 0.3 percent.)
NEVER ENDING EXTENDERS: The extenders draft making the rounds has Democrats proposing to roll back the TCJA’s more generous estate tax parameters two years earlier than currently scheduled — at the end of 2023, instead of 2025 — and to expand both the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. Beyond that, the draft has a fair bit of overlap with a Senate extenders and disaster relief package that Finance Committee leaders put out in the winter, as Tax Notes’ Stephen Cooper reports.
Morning Tax also got a copy of the draft circulating on K Street, but couldn’t confirm that it was a Ways and Means product. But the paper does track pretty closely with what Democrats have been talking about — Ways and Means Democrats acknowledged to Pro Tax’s Aaron Lorenzo last week that they were eyeing the estate tax as a proposed pay-for, and Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) has repeatedly talked about attaching an EITC expansion to an extenders package. In any event, proposing to put a crimp on the estate tax isn’t likely to be the breakthrough that leads to a deal.
Around the World TAKING THE TOP SPOTS: The British Virgin Islands, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands ranked 1-2-3 in the Tax Justice Network’s Corporate Tax Haven Index , with a British dependency, Jersey, coming in seventh. (Europe proper was well represented, too, with the Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg taking fourth, fifth and sixth.)
The Tax Justice Network said the countries in the top 10 in the index had driven a “race to the bottom” on corporate tax systems, as countries vie for foreign investment. The top 10 also accounted for over half of the world’s corporate tax avoidance risks, with the U.K. and its satellites themselves accounting for about a third of those risks.
BAD FOR THE BANKS: Danish voters appear likely to cast aside their current center-right government, and a Swedish bank says a more leftist replacement would be bad for Denmark’s financial industry, Bloomberg reports. Mette Frederiksen, the head of the opposition Social Democrats, is seen as the likely next prime minister, and her party has already proposed hiking taxes on banks by some 1.5 billion kroner (around $225 million) to pay for health care and education initiatives. “Overall, the suggested financing of the welfare promises is considered to be negative for the Danish banking sector,” as Handelsbanken put it. Danish banks have been under fire since Danske Bank became involved in a money laundering scandal, and Social Democrats are also said to be interested in higher taxes on dividend income and interest payments.

Phil Murphy of New Jersey has previously suggested that he wouldn’t sign a budget this summer if his Democratic colleagues in the legislature didn’t include a new tax on income over $1 million a year. But Murphy wasn’t quite as clear when discussing the matter last week, NorthJersey.com reports. ""The line in the sand is, without question, enough of the old stumbling ways of putting Band-Aids on our fiscal house,"" Murphy said after being asked if the millionaires’ tax was a line in the sand . ""So there is a line in the sand for that."" The issue, Charles Stile reports, is that Murphy doesn’t have much support in the legislature with about a month to go before the July 1 budget deadline, and both the state Senate president and Assembly speaker have disavowed their previous support for a millionaires’ tax.

Election Security AMERICA OFFLINE — The Association for Computing Machinery today asked the EAC to prohibit internet connections from all voting equipment under an updated set of voluntary guidelines. Commission Chairwoman Christy McCormick recently said the current Voluntary Voting System Guidelines prohibit internet connectivity, prompting top Senate Rules Committee Democrat Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to seek a correction. Today is the final day for public comment on the the high-level principles and guidelines for VVSG version 2.0. The current guidelines form the basis for many states’ regulations.
A blanket, “categorical prohibition on the inclusion of any connectivity-enabling devices in election-related equipment [should] include all wireless modems, radios, and any other type of equipment capable of communicating over the internet,” the association wrote . “Simply disabling such devices if installed will not suffice to protect election networks, databases and equipment.” The organization also said the guidelines should require fully auditable elections and interoperability of internal voting machine components.
HUAWEI IN COURT — “Huawei Technologies, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment supplier, said on Wednesday it has filed a motion asking the United States courts for a summary judgment on its move to get a US ban on Huawei equipment for federal agencies and contractors declared as unconstitutional,” our partners at the South China Morning Post reported. “The action comes nearly three months after Huawei filed a lawsuit against the US government in a bid to overturn a federal ban on its network gear. The company is arguing that the ban … is unconstitutional, as it singles out a person or a group for punishment without trial.” Pros can read more here .
THINK BEFORE YOU CLICK — About two-thirds of businesses saw an increase in impersonation attacks in the past 12 months, and 54 percent saw more phishing attacks, according to the email security firm Mimecast’s annual report out today. And of those who received impersonation attacks, 73 percent suffered a “direct resulting loss.” More than 6 in 10 of the 1,025 “global IT decision makers” surveyed said they expected to “suffer a negative business impact” from an email-based cyberattack, while 71 percent saw at least one attack that involved an employee unwittingly spreading malware.
Overall, 94 percent of surveyed businesses received phishing emails. Mimecast also gathered data about how businesses train their employees to avoid phishing emails. Of all regions surveyed, the United Arab Emirates had the highest percentages of businesses reporting various training programs.
WELCOME BACK FROM VACATION — A nationwide class-action lawsuit announced on Tuesday alleges that title insurance company First American failed to properly secure 885 million sensitive customer files. The lawsuit — filed in California by the same firm that got Anthem to agree to a $115 million settlement after a 2015 cyberattack exposed personal information of more than 78 million people — argues First American was negligent and violated its customer contracts in how it stored personal information.
The files, which date back to 2003, contained bank account numbers, Social Security numbers and financial and tax records. First American, one of the largest companies of its kind, has hired an outside forensic firm to determine if any customer information might have been compromised, the company said in a statement on its website. “At this time there is no indication that any large-scale unauthorized access to sensitive customer information occurred,” the company said.
MORE CLOUDS, MORE RAIN — Last week’s New York Times story on the role of the NSA-developed exploit named EternalBlue in a Baltimore ransomware attack is getting yet more guff. A number of cybersecurity experts, including one Quote: d in the story, aren’t convinced EternalBlue played a part. “The New York Times claimed a variant of a ransomware used against city governments, including Baltimore—known as RobbinHood—was re-using EternalBlue, an old, leaked NSA exploit,” tweeted Thomas Rid, a cybersecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University. “Proving that link forensically should be straightforward. So far no proof.” One of the lead reporters on the story stood by it.
YOU’RE LEFT FOREVER BLUE — Chinese government-linked hackers recently compromised government networks in two Middle Eastern countries, Palo Alto Networks revealed Tuesday. The hacking group known as Emissary Panda used the (you guessed it) EternalBlue vulnerability, and it’s related to campaigns exploiting a vulnerability that was the subject of Canadian and Saudi Arabian government warnings. Once they had a foothold, the hackers uploaded “additional tools to the SharePoint server to dump credentials, perform network reconnaissance and pivot to other systems,” the company found. “We believe the actors pivoted to other systems on the network using stolen credentials” and the EternalBlue exploit.
RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — Facebook and Twitter removed accounts linked to Iran that impersonated GOP congressional candidates in 2018 and others. … DHS said it assessed that foreign VPN apps pose a “low to moderate” impact on government operations given surveillance risks, but the agency has no way of determining how many government employees use them. … Ireland’s privacy watchdog got another five-year term.

GOOD MORNING! It’s Wednesday, May 29, and this is Morning Shift, your daily tipsheet on labor and immigration news. Send tnoah@politico.com . Follow LABOR SECRETARY MICK MULVANEY?: “President Donald Trump‘s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has seized power over the Labor Department’s rulemaking process out of frustration with the pace of deregulation under Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta,” Bloomberg Law’s Ben Penn reports . “Upon arriving at the West Wing in January, Mulvaney instituted a formalized system for settling regulatory policy and timeline disputes between White House assistants and Acosta’s top aides.”
White House officials have recently tightened their grip on the department. Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff Nick Geale will be leaving the office by the end of this week at the instruction of White House officials, after an investigation raised questions about his professional conduct. But Axios’ Jonathan Swan, who broke the Geale news, reported that a source close to the president questioned whether Geale was the problem and that Acosta could be next on the Trump cabinet chopping block. “It's not clear to me that Nick is the only problem,” the source told Swan at the time. “You take your cues from the top.""
LAWMAKERS URGE ENDING MARIJUANA WORKER POLICY: Representatives Joe Neguse (D-Col.), Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), and Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) will send a letter today urging Attorney General Barr and DHS Acting Secretary McAleenan to retract guidelines issued in April that allow denial of legal citizenship based on work in the marijuana industry -- even if the candidate for naturalization worked in one of the 33 states where the drug is legal for medical or recreational use.
The policy guidance stated that applicants “involved in certain marijuana related activities"" — indicating industry workers — may not be able to meet the ""good moral character"" benchmark for citizenship ""even if such activity is not unlawful under applicable state or foreign laws."" The Associated Press reported last month that “two people said they were denied U.S. citizenship” because of their work in the industry. More on the April guidance from POLITICO’s Lauren Gardner here .
In the Workplace GOOGLE’S FISSURED WORKPLACE: Google has about 121,000 temp and contract employees worldwide, compared to 102,000 full-time employees, The New York Times’ Daisuke Wakabayashi reports. The temp and contract workers “make less money, have different benefits plans, and have no paid vacation time in the United States, according to more than a dozen current and former Google temp and contract workers,” he writes. Google did announce in April that it will require its contractors to provide health benefits, a $15 minimum wage, and paid parental leave; this after more than 900 of its employees signed a letter protesting the company’s treatment of contract workers. But the company is not alone in its practice of outsourcing work to non-employees; “contingent labor accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the workers at most technology firms,” Wakabayashi notes.
Such outsourcing is a phenomenon that David Weil , former administrator of the Obama Labor Department’s Wage and Hour division, described in an influential 2014 book as the “fissured workplace,” and it’s a much bigger deal than the much-discussed gig economy (which, if defined as the percentage of workers employed solely as independent contractors, is not growing ). The “fissured workplace” describes the full spectrum of arms-length arrangements by which businesses over the past half-century have avoided paying payroll taxes, providing benefits and a host of legal liabilities entailed in formal employment. Some companies depend on temp agencies or other contracting companies; others avoid expanding payroll through franchising. At Google, Wakabayashi reports, “contractors handle a range of jobs, from content moderation to software testing,” and former and current workers described Google as “the employer in all but name.”
Weil argued in a 2017 essay that contracting out work “not only means lower wage growth and reduced access to benefits, but also diminished opportunities for on-the-job training, protections from social safety nets like unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation, access to valuable social networks, and other pathways to upward advancement. Taken together, the fissured workplace contributes to growing earnings inequality .” Read Weil’s 2017 essay here and more from the Times here .
2020 Watch SANDERS PRESSES ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY: Democratic 2020 presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders says his campaign is working on proposals “to require large businesses to regularly contribute a portion of their stocks to a fund controlled by employees” and to require corporations “to give workers a share of the seats on their boards of directors,” Jeff Stein reports for the Washington Post.
“ We can move to an economy where workers feel that they’re not just a cog in the machine — one where they have power over their jobs and can make decisions,” Sanders told Stein. “Democracy isn’t just the opportunity to vote. What democracy really means is having control over your life.” Robert Hockett, who teaches law and finance at Cornell University told Stein that the proposals are a sign of a “virtuous competition” between 2020 Democratic candidates “in reexamining the fundamental relationship between capital and labor.” More here .
TEACHER PAY ATOP MANY 2020 DEMS AGENDAS: Joe Biden on Tuesday joined in with many of his 2020 competitors in calling for teacher pay raises, unveiling a wide-ranging K-12 and early education plan , “targeted to increasing educator pay and leveling the playing field between rich and poor school districts,” POLITICO’s Nicole Gaudiano reports. Biden is rolling out his plan in Houston during a town hall meeting that’s part of an elaborate teachers union endorsement process led by the American Federation of Teachers, she reports.
“His rollout follows broad education proposals unveiled by other top candidates, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who also called for tripling Title I funding for low-income schools and for setting a minimum starting salary for teachers of $60,000. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) proposed spending $315 billion over 10 years to boost teacher pay, while former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has called for giving teachers a tax credit of up to $10,000.” A recent report by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that teachers were paid 21.4 percent less than similarly educated and experienced professionals in 2018. More from Gaudiano here .
In the States NEW MAINE LAW REQUIRES PAID SICK LEAVE: Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday signed into law a paid sick leave bill that would require companies with 10 or more employees in the state to offer one hour of earned paid time off, up to 40 hours, for every 40 hours worked, according to WMTW. Currently 10 states and Washington D.C. require employers to offer paid sick leave, according to the National Council of State Legislatures . Some lawmakers estimate the legislation will cover 85 percent of Maine workers, according to WMTW. The law will go into effect in 2021.
The Maine Chamber of Commerce opposes the legislation , arguing that the proposal will increase employers’ bottom lines and create “another deterrent for employers to locate or expand their businesses in Maine.” More from WMTW here .
At the Border EXCLUSIVE — DEM SENATORS QUESTION TSA BORDER REASSIGNMENTS: Nearly a dozen Senate Democrats signed onto a letter from Senator Catherine Cortez Masto Tuesday pressing Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan over the agency’s plans to reassign hundreds of TSA staff to help deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border. “TSA officials have acknowledged that moving agents to work on our southern border carries risk to our national security,” the letter says. “Taking TSA agents away from their mission depletes resources from a critical national security agency that must focus on staying ahead of the dynamic threat to aviation.” DHS has, so far, has reassigned more than 700 CBP agents and requested more than 400 volunteers from TSA's ranks, according to POLITICO’s Stephanie Beasley.
Last week , McAleenan defended the reassignments, telling House lawmakers that “We're not going to put the traveling public at risk. We're not going to reduce our security posture in any way."" The senators who signed the letter, including presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Elizabeth Warren, request that McAleenan clarify how many agents will be sent to the border, and whether reassigned agents will receive any family welfare training. Read the letter here .

MINORS ACCOUNT FOR HIGHEST NUMBER OF BORDER CROSSINGS: “Nearly 169,000 youths have surrendered at the southern border in the first seven months of this fiscal year, and more than half are ages 12 and under,” Maria Sacchetti reports for The Washington Post. “Minors now account for nearly 37 percent of all crossings — far above previous eras, when most underage migrants were teenagers and accounted for 10 percent to 20 percent of all crossings.”
Border Patrol arrested nearly 99,000 migrants at the southwest border in April, marking a 10-year high, POLITICO’s Ted Hesson reported earlier this month . More than half of those arrested were family members -- instead of the single males of a decade ago -- creating unfamiliar new problems for an administration that has made fighting illegal immigration one of its highest priorities. In response to the influx, the White House earlier this month urged Congress to provide an additional $4.5 billion in funding this year for border operations, but congressional negotiators last week declined to include it in a disaster aid bill.

Chao back in the spotlight,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-transportation/2019/05/29/chao-back-in-the-spotlight-441512,"Editor’s Quick Fix — Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao is back in the spotlight, after The Wall Street Journal found she has retained shares in a construction materials company that she promised to give up.
Story Continued Below
— Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) is just the second Democratic presidential candidate to release a comprehensive infrastructure plan, which would leverage both a gas tax increase and the rollback of a corporate tax cut to fund a range of projects.

""But off the boat they stayed a while / Then scatter cross the course / Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most / I took a walk.""
Around the Agencies BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT: Chao has retained shares in the construction materials company Vulcan Materials for more than a year from the date she promised to give them up, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing federal disclosure forms. Shares of Vulcan (which trades as VMC) have risen nearly 13 percent since April 2018, which was when Chao initially promised to relinquish them, according to her 2017 ethics agreement. The Journal said that increase has netted her a more than $40,000 gain.
Of note: “Ms. Chao’s decision to retain the shares and recuse herself from matters that might affect Vulcan stands in contrast to the way previous transportation secretaries have handled potential conflicts of interest.”
DOT says: A spokesperson told The Journal that “the ethics agreement was flawed, because Vulcan’s policy calls for directors’ deferred share units to be paid out in shares of company stock.” And the agency’s top ethics official has determined that owning the shares does not present a conflict of interest for Chao, given her recusal.
2020 Watch FIRST IN MT: Delaney jokes that he’s running for president to solve the one problem with the infrastructure bill that he introduced while still in Congress — the lack of presidential support. Today, he’s rolling out a new infrastructure plan that he argues is “a simple solution to a lot of very big problems we have as a nation.” The plan would raise the gas tax by 15 cents and then index it. Delaney would also partially roll back the 2017 corporate tax cut that changed the rate from 35 percent — which he says was “way too high” — to 21 percent, which was lower than the 25 percent rate the business community had lobbied for. Setting it at 27 percent, he claims, would raise more money than his infrastructure plan would use.
Head count: The various iterations of the infrastructure bills that Delaney introduced while in the House attracted a total of 66 Democratic co-sponsors and 49 Republicans — evidence, he argues, that he can bring the two parties together.
The plan would seed an infrastructure bank with $50 billion and give the Highway Trust Fund a one-time infusion of $500 billion. His plan would then create a suite of matching funds where the federal government pays for 80 percent of projects to make infrastructure more climate resilient, improve water systems, expand schools, address deferred maintenance (rail and bridges get a mention), build out broadband, and reach communities that have been “left behind” by other economic development initiatives. The only other 2020 candidate to release an infrastructure plan — aside from President Donald Trump, who released one in early 2018 that he’s since disavowed — is Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
Automobiles ZIPCAR'S FUTURE IN A CROWDED MOBILITY LANDSCAPE: When Car2Go and other free-roaming car-share companies first hit the streets, it may have seemed like trouble for Zipcar, with its fixed parking spaces and time commitments. But Zipcar membership has continued to grow and Sabrina Sussman, a senior manager for public partnerships and policy, recently told POLITICO that the company is still happy with its model — as old-fashioned as it may appear.
Zipcar enables “purpose-driven trips” that are longer than those used with a dockless scooter or even a free-floating shared car, Sussman said — Zipcar’s average trip length in North America is 47 miles. “We want to continue to encourage people to take transit, walk, bike all of those shorter trips,” Sussman said. “We’re really not looking to add one-mile, 0.8-mile, couple-mile trips in the congested downtown urban core.”
What about the advent of AVs? The company isn’t building an autonomous vehicle, and it doesn’t have a direct partnership agreement with vehicle developers. (However, its parent company, Avis Budget Group, is partnered with Waymo.) But Sussman argues Zipcar has a comparative advantage: “Managing a fleet of vehicles is a skill set and it’s fairly complicated. Zipcar right now has 12,000 vehicles across the globe. Of that, there’s 60 makes and models, which means 60 different oil change schedules and maintenance schedules and tires. All that is something we’ve now had 20 years of expertise learning how to manage, maintain, schedule and optimize the efficiencies around.” Remember: Uber and Lyft drivers are independent contractors who are responsible for maintaining their own cars. Also remember: That’s not going so well .
Zipcar has also spent the last 20 years setting and enforcing community standards — “returning the car on time, filling up the tank of gas, not leaving your trash behind” — with adults who inherently “don’t like to share,” according to Sussman. Plus, she said, the company’s approach to working with cities further sets it apart. “When we think about a new market or we think about expanding in a city, our first call is always to the city [to ask], ‘What are your goals? How can Zipcar help you? Is this the right fit?’” And, Sussman said, the company is happy to share data with cities.
Rail SHORT LINE GROUP BRINGS ON WELL-PLACED LOBBYIST: A railroad trade group pushing for a tax break has hired a former top aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lobby Congress, our Tanya Snyder reports . The American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association has brought on Nadeam Elshami, a former Pelosi chief of staff, and two of his colleagues at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. As Tanya writes, “They'll help the industry group fight to extend a temporary tax break first enacted in 2004 that gives smaller railroads a tax credit for the money they spend maintaining railroad tracks.” The bill has been held up in the House along with other tax extenders as Congress weighs how to move forward.
Transit METRO MELTDOWN: Six stations on the Blue and Yellow lines of D.C.’s metro system are shut down. According to DCist, some commuters said their trips took an extra 45 minutes or hour, due to shuttle bus drivers who got lost (NBC Washington reported that many of the drivers are contracted out from other states) and other factors. One bus , headed to the Pentagon, instead went to Maryland, then D.C. and ended up in Anacostia. Metro staff reportedly huddled Tuesday afternoon to work out some of the issues, but the problems continued into Tuesday evening.
