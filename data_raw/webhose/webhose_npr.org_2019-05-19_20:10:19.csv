Supreme Court Will Hear Cases On LGBTQ Discrimination Protections For Employees,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716010002/supreme-court-will-hear-cases-on-lgbtq-discrimination-protections-for-employees,"Enlarge this image The U.S. Supreme Court will take up three cases that hinge on federal discrimination laws and whether they protect LGBTQ workers when its new term begins in October. Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. Supreme Court will take up three cases that hinge on federal discrimination laws and whether they protect LGBTQ workers when its new term begins in October.
Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images The Supreme Court has accepted three cases that ask whether federal anti-discrimination laws should apply to sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, putting the court on track to consider high-profile LGBTQ issues after its next term begins this fall.
Two of the cases — Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia , and Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda — were consolidated because both include claims that employers discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. A third — R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC — involves the question of whether existing discrimination laws apply to transgender workers.
The Supreme Court granted petitions for writs of certiorari for the three cases Monday morning, adding them to their workload for the term that will start in October — meaning any decisions and opinions will emerge in the runup to the national election in 2020.
But the court also set limits as it accepted the cases. As the court's order list states, the scope of the court's review of the Harris Funeral Homes case is limited to only question ""whether Title VII prohibits discrimination against transgender people based on (1) their status as transgender or (2) sex stereotyping"" under the 1989 decision in the Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins case.
The Supreme Court's order refers to Title VII , the part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin. In recent years, lower federal courts have disagreed on whether the same protections should apply to people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. That divide can be seen in the trio of cases now up for review.
""In two of the cases, lower courts sided with the plaintiffs,"" NPR's Leila Fadel reports for our Newscast unit, ""one in Michigan where a transgender woman was fired from her job at a funeral home based on her gender identity; another, out of New York where a skydiving instructor was allegedly fired because he's gay. But in a third case in Georgia, a gay man who was fired from his job as a child welfare services coordinator lost.""
In that third case, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit turned away an appeal from Gerald Lynn Bostock last summer. Even before Bostock's appeal request was declined by the full panel, his attorneys already had asked the Supreme Court to weigh in.
As member station WABE reported , 11th Circuit judges voted 9-2 to decline Bostock's case — triggering a dissent from Judge Robin Rosenbaum, who wrote, ""I continue to firmly believe that Title VII prohibits discrimination against gay and lesbian individuals because they fail to conform to their employers' views when it comes to whom they should love.""
A similar rationale was put forth by the 2nd Circuit in the Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda case. As the American Bar Association said last spring , ""Indeed, the court found that sexual orientation is doubly delineated by sex because it is a function of both a person's sex and the sex of those to whom he or she is attracted.""
Describing the background of the Harris Funeral Homes case, Amy Howe writes for SCOTUSblog :
""In 2007, the funeral home hired Aimee Stephens, whose employment records identified Stephens as a man. Six years later, Stephens told Rost that Stephens identified as a woman and wanted to wear women's clothing to work. Rost fired Stephens, because Rost believed both that allowing Stephens to wear women's clothes would violate the funeral home's dress code and that he would be 'violating God's commands' by allowing Stephens to dress in women's clothing.""
Depending on how they are decided, the cases could be seen as either continuing a move toward greater rights and protections for LGBTQ people in the U.S. or representing a shift in momentum, four years after the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage.
In response to the news that the cases are heading to the newly conservative-leaning Supreme Court, the Human Rights Campaign called on Congress to explicitly add protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity by approving the Equality Act , which was reintroduced in the House last month."
How To Discipline Kids Without Raising Your Voice : Goats and Soda : NPR,www.npr.org,sports.yahoo.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/20/708806109/disciplining-kids-without-yelling-readers-tell-us-their-tricks?utm_source=pocket-newtab,"Disciplining Kids Without Yelling: Readers Tell Us Their Tricks Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email April 20, 2019 7:00 AM ET Michaeleen Doucleff
Twitter Enlarge this image Malaka Gharib/NPR Malaka Gharib/NPR Is it possible to raise children without shouting, scolding — or even talking to kids with an angry tone?
Last month, we wrote about supermoms up in the Arctic who pulled off this daunting task with ease. They use a powerful suite of tools, which includes storytelling, playful dramas and many questions.
Goats and Soda Can Inuit Moms Help Me Tame My 3-Year-Old's Anger? But Inuit parents aren't the only ones with creative alternatives to scolding and timeouts. Goats and Soda readers sent in more than 300 tricks for getting kids to listen without raising your voice — sometimes without even saying a word.
This story is part of a series from NPR's Science desk called The Other Side of Anger . There's no question that we're in angry times. It's in our politics, our schools and our homes. Anger can be a destructive emotion, but it can also be a positive force.
Join NPR in our exploration of anger and what we can learn from this powerful emotion. Read and listen to stories in the series here.
Here are the highlights, which have been edited for clarity and length.
Step 1: Go into Grandma Mode
The first step to no-yell parenting is to get a grip on your own anger, Inuit moms told us. As I've experienced , this is not always easy. But Veda Glover has a Jedi mind trick that's helpful: ""I consciously place my mindset into a grandmother role,"" says Glover, who's a Navajo bilingual teacher in Kirtland, N.M.
""When I first started teaching, I could feel my blood pressure rising when students wouldn't listen to me and follow directions,"" she says. ""Then I came up with a question to ask myself in these situations: 'What would my own grandmother do?' ""
This strategy ""helps me keep calm and, as a result, helps my students understand that there is no need to yell nor become upset,"" says Glover.
Step 2: Learn to give ""the look""
Instead of yelling or saying ""No,"" try deploying a stern look, says teacher Vita Osborn.
""Almost telepathically, my parents conveyed pages of information in a few short looks,"" she says. ""One serious glance from my father or mother was enough to communicate that I was displeasing them in some way.""
In traditional Inuit culture, some parents wrinkle their noses to convey ""No"" to a small child. But you can make ""the look"" with eyes wide open, eyes squinty or even a blink, as teacher Kristi McEwen's mom did.
""My mother is Yupik from southwest Alaska,"" McEwen says in her response to our callout. ""When she wanted me to stop a behavior, all she had to do was slowly but firmly blink at me and that was a stern 'No.' ""
(McEwen says her mother also had an interesting way to stop bickering between cousins: ""She would have us stand in front of her and raise our arms above our heads while she commanded, 'Don't laugh,' McEwen says. ""Of course, we were in fits of giggles before we knew it."")
FWIW: I find a stern look or nose wrinkle is highly effective in the grocery store when my 3-year-old daughter is picking up candy bars in the checkout aisle. I think she hasn't figured out yet how to try to negotiate with eyes and nose.
Step 3: Put the kids to work
When a child misbehaves or makes a mistake, several readers suggested switching from being angry to being productive.
""Imagine the child knocks over a vase that belonged to your grandmother,"" says Terry Meredith. ""Rather than get angry, I say 'Can you go get the broom so we can sweep up the pieces?' ""
Then Meredith and her child work together to fix the mistake. ""I ask 'Do you think we can glue the vase back together?' "" she says. ""Then the child is involved in cleanup and repair.""
This approach teaches children the real-life consequences of their behavior, says business owner Tracy Herman, who also puts her kids to work instead of yelling.
""As they got older, if they spilled or broke something, I'd toss the appropriate tool and say, 'Clean it up,' "" she says. ""Let go of control and provide natural consequences because that is how we learn to make choices in life.""
June Shockley raised three sons with a similar strategy and says she had a ""happy healthy home.""
""I never grounded a child in my life,"" she says. ""I would give an alternate activity.""
For example, if her son was angry with about what's for dinner, Shockley would involve the child in meal prep by taking them grocery shopping and having them help cook the meal.
""That way our sons walked a mile in my shoes,"" Shockley says.
The method also tamed sibling anger.
""If one son hit his brother, I would say, 'We need more kindness in the world. Let's go to the animal shelter and clean the cages and give hugs and kisses to the puppies,' "" Shockley explains.
Step 4: Bust out Woofie
For young kids, sometimes all it takes is a little make-believe to get them to behave, says Kathryn Burnham.
""For example, if we're running late and my 3-year-old daughter needs to put on her shoes, I've learned that yelling or putting on the shoes myself makes things worse,"" says Kathryn Burnham. But when ""Woofie"" comes along, the shoes go on easy as pie.
""I make my hand into a dog by bringing [two of] my middle fingers down to my thumb for a mouth,"" Burnham says. She calls that hand dog ""Woofie.""
""Then I'll say something like 'Can Woofie have a turn trying to put on your shoes?' And I'll make silly whining, panting and barking dog sounds while Woofie helps her put on her shoes.
""The more animated I make Woofie, the more she giggles and loosens up,"" Burnham says. ""With play, the tense situation has been turned into a fun bonding moment.""
For Penny Kronz's son, a stuffed animal often does the trick.
""When he doesn't want to join an activity, I just tell him it's time for his favorite stuffed animal to go to bed or come eat,"" Kronz says. ""Then I proceed doing the activity with the stuffed animal, and he generally will quickly come join in.""
At the end of day, sometimes Mom and Dad have to let go and let the pajamas take over the parenting, says Adele Karoly.
""When my son doesn't want to put on his pajamas, I will start having the pajamas talk to me,"" she says. ""They will say something like, 'Elliot wants to wear us? And I will answer, 'I don't think he does, let me ask him.' ""
And if Elliot says ""No""?
""I will tell the pajamas and continue to have a conversation with them,"" Karoly says. ""Eventually, he will get drawn in and accept the pajamas, and they will be so excited and give him a big hug.""

Reporter Details Neglect And Disaster In The U.S. Navy : NPR,www.npr.org,Dave Davies,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715904313/reporter-details-neglect-and-disaster-in-the-u-s-navy,"Reporter Details Neglect And Disaster In The U.S. Navy Reporter Details Neglect And Disaster In The U.S. Navy Embed Embed Navy Drops Criminal Charges Against Officers In USS Fitzgerald Collision Case
DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. In the early morning darkness of June 17, 2017, the Navy destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a cargo ship in the South China Sea. The much larger cargo vessel ripped a huge hole in the Fitzgerald, killing seven sailors. Two months later, another destroyer, the USS John S. McCain, collided with another cargo ship leaving 10 more sailors dead.
Our guest, veteran journalist T. Christian Miller, is part of an investigative team at the online news site ProPublica that looked into the crashes and problems with Navy operations that may have contributed to them. The reporters found that ships in the Seventh Fleet were chronically understaffed and that crews were often exhausted, poorly trained, and working with outdated or poorly maintained equipment and software. They also found Navy commanders had flagged the problems for years, but little was done to address them.
T. Christian Miller is a senior reporter for ProPublica. He's covered four wars, a presidential campaign and reported for more than two dozen countries. In 2016, he shared a Pulitzer Prize for an investigation into the failures of law enforcement to properly investigate reports of rape. You can find his stories about the Navy collisions, reported with colleagues Robert Federici and Megan Rose, on the ProPublica website.
Well, T. Christian Miller, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Let's start with this horrific collision, June 2017, between the American destroyer the USS Fitzgerald and this cargo vessel, the ACX Crystal. Tell us a little bit about these two vessels and the risks of a collision, should they cross paths.
T CHRISTIAN MILLER: Well, these are not two vessels that you would typically imagine ever crossing paths, much less colliding into each other. The ACX Crystal was a thousand-ton cargo ship. It was transiting into Tokyo Harbor to deliver some goods. The USS Fitzgerald was a American destroyer of the Arleigh Burke war class. It is the main destroyer which now sails the seas all over the world for the Navy. And what's unique about Arleigh Burke-class destroyers - and this includes the USS Fitzgerald - is they are designed specifically to detect any kind of incoming threat, be it a missile, another warship, an airplane from hundreds of miles away.
So the idea that a 30,000-ton, slow-moving cargo vessel could ever collide with a $1.8 billion destroyer specifically designed to avoid threats like that was an incredible thing to think of ever happening. And so when it did happen, it really shook the Navy.
DAVIES: And give us - where and when did this happen? What sort of waters were they sailing?
MILLER: Sure. So on June 17, 2017, the USS Fitzgerald was sailing off the coast of Japan. It was about 12 miles off the coast. Pretty calm night. There was a little bit of a moon so you could see across the ocean. There was no storms or anything else. And it was sailing on its way to a mission in the South China Seas. It was about 1:20 a.m. in the morning - so very early in the morning - when the ACX Crystal hit the side of the USS Fitzgerald in a collision that tore a gigantic hole in the side of the Fitzgerald.
DAVIES: So it hit the starboard side. What parts of the ship were impacted, and what specifically happened there?
MILLER: So let me try and put you on the bridge of the ship, which is where the ship is steered from and navigated from. So it's 1:20 a.m. You have about 10 or 15 people who are responsible at this hour of the night for navigating the ship through these waters off the coast of Japan. They believe they're in, basically - there's not much traffic around them. This is kind of the mindset of the people who are on the ship right now.
And suddenly, with less than a minute to go, by some estimates, they finally see this 30,000-ton freighter coming toward them. They began emergency avoidance maneuvers. It's very late in the game, obviously. What's called the officer of the deck, who is the person who's in charge of the ship at that moment, was a young lieutenant by the name of Sarah Coppock.
By all accounts, Lieutenant j.g. Coppock kind of basically panicked a little bit, and she turned the Fitzgerald right in front of the cargo ship, in an effort to dodge out of the way. It was a miscalculation. It went against all the rules of seamanship. And what she essentially did in that moment is she exposed the Fitzgerald to being hit directly by the Crystal. When that happened, the Crystal has - and let me kind of try and draw the picture for your listeners. The Crystal's a large ship; it's much higher than the Fitzgerald, much taller than Fitzgerald. And beneath the surface, it has a protruding bough. You might have seen them before; it's almost like a giant bulbous bough, which houses some of the navigation equipment.
What happens then is that the Crystal basically catches the Fitzgerald in a pincer, between its leading prow at the top and the protruding part of it in the bottom, and it punches a hole simultaneously in its sleeping quarters, where there's about 40 sailors asleep, and at the same time, it punches a hole in another sleeping quarter - and this one is occupied by one person, the captain of the Fitzgerald, Bryce Benson.
DAVIES: So this was a massive collision. I mean, the Crystal was just this huge ship with all this momentum. What happened to the sailors who were sleeping in that berth that was directly hit?
MILLER: Right. I mean, the physics of this collision are incredible to think of. Essentially, what happened is, once that collision occurs, there is a hole punched in the side of the Fitzgerald in two different places. Water begins flooding into this sleeping apartment, which is underneath the waterline. There's about 35 to 40 sailors who are asleep in the compartment at that time. They are suddenly - basically, they begin to hear shouts; people can hear shouts like, there's water on deck. Get out, get out.
So people begin to sort of stand up, and they find themselves quickly submerged in water up to their waist within seconds. And they begin having to try and evacuate in this space, and let me kind of describe this space a little bit. It's in the middle of night, of course, so there's no lights on at all in the sleeping berthing area. There's no kind of a collision with sound, and no collision alarm was sounded. So these guys were basically asleep, and the next thing they know, they're woken up by cold water flooding in, a lot of the equipment inside has been tossed aside and tumbled onto the floor. There's lockers. There's an exercise bicycle. There's - there are various chairs and just equipment - they're all floating up in this water.
The water itself is kind of laced with kind of an oily foam, which is part of the - what happens when it breaks through the hole of the Fitzgerald, the Crystal does. And so these guys were immediately, within seconds, basically fighting for their lives. And the amazing thing is that of the - 27 sailors are able to escape from this dark and pitch-black, windowless sleeping area within about 60 seconds to 90 seconds. However, not everybody does. Seven of the sailors are trapped in the room. It's not clear whether or not they ever woke up or were conscious. But all seven sailors, an autopsy later determined, died of drowning. So those seven sailors did not make it out, and that was - at the time, that was the largest seaborne accident number of fatalities that had occurred since the 1970s.
DAVIES: Wow. And one of the remarkable details I read in your story was that sailors were able to maneuver out, despite the darkness, despite the rising water and all of the debris, because they trained to do this with blindfolds because this can happen.
MILLER: Right. That's one of the things that's supposed to happen immediately when you check into a Navy ship, is you get training on how to escape your sleeping quarters while blindfolded. I mean, the Navy is well aware that you have to be able to get out your sleeping quarters in case of a flood or an attack or anything else. So it's one of the primary things they train on. One of the sailors described to it as - it even becomes something of a ritual, breaking in new sailors, because they have to have tie-on blindfold and kind of walk around, almost like Frankenstein, a monster - was how it was described to me, in terms of them being able to feel their way out of their birthing unit and up a ladder and then escaping to a safe place.
DAVIES: So there was this chaos in the births underneath, where the sailors were sleeping. The captain, his sleeping quarters were hid, and he was not on the bridge at the time; we'll talk about that some more. What happened to the ship itself?
MILLER: So that's where the physics of the crash are so incredible. What happens to the ship itself is, once the 30,000 ton and the 8,000-ton Fitzgerald collide, is that the force of the collision is so great that it actually pushes the Fitzgerald on a 360-degree rotation through the middle of the Pacific Ocean in the middle of the night. And that image was one of the striking images that kind of stained me in their reporting of the story. It's just this out of control ship which has lost all its power, lost its steering, lost its lights. There are seven crewmen who are - who were passed away in the sleeping quarters. There are people who are trying to get out of their own sleeping quarters all over.
And in the middle of this chaos, they're also doing this uncontrolled spin in the middle of the night through the Pacific Ocean. And that 360-degree spin doesn't end for five minutes; they're kind of spinning through the ocean. At the same time, the Crystal also bounces off, basically, from this collision. They - the two ships are locked side by side for a few seconds, and they split off in different direction. The Crystal then ends up heading directly for another gigantic cargo ship, and it has to maneuver out of the way as well. So there's all this kind of happening, and the dark of the ocean was a startling image for me to consider.
DAVIES: Yeah, and you describe these somewhat panicked sailors on the bridge who were trying to guide the ship; it's dark, and they're trying to see things with lights from cellphones.
MILLER: Right. As the power goes out on the entire Fitzgerald because of the force of the blow knocks out some of the generators, and so you have sailors all over the ship who are using cellphone lights from their cellphone images. There's some emergency lights that are kicking on, but it's been described to me that those lights were, you know, not enough to illuminate the entire ship.
So you have people running through the darkness. Nobody really knows what's happened - keep in mind that, too. I mean, these sailors were all asleep, and nobody really thinks that they're going to be hit by a gigantic cargo ship. So there's questions flying about - were they attacked, were they hit by a missile, did they go aground? Like, it's all complete chaos, and nobody is - there's no easy way to figure out what's happening in these immediate minutes of the aftershock because everything has been shut down.
DAVIES: Was the Fitzgerald in danger of sinking?
MILLER: So what happens to Fitzgerald is it begins to take on water, both in the sleeping compartments, and there's other compartments nearby that are connected, and they all begin to take on water. And there's sort of these - we got ahold of the deck logs, which would talk about, we now have 80 tons of water in this ship, and we have 500 tons of water we've taken on in this area. And it's almost like this building kind of count of how the ship is becoming more and more hampered by the amount of water that's flooding in and trying to figure out how to balance the ship, and it's listing to one side.
And what finally happens is they manage to stabilize the ship enough, the crew does, to lock off all the flooding boundaries to get a little bit of power in one of their main shafts so they can kind of move forward a little bit, and they begin bailing out the ship by hand because the pumps are beginning to fail, and the pumps aren't working. And so for 10 hours, they are bailing out one of the compartments by hand, all in an effort to keep this ship righted and directed home under its - mostly under its own power. And that's a 14-hour rescue mission where these sailors basically recover from this incredible, traumatic blow and are managed to pull together and get their ship back into harbor.
DAVIES: T. Christian Miller is a senior reporter for ProPublica. You can read the reports that he and his crew of investigative reporters prepared on the problems with Navy operations and the collision of the USS Fitzgerald on the ProPublica website. We'll talk some more after a moment. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF AARON PARKS' ""SMALL PLANET"")
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with T. Christian Miller; he's a senior reporter for ProPublica. He and a team of reporters investigated some troubling issues plaguing U.S. Navy operations that contributed to two deadly collisions with commercial vessels in 2017 - one of them the USS Fitzgerald. You can find their reporting on the ProPublica website.
This was a horrific disaster, but for a lot of people in the Navy, you tell us, it was not unexpected; that for years, up and down the command ranks, there were warnings about problems in the Navy operations. So let's look at the big picture - a lot of it, of course, was about resources, money. What was the pattern in the - I don't know - 10 or 20 years leading up to this that left the Navy under-resourced?
MILLER: So the Navy had made a lot of decisions in the 2000 time period to get more efficient, to try and find out ways to basically steer ships and man ships with fewer people on board by relying upon technology. A number of Navy thinkers, admirals, considered this possibility and were alarmed that what the Navy was doing was not becoming more efficient but was actually harming itself in terms of its ability to be effective in its mission.
And so when myself and my colleagues, Robert Faturechi and Megan Rose, went to look at this longer-term picture, the bigger picture of what had happened, it became clear there was a pattern where a Navy - internal Navy person - be it a three-star admiral or a high-ranking civilian, an assistant secretary of the Navy - would come forward and say, we don't think that you're putting enough resources into enough personnel, the training of those people, and then making sure those people have good equipment to work with, and instead, your focus is mostly on building ships and hoping that the crew will come later to staff up these ships. And that happened in - we found reports dating back to 2010 and earlier.
The GAO, externally, was also warning about those problems in manning, training equipment. A lot of the concern focused on what's called the 7th Fleet, and the 7th Fleet is the biggest fleet in the American Navy. It's actually the most powerful armada in the entire world. It's responsible for protecting the Pacific region and patrolling that area.
And so it's considered to be, like, one of the most strategic, one of the most important, really one of the most, kind of, hot-shot areas to work in because you're constantly, actually, deploying on missions to, let's say, go off the coast of North Korea and protect from missiles or go down in the South China Seas and confront Chinese naval vessels which are asserting their own territory there. So it's a very - it's like a ""Top Gun"" sort of operating environment, but for the Navy.
And so for these collisions to happen in the 7th Fleet was one of the shocking things - that was a sign that this wasn't just an accident. This wasn't just a one-time occurrence - that there might have been a pattern of neglect that had developed here over the years. And that's really what we try to show in our second story.
DAVIES: Let's look at some of these issues one at a time. The issue of a shortage of personnel - ships were being sent out with fewer people than they had before. Why was there a shortage?
MILLER: Why was there a shortage? The simple answer to that is the Navy had not paid enough attention to putting people into warships in Japan. The focus was on maintaining warships here, based in the United States, rather than making sure that the ships that were actually out doing patrols on a daily basis were filled. And so the mantra over in the 7th Fleet was really, we can do more with less. Like, we can get the job done, and whatever it takes, we will get that job done.
When the Navy looked at that afterwards, that's certainly a good trend in general - to believe that you can overcome adversity and get things done - but it can become dangerous if it becomes the norm. The accepted pattern is we are never going to have enough sailors. Our ships are never going to be fully certified for missions, but we're going to go out and do it anyway.
And that, essentially, was what we found had happened in the 7th Fleet area. There had been a long time of pushing these ships out without enough crew and that becoming almost a point of pride - the ability of our Navy to do that.
DAVIES: Yeah. You cited one report that showed that destroyer crews used to be 317 sailors. They were down to 254. That's a big loss. Now, there are different ways to deal with the shortage of people. People can work longer shifts or you can leave jobs simply unfilled. Did both things happen?
MILLER: Yes. There was - and both things happen in this case. Sailors talked to us about working 100-hour work weeks, for instance, on a routine basis just because that was the pace they needed to operate at in order to accomplish the jobs they had. And they talked about being exhausted and tired and uncertain of what it was that they were operating sometimes because they hadn't enough time for training.
You could also cut back on the number of missions that had occurred. That was the one thing that was not occurring is they were - the same number of missions were being conducted by the Navy with fewer people on their ships.
They also made a practice of simply operating without some personnel. For instance, with the Fitzgerald, they hadn't had the position of a senior quartermaster. And a quartermaster in the Navy is responsible for navigation on a particular shift. And so in this particular case, the Fitzgerald had had an unfilled navigator position, a quartermaster position, for more than two years. And that was not unusual is what our reporting found. It did happen in the 7th Fleet. It did happen on other ships.
But our reporting since has uncovered this is kind of a Navy-wide problem - that they're - having to kind of fully man their ships with the right people at the right time is still a difficulty for them.
DAVIES: And the quartermaster does a lot of training, right?
MILLER: Yes. This particular quartermaster position was responsible for doing a lot of the training of junior enlisted sailors. And so they were missing both of - sort of the function of their job, which is helping to move the ship around - but also, they were missing the function of their job which is to train younger, enlisted sailors on navigation.
DAVIES: Now, you write about how the navigations and control and radar systems were increasingly, you know, sophisticated and digitized. And you really have to know what you're doing to operate them. And if you're short of people and shifts are long, training suffers. How did that impact things?
MILLER: Well, so you saw, for instance, the No. 2 officer on the deck of the Fitzgerald that night later told investigators that she really wasn't sure how to operate the radar on the Fitzgerald that night. You had lots of questions about whether or not the radars had been properly fixed and whether or not the people who were using those radars had been trained in a way to operate them correctly.
For instance, some of the sailors that were the focus of the investigation were located in what's called the Combat Information Center - which is a windowless room in the center of the Fitzgerald from which a lot of the arms, ammunitions are fired. It's kind of at the heart-of-the-warship part of the warship.
And the people who were operating in the Combat Information Center testified and told us that they had never seen the approach of the cargo ship until a few, very few minutes before the collision actually happened. So this is the warship which is supposed to be designed to be looking out everywhere and finding enemy targets and defending the ship itself, and they don't even see this ship on their radar screens till about 90 seconds, perhaps, before that collision happens.
So the sailors we talked to talked about their radar not working. One of the navigational tools was being operated with a 17-year-old package of software - Windows 2000. The different equipment on the ship couldn't really talk to each other. So they were lacking, essentially, a picture of the environment around them, even though that's exactly what the equipment is supposed to do - is create a picture of the environment around them to avoid things like hitting a giant cargo ship.
DAVIES: T. Christian Miller is a senior reporter for ProPublica. After a break, he'll talk more about the events aboard the USS Fitzgerald, how the Navy responded to the collisions and what the ProPublica team is hearing from other sailors about conditions aboard their ships. Also, jazz critic Kevin Whitehead reviews a New Orleans-inspired album from drummer Herlin Riley. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF CALIFORNIA WIND ORCHESTRA'S ""THE NAVY HYMN"")
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with ProPublica senior reporter T. Christian Miller, part of a team that investigated problems in the Navy that led to two disastrous collisions between American destroyers and commercial cargo ships. The ProPublica team found that for years, crews on Navy vessels were often understaffed, poorly trained and working with obsolete or poorly maintained equipment. When we left off, Miller was describing problems aboard the USS Fitzgerald that led to its collision with a cargo vessel that killed seven American sailors.
I have to say, this is a really compelling description because you have, in some cases, a place where a critical button was taped over that I think had to do with tuning radar to focus in on a particular target. And there was another system where a sailor had to tap, I guess, the refresh button a thousand times an hour to try and keep the picture in place.
MILLER: Yeah. When we sort of dug into some of the details of how the equipment was operating or not operating on the Fitzgerald, it was a continual source of amazement that the equipment was in the state it was in. So they had had a piece of tape covering a button to help tune the radar because they hadn't been able to find the actual button to replace it. A sailor who was operating one of these radar was having to essentially operate it in manual mode, which requires you to continually refresh the screen to be able to understand the ships that are around you.
So records show that this guy had actually hit the - this refresh button a thousand times in an effort to kind of get a picture of the environment around him. And - but even him doing that - which is uncontested - he said that he had never seen more than four or five ships close enough to pose a threat to the Fitzgerald during the entire evening.
And like everyone else, he just didn't know what was happening when there finally was a collision. It was - the last seconds that anybody was aware that there was a ship approaching them.
DAVIES: And do I have this right that one of these radar systems didn't show any vessels nearby because they didn't realize they had had it set to capture stuff at a much larger distance, and so they really didn't know what they were looking at?
MILLER: Right. So the Navy has pointed out that the training of these guys should have allowed them to understand what settings are supposed to be in effect when they're patrolling the night seas, right? And when the Navy looked at where the settings were for this particular radar system, they found that it was designed to look much further away than to look much closer in.
Now, all that being said, if the radar was operating properly, it's difficult to imagine how exactly you would have seen - missed, excuse me - a big cargo ship coming towards you. Whether or not it's the long setting or the near setting, that doesn't really matter so much in picking up a vessel that's that close and that large.
DAVIES: Right. It appears that there were problems both with the equipment that was used, you know, to track and monitor, navigate the ship, as well as some of the people who were operating it. There's also, then, the question of who was actually in charge of the vessel. And you write that the captain of the vessel - Bryce Benson - seems to be a really good officer. He was not on the bridge that night. Just tell us why he wasn't there and, you know, what his instructions were, what kind of crew was there to command the ship.
MILLER: So Captain Benson had taken over the Fitzgerald about a month before. During that month, he'd tried to get his crew up to speed, to do some training. But there was constantly missions that he was having to go out and do. So he didn't have a lot of time.
So on June 17, the Fitzgerald launches from Tokyo. It's on its way to the South China Seas. Captain Benson has been working kind of nonstop getting this ship ready to go. He wants to get ahead of schedule. And he knows he's going to have an early morning.
So he decides that around 11:30 - the ship is moving out past the heaviest traffic that's outside of Tokyo - and he decides that his crew is able to take over the ship. The ship's traveling in a relatively less dense area of traffic. And he says - decides that he is going to go and retire to his cabin because he needs the rest. Basically, he kind of self-assesses that he's near exhaustion and he needs to rest to be prepared for the missions ahead of him.
DAVIES: And did he have a crew he was confident in on the bridge then?
MILLER: And so he had placed on the bridge a crew which was the result of having to juggle a lot of different decisions. He had placed - tried to compensate some weaker crew members with stronger crew members. And so you had a mixed bag onboard the ship that night steering at the time of the collision. You had the officer of the deck, who was Lieutenant J.G. Sarah Coppock. Her No. 2 had said that she wasn't that experienced in actually using the radar on deck.
There was another junior officer who was charged with kind of helping to steer the ship. He had - was basically as new as an officer could be. It was his very first night on the job by himself without help. You had another sailor on - in the bridge. It was actually the one whose person - her hands were on the wheel, the steering wheel - who had never touched the steering wheel before.
And so Captain Benson's strategy here was to balance out stronger sailors with weaker sailors. And under the conditions, he believes that he did the very best he could to balance that crew out - to accommodate the hand he was dealt, which was a ship that didn't have enough crew in the first place. The training was behind. And there were problems with the radar on the vessel. So given that - those circumstances, his belief is that he was doing the very best he could to balance out that ship.
DAVIES: You have a situation where, for a combination of reasons - I mean, the people that were supposed to be aware of ships nearby are not. And so they don't see this vessel until very late. One thing that would help, of course, would be having people watching the sea. The shortage of personnel had an impact here, right?
MILLER: Yeah, absolutely. The other thing that - especially for your listeners who are old-time Navy hands who are listeners to this show - is that the Fitzgerald did not post lookouts on the port side and on the starboard side of the ship. And those port lookouts - going back for generations - are remembered by basically anybody who served in the Navy. You always had somebody who was looking off at the right, somebody who was looking off at the left and somebody who was looking off in the rear of the ship. And that was their one job.
Because of personnel shortfalls and because of the juggling he was having to do, Captain Benson - and other captains also certainly did this - decided to forego having two dedicated lookouts on either side of the ship and instead kind of distribute that responsibility to the entire - everyone who was on the bridge to kind of be maintaining awareness of what's around you, which - that is a highly reasonable assumption to make. But it is different than having one person whose one job it is to look off to the right, look off to the left, look behind the ship.
Those two positions were traditionally filled. And they have basically fallen away in the modern Navy because of the increased demands on ships, because of the fewer personnel available, but also because of the technology. I mean, the belief is that the technology is there to protect these ships. You know, it's not as necessary as it was when you had poor radars and poor systems to have somebody just perched, looking out across the ocean.
DAVIES: So you had this circumstance where Lieutenant Junior Grade Sarah Coppock is on the bridge, and suddenly she realizes that the Crystal is much, much closer than she expected. There's another ship that she thinks may pass behind the Fitzgerald. And she's got to make some quick decisions. What happens?
MILLER: So under the international rules that cover sea traffic, she's supposed to turn right. She's supposed to go starboard. And she initially orders the Fitzgerald to go starboard to avoid the impending collision. The young man who is transmitting her orders gets confused about some of those orders and kind of freezes up. The young woman who is - actually has her hands on the control is also not certain what it is she's supposed to do.
So Sarah Coppock, realizing that her orders aren't being carried out, makes a quick change to dodge left and go in front of and avoid the oncoming Crystal. That was a calculation which goes against international maritime rules. It goes against Navy training, but it's what she felt that she could do to avoid this collision. It was - didn't pay off. She ended up steering right into the front of the Crystal, and the Crystal ends up hitting the front right part of the ship.
And in kind of a dramatic turn, Sarah Coppock - to try to figure out whether or not she has the space to turn, she actually runs out onto a small deck which extends out in front of the bridge just in time to look up and see this looming, dark superstructure of the Crystal about to crunch into her ship. And she actually has to hold onto a metal instrument that's out there to prevent from being - get tossed overboard by the impact of the collision itself.
DAVIES: Two months after this collision, there was another one. The USS John McCain collided with an oil tanker. What do we know about what led to that?
MILLER: So this was what makes it apparent that this wasn't just a one-time incident that occurred on the Fitzgerald, that this is actually more of a systematic problem and it's not just about the crew - although they made mistakes. It's also about the Navy and the - and higher-up decisions by the Navy in training and equipping these ships because one $1.8 billion destroyer being hit by a cargo ship is a black swan event - incredibly rare, hasn't happened in 40 years. For a second one to occur two months later, this time in the straits of Singapore - very similar situation.
They're approaching a heavy traffic area. This time, the captain is actually on the bridge. As they approach, another 30,000-ton oil tanker - in this case it's called the Alnic - they lose control of the steering, or they think they lose control of the steering. And there's confusion in the bridge room. And by the time they figure it out, they have actually pivoted themselves directly in front of the oil tanker, the Alnic, which, again, hits the - hits McCain, punches another hole again in a sleeping area. This happens - accident happens early in the morning hours. And in this case, a lower sleeping berthing fills. And this time, 10 sailors are drowned within seconds.
DAVIES: T. Christian Miller is a senior reporter for ProPublica. You can read reports of the investigation he and two other reporters conducted into Navy operations and the collision of the USS Fitzgerald on the ProPublica website. We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with T. Christian Miller. He's a senior reporter for ProPublica. He and a team of reporters investigated some troubling issues plaguing U.S. Navy operations that contributed to two deadly collisions with commercial vessels in the summer of 2017. You can find their reporting with some remarkable graphics on the ProPublica website.
So after these two collisions, this was a big, big deal. How did the Navy Command respond?
MILLER: So the Navy after the second collision knew that this was much bigger than any one-ship collision had been. And to their credit, the Navy opened a number of internal and external investigations into what happened. All through the fall of 2017, which is happening after the McCain collide in August of 2017, they release a series of reports. And they kind of look - what happened on the ship? What happened in the 7th Fleet as a whole? And then strategically, on the highest level, what had the Navy done or not done?
And the Navy found that there were definitely errors and mistakes made by the crew. But they also sort of highlighted a number of problems that had existed in the big Navy for a number of years, and they had to do with decisions that were made to kind of cut back on the sort of face-to-face training that had occurred or cut back on the radars they were placing on these ships. Part of this was due to Congress and cutting Navy and military budgets in general.
But part of this was decisions made by the Navy to accommodate and adjust to a smaller fleet even though they were being warned over and over again that they needed to reduce. Ultimately, they couldn't keep everything the same. You can't run the same number of missions without more ships and without more people. And that's essentially what the Navy has been trying to do - is trying to kind of keep up constant pace of missions to operate in a very dangerous world that we live in while at the same time not addressing the fact that they don't have as many people or as many ships to do it.
So the Navy investigates itself, and then it decides to do a series of accountability actions, let's call them. They fire a number of individuals - three-star admirals, two-star admirals. And they punish some crew members on the ship itself.
DAVIES: You know, when I read these pieces that you and your two co-authors wrote, I mean, you get the sense that these were problems that were endemic to the Navy for many, many years and pointed out by commanders and studies and reports. And so then in some respects, a disaster was surprising, but I'm interested in how you got that story because, you know, military culture is typically pretty closed. I mean, people respect chains of command. They follow orders. How did you get people to talk? How did they start talking to you?
MILLER: So when the story began, me and Robert Faturechi and Megan Rose all began to fan out to just talk to sources, names we had. And we all had a similar experience, which is that when we would talk to officers, to admirals, to enlisted sailors, there was a strong belief that the Navy had not learned the lessons from these two crashes. And we were all struck by - all of us are - Robert has reported on law enforcement for many years. Megan's reported on the military. Her family is filled with military. I've reported on the military for many years as well.
All of us were struck by how aggrieved and upset people were about the way Big Navy had handled the lessons to be learned from this case. So it's rare, in my experience at least, that you get active duty and non-active duty admirals willing to lend their names to a story that was critical of the Navy.
In this case, people were wanting to come forward. Whistleblowers wanted to come forward because they felt the Navy had missed signs in the past that would have prevented these collisions from ever occurring.
DAVIES: And I'm guessing you and your team have open lines of communications to sailors and commanders. What are you hearing from them about what's changing?
MILLER: So we did a piece that kind of looked at some of the feedback we got after the articles ran, and a number of sailors have said it's the same thing. There are still sailors that are running 100-hour work weeks in Japan. Ships might be sailing, for instance, with a full complement of sailors, but those sailors might not be trained in all the jobs they're supposed to do.
So it'll look like you have, you know, a full ship - fully crewed ship, but some people on that ship won't be able to do the jobs that they're supposed to be doing. We've heard that there are ships that are still kind of leaving without proper parts - all the parts they need - and they cannibalize them, taking part from one ship and adding parts to another ship.
So we haven't heard a full, you know, endorsement that everything is getting better. On the other hand, certainly there are sailors who've contacted us to say they have seen some changes, most notably in the training phases, where you definitely have more time you spend now as an officer in getting certified to be a surface war officer, which is the guys who steer our ships and fight wars with our ships. That designation is being - takes more training to get that designation, to keep that designation.
So you are seeing some people who are coming forward and saying, yeah, they've seen changes from this training. The biggest overall question is, what is the impact going to be? Have we gone far enough? Have we done enough? Are the steps taken going to make for a better Navy?
DAVIES: Well, T. Christian Miller, thanks for your reporting. And thanks for speaking with us.
MILLER: Thanks so much for having me on, Dave. I really do appreciate it.
DAVIES: T. Christian Miller is a senior reporter for ProPublica. He reported on problems with Navy operations in two deadly collisions between Navy destroyers and commercial vessels. Besides the demotions and discipline imposed after the collisions, criminal charges were brought against six officers and enlisted crew members - charges that were recently dropped.
Miller reported on problems with the prosecution earlier this month. You can find that and his stories about the Navy collisions, reported with colleagues Robert Faturechi and Megan Rose, on the ProPublica website.

"Herlin Riley's Swinging, Modern Style Shines On 'Perpetual Optimism'",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715947681/herlin-rileys-swinging-modern-style-shines-on-perpetual-optimism,"The New Orleans drummer produces jazz with its own distinct character on his new album. Critic Kevin Whitehead says Perpetual Optimism is marked by Riley's upbeat nature and attention to detail.
DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. New Orleans drummer Herlin Riley has played in some high-profile settings with pianist Ellis Marsalis and Ahmad Jamal, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and New York's Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Herlin Riley is also a bandleader who makes his own records. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead really likes his latest.
(SOUNDBITE OF HERLIN RILEY'S ""RUSH HOUR"")
KEVIN WHITEHEAD, BYLINE: Drummer Herlin Riley's quintet with Bruce Harris on trumpet. It's from the album ""Perpetual Optimism."" Riley's side folk are native or transplanted New Yorkers, but the leader lives in his hometown New Orleans. That city's musical culture stamps the band's interplay, rhythmic buoyancy and high spirits. In New Orleans music, drums and drumbeats reflect and represent centuries of African American folkways and culture. That's a legacy Herlin Riley takes seriously. He honors the elders.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""TWELVE'S IT"")
HERLIN RILEY: (Rapping) Music is the thing that can heal your soul - black or white, rich or poor, young or old. It came to me at an early age, with me all my life as I turned each page. I got a lot of knowledge from folks who taught me. We need to pass it on to people we teach. A great musician who taught a whole lot of fellas - he wrote this tune. His name is Ellis Marsalis, Ellis Marsalis, great Ellis Marsalis, the Ellis Marsalis. The dad of Branford, Wynton, Delfeayo and Jason Marsalis, Ellis Marsalis.
WHITEHEAD: On his album ""Perpetual Optimism,"" Herlin Riley does a couple things drummer-leaders like to do, such as playing drum solos within the band instead of all by himself or playing in odd time signatures. Riley plays Willie Dixon's Chicago rave-up ""Wang Dang Doodle"" in 5/4 meter, which adds an extra beat to every bar for extra swagger. It's Riley's only other vocal on the album. Check out those slinky horns behind him.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""WANG DANG DOODLE"")
RILEY: (Singing) Tell automatic Slim. Tell razor-toting Jim. Tell butcher knife-toting Annie. Tell fast-talking Fanny. We going to pitch a ball down to that old union hall. We're going to rump and trump 'til midnight. We're going to fuss and fight 'til daylight. We're going to pitch a wang dang doodle all night long.
WHITEHEAD: Herlin Riley wrote most of the music for his new album. The standout composition ""Be There When I Get There,"" with its rhythmic and interlocking phrases for trumpet and alto saxophone, sounds like drum music orchestrated. The parts fit together like different components of a drum set. Russell Hall is on bass.
(SOUNDBITE OF HERLIN RILEY'S ""BE THERE WHEN I GET THERE"")
WHITEHEAD: The members of Herlin Riley's quintet are close listeners, working together in subtle ways to feed the band's percussive texture. There's a good example on their airy reading of the standard ""You Don't Know What Love Is."" Behind Godwin Lewis' alto solo, new star pianist Emmet Cohen chimes in with high notes behind Riley's heavy beats. That adds a little extra ping to the snare drum sound.
(SOUNDBITE OF HERLIN RILEY'S ""YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS"")
WHITEHEAD: We don't have time to skim all the highlights of Herlin Riley's ""Perpetual Optimism."" The music is solidly in the suave and swinging modern style, but Riley's New Orleans-infused jazz has its own distinct character. The leader's upbeat nature and attention to detail shine through.
(SOUNDBITE OF HERLIN RILEY'S ""PERPETUAL OPTIMISM"")
DAVIES: Kevin Whitehead writes for Point of Departure and The Audio Beat. He reviewed ""Perpetual Optimism"" by drummer Herlin Riley's quartet. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR...

GLENDA JACKSON: Now we have divided in three our kingdom.
DAVIES: Glenda Jackson's now starring as King Lear on Broadway. Terry Gross talks with the 82-year-old two-time Oscar winner about her life and career. Jackson took 23 years off from acting to spend two decades as a member of the British Parliament. I hope you'll join us.

Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Coachella The precision. The energy. The limitless swag.
Fans of Beyoncé are reliving the pinnacle performance of her career once again with Homecoming , the concert documentary released on Netflix last week. The film both documents the performance and sheds light on the eight months of work — four months of putting together the run of show and learning the choreography, followed by four months rehearsals — that led up to her headlining slot at Coachella in 2018.
In the two-hour film, extended sections of the performance are intercut with behind-the-scenes clips of Beyoncé conceptualizing the show alongside the 200-plus artists — dancers, musicians, creative directors, technical staff — who helped make it possible.
Turning The Tables Beyoncé Is The 21st Century's Master Of Leveling Up All Songs Considered Beyoncé Marks Her Homecoming At Coachella 2018 As momentous as the performance was in real time, and in the days that followed, its shadow has only lengthened in the year since. As the first black woman to headline Coachella — probably America's most-visible music festival — Beyoncé set out to make a deliberate statement about black beauty, culture and fortitude. From the orchestral sampling of Southern greats like C-Murder and Juvenile to the incorporation of classic marching band fight songs, the detail woven into the performance, much of it native to the culture of historically black colleges and universities — HBCUs — was a celebration that now doubles, in the document of it, as an introduction to that culture's traditions: the big football game, the drumline battles, the homecoming concert, the steppers, the dancing dolls.
To do so authentically, Beyoncé's creative team enlisted the help of marching band members from across the country to kick up the flavor.
""I wanted a black orchestra,"" Bey says in the film (and in an interlude on Homecoming: The Live Album ). ""I wanted the steppers. I needed different characters, I didn't want us all doing the same thing. And the amount of swag is just limitless. Like, the things that these young people can do with their bodies and the music they can play. The drum rolls and the haircuts and the bodies... it's just not right. It's just so much damn swag."" Beyoncé commends the insurmountable passion and charisma of her band, calling the young performers ""the heartbeat of the show.""
To find her black orchestra, Beyoncé and her team enlisted the services of DRUMLine Live , and sought out black musicians on an individual basis. Over the weeks and months of rehearsal leading up to the show, she trusted the instincts of her assembled band to incorporate their swag in ways that were most natural to their college experiences.

""It was on my birthday — December 11, 2017 — and I was flown out the very next morning at 6 o'clock and I had rehearsal that same day. I literally got off the plane, went to the hotel room, dropped my stuff off and the car was already waiting outside for us to go. I was looking at all these women that I had seen in her concerts before and I was like, 'Oh my God. Do they know me? 'Cause these are like legends right here. You sure you want me to do this?' ""
On the family atmosphere of rehearsals
""That was my first time being away from home for an extended period of time and I felt so comfortable... I kinda miss it right now. It was a lot of long days of just working and crashing together. We all felt very, very included. We got to have a lot of input, [with] a lot of us going to college and HBCUs, so getting to see how this was formed, just the process, was amazing. It made the days not even feel long. I always left wanting to stay in rehearsal.""
On what working with Beyoncé taught her
""Before this, I have never been in a situation where everything was just so professional. Everyone was always on time. ... To see just a high standard everyone had for each other, that's the standard that I carry for my peers now and will carry for our peers from now on.""

On the legacy of the performance
""I knew it was going to be an amazing show, but I didn't know that impact that it would have, only because I have not experienced what it's like to be in an HBCU. But being a Delta [ Editor's note : Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. is a sisterhood of predominantly black, college-educated women and is part of the National Pan-Hellenic Council , an organization of nine historically African-American Greek lettered fraternities and sororities] and being in the Black Student Union at school, to see those elements made me so excited. And then, to see afterwards how many people could relate, I was thinking, 'Man, I guess I should've expected that,' because so many people relate to this culture. To see all the positive feedback made me feel so good. It really reminded me how deep we are out here.
""There's a prayer that I will always say before I perform:
""God, give me the strength to hold around your heart the strength to hold us up allow us to feel blessed embody and make us a great show. Allow us to bless somebody in a way for them to walk away with something and then do my job and then go.""
""But now, looking back at it, everyone held her up. She held us up. And we really helped people walk away with something."""
"Meal Kits Have Smaller Carbon Footprint Than Grocery Shopping, Study Says : The Salt : NPR",www.npr.org,Jonathan Lambert,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/22/716010599/meal-kits-have-smaller-carbon-footprint-than-grocery-shopping-study-says,"Enlarge this image While it may seem that heaps of plastic from meal kit delivery services like Blue Apron make them less environmentally friendly than traditional grocery shopping, a new study says the kits actually produce less food waste. Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald via Getty Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images While it may seem that heaps of plastic from meal kit delivery services like Blue Apron make them less environmentally friendly than traditional grocery shopping, a new study says the kits actually produce less food waste.
Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images Meal kit delivery services like Blue Apron or HelloFresh promise gourmet meals without the hassle of shopping for ingredients. But the environmentally conscious consumer may feel guilty about seeing all the plastic and cardboard it takes to bring that Pork and Veggie Bibimbap to their doorstep.
That guilt may be misplaced, according to a new study . The researchers argue that, pound for pound, meal kit delivery services have a smaller carbon footprint than equivalent meals bought from a grocery store and prepared at home.
The Salt Opinion: How I Learned To Face Food Waste And Plan Smarter The study , published Monday in the scientific journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling , examines the whole life cycle — from farm to garbage can — of meal kits and their grocery store equivalents, and finds that, on average, store meals produce 33% more greenhouse gas emissions than their equivalents from Blue Apron. Much of the reduced emissions stems from less food waste and a more streamlined supply chain, according to the study.
(Note: Blue Apron has been a sponsor of NPR programming.)
""Folks are really focused on the plastics and packaging in meal kits,"" says Shelie Miller , an environmental scientist at the University of Michigan who led the study. ""That's important, but it's not the full story.""
Brent Heard , a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan and first author of the study, says, ""When you zoom out and look at the whole life cycle, packaging is a relatively small contributor to the overall environmental impacts of a meal. What really ends up mattering is the quantity of food wasted throughout the supply chain.""
Food production has a huge carbon footprint. One study estimates it is responsible for 19% to 29% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. The plastic that keeps food fresh certainly contributes to food's carbon footprint. A small part of this is producing the plastic that keeps food fresh. But to get the whole picture, Heard says you need to consider emissions from fertilizer production, farm equipment and processing operations and how that food gets distributed.
A substantial chunk of food's carbon footprint is waste, much of which happens during distribution and consumption. According to a U.N. report , if food waste were a country, its production, processing and distribution would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, just behind the U.S. and China. In a study from 2010, the USDA estimated that about 31% of the food produced in the U.S. is wasted, with 10% occurring at the retail level and 21% at the consumer level. (Losses on the farm and between the farm and retailer were not estimated because of data limitations for some of the food groups.)
The researchers thought that perhaps because meal kits generally deliver only the food you need for a meal, their larger plastic footprint could be offset by savings from reduced waste.
To find out, the study's authors ordered five meals from Blue Apron and enlisted undergraduate researchers to purchase the necessary ingredients from grocery stores for the same recipes. Then they cooked both in parallel and ""measured every bit of food, plastic, bits of cardboard, everything for each type of meal,"" says Miller. ""I think they had a lot of fun.""
The Salt Grocery Stores Get Mostly Mediocre Scores On Their Food Waste Efforts For the Blue Apron meals, all food provided was used. But store meals required purchasing food in larger quantities than necessary (think a 12-pack of hamburger buns for a two-person meal). The researchers took these leftovers and estimated how much would eventually be wasted, based on USDA data about consumer habits.
For each meal type, the researchers fed their measurements into a life-cycle analysis — which incorporates existing data on emissions throughout the supply chain — to estimate the total emissions for each stage of the process: agricultural production, packaging production, distribution, supply chain losses (for example: unsold grocery store food), consumption and food waste.
It turned out that meal kits had more plastic waste than grocery store meals, but less food waste. Greenhouse gas emissions tied to distribution were also lower for kits, owing to their streamlined supply chain. Grocery stores can't always predict demand and so generally buy more food than they can sell. Meal kit services skip the brick-and-mortar stage altogether by shipping directly to the consumer, which cuts down on food waste and distribution emissions, according to the authors.
Of course, shipping meal kits to millions of households causes emissions. But these kits are delivered alongside other mail on normal routes, and the researchers found that this last stage of distribution accounted for 11% of grocery store meal emissions but only 4% for meal kits.
""This study is a good first step towards understanding the environmental impacts of meal kits,"" says Rebecca Boehm, an economist who studies food and environment at the Union of Concerned Scientists, ""but more research will be needed to understand the whole picture."" She was not involved in the new study.
""Even though it may seem like that pile of cardboard generated from a Blue Apron subscription is incredibly bad for the environment, that extra chicken breast bought from the grocery store that gets freezer-burned and finally gets thrown out is much worse, because of all the energy and materials that had to go into producing that chicken breast in the first place,"" Miller said in a press release from her university.
The kinds of foods purchased also affect the emissions profile. For emissions-intensive foods, like cheeseburgers, the researchers found that they were associated with 15% more emissions than the grocery store equivalent, mostly because cheeseburgers tend to have less food waste associated with them than other kinds of foods.
The outsize role of food production on emissions is consistent with Boehm's research as well. ""The largest share of emissions from U.S. household food purchases comes fairly early in the food supply chain at production,"" she says.
What if a consumer was extra vigilant against food waste, but still bought from the store?
""We didn't see that dramatically influencing results in any way or flipping the relationship,"" says Heard. He says this underlines the benefits of meal kits' direct-to-consumer supply chains in reducing food waste at grocery stores and distribution costs.
Boehm says future research should aim to incorporate more data on consumer behavior. For example, if a consumer stops by the grocery store on the way home from work, it can be difficult to assign emissions to grocery store food they eat at home. Boehm also notes that Americans are increasingly eating at restaurants , which could change the overall impact of meal kits compared with other meals.
Additionally, meal kit delivery services still have their environmental drawbacks. While much of the packaging material is recyclable, components like freezer packs can often be a hassle for consumers to figure out how to recycle.
Miller hopes this study will push people to think more carefully about a product's environmental impact. ""We really want to have people to think beyond just what their automatic gut reaction"" is in terms of whether a product is good or bad for the environment, Miller says.
""Yes plastic is bad, but it's not necessarily the whole environmental story,"" Miller says. ""To understand the actual environmental impacts [of food production] and how to reduce them, we need to look at the whole system."""

Michael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images One of the biggest corporations on the planet is taking a serious interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and health.
Google and its sister companies, parts of the holding company Alphabet , are making a huge investment in the field, with potentially big implications for everyone who interacts with Google — which is more than a billion of us.
The push into AI and health is a natural evolution for a company that has developed algorithms that reach deep into our lives through the Web.
""The fundamental underlying technologies of machine learning and artificial intelligence are applicable to all manner of tasks,"" says Greg Corrado , a neuroscientist at Google. That's true, he says, ""whether those are tasks in your daily life, like getting directions or sorting through email, or the kinds of tasks that doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients face every day.""
Corrado knows a bit about that. He helped Google develop the algorithm that Gmail uses to suggest replies.
The company also knows the value of being in the health care sphere. ""It's pretty hard to ignore a market that represents about 20 percent of [U.S.] GDP,"" says John Moore, an industry analyst at Chilmark Research . ""So whether it's Google or it's Microsoft or it's IBM or it's Apple, everyone is taking a look at what they can do in the health care space.""
Shots - Health News How Can We Be Sure Artificial Intelligence Is Safe For Medical Use? Google, which provides financial support to NPR, made a false start into this field a decade ago. The company backed off after a venture called Google Health failed to take root. But now, Google has rebooted its efforts.
Hundreds of employees are working on these health projects, often partnering with other companies and academics. Google doesn't disclose the size of its investment, but Moore says it's likely in the billions of dollars.
One of the prime movers is a sister company called Verily , which this year got a billion-dollar boost for its already considerable efforts. Among its projects is software that can diagnose a common cause of blindness called diabetic retinopathy and that is currently in use in India. Verily is also working on tools to monitor blood sugar in people with diabetes, as well as surgical robots that learn from each operation.
""In each of these cases, you can use new technologies and new tools to solve a problem that's right in front of you,"" says cardiologist Jessica Mega, Verily's chief medical and scientific officer. ""In the case of surgical robotics, this idea of learning from one surgery to another becomes really important, because we should be constantly getting better.""
Mega says the rise of artificial intelligence isn't that big a departure from devices we're used to, like pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, which jump into action in response to health signals from the body. ""So patients are already seeing this intersection between technology and health care,"" she says. ""It's just we're hitting an inflection point.""
That's because the same kinds of algorithms that are giving rise to self-driving cars can also operate in the health care sphere. It's all about managing huge amounts of data.
Hospitals have gigabytes of information about the typical patient in the form of electronic health records, scans and sometimes digitized pathology slides. That's fodder for algorithms to ingest and crunch. And Mega says there's a potential to wring a lot more useful information out of it.
""There's this idea that you are healthy until you become sick,"" she says, ""but there's really a continuum"" between health and disease. If computer algorithms can pick up early signs of a slide toward disease, that could help people avoid getting sick.
But medical data aren't typically collected for research purposes, so there are gaps. To close those, Verily has partnered with Duke University and Stanford University in an effort called Project Baseline , which seeks to recruit 10,000 volunteers to give tons more data to the company.

toggle caption Courtesy of James Davis Judith Washburn and her husband, James Davis, have volunteered to be subjects in Project Baseline, an effort to gather a range of detailed data to characterize and predict how people move from health to illness.
Courtesy of James Davis Judith Washburn, a 73-year-old medical librarian and resident of Palo Alto, Calif., signed up after she saw a recruiting ad. ""A couple months later, I got a call to go in, and it's two days of testing, two different weeks and it's very thorough,"" she says.
She had heart scans, blood tests, skin swabs and stress tests — a checkup on steroids, if you pardon the expression. Her husband, James Davis, decided he'd give it a go as well.
""They were having trouble finding African-American participants at the time, so I was pretty much a shoo-in,"" he says. ""I'm aware of people who donate their bodies to medical science when they die,"" he says, ""so it's sort of a way of donating your body while it's still alive.""
The retired aerospace engineer also got an added benefit. The doctors diagnosed a serious heart condition, and Davis then had triple bypass surgery to treat it.
The couple replies to quarterly questionnaires, a gizmo under their mattress tracks their sleep patterns and they each wear a watch that monitors their hearts. The watches also count their steps — sort of.
""They haven't quite figured out your exercise yet,"" Washburn says. ""In fact, I can knit and get steps!""
All this highly personal information goes into the database of a private corporation. Both Washburn and Davis thought about that before signing up but ultimately concluded that's OK.
""It depends upon what they're using it for,"" Washburn says. ""And if it's all for research, I'm fine with that.""
Here's what makes Google's position unique. Some of the most useful data could be what the company collects while you're running a Google search, using Gmail or using its Chrome browser.
""As companies like Google and other traditional consumer-oriented companies start moving into this space, it is certainly clear that they bring the capability of taking much of the information they have about us and be able to apply it,"" says Reed Tuckson , a well-known academic physician who was recently recruited to the Verily advisory board.
For example, people's browsing history can reveal a lot about what they buy, how they exercise and other facets of their lifestyles.
""We now understand that that has a great deal to do with the health decisions that we make,"" says Tuckson, who is on a National Academy of Medicine working group that's exploring artificial intelligence in medicine.
He says Google needs to tread carefully around these privacy issues, but he's bullish on the technology.
""We should remember that the status quo is not acceptable by itself and that we've got to use every tool at our disposal — use them intelligently"" to improve the health of Americans, he says. ""And I think that's why it's exciting.""
Shots - Health News Training A Computer To Read Mammograms As Well As A Doctor Tuckson isn't the only influential recruit to the effort. Verily recently brought in Dr. Robert Califf, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, as well as David Feinberg, a physician who ran Geisinger, a major health care provider based in Danville, Pa. Vivian Lee, a radiologist who headed the University of Utah's health care system, also joined Verily.
""It seems like it was a bit of a war on talent right now between Amazon and Google and to a certain extent Apple,"" says Moore, the analyst. Google needs to build credibility in the medical sphere.
""I think Google is trying to have those people that can basically proof out what Google is doing and stand up and say, 'Yes, Google can do this,' "" Moore says.
He also has his eye on what the company's investment means for the rapidly developing industry around health care and artificial intelligence. ""Anyone should take Google very seriously,"" he says.
Some big players, like Apple and Microsoft, can hold their own.
""For other AI companies that don't have those resources, they're going to have to be very judicious in picking the niches they want to target, niches that are ones that, frankly, Google is not terribly interested in,"" Moore says.
Getting the technology to work is just the start.
The health care business is ""a very complex ecosystem,"" says Dr. Lonny Reisman , a former health insurance executive who now heads HealthReveal , a company that develops algorithms to help doctors choose the appropriate therapy. Google will need to answer many questions as it enters that landscape.
Who will have an incentive to buy software based on artificial intelligence? Will it really save time or money, as advocates often assert? Or is it just the next new driver of health care inflation?
""There are all these competing forces around cost containment,"" Reisman says. It's not easy to balance innovation, access, fairness and health equity, he adds, ""so they've got a lot on their plate.""
Google's Corrado says collaborations with academics and the health care industry are key for navigating this territory.
""A big part of the way that research and development should work in this space is by having kind of a long-term portfolio of technologies that you percolate through the academic and scientific community and then you percolate through the clinical community,"" Corrado says.
For all the challenges of forging a new path into health care, Google has a potentially enormous advantage in all the data it collects from its billions of users.
Corrado says the company is well aware of the sensitivity of putting that information to use and is thinking about how to approach that without provoking a backlash.
""It has to be something that is driven by the patients' desire to use their own information to better their wellness,"" Corrado says.
In a world where people are increasingly concerned about how their personal data are exploited, that could be even more of a challenge than building the computer algorithms to digest and interpret it all.

Lost Pup Finds New Life As Humanitarian Mascot In Refugee Camp,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/22/714347857/lost-pup-finds-new-life-as-humanitarian-mascot-in-refugee-camp,"Enlarge this image Foxtrot and Gemma Snowdon of the U.N.'s World Food Programme, who rescued the lost 4-week-old puppy.

toggle caption Jason Beaubien/NPR Foxtrot and Gemma Snowdon of the U.N.'s World Food Programme, who rescued the lost 4-week-old puppy.
Jason Beaubien/NPR Cox's Bazar, a town in Bangladesh, has become the headquarters for the massive humanitarian operation to support the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees who have fled from Myanmar. But Cox's Bazar is also home to what local tourism officials tout as the ""longest sand beach in the world"" –with 75 miles of unbroken sandy coastline. Once a month those two worlds come together as international humanitarian workers from the dozens of charity groups in Cox's Bazar volunteer in a beach cleanup.
It was at one of these beach cleanups back in November that a group of staffers from the World Food Programme rescued a 4-week-old puppy, who has since been named Foxtrot.
""This puppy just appeared and started following us,"" says Gemma Snowdon, who is originally from New Zealand and now works as a communications officer with the WFP. ""And we kind of tried to discourage it, you know. Tried to get it to go back to its mum wherever its mum was but it just kept on following and following and following.""
Foxtrot was tiny and exhausted. He was severely dehydrated and far more interested in Snowdon than in trying to finding his real mum. Eventually Snowdon brought him to her office in the WFP's compound.
""I left him here overnight and honestly none of us expected him to survive because he was just so small and far too small to be away from his mum,"" Snowdon says. ""But I came in the next day and he was happily running around, and he's been running around the compound ever since.""
Under her wing, Foxtrot regained his strength. He now appears in online videos, as a voiceover narration (in the dog's voice!) talks about the important work that WFP is doing to help the Rohingya refugees. ""I'm part of the operations in the world's largest refugee camp,"" Foxtrot earnestly declares in a video while appearing to monitor a computer screen. ""I even have my own ID badge! Did you know that more than 870,000 Rohingya refugees are in need of assistance?""
The Rohingya refugees are not officially allowed to work in Bangladesh and rely primarily on the U.N.'s World Food Programme to feed themselves and their families. The WFP provides food aid, including 8,000 metric tons of rice each month, to 869,690 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.
Back at the WFP office in Cox's Bazar, not everyone was thrilled about the arrival of Foxtrot.
""I'm not really a dog person at all,"" says Binta Bajaha, who works on gender issues for WFP's Cox's Bazar operation. Bajaha is originally from Gambia but now lives in Canada. She was also at the beach cleanup when Foxtrot was ""rescued"" and didn't think the whole thing was a good idea.
""I wasn't sure what they had planned to do with Foxtrot in an office. I was like, 'What are you going to do with a dog in an office?' ""
The question may really have been what Foxtrot was planning to do with the humans in an office.
""He likes to say hello and bite a few legs here and there,"" says Zeff Kapoor, deputy emergency coordinator for WFP in Cox's Bazar, with a laugh. Kapoor describes himself as an Indian Kenyan who grew up in the U.K. He says Foxtrot has become a big presence at the compound.
""We love him. And he's here to stay now with us.""
Although soon after he arrived, it wasn't clear how long that might be. Several weeks later he got sick a second time and almost died.
""There are no vets in Cox's Bazar, which means that we weren't able to get him vaccinated,"" Snowdon explains. ""We had a terrible scare because he got parvovirus, and parvovirus has about a 90 percent mortality rate in puppies who aren't treated by a vet.""
Actually there is a vet in Cox's Bazar, but he only treats goats, sheep and cattle, and sometimes horses.
So Snowdon rallied her colleagues to try to figure out how to get Foxtrot on IV fluids. ""We managed to find a couple of nurses who would come over and put an IV drip in to give him saline solution and electrolytes and amino acids.""
She even recruited Binta ""I am not a dog person"" Bajaha for the effort to save Foxtrot.
""Lo and behold, Gemma [Snowdon] called me to bring the first-aid kit on Friday, which is the weekend here,"" says Bajaha, who months later still sounds surprised that this task fell to her. ""So I got up and went to see how he was doing. And then, you know, you actually become invested in him. Now he's part of the family whether I'm a dog person or not.""
On International Women's Day this year, Foxtrot paid Bajaha back for her medical help. He has a World Food Programme cape that he wears when he goes out in the field. It's sort of the canine equivalent of a humanitarian vest. But on International Women's Day he donned a purple Women's Day cape as he toured WFP projects — which Bajahan, with her focus on gender issues, appreciated.
""And he has his Instagram page so he makes sure that people are aware of things that we do here in Cox's Bazar for the Rohingya operation. So love him or not, Foxtrot is an asset, I guess.""
Besides his skills as a mascot, Foxtrot is quite good at fetching plastic water bottles, Snowdon adds.
When he's not at work in the largest refugee camp in the world, Foxtrot can be found at Humanitarian_Pup on Instagram, and he occasionally pops up on Twitter .

More than 300 people died and more than 500 were wounded after Sunday's attacks on churches and hotels.
Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 1:11 a.m. ET Tuesday:
The Sri Lankan government has blamed the National Thowfeek Jamaath, a little-known Muslim militant group, for the coordinated attacks on churches and hotels that rocked the island nation on Easter Sunday.
Sri Lankan Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne says the small group was aided by an international network.
""We do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country,"" Senaratne said. ""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded.""
World Death Toll Rises In Sri Lanka Explosions Carried Out On Easter Sunday The radical Islamist group has been linked to the vandalism in recent years of Buddhist statues and has earned a reputation for being against Buddhism, the country's main religion.
At least one suicide bomber involved in the explosions previously had been arrested for defacing Buddhist statues and then released ""on orders from higher authorities,"" according to Highways Minister Kabir Hashim, as reported in a local outlet.
No one claimed responsibility for Sunday's violence, but by Monday, police had arrested 40 suspects linked to the blasts, which took place at three prominent churches and three luxury hotels. They also said they found 87 bomb detonators at a bus station in Colombo, the nation's capital, according to media reports.
Among those arrested were the driver of a van allegedly used by the suicide bombers and the owner of a house where some of them lived, according to The Associated Press.
Another explosion occurred Monday near the bombed-out St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo, after bomb disposal experts tried to neutralize explosives inside a parked van. No injuries were reported.
The day was filled with funerals — accompanied by military and police protection — after a night lit by candles for victims.
Residents hung flags outside St. Anthony's Shrine to mourn the dead. Flags of mourning also were strung outside the Negombo Grand Mosque , in a fishing town where a second church, St. Sebastian's, was targeted.
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, who was not in the country during the attacks, declared April 23 as a day of national mourning. The government also said that it would compensate victims and support church reconstruction efforts, according to local media.
Victims of the attacks
More than 300 people were killed and more than 500 injured in the coordinated attacks.
Janaka Shaktivel, 28, went to a government morgue to identify his wife. ""I recognised her body from the wedding ring that she always wore,"" he told Agence France-Presse . ""I have no words to explain my feelings.""
Religion Photos: Easter Services Around The World Celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne and her daughter were killed in the blast at the Shangri-La hotel, according to Sri Lanka's Hiru News. Her daughter, Nisanga Mayadunne, had posted a photo on social media of the smiling family, writing, ""Easter breakfast with the family.""
Among the hundreds killed were 31 foreigners, Sri Lanka's ministry of foreign affairs said , with 14 people unaccounted for. They may be among the unidentified victims at the Colombo Judicial Medical Officer's mortuary, the ministry said in a statement.
At least four U.S. citizens were killed, the State Department told NPR.
One of them was Dieter Kowalski, 40, who had just arrived at the Cinnamon Grand hotel on a work trip when an explosion occurred, according to John Fallon, CEO of Pearson, where Kowalski worked as a senior leader of technical operations.
""Dieter was looking forward to an action-packed week,"" Fallon said in a statement emailed to NPR, adding that his colleagues described him as ""big-hearted"" and ""full-spirited.""
""And the fun begins,"" Kowalski posted Friday on Facebook before his flight. ""Love these work trips. 24 hours of flying. See you soon Sri Lanka!"" He posted again that he had arrived at 3 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Fallon said, ""We're angry that a good man, who took simple pleasure in fixing things, has been killed, along with many others, by evil men and women who know only how to destroy. But in our anger and despair, we remember the words of Queen Elizabeth II in the aftermath of 9/11. Grief, she said, is the price we pay for love.""
A student at Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., was also among the U.S. citizens killed. Kieran Shafritz de Zoysa was in the fifth grade.
Ben Nicholson of the United Kingdom says his wife, Anita, and their son and daughter, aged 14 and 11, were killed when a bomb exploded at the Shangri-la hotel restaurant in Colombo. ""Mercifully, all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering,"" he said, according to the BBC.
Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen , known for making his fortune in fashion, lost three of his four children in the attacks.
Kyodo News, citing government officials, reported that a Japanese woman named Kaori Takahashi died while dining with her husband and child at a restaurant in Colombo.
At least eight Indians were also killed, the High Commission of India in Colombo announced Monday . That included several members of southwest India's Janata Dal-Secular political party who were on tour in the capital. The chief minister of the government of Karnataka identified five of them as Lakshmana Gowda Ramesh, K. M. Lakshminarayan, M. Rangappa, KG Hanumantharayappa and Sri Hanumaiah Shivakumar.
Three Sri Lankan police officers who were killed in a blast during the raid of a house were recognized for their work. ""They have been posthumously promoted,"" said police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara, according to The Hindu .
More developments
A curfew imposed Sunday night was reinstated in Sri Lanka for a second night.
The president's office announced a state of emergency beginning at midnight, a move that will give the police and military broad power to detain and interrogate people suspected of involvement in the attacks.
Interpol announced that a team — experts in crime scene examination, explosives, counterterrorism and victim identification — will begin Tuesday to help Sri Lankan authorities in their investigation.
But many worry about the intangible damage the attacks have caused for a country just 10 years past a violent civil war. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed concern that the blasts could lead to political instability and called for an investigation into an intelligence warning that ministers never received.
Some observers are already calling it ""a major failure by Sri Lanka's security establishment to prevent the carnage"":
""President Maithripala Sirisena, who heads the administration, has repeatedly tried to oust [Prime Minister] Wickremesinghe, including through a failed constitutional coup late last year. 'This is a two-party government with two heads pulling in different directions,' one diplomatic source noted.""
Meanwhile, members of Sri Lanka's Muslim community continue to denounce the attacks. The National Shoora Council, an umbrella group for 18 Muslim organizations, called the events on Easter Sunday a ""dastardly act intent on seeding communal/religious conflict and destroying the national economy."""
Companies Continue To Stumble Over Racially Offensive Advertising Campaigns : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096440/companies-continue-to-stumble-over-racially-offensive-advertising-campaigns,"In the wake of a racially-insensitive ad by Ancestry, NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Nikole Hannah-Jones, a race and culture reporter for The New York Times Magazine, about why this keeps happening.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The genealogy company Ancestry has removed and apologized for an ad that featured a fictional pre-Civil War romance between a black woman and a white man.
(SOUNDBITE OF AD)
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) There's a place we can be together - across the border. Will you leave with me?
SHAPIRO: Then text says - without you, the story stops here. As many people pointed out on social media, the ad overlooks the fact that during slavery, many relationships between black women and white men were forced, not consensual.
Ancestry is just the latest company to stumble over a racially offensive advertising campaign. A couple of years ago, Nivea tried the tag line white is purity. Last year, Ram trucks aired a Super Bowl ad that paired a Martin Luther King speech with the line built to serve. And just a few months ago, Gucci apologized for a turtleneck sweater that depicted blackface. So why does this keep happening?
Well, Nikole Hannah-Jones, reporter for The New York Times, focuses on racial injustice and joins us to discuss that question. Hi.
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Hi. How are you?
SHAPIRO: I'm fine.
So how would you answer that question? Why does this keep happening? You would think that businesses would learn from the mistakes of people who have done this before. And yet, they seem to keep stepping in it.
HANNAH-JONES: I mean, I think it's happening for a few reasons. I think that, in general, we have a very unsophisticated way of understanding race and racism and the history of race and racism in this country. Many people don't really understand, particularly white Americans, that the language that they're using and the depictions that they're coming up for our advertising are offensive.
I think another reason is, a lot of times, the teams who are coming up with this advertising don't have people of color on the teams or at least people of color who can have a strong, influential role on the campaigns that come out.
SHAPIRO: We reached out to Ancestry, and they sent us a statement saying, in part, Ancestry is committed to telling important stories from history. This ad was intended to represent one of those stories. We very much appreciate the feedback we have received and apologize for any offense that the ad may have caused.
Now, I know you posted on Twitter inviting anyone who worked on or was aware of the ad campaign to send you a message and start a conversation. Did anyone reach out?
HANNAH-JONES: I heard from a couple of folks, but no one who worked directly on this campaign. What I did hear is more generally about the problems in the ad agencies - that often they are not very diverse and that if there are people of color who serve on these teams, they do not feel empowered enough to push back on some of these campaigns.
SHAPIRO: I'm thinking about the catchphrase representation matters and how this may be a pretty specific example of what exactly that catchphrase means.
HANNAH-JONES: Yeah, of course. I mean, when you think about the Ancestry campaign, it is romanticizing slavery. And it is clearly coming from the perspective of someone who wants to make it appear as if the high rates of white ancestry in black Americans' blood could have come from, you know, a loving relationship - which of course it could have - but that's the most unlikely scenario. Had you had a black person on that campaign, the chances that that came out, I think, would have been a lot less.
SHAPIRO: How do you think companies can avoid mistakes like this? Because they seem to just keep making them.
HANNAH-JONES: (Laughter) I mean, one, you need to actually have people from diverse racial backgrounds on your marketing teams. I think you need to also have focus groups and introduce these campaigns before you roll them out. And you have to empower the people of color if you do have them on your team. It doesn't do any good if the only people of color on your teams are the least senior, who can raise an objection and that objection is not heard. We also shouldn't let white people off the hook in this case. So a white person who actually has an interest in these things could understand and raise a red flag, as well.
The whole job of marketing people is to understand and to know the people whom they're marketing to. So in some ways, it just feels like laziness. Like, you didn't actually do the type of research that you probably did in every other aspect of the campaign to see if maybe this wasn't a good idea.
SHAPIRO: That's Nikole Hannah-Jones of The New York Times. Thanks so much for talking with us today.
HANNAH-JONES: Thank you.

"In 'Choked,' Beth Gardiner Looks At The Origins Of The Clean Air Act : NPR",www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096400/in-choked-beth-gardiner-looks-at-the-origins-of-the-clean-air-act,"In 'Choked,' Beth Gardiner Looks At The Origins Of The Clean Air Act In 'Choked,' Beth Gardiner Looks At The Origins Of The Clean Air Act Embed Embed
NPR's Audie Cornish talks with environmental journalist Beth Gardiner about the origins of the Clean Air Act, which she writes about in her book Choked: Life and Breath in the Age of Air Pollution.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Today is Earth Day, a tradition begun in 1970 as the environmental movement was gaining momentum. Climate change wasn't yet on the agenda, but pollution was capturing the public's attention. The air quality in American cities from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh to New York City was found to be terrible. And amid all of that, an obscure Senate subcommittee began holding hearings about what to do about it. Those hearings eventually led to the Clean Air Act, signed into law by Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970.
Environmental journalist Beth Gardiner recalls this history in a new book. It's called ""Choked: Life And Breath In The Age Of Air Pollution."" Welcome to the program.
BETH GARDINER: Thanks for having me.
CORNISH: So your book looked at air pollution in a number of countries, but we want to talk about a chapter that discusses the development of the Clean Air Act here in America. And you call this a landmark moment for public health. How come?
GARDINER: Well, the Clean Air Act of 1970 was really a revolutionary piece of legislation for its time. And I think in retrospect, it really stands as one of the most consequential laws in modern American history. A couple of congressionally commissioned studies since 1970 have found - literally - that the regulations enacted under the Clean Air Act have saved millions of American lives since that time and trillions of dollars.
So that's an extraordinary impact. It's one that's sometimes invisible to us. We obviously don't know if we haven't had a heart attack, haven't had an asthma attack, haven't lost a loved one because the air was cleaner than it otherwise would have been. But nonetheless, the science demonstrating that that's true is very solid.
CORNISH: You also call this the start of a new era in America's modern history - in what way?
GARDINER: Well, the Clean Air Act really changed, in many ways, the conception of government's role and gave to the federal government both the power and the responsibility to protect Americans' health. One of the most revolutionary pieces of this very innovatively designed law was a provision which elevated public health as a priority above all others in the setting of air quality standards for the entire country. It put public health over and above corporate profit and cost in determining what amounts of pollution would be allowed in Americans' air.
CORNISH: But that hasn't stopped it from being challenged, right? How has it weathered those challenges?
GARDINER: Well, it's been up and down over the years. And I think what we're seeing right now is a really sort of unprecedented assault on the Clean Air Act and the enforcement of the Clean Air Act by the Trump administration. Obviously, I think, we've all become familiar over the last few years with the idea of climate change denial. But I think what we're now seeing in the Trump years is actually air pollution denial.
So the science around air pollution is very strong. And what it tells us is that as levels of pollution in the air go up, levels have all sorts of health problems go up, whether it's heart attacks and strokes or dementia and premature births. And the link between air pollution and ill health is very powerful when it comes to justifying regulation. So if you want to begin to roll back those regulations, a pretty effective way to do it is to try to cast out on the science.
CORNISH: Can we talk about criticism of the law itself, though? I mean, one is that it's applied too broadly, right? And that as air quality has improved, the goalposts have moved. And one of the conservative regulatory experts you spoke to said, look, this is an example of federal government overreach. Do those critics have a point?
GARDINER: Yeah, I mean, that certainly has been the view on the right and in the Republican Party and from many quarters over, you know, this isn't fair and you keep moving the goalposts. One of the problems has been that it's built into the Clean Air Act that it is updated every five years in accordance with the science.
And what the science has found in its progress over the decades has been disturbing from a health perspective. And it's also been sort of onerous from a regulatory perspective because those findings are that levels of pollution that years ago were thought to be safe actually are still killing people. America's air is much cleaner now than it was back in 1970, but a hundred thousand Americans still die every year from the effects of air pollution. That's a lot of people.
CORNISH: As you travel the world reporting on air pollution in other countries, did you gain an appreciation for what the U.S. was able to accomplish with the Clean Air Act?
GARDINER: Yeah. I think as I traveled around the world, I could see actually in clearer and clearer focus that America's progress since 1970 is a real success story. I went to China, and officials there are trying to sort of replicate the achievements that we've had here in the United States. And it's, you know, I guess sort of ironic to see the United States undermining its own Clean Air Act enforcement capability as other countries begin to try to replicate it.
CORNISH: Beth Gardiner is author of the book ""Choked: Life And Breath In The Age Of Air Pollution."" Thank you for speaking with us.

No Official Winner Has Been Declared Nearly A Month After Thailand's General Election,www.npr.org,Michael Sullivan,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096450/no-official-winner-has-been-declared-nearly-a-month-after-thailands-general-elec,"No Official Winner Has Been Declared Nearly A Month After Thailand's General Election No Official Winner Has Been Declared Nearly A Month After Thailand's General Election Embed Embed Heard on All Things Considered Michael Sullivan
Weeks after Thailand voted for the first time since a 2014 military coup, the results are still not official. There are signs that the junta is set on clinging to power.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
It's been nearly a month since Thailand's general election. Though there's still no official winner, many expect the pro-military party to prevail. The military seized power in 2014 and promised a return to democratic rule. Five years later, that promise appears hollow. Michael Sullivan reports from Bangkok.
MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Even before the election, nobody really believed the idea that the Thai military would voluntarily exit the political stage.
THITINAN PONGSUDHIRAK: I think the military junta backed by the army is now intending to stay for the long haul at all costs.
SULLIVAN: That's Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University explaining how the military has been busy cementing its continued role in Thai politics with a new military-drafted constitution, a new junta-appointed Senate and a new way of allocating seats in parliament to ensure no single party won an overwhelming majority in this election as parties loyal to the military's nemesis, deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, had done in the previous three.
DAVID STRECKFUSS: This was an exercise in making Thailand look democratic when, in fact, it was not; it is not. So call it what you want. It's still putting lipstick on the pig.
SULLIVAN: David Streckfuss is an independent scholar who lives in Thailand's northeast. He was surprised the military-backed party didn't perform better at the polls.
STRECKFUSS: They did quite badly given that they had five years of total domination over the Thai government. At the end of the day, 74% of the Thai population voted against them.
SULLIVAN: After the unofficial results were announced, a coalition of anti-military parties quickly claimed the results showed they had enough seats to form a coalition government - prematurely it turns out.
PAUL CHAMBERS: All of a sudden, the military-appointed election commissioners suddenly say we have to look again and maybe recalculate.
SULLIVAN: That's Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University who thinks the commissioners will try to recalculate in the pro-military party's favor. The junta-appointed election commission vehemently denies any bias. But the junta has another problem it didn't see coming, says David Streckfuss - a new anti-military party with a charismatic leader that finished a strong third in last month's election.
STRECKFUSS: With their hyper-focus on trying to end any sort of influence of Thaksin Shinawatra was that they missed a whole new generation and a whole new movement that the Future Forward was able to create. And this party did remarkably well, and that is exactly why it's being targeted now.
SULLIVAN: Earlier this month, the party's leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, appeared at a police station and was charged with sedition in connection with an anti-junta protest he attended more than three years ago. Outside this station, Thanathorn, surrounded by supporters, defiantly held up the three-finger salute from ""The Hunger Games,"" an early symbol of resistance to the 2014 coup.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
THANATHORN JUANGROONGRUANGKIT: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: Thanathorn told the crowd he's innocent of the sedition charge and two more brought against him. The military denies the charges are politically motivated. Paul Chambers isn't buying it.
CHAMBERS: I can promise you next they're going to dissolve the Future Forward Party, and then it's going to be smooth sailing for a pro-junta coalition.
SULLIVAN: But even a pro-junta coalition will still have to face a feisty and formidable opposition in the House, a recipe for political gridlock and more discontent. David Streckfuss...
STRECKFUSS: It's going to be a perilous time for the military. People are watching, and there's a whole new game in town with the Future Forward Party. And it's quite unpredictable.
SULLIVAN: Final results, in theory, are expected May 9. For NPR News, I'm Michael Sullivan in Bangkok. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Where The Trump Administration Stands On Election Hacking After The Mueller Report,www.npr.org,Miles Parks,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096431/where-the-trump-administration-stands-on-election-hacking-after-the-mueller-repo,"The Mueller report further highlighted a major risk to the political system: hackers accessing sensitive internal deliberations. As the 2020 election nears, campaigns are stepping up their security.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Even though special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference was a look back at 2016, it will also serve as a guiding document for election officials and campaigns hoping to play defense going forward. It remains unclear, however, how serious President Trump will be about deterring interference in 2020. Over the weekend, his defense attorney and surrogate Rudy Giuliani said this on CNN about Russian efforts to help the Trump campaign.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RUDY GIULIANI: There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.
CORNISH: Joining us now is Miles Parks. He's covering voting and election security for NPR. Welcome to the studio.
MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hi there.
CORNISH: What do we know about what the Trump administration is doing in terms of the Russian election interference?
PARKS: Well, in terms of messaging, they seem really caught in the middle. Since President Trump took office, he's tried to position himself as a president who's really hard on Russia. He signed sanctions into law in 2017 in his first year in office. And his administration was celebrating last week when the Mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between Russia's actions in 2016 and his campaign.
At the same time, Giuliani's comment here presents a really problematic idea that tracks along with some of President Trump's public statements. Russia broke the law leading up to 2016 to get a hold of the Democratic emails that got - that ended up on WikiLeaks. And yet the president's attorney here is refusing to kind of condemn that election interference. And you remember during the campaign President Trump publicly called on Russia to try to find Hillary Clinton's, quote, unquote, ""missing emails."" He also, since he's taken office, has kind of seeded doubt in the idea that Russia was behind the hack at all despite his intelligence - his own intelligence agencies being very clear about that. So at this point, I think it's fair to say that there is a very ambiguous public facing, at least, policy toward election interference.
CORNISH: How worried are experts about Russians - or about Russia trying to do what they did again?
PARKS: So we know that everyone agrees that the U.S. election in 2020 remains a very real target. Here's the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, at a Senate hearing earlier this year.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DAN COATS: We assess that foreign actors will view the 2020 U.S. elections as an opportunity to advance their interests. We expect them to refine their capabilities and add new tactics as they learn from each other's experiences and efforts in previous elections.
PARKS: Whether it's the Russians, though, is a slightly different question. I talked to Eric Rosenbach, who leads a program at Harvard University that helps election officials and campaigns kind of beef up their cybersecurity. And he said he actually thinks Russia may be less involved because of all the attention that's been paid to them over the last couple of years.
ERIC ROSENBACH: I'm actually now more concerned about the North Koreans or the Iranians.
PARKS: Cyberwarfare is just a lot cheaper than some of the more traditional forms of aggression, so Rosenbach says you can expect a number of nation states to be involved in this space going forward.
CORNISH: I was going to ask. Are campaigns more prepared than they were?
PARKS: I think the short answer to that seems to be yes. Rosenbach says it is at least. He's had a number of presidential campaigns call him personally and ask for their advice in terms of beefing up their cybersecurity. I think when you look at the broader picture, though, there's going to be Senate campaigns in 2020. There's going to be hundreds of House races. Are those campaigns as well going to be as prepared both resource-wise and awareness to protect against the sort of hacks we saw in 2016? I think that is the bigger question.
CORNISH: That's NPR's Miles Parks. Thanks for your reporting.
PARKS: Thank you.

Trump Administration Sends Warning To Countries That Continue To Import Oil From Iran,www.npr.org,Michele Kelemen,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096391/trump-administration-sends-warning-to-countries-that-continue-to-import-oil-from,"Trump Administration Sends Warning To Countries That Continue To Import Oil From Iran Trump Administration Sends Warning To Countries That Continue To Import Oil From Iran Embed Embed
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is warning countries they could face U.S. sanctions unless they stop importing oil from Iran.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The Trump administration is sending a warning to China, India and others. Stop importing oil from Iran, or risk U.S. sanctions. It's part of a pressure campaign meant to force Iran to change its behavior. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports the U.S. is facing some pushback on this approach.
MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Ever since the Trump administration pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, the U.S. has been ramping up sanctions and calling on countries around the world to stop buying Iranian oil. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had given eight importers a six-month grace period, but now that is coming to an end.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: Today I'm announcing that we will no longer grant any exemptions. We're going to zero - going to zero across the board.
KELEMEN: His aides would not say what kind of sanctions countries might face if they continue to import Iranian oil. There are some big U.S. trading partners in the mix, including China, India and Turkey. China said the U.S. is reaching beyond its jurisdiction and taking unilateral action. Turkey's foreign minister said the sanctions will not serve regional peace and stability. But the State Department's point person on Iran, Brian Hook, says this pressure campaign is meant to force Iran to behave like a normal country.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BRIAN HOOK: It is very hard to imagine a peaceful and stable Middle East if you accept the status quo of Iran's expansionist foreign policy.
KELEMEN: Proponents of the Iran nuclear deal known as the JCPOA say it's working to keep Iran's nuclear program in check. But Pompeo says it doesn't address U.S. concerns about Iran's destabilizing activity, and the sanctions which he says have already denied Iran more than $10 billion should force Iran back to negotiations.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
POMPEO: And if they're prepared to come to the table and negotiate those things to get to that outcome, fantastic. If not, the campaign with which we've been engaged since, frankly, the administration took office but more clearly since the president's decision to withdraw from the JCPOA - that campaign will continue.
KELEMEN: The administration is not leaving much room for diplomacy, says Ariane Tabatabai, an Iran expert with the Rand Corporation.
ARIANE TABATABAI: The administration's stated goal is to get the Iranians to return to the negotiating table and get a big-for-big deal. But I don't think the administration is doing enough to signal to the Iranians that the diplomatic channel is open, that if they do come back to the table, that sanctions will be removed and the administration is willing to stick by its word.
KELEMEN: Tabatabai says the U.S. seems more interested in forcing the Iranian regime to collapse. And though she doesn't see either side pushing for war, she worries about miscalculations. Today Secretary Pompeo was putting Iran on notice.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
POMPEO: We've made clear to Iran's leaders that if Americans are attacked, we will respond in a serious way.
KELEMEN: And respond to any threats to Americans from Shia militias supported by Iran. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

The Latest On The Easter Sunday Terrorist Attacks In Sri Lanka,www.npr.org,Lauren Frayer,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096384/the-latest-on-the-easter-sunday-terrorist-attacks-in-sri-lanka,"The Latest On The Easter Sunday Terrorist Attacks In Sri Lanka The Latest On The Easter Sunday Terrorist Attacks In Sri Lanka Embed Embed
Sri Lanka is blaming a Muslim militant group for the Easter attacks that left nearly 300 dead and wounded 500 others. The nation has a complex ethnic and religious tapestry and a history of conflict.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
So a number of arrests in Sri Lanka, and the government there has named an Islamist militant group it believes carried out yesterday's attacks. For more on that group, we called on NPR's Lauren Frayer. She reports on South Asia from Mumbai.
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: So Sri Lanka's health minister came out of an emergency government meeting and named this group, calling it the National Thawahij (ph) or Thawahid Jaman (ph). We couldn't quite understand how he pronounced it. But he called it a local domestic Muslim group.
It's not a famous group. It's not a household name. It did first make headlines for vandalizing Buddhist statues. It was reportedly involved in some clashes two years ago near where one of the church bombings was yesterday.
CORNISH: But vandalizing statues is very different from the scale of the attack that we saw this weekend.
FRAYER: Right. I mean, what we saw was spectacular coordinated attacks. And Sri Lanka's Cabinet spokesman said, this couldn't have been done without international help. He said this was not confined to a local Sri Lankan group. I mean, look at the targeting of churches. Your thoughts immediately go to al-Qaida or ISIS, these, you know, big global extremist networks. We don't have a claim of responsibility here to help us decipher this.
CORNISH: We're seeing some reporting that the government may have had some forewarning about these attacks but that word never got out. What more have you learned?
FRAYER: So that's what many politicians coming out of this emergency meeting today said, that there were warnings about this local Muslim group weeks in advance, but that they weren't raised to the highest level of government and that the prime minister was not made aware of those threats.
The prime minister himself seemed pretty angry. He called the security response to those warnings inadequate. That may be why officials have been able to say pretty quickly that all the suicide bombers were Sri Lankan nationals. They may have had some clue as to who these people are - were beforehand.
CORNISH: All right. Lauren, let's step back for a moment. When most of us think of Sri Lanka, maybe we know the long civil war that finally ended about a decade ago, but that civil war did not involve Christians. Is that right?
FRAYER: So that conflict was started with a separatist insurgency by ethnic Tamils. It was a secular conflict. Ethnic minority Tamils - mostly Hindu - were fighting for independence from ethnic Sinhalese Buddhists, who make up the majority of the country - around 70 percent of Sri Lanka. It was a bloody 26-year civil war. There were many tens of thousands of people killed. But as you said, it ended a decade ago.
Sri Lanka was just about to celebrate 10 years of peace. At the height of this conflict, there were bombings like this. They did happen in the capital Colombo at shopping malls, hotels popular with tourists. But violence like this has not been the norm for a long while.
CORNISH: Similarly, the Muslim community - is there any connection there in terms of violent groups?
FRAYER: There's really been no history of violent Muslim extremism in Sri Lanka. And so if this is a Muslim extremist attack, it would be unprecedented. I mean, this is - this illustrates the ethnic and religious makeup of Sri Lanka. As I said, it's a majority Buddhist country, about 70 percent. But it has significant Hindu, Muslim and Christian minorities.
And the interesting thing about the Christian community, which seems to be targeted with these bombings at churches on Easter Sunday, is that the Christian community really straddled the conflict during the civil war. You have Christians who are ethnic Tamils. You also have Christians who are ethnic Sinhalese. So they really were sort of outside and kind of a group that could have bridged the conflict and did.
Today, we saw, you know, funerals are under way for these victims. And we saw the funeral for a 13-year-old girl. Her father is a Muslim, and her mother is Catholic. And that just shows you the kind of mixed families Sri Lanka has.
CORNISH: That's NPR's Lauren Frayer in Mumbai, India. Lauren, thanks for your help.

Sri Lanka Declares State Of Emergency After Deadly Terrorist Attacks,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096377/sri-lanka-declares-state-of-emergency-after-deadly-terrorist-attacks,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Kris Thomas, a reporter for Roar Media, a digital news site in Sri Lanka, about the latest news concerning Sunday's terrorism attacks in the country.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
We begin this hour with Sri Lanka, where the government has declared a state of emergency. Yesterday, a series of bombings across the island nation killed nearly 300 people; some 500 more were wounded. Many of the bombs went off at churches during Easter Mass. Although no individual or group has claimed responsibility, the government is now blaming a little-known jihadist group.
Kris Thomas is a reporter for Roar Media, a digital news site in Sri Lanka, and he joins us from the capital city, Colombo. Welcome.
KRIS THOMAS: Hello.
SHAPIRO: Tell us what you saw when you visited the sites of the attacks today.
THOMAS: I was able to visit two of the churches that were attacked yesterday. And most of the areas were cordoned off to the public, and even the media was not allowed to enter into the location.
So what we saw from outside was complete devastation. The first thing you see when you go to the churches is the glass scattered all over the ground. And the walls have been perforated with ball bearings that were thrown across the room and the premises after the explosion. Even the altars have been riddled with small metal pieces. This is what we saw from outside. It was truly devastating.
SHAPIRO: And I understand that in addition to these attacks on churches that targeted worshippers during Easter, there were also attacks on high-end hotels that were...
THOMAS: Yes.
SHAPIRO: ...Popular with tourists.
THOMAS: Yes. The bombs went off in restaurants in all three hotels right where tourists and locals were basically enjoying their Easter brunch with their family. Many of the people started circulating images of those who had died, images that they had put up right before the attack, of them enjoying Easter with their family and loved ones.
SHAPIRO: And so today, a day after the attack, how are people in Colombo and across Sri Lanka feeling? Is there a fear of more danger, more attacks? Do people feel safe?
THOMAS: Definitely, there is a bit of a tension. The day has started off all right. Things were quite calm. Life seemed to resume right after. But given time, there were several incidences where suppose that suspects were arrested by the police, which led to the public providing information to police of various suspicious items being found in public area.
There were several occasions where the public was evacuated so that the police can conduct search operations. It started off fine, but tension has grown. And now it has come to a point that curfew has been imposed again for the second day. And the tension could only to get more worse.
SHAPIRO: Now, we mentioned that Sri Lanka's government has declared a state of emergency. I know there's been a social media blackout. That's one reason we're talking to you over a very scratchy phone line. What else does this mean in practical terms?
THOMAS: First of all, it's actually a conditional state of emergency, which means that curfew will only be imposed for a specific amount of time. As for the investigation, there have been 24 known individuals who have been arrested. The police have not divulged information as to what their identities are or whether they belong to any organization.
But the police are also saying that the actual number of arrested suspects cannot be divulged at the moment because of the severity of the situation, severity of this crime. What they're saying is any vital information can impede their investigation. So they're not divulging any information at all except for the information that has already been publicized by politicians and various other groups.
SHAPIRO: Kris Thomas is a reporter in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Thank you for speaking with us.
THOMAS: Thank you.

toggle caption Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. Supreme Court will take up three cases that hinge on federal discrimination laws and whether they protect LGBTQ workers when its new term begins in October.
Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images The Supreme Court has accepted three cases that ask whether federal anti-discrimination laws should apply to sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, putting the court on track to consider high-profile LGBTQ issues after its next term begins this fall.
Two of the cases — Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia , and Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda — were consolidated because both include claims that employers discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. A third — R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC — involves the question of whether existing discrimination laws apply to transgender workers.
The Supreme Court granted petitions for writs of certiorari for the three cases Monday morning, adding them to their workload for the term that will start in October — meaning any decisions and opinions will emerge in the runup to the national election in 2020.
But the court also set limits as it accepted the cases. As the court's order list states, the scope of the court's review of the Harris Funeral Homes case is limited to only question ""whether Title VII prohibits discrimination against transgender people based on (1) their status as transgender or (2) sex stereotyping"" under the 1989 decision in the Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins case.
The Supreme Court's order refers to Title VII , the part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin. In recent years, lower federal courts have disagreed on whether the same protections should apply to people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. That divide can be seen in the trio of cases now up for review.
""In two of the cases, lower courts sided with the plaintiffs,"" NPR's Leila Fadel reports for our Newscast unit, ""one in Michigan where a transgender woman was fired from her job at a funeral home based on her gender identity; another, out of New York where a skydiving instructor was allegedly fired because he's gay. But in a third case in Georgia, a gay man who was fired from his job as a child welfare services coordinator lost.""
In that third case, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit turned away an appeal from Gerald Lynn Bostock last summer. Even before Bostock's appeal request was declined by the full panel, his attorneys already had asked the Supreme Court to weigh in.
As member station WABE reported , 11th Circuit judges voted 9-2 to decline Bostock's case — triggering a dissent from Judge Robin Rosenbaum, who wrote, ""I continue to firmly believe that Title VII prohibits discrimination against gay and lesbian individuals because they fail to conform to their employers' views when it comes to whom they should love.""
A similar rationale was put forth by the 2nd Circuit in the Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda case. As the American Bar Association said last spring , ""Indeed, the court found that sexual orientation is doubly delineated by sex because it is a function of both a person's sex and the sex of those to whom he or she is attracted.""
Describing the background of the Harris Funeral Homes case, Amy Howe writes for SCOTUSblog :
""In 2007, the funeral home hired Aimee Stephens, whose employment records identified Stephens as a man. Six years later, Stephens told Rost that Stephens identified as a woman and wanted to wear women's clothing to work. Rost fired Stephens, because Rost believed both that allowing Stephens to wear women's clothes would violate the funeral home's dress code and that he would be 'violating God's commands' by allowing Stephens to dress in women's clothing.""
Depending on how they are decided, the cases could be seen as either continuing a move toward greater rights and protections for LGBTQ people in the U.S. or representing a shift in momentum, four years after the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage.
In response to the news that the cases are heading to the newly conservative-leaning Supreme Court, the Human Rights Campaign called on Congress to explicitly add protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity by approving the Equality Act , which was reintroduced in the House last month."

toggle caption Frank Franklin II/AP 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks to local residents in Queens, N.Y. Warren wants the federal government to forgive hundreds of billions of dollars in existing student loan debt.
Frank Franklin II/AP Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has issued another big policy proposal as part of her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. This one concerns higher education.
Election 2020: Opening Arguments Sen. Elizabeth Warren Blasts Big Tech, Advocates Taxing Rich In 2020 Race Warren proposes that the federal government write off hundreds of billions of dollars in existing student loan debt.
The amount of debt that would be eligible for forgiveness would vary by income, but an independent expert analysis submitted as part of her plan suggests that three-quarters of households would see all their federal student loans forgiven. In addition, the analysis notes, getting rid of this debt would reduce the racial wealth gap.
The debt cancellation plan, according to her post on Medium , ""cancels $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with household income under $100,000"" and ""provides substantial debt cancellation for every person with household income between $100,000 and $250,000.""
Beyond the student debt plan, Warren calls for eliminating tuition at all public two- and four-year colleges, an idea introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2016 presidential race. She would also create a fund of at least $50 billion specifically for historically black colleges and universities. And she would cut off all federal subsidies to the for-profit college sector, which has been roiled by various scandals and large-scale closures in the past decade.
The projected total price tag: $1.25 trillion over 10 years. Warren says it would be paid for by a new tax on multimillionaires and at least partially offset by new economic growth. Federal agencies have calculated in the past that the current $1.5 trillion of outstanding student loans could be impacting consumer spending and demand for mortgages — so canceling many of those loans could indeed goose the economy.
NPR Ed Fact-Check: Bernie Sanders Promises Free College. Will It Work? Warren is not the only 2020 Democratic primary candidate with ideas about lowering the cost of college. Besides Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris of California has called for ""debt-free college,"" and last year she, Warren, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York signed on to a bill called the ""Debt-Free College Act."" Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas has also backed free community college.
Warren's proposal, however, is unusual for the amount of debt she would cancel outright, as well as her idea of withdrawing support from the for-profit college sector.
Warren also has a longer track record on this issue than most candidates. ""Student loan collectors have power that would make a mobster envious,"" she told the The Wall Street Journal back in 2005, when she was a Harvard law professor; she was referring in part to the lack of bankruptcy protection for these loans.

Losses Continue To Mount After Recent Midwest Flooding,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715902263/losses-continue-to-mount-after-recent-midwest-flooding?station=KXJZ_FM,"Floods in Nebraska tore out major highways and railroad lines and destroyed levees. In addition to rebuilding lives, residents of some small towns face hours long detours to buy basic supplies.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Here in the United States, the devastating floods in the Midwest last month caused billions of dollars in damage, and those losses are still mounting. As Frank Morris from member station KCUR reports, the final tally of those losses will likely include entire communities torn apart by this disaster.
FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Lynch, Neb., with just 200 residents, is tucked away on the South Dakota line. It seems like a remarkably successful town.
(SOUNDBITE OF BOWLING BALL STRIKING ALLEY)
KEVIN THOMPSON: To have, like, a hospital, you know, theater - it's all run by volunteers. And then we've got the bowling alley here.
MORRIS: Kevin Thompson (ph) is the local electrician.
THOMPSON: We got a couple bars. And we got Faith's BBQ (ph) down the street.
MORRIS: But this town's in trouble. The grocery store is for sale. Employee Georgia Courtney (ph) is worried about losing her job and finding a place to live.
GEORGIA COURTNEY: Well, I'm homeless right now, but I'm staying with friends. There's a lot of us displaced that are trying to find a place to go, a place to live or whatever. But there's not that much housing in this town.
MORRIS: Not since last month's flood when Ponca Creek, running through Lynch, jumped its banks, swamping about a third of the town, setting off a chain reaction that threatens to unravel this tightknit community.
TAMARA SMITH: Everybody would really like to stay here, but we don't have the housing. I mean, there's just not enough room.
MORRIS: Tamara Smith (ph) lost her home. She's disabled and worries that the tiny hospital here will soon close, so she's moving.
SMITH: It's a rough time for everybody, and it's going to get a lot rougher.
MORRIS: The flood hit the only sector bringing money into this area - agriculture. Ranchers lost cattle, hay to feed them and, in some cases, access to pastures. Diane Heiser (ph) says she and her husband may sell out and leave.
DIANE HEISER: It's tough. And we live, really, in paradise. I mean, this is gorgeous. This valley here is absolutely beautiful. But the economics are just - and they're not getting any easier. It just gets harder and harder and harder to make it.
MORRIS: And it's not just Lynch. Last month's flood is forcing a reckoning in ravaged towns and farms across parts of four states.
PAT SHELDON: Well, I don't think most people in Bartlett will comeback.
MORRIS: Farmer Pat Sheldon (ph) is talking about Bartlett, Iowa - population 50 - on the southwest edge of the state, flooded by the Missouri River.
SHELDON: I don't think there's hardly anybody in McPaul that will come back. I mean, they've had water up to their eaves or higher. The town that I grew up in, around Percival, we might be lucky if half the residents come back.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, I guess I'll take a hotdog then.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: OK.
MORRIS: In Glenwood, Iowa, volunteers are serving lunch to flood victims from little towns nearby here.
SHARON STEWART: My name's Sharon Stewart (ph), and I'm from Pacific Junction, Iowa.
MORRIS: An old railroad town close to the Missouri River and prone to flooding. But Stewart says the crests never reached her house - until last month, when it took 12 feet of water. She says many of Pacific Junction's 450 people are like her, lifelong residents who won't be going home.
STEWART: They can't go back and face this again. Knowing that everything they had is gone, it's kind of like a death.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: You want to drive down the road, down that way...
MORRIS: Farther downstream, Richard Oswald (ph) farms near Rockport, Mo. But he's not farming today.
RICHARD OSWALD: Well, I've heard people say, well, I guess it's going to be a summer off because you can see all the water on the fields around us. And these fields over here to your right, those are fields that I farm. And they're completely covered with water. There's still 5 feet of water on that field.
MORRIS: The deluge broke records here and came up neck deep in a place where Oswald had never in his 69 years seen flooding before - the house where he was born and where he's lived most of his life.
OSWALD: Well, I'm not going to go back to that house. And I'm not going to let anybody else live in that house because I don't think it's going to be safe.
MORRIS: He's concerned about mold and future floods amplified by climate change and river management. There's also the threat of aging dams upstream from here giving way. But with all that hanging over his operation, Oswald is just not ready to give up farming this land.
OSWALD: I've even had people that I was - and that I am am friendly with who, when this occurred, said - well, it's just time to let this all go back to nature down here. Well, that's my farm.
MORRIS: It's clear that last month's flood is straining - sometimes breaking - tight bonds between farmers and their land and between small-town residents and their lifelong communities. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris.

World After Sri Lanka Attacks, Islamist Group Blamed And Victims Named Police in Sri Lanka have arrested 40 suspects since a wave of deadly suicide attacks Sunday killed more than 300 people and wounded hundreds more . President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday granted the military sweeping powers to arrest and detain suspects.
World Death Toll Rises In Sri Lanka Explosions Carried Out On Easter Sunday According to The Associated Press, among the suspects arrested were the driver of a van allegedly used by suicide bombers, and the owner of a house where some of the attackers lived. Most of the people arrested are Sri Lankans, but police are also investigating whether foreigners were involved in the attacks.
Politicians emerged from an emergency meeting Monday pointing fingers at a little-known local Muslim group, National Thowfeek Jamaath. They said all seven suicide bombers who attacked Christian churches and prominent hotels across the island nation on Easter Sunday were Sri Lankan nationals; however, they also said the suspects could not have succeeded in the highly coordinated attacks without international help.
At least one fresh blast shattered nerves in the traumatized capital, Colombo, where schools and offices were ordered shut Monday and Tuesday. A vehicle exploded as police tried to defuse explosives found in it, near one of the churches attacked the day earlier. An unexploded device was also found on the road to the capital's international airport, and 87 detonators were found scattered at the city's main bus depot.
Funerals began on Monday, as more of the victims were identified. Most were Sri Lankan, many from the country's Christian minority, and had been attending Easter Mass. Tuesday was declared a national day of mourning, according to the president's office.
More than 30 foreigners from a dozen countries were among the dead, including at least four Americans.
Here are some key things to know.
Who was targeted?
Many of the victims were attending three Christian churches that were targeted — St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo, St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo, 20 miles north of the capital, and Zion Church, an evangelical church in the eastern coastal city of Batticaloa.
In addition, four hotels frequented by foreigners were hit. An individual being questioned by police also detonated a suicide bomb near a housing complex on the outskirts of the capital.
Who is responsible for the attacks?
No one has yet claimed responsibility, but the government is blaming a group called the National Thowfeek Jamaath.
Little is known about the group, which came to light a few years ago when it was involved in violence in the city of Batticaloa, near the site of one of Sunday's church attacks. It was also reportedly known for vandalizing Buddhist statues. Sunday's attacks were on a massively larger scale than anything for which the group had previously been blamed. The country has no history of Muslim militancy.
The group has a name similar to that of a group based in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu — the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath, which calls itself nonpolitical and is reported to have denied any links with the group named by Sri Lanka's government .
It would be unusual for a new and relatively untested extremist group to carry out such a broad and coordinated attack on its first attempt. ""We do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country,"" Sri Lanka's health minister and Cabinet spokesman, Rajitha Senaratne, said on Monday. ""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded.""
Was there any warning about the attacks?
Many Sri Lankan politicians coming out of an emergency meeting on Monday expressed concern and frustration that parts of the government apparently were aware of a possible attack by the group days before it occurred. A series of warnings had been issued from various sources starting early this month, according to Senaratne.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed anger that he was not made aware of the threat.
He and President Sirisena have frequently been at odds. Late last year, Sirisena fired Wickremesinghe , setting off a constitutional crisis that culminated in December, after the president was pressured to reinstate the prime minister .
Is this week's violence connected to the civil war in Sri Lanka that ended a decade ago?
There's no immediate indication that Sunday's attacks have anything to do with Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war.
That conflict, which lasted until 2009, involved an extremist group known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam . The Tamil Tigers, as they were commonly known, fought a brutal separatist insurgency against Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese. The Tamil Tigers were among the first groups to deploy suicide bombers.
Sri Lanka's people make up a complex web of ethnic and religious diversity. Most Sinhalese are Buddhist, religion — about 70 percent of the population. Tamils are mostly Hindu, and Hindus represent nearly 13 percent of the population.
Tensions have flared in recent years between Buddhists and Muslims — last year, Buddhist mobs attacked Muslims, leading to a state of emergency . There has been no real history of violence between Christians and Muslims, who, across various ethnicities, account for about 7.5 percent and 10 percent of Sri Lanka's population, respectively."

Depression affects more than 16 million Americans , each of whom has a unique journey to finding treatments that work. This can involve a lot of trial and error — but what if you don't find anything that works?
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug based on ketamine to treat treatment-resistant depression. It's called esketamine, sold in a nasal spray called Spravato.
Intravenous ketamine has been used to treat depression for years — as well as to cause euphoric highs as a party drug.
What led the FDA to approve this new medication? Why is it so hard to find an anti-depression regimen that works? And what kind of difference has it made in patients' lives? Facebook"

Parts of Alaska are warming twice as fast as the global average. But teaching about climate change can be tricky in a state with a strong oil and gas industry.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Now on this Earth Day, we're going to hear from teachers in Alaska where temperatures are warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average. A new national NPR/Ipsos poll found teachers are more likely than the general population to believe that the world's climate is changing, yet only 42% actually teach or talk about climate change in their classrooms. Some teachers in Alaska are finding innovative ways of getting at that subject. Elizabeth Jenkins from Alaska's Energy Desk reports.
ELIZABETH JENKINS, BYLINE: Chohla Moll's science classroom in Sitka has an ocean view. And today, the proximity to seawater will come in handy.
(SOUNDBITE OF STUDENTS BLOWING BUBBLES)
JENKINS: Students at Mt. Edgecumbe High School take turns blowing through straws into a glass full of seawater, adding carbon dioxide with their breath. The pH indicator shows the water becoming increasingly acidic, a process known as ocean acidification. Moll explains it's one of the consequences of burning fossil fuels. It's all part of a lesson on climate change. Not all teachers feel comfortable talking about how humans are contributing to the problem, but Moll thinks it's fairly simple.
CHOHLA MOLL: So when we come into science, we're not talking about things we believe in. We're talking about things that we have evidence to back up.
JENKINS: According to a new NPR/Ipsos poll nearly 9 in 10 teachers think climate change should be taught in schools. But 55% said they don't currently teach or talk about it in their classrooms. And about a third of teachers worry about parent complaints when it comes to talking about climate change.
The teachers who don't currently teach it gave several reasons why. Most said climate change is outside their subject area. Seventeen percent said they didn't know enough about climate change to teach it. And 17% also said they don't have the right materials. Math teacher Emma Carr falls into that last camp. She'd like to teach about climate change, but...
EMMA CARR: A lot of textbooks - they don't do a great job of connecting the math that we're learning to the real world. And so anytime that I want to do that, I have to create those lessons myself.
JENKINS: Carr teaches in Unalaska, a fishing community that's experiencing ocean warming. She's heard her students talk about that warming, and she thinks they should learn to interpret climate change data in school so they can understand the facts.
CARR: Like, kids will really need to be able to, like, look at a graph or a chart or whatever and be able to analyze it for themselves.
JENKINS: In Anchorage, science teacher Bryan Smith acknowledges climate change is a sensitive subject, especially in a resource-rich state like Alaska. Some of his students have parents who are employed by the oil and gas industry.
BRYAN SMITH: I've got this Upton Sinclair quote above my door. It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.
JENKINS: Smith does teach climate change, and he's received pushback from at least one of the teens in his class.
SMITH: Some people you won't be able to reach.
JENKINS: So there are social complexities to teaching climate change in an oil state. But there's another limitation almost every teacher will understand - not having enough time. Teachers are busy and often overworked. When NPR and Ipsos asked them to rank which subjects their schools should invest more in, climate change fell near the bottom of the list behind basic literacy and STEM, two subject areas that are far more likely to appear on standardized tests.

"Desperate For Change, Ukrainians Choose A Complete Novice In Presidential Election : NPR",www.npr.org,Lucian Kim,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096512/desperate-for-change-ukrainians-choose-a-complete-novice-in-presidential-electio,"Ukrainians elected actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelensky as their next president. Zelensky has no government experience. His fame comes from a sitcom about a high school teacher who becomes president.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
The people of Ukraine have spoken. In yesterday's presidential election, they overwhelmingly went for a comedian who plays a fictional president in a popular TV series. As NPR's Lucian Kim reports, the vote reveals how desperate Ukrainians are for change even if that means sending a complete novice to the highest office.
LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: As the polls closed after Sunday's runoff election, supporters of upstart candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy assembled in his campaign headquarters in Kiev.
(CHEERING)
KIM: First televised exit polls showed Zelenskiy with more than 70 percent of the vote and incumbent President Petro Poroshenko with just a quarter - practically out of the blue, a popular comedian who never held office and crushed one of the longtime heavyweights of Ukraine's political establishment. As he addressed his supporters and journalists, Zelenskiy first tried to practice his English.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKIY: I'm very good. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.
KIM: Congratulations started pouring in from around the world - from French President Emmanuel Macron, from President Donald Trump and even from Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaido. Zelenskiy's landslide came after a bitterly fought election campaign that started with 39 candidates. Zelenskiy managed to channel voter frustration with the status quo without offering any detailed proposals on how he'd end the war with Russia, clamp down on corruption or turn Ukraine's economy around.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ZELENSKIY: (Speaking Ukrainian).
KIM: In a debate in Kiev's Olympic stadium Friday, Zelenskiy said he voted for Poroshenko five years ago but didn't get the president he thought he would. Poroshenko, for his part, called Zelenskiy a bright wrapper that's concealing the interests of oligarchs and Russians inside. Still, once the first tallies were made public, Poroshenko conceded defeat, though he didn't hide his disappointment as he spoke to foreign press.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT PETRO POROSHENKO: You may just look at the celebration in the Kremlin. They believe that with a new, unexperienced Ukrainian president, Ukraine could be quickly returned to the Russia orbit of influence.
KIM: It's not clear how hard Russia's leaders were partying in the Kremlin. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said it would be premature to congratulate Zelenskiy. However, Russian opposition leaders congratulated Ukrainians on holding free and fair elections that saw a peaceful transfer of power. Russian state media have been covering the Ukrainian election obsessively, contrasting it with the stability of the Putin regime.
Ukraine used to be the jewel in the crown of the Soviet Union and, before that, the Russian Empire. And many Russians still can't accept it's an independent country. Five years after Russia annexed Crimea and fomented an armed uprising in eastern Ukraine, relations are at a complete stalemate.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ANDREI CHESNAKOV: (Foreign language spoken).
KIM: Andrei Chesnakov, a Kremlin-connected political adviser, said in a TV interview it'll take years, if not decades, to restore relations between Ukraine and Russia. He said any improvement will depend on small confidence-building measures. Zelenskiy has said his first priority is to win the release of Ukrainian naval personnel captured by Russia last year.

Quentin Geant, California branch manager of Beeopic, works with his father Nicolas Geant to care for the nearly 180,000 bees on top of Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral. The bees survived last week's fire.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
A week ago the world was watching as Notre Dame Cathedral burned.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
While the spire fell and the wooden roof was destroyed, no one was killed. And that includes some 180,000 winged residents of Notre Dame.
QUENTIN GEANT: (Speaking French).
SHAPIRO: ""The bees of Notre Dame survived the fire.""
CORNISH: Says Quentin Geant - he's the executive manager of Beeopic California. His firm rents bees, including those on the roof of the Notre Dame's stone vestry. And his father, Nicolas, is the beekeeper there.
SHAPIRO: Because of a declining bee population, the city of Paris pushed to have more hives in the city.
GEANT: Notre Dame has been a really proud owner of this hive since 2013 because, also, the Catholic Church has been some of the biggest beekeepers all throughout history because of the candle they needed.
SHAPIRO: Not only the candles they needed, but there's also all that honey.
CORNISH: The Geants, father and son, were concerned when they watched TV coverage of Notre Dame burning.
GEANT: We knew our bees will be there, and we could not do anything.
SHAPIRO: That was last Monday. The next day, there was a sign of hope.
GEANT: My dad could see on the pictures from the satellite that the three hives were still standing.
SHAPIRO: A couple days later, church officials told the senior Geant that bees were alive and even sent out a video. Because of the continuing danger and the fire investigation, the beekeeper has not been able to get to see the hives in person.
CORNISH: That these bees survived a huge fire doesn't seem like such a miracle to Quentin Geant.
GEANT: They don't have the same kind of lungs than us. And we have been using smoke of beekeeping when we keep our bees since hundreds of years, so they're kind of used to it. That's the good news and the magic of it.
SHAPIRO: Magic, indeed. The bees are OK with smoke, but if the heat from the fire had gotten above 145 degrees Fahrenheit, the wax of the hive would have melted, and the bees would not have been able to survive.

Armed Groups Are Attacking Health Workers Responding To Ebola Outbreak,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096505/armed-groups-are-attacking-health-workers-responding-to-ebola-outbreak,"There's been a deadly escalation of the violence against health workers trying to curb the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since Friday there have been two separate attacks.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Now to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where for months health workers have been struggling to contain an Ebola outbreak. Despite the fact that more than 100,000 people have been vaccinated, there's been a surge of new cases. And more than 1,300 people have been infected so far. The biggest obstacle to stopping the outbreak - armed groups who keep attacking health workers. In just the last few days, there were two assaults. Here to tell us more is NPR's Nurith Aizenman. Welcome to the studio.
NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: Hi, Audie.
CORNISH: Give us the latest on these attacks first.
AIZENMAN: Well, the first one was on Friday afternoon. It was at a local hospital in a city called Butembo. That's one of the current epicenters of the outbreak. And about 20 members of one of the local Ebola response teams were having a meeting. And witnesses say two gunmen burst in. They took everyone's cell phones and other equipment. They started shooting, injured two people. And they killed the team leader. His name was Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko. He was an epidemiologist from Cameroon who'd been deployed by the World Health Organization to help fight Ebola.
And then, just a few hours later, there was an attack on another local command center. This one was at a hospital in a nearby suburb called Katwa. It's one of the worst hotspots in the outbreak zone. And this one was around 3 a.m. Saturday morning. Four people tried to set fire to that command center. Police fought them off. They killed one assailant, and they captured the rest.
CORNISH: Are these centers being targeted on purpose? And if so, how come?
AIZENMAN: It seems so, yes. And it's not clear exactly who was behind each of these attacks. But I spoke with Dr. Michel Yao, who is leading the Ebola response for the World Health Organization. And he says witnesses in that first attack told him that the gunmen were shouting, Ebola doesn't exist; you're just here to make money off of us. And it fits into a larger problem of mistrust in the local population. There have been years of armed conflict in this part of Congo. And people feel victimized by the government. So they don't trust authorities and, by extension, health workers.
CORNISH: What does this mean for the effort to try and contain the outbreak?
AIZENMAN: Well, there's a lot of concern because this is just the latest in a series of violent incidents that directly target health workers. Since February, two Ebola treatment centers have been attacked. Dr. Mouzoko, the doctor who was killed on Friday, he had only arrived four weeks ago. And he apparently told colleagues that he was really worried. He's left behind a wife and four children in Cameroon. And so each time there's been an attack, the health workers need to regroup. They slow down their efforts to vaccinate people who've been exposed.
And then you see the effect in the outbreak. It gets worse. Basically, more people start to get sick. And, you know, to give you an example, in February, just before these attacks on the Ebola treatment centers started, they were seeing about 30 new cases a week. And then this month, we're already up to 70 new cases every week, even as high as 100 new cases every week.
CORNISH: If this violence continues, is there a chance that the outbreak could grow into a catastrophe similar to what we saw in 2014 in some West African countries?
AIZENMAN: There are some really important differences. First of all, the WHO and the government have been on this from the beginning. There's also a vaccine now, which has been a game changer. As you noted, they've managed to get more than 100,000 people to take it. And the evidence is it's highly effective. So there are still reasons to be hopeful, despite this latest violence.
CORNISH: That's NPR's Nurith Aizenman. Thank you for explaining it to us.
AIZENMAN: Glad to do it.

Leader Of Armed Militia Group Operating Along New Mexico Border Appears In Federal Court,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096480/leader-of-armed-militia-group-operating-along-new-mexico-border-appears-in-feder,"Larry Hopkins, the leader of an armed militia in New Mexico, was arraigned in federal court Monday on charges of firearms possession by a felon. He was arrested by the FBI on Saturday.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
The alleged leader of an armed militia group operating along the New Mexico border appeared in federal court this morning in Las Cruces, N.M. Larry Hopkins was arrested on Saturday on charges of illegally possessing firearms as a felon. Joining us now to discuss the case is reporter Mallory Falk of member station KRWG. Welcome, Mallory.
MALLORY FALK, BYLINE: Thank you.
CORNISH: Tell us about this militia group that Hopkins leads. What is it, and what are they alleged to be doing?
FALK: So the group is called United Constitutional Patriots. It's a group of armed civilians often dressed in military fatigues. They've been camped out in Sunland Park, N.M., which is a small community very close to the U.S.-Mexico border. And they've been stopping migrant families that they're encountering crossing the border who are trying to come into the U.S. to claim asylum. They've been stopping those families, telling them to sit on the ground and then calling Border Patrol. And Border Patrol then comes in and apprehends those families. I spoke with Kelly O'Connell, who's the lawyer representing Larry Hopkins. He talked a little bit about how this group views themselves. And we're going to hear from him right now.
KELLY O'CONNELL: They generally think that Border Patrol is spread too thin, and that there are gaps in the system or there's literal gaps in the fence. They think - they believe that they are helping to enforce the law of America.
FALK: But I should say that Border Patrol has said explicitly that they do not endorse or condone private groups taking law enforcement into their own hands.
CORNISH: And what is Hopkins being charged with specifically?
FALK: The charges don't relate to his recent activity here in southern New Mexico. They actually date back to 2017. And at the time, the FBI had received some reports that Hopkins was saying his group was training to assassinate Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the philanthropist George Soros. So they went to search his home and found some guns there. And they're charging him with illegal possession of firearms and ammunitions as a felon because he'd had at least three previous felony charges, including impersonating a peace officer.
CORNISH: So unrelated to the militia activity, why are they charging him now?
FALK: It's a little hard to say. Officials haven't yet commented on that. I did speak with his attorney, who, in his words, says that this timing gives rise to suspicions. He thinks that it's possible that some leaders here in New Mexico want to put a stop to the United Constitutional Patriots, want to stop them from patrolling the border as armed civilians. And so in his view, potentially they're using these old charges from a year and a half ago as a way to kind of put some pressure on the group and potentially stop these activities.
CORNISH: How is this playing out in New Mexico? Is there much support for what he and this group were doing along the border?
FALK: There has been some online crowdfunding - although some of those sites have since been removed - but where people were donating for food and supplies while this group was camped out. But there's also been a lot of condemnation. The Democratic governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham, has ordered an investigation into the group. She says it's unacceptable to menace immigrant families and asylum seekers as they're crossing the border. And the New Mexico attorney general has said that armed vigilantes should not be enforcing the law. So he has condemned this as well.
CORNISH: Do you have any sense of whether this has been a problem in the past?
FALK: There have been armed militia groups along numerous parts of the border for years. This isn't new. I believe it's relatively new here in Sunland Park. But this has been happening in Arizona. It's been happening along the border. But, you know, the folks that are crossing the border here - that composition has changed where it's now often families, parents with young children as opposed to single men. And so people are saying it also looks very different when you have militia members stopping, you know, young children, stopping families during the night.
CORNISH: That's Mallory Falk from member station KRWG. Thank you for your reporting.
FALK: Thank you for having me.

"In Iowa, Democrats Are Already Campaigning Ahead Of Presidential Caucuses",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096466/in-iowa-democrats-are-already-campaigning-ahead-of-presidential-caucuses,"Western Iowa is a Republican stronghold, but Democrats are visiting in search of support during the presidential caucuses. They hope to undermine at least some of President Trump's support.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Part of the calculus for Democrats on whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings is assessing how it might affect the outcome in the 2020 elections. In Iowa, the campaign already feels like it's in full swing. That's despite the fact that the field of presidential candidates is not complete. Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to officially enter any day now, and others could still jump in.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
NPR's Don Gonyea says those who have declared their candidacy are making visits to less-well-trod campaign stops, including in rural and solidly Republican parts of the state.
DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Denison, Iowa, the hometown of Academy Award-winning actress Donna Reed, has a population of just over 8,000. It's in a county that gave Donald Trump 2 of every 3 votes cast in 2016. Nevertheless, the Democrats are coming to town.
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Hi. How are you?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Fine. How are you?
GILLIBRAND: Kirsten Gillibrand. Nice to meet you.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Nice to meet you.
GILLIBRAND: How're you doing?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Doing good. You traveling all over?
GILLIBRAND: I sure am, doing the hard work.
GONYEA: That Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York on a stop at Cronk's Cafe in Denison. About 30 people were waiting for her in the back dining room on Friday, one of them noting that this is also the district of one of the nation's most conservative members of Congress.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Got to congratulate you on coming to Western Iowa - Steve King Country. There are Democrats. We are out here. So - and that's brave.
GONYEA: Two weeks earlier, Democratic hopeful Beto O'Rourke was in this exact same room. Gillibrand took questions, did interviews, posed for selfies, talked rural issues and said Trump has not been good for these voters.
GILLIBRAND: And he's created a trade war with China, which is particularly crippling, especially for farmers in Iowa.
GONYEA: But a day earlier on a morning when there were no candidates dropping by, my conversation with some customers at a table near the front windows underscored how steep of a climb Democrats have in this part of the state. Meet 70-year-old Sonny Sonnichsen.
SONNY SONNICHSEN: Not a diehard Republican, but I'm following Trump. We needed a change. And if they'd just give him a chance, I think he'd do wonders, if he hasn't already done some great things.
GONYEA: But he says the Washington establishment won't give Trump any credit. He says they still can't get over the fact that Trump won. Seated to his left is 68-year-old electrician Jerry Bryan. I ask if he's a Republican. He prefers this description...
JERRY BRYAN: Conservative.
GONYEA: You're a conservative.
BRYAN: Yes.
GONYEA: Bryan voted for Trump. He acknowledges that Trump often gets his facts wrong and that he lacks polish and that he relishes picking a fight. But he says the media, which he labels the left-wing media, jump on him no matter what. Then I ask Bryan to look ahead to the 2020 election.
BRYAN: Not to be humorous in a situation that needs some real serious concentration, but I'm probably going to vote for the lesser of the weasels, all right?
GONYEA: So you put Trump in that category.
BRYAN: Yes, yes.
GONYEA: But ultimately he thinks Trump has the skills as a businessman that the country needs right now. As for the trade fight so many farmers complain about, including those retaliatory tariffs by China on soybeans and other Iowa commodities, Bryan says it's not a permanent situation.
BRYAN: We'll get through it. But someplace along the line, you've got to have a little pain for a little gain.
GONYEA: Democratic candidates are hoping to both win votes here in next February's caucuses and send a message that they can get votes in rural America, something that could make the difference in the general election in battleground states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that Trump carried narrowly. Recently the northwest Iowa town of Storm Lake hosted five Democratic candidates at something called the Heartland Forum, focusing on ag policy. Sixty-four-year-old Chris Petersen of Clear Lake, Iowa, was there.
CHRIS PETERSEN: Been a family farmer all my life, traditional family farms.
GONYEA: But he says it's getting harder and harder to survive. Petersen is a Democrat.
PETERSEN: You know, it's not only the trade stuff. It's the flood stuff. It's the price of the grain. Everything is bad right now. And I tell you what. The Democrats need to stand up.
GONYEA: Do enough Democrats understand what's happening here?
PETERSEN: Well, that's the problem. A lot of them don't. Of course Trump doesn't either, you know?
GONYEA: Also at the forum was Beth Henning, an independent who votes Democratic. She has deep family roots in farming. She says in 2016, Democrats seemed to write off rural areas, which cost them in a close election.
BETH HENNING: I think that's true. I think that a lesson has been learned that you can't ignore the rural Midwest.
GONYEA: So far, that's not a problem this election season, though some Denison residents did complain, saying it's way too early for this. But for rural Democrats used to being forgotten, they are relishing the sudden attention. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

House Democrats To Discuss How They'll Respond To Conclusions From The Mueller Report,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096457/house-democrats-to-discuss-how-theyll-respond-to-conclusions-from-the-mueller-re,"House Democrats will hold a conference call Monday to begin strategizing how they will respond to the conclusions in the special counsel's report on Russian interference and President Trump.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
House Democrats are divided over how Congress should respond to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top committee chairs are holding a conference call this evening to hear out lawmakers on the path forward. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis is here in the studio now. Hi, Sue.
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.
SHAPIRO: So where are the dividing lines among Democrats on this?
DAVIS: I think when it comes to the question of impeachment, you see, really, three camps. The most influential camp right now is led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, from the very beginning, long before the Mueller report was released, has been an impeachment skeptic - that she is, in her words - that it was not worth it, and if you were ever going to go down that path, it would have to be both bipartisan and overwhelming.
You then have the base of the party, where a lot of the activity and energy is. You look at people like Elizabeth Warren, one of the leading 2020 candidates, already calling for impeachment hearings. You have a lot of the progressive freshmen women signing on to a resolution calling for impeachment hearings. That's people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. So that shows you where sort of the energy in the party is.
And then I think you have this third camp by a lot of veteran lawmakers, where they're kind of stuck in the middle. And House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings was on ""Face The Nation"" yesterday, and he spoke to this.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FACE THE NATION"")
ELIJAH CUMMINGS: There comes a point in life where we all have to make decisions based upon the fact that it is our watch. And, you know, history - I think even if we did not win, possibly, if there were not impeachments, I think history would smile upon us for standing up for the Constitution.
DAVIS: I hear a lot of Democrats' talk sounding like Cummings, where they say, look; we know we don't have the votes for impeachment, but how are we going to be judged if we don't at least try? And Cummings also makes the point that if Democrats don't take a really aggressive stance here, they think that President Trump is just going to be really emboldened to continue to act in the kind of way he did in - outlined in the Mueller report.
SHAPIRO: Although, there's some question as to whether the president is already emboldened. I mean, today, he announced that he's suing Cummings to try to block that committee from gaining access to the Trump Organization's financial records. Cummings recently subpoenaed those records. I mean, isn't that a signal that the White House is already willing and eager to fight Democrats on their investigations?
DAVIS: I think absolutely. And I also think if you look at the other side of the aisle, how the Republicans responded to the report - they have really rallied behind the president with very few exceptions. And the president's attorney - one of his attorneys, Jay Sekulow, said today, in response to countersuing Elijah Cummings and his efforts to get these documents, he said, we will not allow presidential harassment to go unanswered, which shows you sort of the aggressive posturing of the White House on this.
You know, there has been some critics. I think Utah Senator Mitt Romney is one voice that has said he was appalled by the president's behavior outlined in the report. But on the whole, more Republicans have been acting like Republican Doug Collins. He's the top Republican on Judiciary. He went over to the DOJ today and looked at the unredacted Mueller report and put out a statement that said, I saw the unredacted report. There's nothing to see here. It corroborates the public findings, and we all need to move on.
SHAPIRO: There are options between impeachment and moving on.
DAVIS: Yeah.
SHAPIRO: What else are Democrats considering?
DAVIS: So one of the things Pelosi has been saying, and I think she's going to reiterate that again tonight, is you don't have to have, quote, unquote, ""impeachment hearings"" to do a lot of the things they say they're going to do. You know, Attorney General William Barr is coming up to the Hill next week to testify. They still want to hear directly from Robert Mueller. The House Judiciary Committee today subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn.
Another word that I think you should think about and we're going to hear a lot more of is the word censure. I've talked to some Democrats who say that impeachment isn't the only option. Censure is a way for Congress to take a public vote to reprimand the president, to let lawmakers go on record without having to go full bore on impeachment.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Susan Davis. Thanks a lot, Sue.
DAVIS: You're welcome.

toggle caption Jeopardy Productions Inc. /AP Professional sports gambler James Holzhauer won $131,127 during a Jeopardy! show that aired Wednesday night, breaking his previous record.
Jeopardy Productions Inc. /AP A new star has risen on a classic game show.
James Holzhauer, a Las Vegas professional sports bettor, is on a Jeopardy! hot streak. He has breezily won the last 12 games in a row.
But most notably, the 34-year-old is drawing attention for his unique strategy and big bets. Over the 12 wins as of Friday, he now holds the top five slots for single-day winning records on the show in regular play, racking up a total of $851,926.
Last week, he won $131,127 in a single game, setting yet another new record. He answered every single question correctly that he buzzed in for. Before his appearance on the show, the previous single-day record in regular play was $77,000.
For comparison, Ken Jennings, the show's most successful player ever during nontournament play, had won $410,158 after 12 games, according to The Jeopardy Fan .
This is absolutely insane. I've always wanted to see someone try Jeopardy! wagering this way who had the skills to back it up. https://t.co/PYj6MDsXjs
— Ken Jennings (@KenJennings) April 18, 2019 ""All good professional gamblers are selectively aggressive. You need to pick your spots and bet big when you identify them,"" Holzhauer tells NPR over email. ""That's basically my Jeopardy strategy in a nutshell.""
Holzhauer starts by choosing the highest-value clues on the six-by-five board. Contestants have typically started with the lowest value of a category and worked down the board to the more valuable spots.
""You need a decent-sized bankroll to bet for profit, which is why I start at the bottom of the board,"" he says. That bankroll pays off when he hits a ""Daily Double,"" a question where he can bet more if he has more money in his pocket already. And he routinely bets everything he has.
James is already up to 10 wins! How far will he go? pic.twitter.com/dn1nsUWYkq
— Jeopardy! (@Jeopardy) April 18, 2019 The show's host, Alex Trebek, put it simply during a recent show: ""If you control the board and constantly come up with correct responses, you're likely to hit most of the Daily Doubles, which is what you do,"" he remarked to Holzhauer. He asked the other contestants: ""How does it feel to come into a buzz saw?""
Holzhauer, who has a degree in math from the University of Illinois, says that sports betting comes naturally to him. ""There's nothing better for my interests and talents than combining math and sports for profit.""
He says he initially focused on baseball ""because it is the easiest sport to break down mathematically, but as betting markets have adjusted, I'm spending more time on football and hockey now.""
His grandmother, who is now deceased, inspired him to try out for the show.
""She moved from Japan to help raise me and my brother, spoke barely any English, if anything at all,"" he told Trebek in a recent episode . ""But Jeopardy! was on in the afternoon at our house. ... She would watch the program with me even though she didn't understand a lick of it. And I promised her someday, she'd see me on the stage up here.""
""So, I hope wherever she is right now, she's looking down,"" Holzhauer added. He has written a short message in her honor on the final question's write-in space. On other days, he has given shout-outs to his young child and other family and friends.
Television 'Jeopardy!' Host Alex Trebek Says He Has Pancreatic Cancer Holzhauer dominates across topics – with answers such as ""Who is Aquaman?"" ""What is the Reformation?"" ""What is quantum leap?""
He says some categories come more easily to him than others. ""I spent almost no time studying categories like geography and sports, even though they came up frequently on Jeopardy, because I'm already strong in those subjects,"" he tells NPR. Categories he says he did spend time reviewing: animals, classical music and literature.
In 2004, Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings eventually went on to win 74 straight games and more than $2.5 million.
""I'm just gobsmacked by James,"" Jennings told Wired . ""It's absolutely insane what he's doing. Like, I thought I had seen everything on Jeopardy! And this is something I would have thought was just impossible, these numbers.""
He says he played the game very differently. ""I was playing a game show like I had on my couch. My top priority wasn't maximizing winnings,"" he said. ""I would never have had the stomach for those kinds of bets.""
Jennings told the magazine that he is surprised his record has stood for some 15 years. ""As a fan of the show, I'm actually rooting for James or anybody who can take a swing at that record,"" he added.
Who will it be ... ? pic.twitter.com/UiuiljNCOh
— Jeopardy! (@Jeopardy) April 8, 2019 On April 8, Jeopardy! released a trailer pumping up excitement about the new challenger. ""This April ... every record ... is in Jeopardy! "" it said. ""The next great champion ... is coming. ... Is it too soon to start making comparisons with Ken Jennings?"" ( Jeopardy! is taped in advance — the episodes that have aired thus far were taped in early February, Holzhauer said.)
""It's an honor to be compared to him, but he and I play very differently,"" said Holzhauer. ""Studying his game film would be about as useful as someone my size trying to play like Shaq in a pickup basketball game.""
Holzhauer has shown extraordinary speed with the buzzer — and it's notoriously difficult to get that timing right.
Originally on the show, contestants could buzz in as soon as the clue appeared. That ""led to a lot of quick guesses, negative scores and general confusion,"" Jeopardy!'s website says . These days, the contestants can't buzz in until Trebek has finished reading the clue. Then, a staff member pushes a button that illuminates lights on either side of the game board and opens up the system to allow contestants to buzz in.
However, if a contestant buzzes in before the system is operating, he or she gets locked out for a quarter of second — a huge disadvantage when tiny fractions of a second determine who has the edge. As The Ringer reported, before he appeared on the show, Holzhauer practiced his timing using an improvised buzzer — a mechanical pencil wrapped in masking tape.
The Two-Way 'Jeopardy!' Champion Goes Viral With Quirky Style, Big Bets The Jeopardy! success hasn't yet changed his life much yet — ""I would say I'm currently a C-list celebrity with Vegas locals,"" Holzhauer says. But that may be different when he visits his hometown of Naperville, Ill., where he hears his success is generating a lot of buzz. ""My dad has never been more popular,"" he adds.
And at this point, he says sportsbook managers have said they are rooting for him. ""Maybe they think I will stop betting on sports if I stay on Jeopardy forever,"" Holzhauer adds.

Eric Risberg/AP With its folding 7.3-inch screen, Samsung's Galaxy Fold was touted as the biggest Galaxy phone yet. Priced at nearly $2,000, the folding smartphone was due to go on sale this Friday. But Samsung announced on Monday that it's delaying the release after reviewers found problems with the phone's screen.
In a statement, Samsung acknowledged the device ""needs further improvements that could ensure the best possible user experience. To fully evaluate this feedback and run further internal tests, we have decided to delay the release of the Galaxy Fold. We plan to announce the release date in the coming weeks.""

In her review, titled ""Samsung Galaxy Fold Non-Review: We Are Not Your Beta Testers,"" she wrote :
""The day I got the phone, I began peeling at an edge of it. I thought it was like any other Samsung Galaxy S10 model—the company now ships its priciest phones with screen protectors that are fine to remove.

Matthew Murphy/Courtesy of Hadestown, The Musical More than a decade ago, Anaïs Mitchell was running late for one of her shows. The singer-songwriter, in her 20s at the time, was trying to get from one gig to another and found herself lost. Along the drive, a song lyric popped into her head. ""The lines that came were, 'Wait for me I'm coming. In my garters and pearls with what melody did you barter me from the wicked underworld,'"" she remembers.
Those lyrics never made it into one of Mitchell's productions, but as the musician says, they pointed her to the story of Eurydice , the Greek myth that follows two lovers, Eurydice and Orpheus. Eurydice goes to the underworld and Orpheus follows to bring her back. In the story, Orpheus sings a song so sweet, it melts the heart of Hades.
Mitchell's fascination with this story has taken her on journey across mediums, one that is as winding as her hero's quest. She's turned these lyrics into a song, then a concept album in 2010 called Hadestown , stage productions in the U.S., Canada and London and on April 17, Hadestown finally opened on Broadway.

"Following Easter Attacks In Sri Lanka, A Social Media Ban Disabled Some Apps",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716096498/following-easter-attacks-in-sri-lanka-a-social-media-ban-disabled-some-apps,"Sri Lanka government officials shut down social media in the wake of the attacks. Such moves are more common and signal how tech companies struggle to maintain control of who uses their platforms.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
As Sri Lanka investigates who was behind yesterday's terrorist attacks on churches and hotels, the government continues to block access to social media there. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, all owned by Facebook, are among the services under a blackout. This once again brings into focus the fear that Facebook cannot rein in disinformation and calls to violence. NPR's Aarti Shahani is following the situation. Hi, Aarti.
AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi.
SHAPIRO: What explanation did Sri Lanka's government give for shutting down these social media apps?
SHAHANI: So in a nutshell, the government doesn't trust Facebook to yank down fake news and calls to violence before they go viral. Keep in mind, Sri Lanka is only a decade out of civil war. That's not a long time. People remember it. Peace feels tenuous to them. Just a year ago, last March, Buddhist extremists torched Muslim homes and businesses and used Facebook to incite violence. In response to that, the government had announced a 72-hour block on social media. And this time around, the government is not putting a time limit on it. It's unclear when the ban will come to an end.
SHAPIRO: Of course, there are lots of examples of hoaxes going rampant on Facebook, from Myanmar to the United States. We have to note, they are an NPR sponsor. How has the company responded to what's happening in Sri Lanka?
SHAHANI: The response is meek. Company leaders are not defending themselves. They issued a statement in a pretty conciliatory tone saying, hey, we're working to support first responders and law enforcement and to identify and remove harmful content. Facebook has had so many screw-ups. Executives can't give themselves a pat on the back or claim, hey, we have a handle on calls to violence. As recently as the New Zealand massacre, Facebook failed to remove 20% of the video footage of the mass shooting even though, in that instance, people in the company knew what to look out for.
SHAPIRO: And tell us how people in Sri Lanka are responding to this. I know you've been reaching out to people affected by the blackout. What are you hearing?
SHAHANI: I have. You know, social media has been used time and again to help in crises, right? People turn to Facebook to check in and broadcast that they're safe, to get updates from local officials and hospitals. And especially in Asia, where WhatsApp has replaced regular phone calls for much of the population, the ban really threw people off.
I spoke to one woman, an American named Reena Arora, who was in Sri Lanka on vacation. Her family didn't know if she was in Colombo, near a bomb target. And this is her.
REENA ARORA: They tried to call me several times, I believe through WhatsApp. And they weren't able to get in contact with me. And so they were very concerned for my safety because all of them knew that I was traveling in Sri Lanka at the time.
SHAHANI: She had to worry about her parents worrying that she was injured or even worse than that. And she had no idea WhatsApp was down. When she tried to reach her driver to get to the airport, he didn't respond. And she figured, OK, he's blowing me off. And, you know, he wasn't. He just didn't get the messages. So the both of them were operating in an information vacuum, feeling totally isolated, when what they really needed was to connect in a moment of panic.
SHAPIRO: Can we say whether the blackout has actually worked at preventing the spread of hoaxes and conspiracy theories?
SHAHANI: Yeah, you know, I actually spoke to a man who lives in Colombo. And he told me that even though Facebook was banned, some people used a backdoor tool - it's called a VPN - to get on anyway. And lo and behold, there were posts online designed to sow fear. One post claimed a bomb went off in a nearby local park. That was not true.
Another post claimed that terrorists had poisoned the water supply. That was also a lie. TV and radio journalists had to jump in on that and report that, hey, you can trust the water. You can drink it; it's safe. That was extra work for them. It could have been worse with more people on the platform.
SHAPIRO: Wow. So just briefly, how does what's happened in Sri Lanka compare to what you've seen in other parts of the world?
SHAHANI: You know, what we've just seen in Sri Lanka is very swift, unilateral action. Other countries, like France and Germany, have gone the regulatory route, right? Germany passed laws to fine Facebook severely for its failure to pull down white supremacist content. Either approach - quick or regulatory methodic - they illustrate that because Facebook hasn't been able to take control, governments have decided they're going to have to act.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Aarti Shahani. Thanks so much.
SHAHANI: Thank you.

House Democrats Divided Over How Congress Should Respond To Russia Investigation : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/716165734/house-democrats-divided-over-how-congress-should-respond-to-russia-investigation,"House Democrats Divided Over How Congress Should Respond To Russia Investigation House Democrats Divided Over How Congress Should Respond To Russia Investigation Embed Embed
NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., about Democratic plans following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
House Democrats are divided over how Congress should respond to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement today saying the president's behavior described in the report is, quote, ""at a minimum unethical and unscrupulous."" However, she continued to caution against impeachment.
Earlier today, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn, and House Democrats held a conference call this evening. Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina was on that call and joins us now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
JIM CLYBURN: Thank you so much for having me.
SHAPIRO: So Speaker Pelosi has been trying to discourage House Democrats from pursuing impeachment. Do you think this evening's conference call brought the party any closer to consensus?
CLYBURN: Oh, I think so. I think consensus had been there for a while. The problem here is whether or not that term is being used or whether we are satisfied that pursuing a course of action that we have been pursuing all the time. We have six committees, and those six chairs have been active in this process. Some of this process deals with the president's finances, and there is a committee for that.
Maxine Waters, as you know, have been talking about Deutsche Bank and its relationship to this president and its record in these kinds of activities. So she and her committee are pursuing that. Jerry Nadler is chair of Judiciary, and he is looking at those issues involved in his committee. And we are going to be doing that. Ways and Means has asked for the tax records, and they are pursuing that. There are various roadmaps that have been laid out by Mueller, and we are following them committee by committee.
SHAPIRO: I hear you arguing that investigations are an adequate response. The counterargument is that if there is no impeachment proceeding, then there is no accountability for behavior described in the Mueller report that includes using material from a foreign adversary that was obtained illegally. How do you respond to that argument?
CLYBURN: Well, I think accountability is more than you get there. Just because we aren't leaping there tomorrow, as I said on the call today - I'm a history major, and one of the reasons for that is because I did not like going through the steps one had to go through in trying to solve a math problem even when you know their answer. We may know where this will lead, but we need to lay out a process and go through that process to make sure we don't do anything that will short circuit.
SHAPIRO: Are you arguing that impeachment could still be on the table depending on how these investigations turn out? Or do you agree...
CLYBURN: Absolutely.
SHAPIRO: ...With some of your colleagues that in lieu of impeachment, the 2020 election is the moment to hold the president accountable?
CLYBURN: Impeachment is still on the table. It has never been taken off the table. We just don't want to try to rush to something without going through the proper process. It happens in courtrooms all the time. You lay out your case. You go through the process, and then you get to the conclusion. Why should you jump to the conclusion before going through the proper process? So that's what we're trying to do here.
SHAPIRO: As you know, there are House Democrats who disagree with you on this. Do you worry that the question will continue to divide your party and get in the way of policy priorities that you would like to see the party pursue?
CLYBURN: Well, no, I'm not worried about that at all because the speaker is where she thinks - where I think she needs to be. I'm where she is, and so is the majority leader. So sentiments are there, and people are free to hold onto them. They know what their districts are, and maybe that's what their constituents want to hear them say. We all have two sets of constituents - the ones that vote for us out in the ballot box and the one that vote for us when we get into our caucuses.
SHAPIRO: That's House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, Democratic congressman of South Carolina. Thanks so much.

Dona Ana County Detention Center/Reuters The alleged leader of an armed militia group that has intercepted and detained migrant families along the southern border in New Mexico was charged with federal firearms offenses on Monday.
Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, of Flora Vista, N.M., appeared in federal court in Las Cruces after his arrest on Saturday on charges of illegally possessing firearms as a felon.
A criminal complaint filed by the FBI states that Hopkins, also known as Johnny Horton Jr., was in possession of nine firearms and ammunition in his northern New Mexico home in Nov. 2017. He had three prior felony convictions dating back to 1996, including impersonating a peace officer in the state of Oregon in 2006, according to a press release issued by the U.S. Attorney's office.
Hopkins' arrest is not tied to his involvement with the border militia.
Reporter Mallory Falk of NPR member station KRWG told All Things Considered that Hopkins leads a group called United Constitutional Patriots:
 ""It's a group of armed civilians often dressed in military fatigues. They've been camped out in Sunland Park, N.M., which is a small community very close to the U.S.-Mexico border. And they've been stopping migrant families that they're encountering crossing the border who are trying to come into the U.S. to claim asylum. They've been stopping those families, telling them to sit on the ground, and then calling Border Patrol, and Border Patrol then comes in and apprehends those families.""
Hopkins' attorney, Kelly O'Connell, told Falk that the militia group believes it is aiding an overstretched Border Patrol.
""They generally think that Border Patrol is spread too thin and that there are gaps in the system or there's literal gaps in the fence,"" said O'Connell. ""They think they believe that they are helping to enforce the law of America.""
A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, in an emailed statement, said ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not endorse or condone private groups or organizations taking enforcement matters into their own hands. Interference by civilians in law enforcement matters could have public safety and legal consequences for all parties involved.""
Falk reported that federal officials are not commenting on the timing of the charges against Hopkins for offenses committed in Nov. 2017. But she said that his attorney suggested that state officials want to stop the group's border activities and are using charges that are a year-and-a-half old to put pressure on them.
The FBI began investigating Hopkins after receiving reports that the United Constitutional Patriots were targeting Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton and George Soros for assassination.
Hopkins is no stranger to investigators who track right-wing activities. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Hopkins, using his pseudonym Horton, claims to have advised President Trump on border security.
Hopkins is expected to enter a plea of not guilty at a bond hearing next week in Albuquerque.
Hopkins faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in in prison if convicted.

A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the city, which had ended a foster-care contract with an agency of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. That agency, Catholic Social Services, had declined to place foster children in LGBTQ households and sought an injunction that would have forced the city to renew its contract.
The appeals panel said ""the religious views of CSS do not entitle it to an exception"" from the city's nondiscrimination policy. The agency ""has failed to make a persuasive showing that the City targeted it for its religious beliefs, or is motivated by ill will against its religion, rather than sincere opposition to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.""
""The City stands on firm ground in requiring its contractors to abide by its non-discrimination policies when administering public services,"" concluded Circuit Court Judge Thomas Ambro, writing for the panel.
Attorneys for CSS said the ruling will hurt hundreds of potential foster children and foster parents who were waiting for a placement.
""We're disappointed that the court decided to let the city place politics above the needs of kids and the rights of parents, but we will continue this fight,"" said Lori Windham, a lawyer for Catholic Social Services as quoted by The Associated Press.
Mayor Jim Kenney praised the ruling.
""Our policy ensures that same-sex couples do not face discrimination as they seek to offer loving homes to Philadelphia children in need of foster care,"" Kenney said in a statement . ""At the same time, the policy safeguards religious liberties. We are proud that Philadelphia is a welcoming, inclusive city that values the diversity of its residents.""
The ruling upholds a lower court decision siding with the city and its nondiscrimination policy.
As The Philadelphia Inquirer reports , the dispute is the latest case in which LGBTQ rights and religious freedoms have come into conflict where child welfare is concerned.
""In most of those cases, the child-welfare agencies are facing lawsuits for contracting with groups that discriminate,"" the Inquirer reports. ""Here, the city was being sued for barring an organization it says discriminates."""

A desperate father, once deported, has trekked 2,000 miles from Honduras to cross the border again and reunite with the daughter who was separated from him last spring.
He is one of more than 200 parents who were deported to Central America while their children were placed with sponsors or in foster homes in the United States.
Last week, Jose Eduardo pushed open the door to Apartment 204 in Arlington, Texas, and threw his arms around his 15-year-old daughter, Yaimy. They'd been apart for 10 months. They wept. Then they went out for shrimp and rice, and talked about their remarkable journey.
This was Jose's second trip to Texas. The first time was in May, when he and Yaimy traveled from their village in Copan, Honduras, to Reynosa, Mexico, floated across the Rio Grande to Hidalgo, Texas, on a smuggler's raft, and surrendered to green-suited agents. He says they were fleeing marauding gangs who had marked them both for death. Parents Were 'Coerced' To Waive Reunification Rights With Children, Complaint Says
The last time Jose saw Yaimy, she was standing in a frigid border patrol holding cell. He was marched off to court to face charges of unlawful entry. When he returned, she was gone.
""When we entered immigration,"" he said, ""I never imagined they would separate us. I told my daughter, 'Don't worry! We're going to be together.' I never thought they would separate us. I asked the officials, crying, 'Where is my daughter?' And they replied, 'We don't know.'""
He said they told him, ""You're going to be deported and your daughter will stay here.""
NPR agreed not to use the family's surname because they worry that speaking out could affect their asylum cases. Federal Immigration Agents Separated More Migrant Children Than Previously Thought
Jose's story is similar to that of thousands of parents who have been torn from their children by the Trump Administration.
Last spring, immigration officials defended the so-called Zero Tolerance policy, saying they were compelled to remove a child when their parent is jailed for a federal crime. But the international community and domestic critics said family separation was an atrocity. Trump rescinded the practice in June.
Then came revelations from the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services that potentially thousands of additional families were separated before Zero Tolerance.
Sent to a youth shelter
When Jose was deported, Yaimy was sent to a government-contracted youth shelter in South Texas where they played soccer in the warm gulf winds. Nearly 200 other girls from Central America were being held there.
""Lots of girls offered to be my family,"" she says, ""but that's not what I wanted. I wanted my papa. I didn't know what to do. I passed the time crying. The staff was good to us. They treated us well. But I missed my papa a lot."" Enlarge this image

""Some of the girls confided to me that they had been treated very badly on the journey to the border,"" Yaimy continues. ""Some were sexually assaulted. At the shelter, some of them would cut themselves. They cried and cut themselves. We couldn't have sharp objects in our room. I cried, but I never cut myself.""
After three months at the shelter, Yaimy was discharged to live with an adult cousin and his family in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. That's where she's been staying for the past five months, in a low-budget apartment with a torn sofa and a large painting of the Last Supper. She's been going to school, taking English classes, attending church, and playing with four rambunctious cousins.
Yaimy was one of nearly 3,000 children forcibly removed from their parents under Zero Tolerance. Most families have been reunited. But some 200 parents were returned to their home countries without their children. Many say they did so reluctantly, or against their will.
Earlier this month, a group of 29 determined parents returned to the border. Jose was among them. They crossed the Mexicali port of entry to ask for asylum and demand to be reunited with their children. According to a pro-immigrant group, Al Otro Lado, most of the 29 parents are still detained.
But immigration agents released Jose, who was traveling with his 9-year-old son, Anderson.
""As sad as it sounds, [Jose] is now one of the lucky parents,"" says Lee Gelernt, a senior attorney with the ACLU who has sued to force the government to reunite the families. ""There are still hundreds of parents in Central America who have not reunited with their children. We're hoping some of them will be allowed back, but at this point very few have been able to come back.""
I cannot imagine being separated from one of my children. We felt that our faith compelled us to open up our home to do whatever possible to help the families that were separated at the border. Sarah Riggio
Jose, Yaimy and Anderson consider themselves doubly lucky. They're together. And on Sunday they boarded a flight from Arlington to Seattle, where they've been taken in by a generous family while they await their day in immigration court.
Sarah Riggio is a stay-at-home mom and a devout Catholic. She found out about the Honduran family on a Facebook post, and decided that her family had to act. They have a spare room in their home.
""When we first heard the news of the family separations taking place at the border, we were absolutely sickened by it,"" Riggio said by phone. ""Having five children of our own, I cannot imagine being separated from one of my children. We felt that our faith compelled us to open up our home to do whatever possible to help the families that were separated at the border.""
Jose marvels at his turn of fortune.
""We're very happy because they're beautiful people, with good hearts"" he says with a huge smile. ""I believe God brought us all together.""
But with this experience I'm not afraid to be out in the world. I want to know even more places. I wasn't this way in Honduras. I've changed a lot. Yaimy, Honduran migrant
As for Yaimy, this immigration odyssey has exposed her to the world outside of her village in a way that she never anticipated. ""In Honduras, I led a boring life. I didn't like to leave the house much,"" she says. ""But with this experience I'm not afraid to be out in the world. I want to know even more places. I wasn't this way in Honduras. I've changed a lot.""
There may be more reunions like this to come. Last week, a federal judge ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for the care of unaccompanied migrant children, might have to find and reunite hundreds, if not thousands, of migrant families that remain separated.
Because, he said, families belong together."

When she's not reporting, she enjoys spending time with her husband and three cats. Jackie Fortier / StateImpact Oklahoma An optometry office in Duncan, Okla. A bill allowing optometrists to practice in big-box stores like Walmart is quietly making its way through the state legislature. It may look familiar to Oklahoma voters, who defeated a similar state question last fall. Oklahoma and Rhode Island are currently the only two states that ban the sale of glasses and contacts outside of non-medical settings and bar optometrists from setting up shop in large retail stores. Senate Bill 100 would lift that ban, allowing chains like Walmart and Target to sell eyewear and allow optometrists to lease office space in the stores. The bill is endorsed by both the state’s optometric association and Walmart, who just a few months ago were on opposing sides of SQ 793. At face value, the two measures look very similar. The constitutional measure would have allowed Oklahoma optometrists to open clinics in large retail stores as well as the sale of eyewear. But last year, state optometrists were vehemently opposed to a section of the state question which would have allowed optometrists sign a contract with a retailer like Walmart limiting their scope of practice — the procedures and services an optometrist is allowed to perform under their state license, including laser eye surgery. Oklahoma optometrists were a powerful foe of the ballot measure and made up a majority of the individual contributions against the state question.
In total, Oklahomans Against SQ 793, headed by the state’s optometric association, spent more than $2.9 million, while the yes campaign funded primarily by Walmart spent more than $4.6 million. The measure failed, but just barely. What changed? “After the election, Walmart expressed a desire to continue on the path that they were going,” said Joel Robison, executive director of the Oklahoma Association of Optometric Physicians . “We had some discussions with them, and discussions within [our] own membership about what’s the best way for us to approach this,” he said. Robison says that during the campaign it was made clear that Oklahomans want more eyewear options. “We decided to develop some legislation that would protect patients and that would require optometrists no matter where they practice, be independent practitioners, that they would not be employees of any retailer, possibly within a retail setting.” He says that unlike in the state question, the bill won’t allow the retailer to dictate any part of the eye exam. Jackie Fortier / StateImpact Oklahoma One of many posters against SQ 793 in Dr. Fritts’ office in Sept. 2018. “The retailer can’t require that so many patients are seen per day or the hours that the optometrist must be open. Any of those things that might allow the retailer to put pressure on optometrists to lower their standard of care,” Robison said. That includes surgeries. Optometrists are not medical doctors and in many states aren’t allowed to perform minor eye surgeries — but in Oklahoma, they can . That became a sticking point during the state question campaign, with Walmart seeking to prohibit laser eye surgeries from being performed in their stores. Oklahoma optometrists fired back, calling it too much corporate interference in their scope of practice. The two sides seemed to have reached a compromise. Under the bill, any optometry clinic within a store is required to be owned and operated by an Oklahoma optometrist who would lease the space from the retailer. The sales of glasses and contacts are done in a separate area by store employees. 23-year rollout Even if the bill passes the legislature in its current form and is signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt, rural Oklahomans will still be waiting a long time before they see an optometrist in their local big box store. The legislation includes a staggered rollout based on population. Retailers would be allowed to offer optometry services as soon as Nov. 1 of this year in counties with populations higher than 300,000, but the most rural will have to wait until 2042. Tags"

Marcus Butt/Getty Images/Ikon Images Marcus Butt/Getty Images/Ikon Images Social psychologist Keith Payne says we have a bias toward comparing ourselves to people who have more than us, rather than those who have less.
Marcus Butt/Getty Images/Ikon Images When Keith Payne was in the fourth grade, he realized he was poor. The epiphany came to him in the cafeteria.
""We had a new cashier in the line that day,"" he said. ""And when I got to the cashier's desk she asked me for, I think it was $1.25. That was the first time that anybody had ever asked me to pay for my lunch because I'd always been on free lunch.""
Keith had been blissfully unaware that many of his classmates were paying for their meals every day. But now, he began comparing himself with his peers.
""It's not like I was poorer the day after that than I was before. Nothing objective had changed. But because of that subjective awareness, now everything seemed different to me.""
Keith Payne is now a social psychologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He's the author of The Broken Ladder: How Inequality Affects the Way We Think, Live, and Die . He says it's human nature to compare ourselves to others. But that instinct can cause psychological stress.
""We think about ourselves in terms of being on a certain rung with some people above us, and other people below us. Where we think we stand on that ladder tells you a lot about a person's life and their life outcomes.""

toggle caption David McNew/Getty Images A study by the think tank Demos finds that black and Latino families with two parents still own only half as much as wealth as white single parents.
David McNew/Getty Images The racial wealth gap has been measured and studied for decades. One fact has remained the same: White families build and accumulate more wealth more quickly than black and brown families do.
The reasons for this are multiple and well-documented. They start at slavery and traverse the historical and deliberate exclusion of people of color from the economic institutions and government programs that helped white Americans build wealth and pass it on to successive generations. Segregation and redlining by banks made it impossible for many black and Latino families to secure mortgages, for example. The GI Bill, which helped establish an American middle class by helping veterans pay for college and buy homes after World War II, mostly excluded people of color.
The results are stark.
In 2013, the median white family held 13 times as much net wealth as the median black family and 10 times as much wealth as the median Latino family, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. Just a decade earlier, the disparity was 7 to 1 for black families , and 9 to 1 for Latino families.
A study released this week by the liberal-leaning think tank Demos offered new points of analysis on the disparity, one of which was particularly sobering. In comparing the wealth held by single-parent white families to that held by black and Latino families with two parents, the authors found that:
The median two-parent black family had $16,000 in wealth. The median two-parent Latino family had $18,800 in wealth. The median single-parent white family had $35,800 in wealth (two-parent white families had $161,300). Black and Latino two-parent families still have half the wealth of white families with just one parent. Demos.org hide caption
toggle caption Demos.org The median single-parent white family had roughly twice as much wealth as the median black or Latino family with two parents. This ratio is interesting for a couple of related reasons.
First, it demonstrates that the financial advantages that come with marriage, like having two earners, qualifying for tax breaks for dependents, and the ability to share expenses, are insufficient to close the racial wealth gap.
Second, as the study points out, the data call to mind Daniel Patrick Moynihan's controversial 1965 report ""The Negro Family."" In it, he attributed poverty among African-Americans to the structure of black families and the fact that many were headed by single mothers. Moynihan argued that the widening gap between black Americans and white Americans would persist so long as ""the deterioration of the Negro family"" did.
A Nation Engaged: Sparking Conversations That Matter Amid A Business Boom, A Wealth Gap Between Races Leaves Some Struggling This premise has often been used to advance the argument that personal responsibility and social respectability are the solution to racial and economic inequity (see: Bill Cosby, et al.). Yet decades of research have demonstrated that this is a faulty premise and cannot explain away the racial wealth gap. The Demos study reiterates this point.
""Family structure does not drive racial inequity, and racial inequity persists regardless of family structure,"" the authors note. ""The benefits of intergenerational wealth transfers and other aspects of white privilege ... benefit white single mothers, enabling them to build significantly more wealth than married parents of color.""
The study uses available data to illustrate other ways that have proved inadequate to close the racial wealth gap. Attending college, working full time, spending less than whites — none of these have been enough to help black and Latinos even begin to achieve parity with white Americans in this regard.

toggle caption Ann Wang/Reuters Detained Reuters journalists Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone are escorted by police as they leave after a court hearing in Yangon, Myanmar, in August. Myanmar's top court rejected their appeal Tuesday, letting their seven-year prison term stand.
Ann Wang/Reuters Two Reuters reporters, jailed after investigating the killing of several Rohingya Muslims, will remain in prison, Myanmar's highest court ruled Tuesday.
""They were sentenced for seven years and this decision stands, and the appeal is rejected,"" Supreme Court Justice Soe Naing told the court, according to Reuters. The judge did not elaborate.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested in December 2017 after they helped expose a massacre of 10 Muslim men and implicated government forces in the killings. Myanmar arrested the journalists for allegedly obtaining confidential government documents.
The two journalists were awarded a Pulitzer Prize for international reporting this month, along with their colleagues. The Reuters report ""expertly"" exposed military units and Buddhist villagers who were ""responsible for the systematic expulsion and murder of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, courageous coverage that landed its reporters in prison,"" the Pulitzer committee said.
The journalists' lawyers argued the police had set them up — and a prosecution witness said in pretrial hearings last year that the police had planted military documents on the reporters to frame them for violating the country's Official Secrets Act. But the lower court found that the reporters had intended to harm national security. And the witness who testified that the police planted evidence was sentenced to one year in prison for violating the Police Disciplinary Act.
With Tuesday's Supreme Court decision, the two Reuters journalists have exhausted their legal appeals in Myanmar.
""Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo did not commit any crime, nor was there any proof that they did,"" Reuters chief counsel Gail Gove said in a statement Tuesday. ""Instead, they were victims of a police set-up to silence their truthful reporting. We will continue to do all we can to free them as soon as possible.""
The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed disappointment in the ruling. ""Myanmar authorities have committed a grave injustice to Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo and their families, and criminalized independent journalism,"" said CPJ Senior Southeast Asia Representative Shawn Crispin. ""They should both be free and able to continue their reporting, not sitting in jail cells. Their conviction and sentence will be an enduring stain on Myanmar's reputation.""
Kyaw Soe Oo's wife ""broke down in tears when the ruling was read,"" The Associated Press reported.
They were also recognized by Time magazine's ""Person of the Year"" issue. ""In prison in Myanmar, two young Reuters reporters remain separated from their wives and children, serving a sentence for defying the ethnic divisions that rend that country,"" Time wrote. ""For documenting the deaths of 10 minority Rohingya Muslims, Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone got seven years. The killers they exposed were sentenced to 10.""
The original verdict was condemned by human rights groups, press freedom associations and Western governments. Vice President Pence said last year he was ""deeply troubled"" by the decision to imprison the journalists. They should ""be commended — not imprisoned — for their work exposing human rights violations & mass killings,"" Pence wrote , calling for their immediate release."
Sri Lanka Blames Islamist Militant Group For Easter Attacks,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715944514/sri-lanka-blames-islamist-militant-group-for-easter-attacks?station=KXJZ_FM,"Government officials in Sri Lanka say that a little-known Islamist extremist group is responsible for the Easter Sunday attacks that killed almost 300 people. No group has claimed responsibility.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Government officials in Sri Lanka are saying that a little-known Islamist extremist group is responsible for the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka yesterday. Almost 300 people were killed in bombings at churches and hotels in that small South Asian country. No group has come forward to claim responsibility, which is adding to a lot of confusion. Let's turn to NPR's Lauren Frayer, who is following this story from Mumbai. Hi, Lauren.
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Hi, David.
GREENE: Let's start off with this group that the government is saying is responsible. Who are they?
FRAYER: We know very little about them, actually. I mean, the world is Googling them right now. It's called the National Thowfeek Jamaath; it's a local Muslim group local to Sri Lanka - not a household name there. It was Sri Lanka's health minister who announced this. So it wasn't the president, nor the prime minister. The health minister said all seven suicide bombers were Sri Lankan nationals. He didn't explain how they know that. It's pretty fast timing if they have done DNA testing on remains, unless they knew exactly who these people were beforehand.
And in fact, that's what many politicians coming out of this emergency meeting today said; that there were warnings about this group possibly weeks and weeks in advance, and that they weren't raised to the highest level of government, that the prime minister was not made aware. And the prime minister himself seemed pretty angry. He called the security footing here inadequate.
And so while everyone's concentrating on this local group, a cabinet spokesman also came out with seemingly contradictory information, saying that this was the work of an international network, not confined to Sri Lanka. And so that left everyone really scratching their heads. I mean, both could be true - this could be locals with international help. And of course, as you mentioned, there's been no claim of responsibility to clarify that.
GREENE: So the government - not at all on the same page right now, at a moment when a lot of people are looking for soothing and answers. I guess we should say the authorities have taken, like, two dozen people in to custody at this point. So they are - they probably are learning something about what happened.
FRAYER: Yeah, so most likely they're interrogating those people. They haven't come out with any information and shared that with the public. We don't know who those people are - whether they're accomplices, even if they're local Sri Lankan nationals or outsiders. There was an explosion last night at a house on the outskirts of the capital, Colombo. Police were doing searches as part of their investigation, and suspects inside that house detonated a blast, killing themselves, rather than being taken into custody alive. Three officers were killed there.
So security operations are very much underway. Police found three more bombs in a van parked in a city on Sri Lanka's west coast today, near one of the churches that was hit yesterday. Those bombs exploded while police were diffusing them. They also found 87 detonators at a bus depot. So there's a feeling that this is, you know, very much still a kinetic operation.
GREENE: So this country, I mean, went through a civil war that ended, like, a decade ago. Now we have this small Islamist extremist group being accused of doing this, at least now. Would that make sense? I mean, did groups like this play a role in the war?
FRAYER: It's really unprecedented. The civil war was started with a separatist insurgency by ethnic minority Tamils, but secular ethnic minority - the Tamil Tigers was one of - the name of one of their groups, and they were fighting for independence from a Buddhist majority. But if this turns out to be a local Muslim group responsible, possibly with help from international militants, it would really be unprecedented.
GREENE: NPR's Lauren Frayer in Mumbai, telling us the latest from Sri Lanka. Lauren, thanks a lot.
FRAYER: You're welcome.

Pompeo: No More Sanctions Waivers For Iranian Oil Importers,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715930346/pompeo-no-more-sanctions-waivers-for-iranian-oil-importers?station=KXJZ_FM,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday announces an end to sanctions waivers it has granted countries that import Iranian oil, such as Japan and Turkey.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The State Department this morning is threatening to punish its allies to get at iran - the United States is trying to get other countries to stop buying Iranian oil.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: Today I'm announcing that we will no longer grant any exemptions. We're going to zero - going to zero across the board.
GREENE: That's the voice of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announcing an end to waivers it had granted to countries like Japan and Turkey. This is all part of an effort the United States began a year ago, when it pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal; that was the international agreement giving Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. Let's talk this through with NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen, who's at the State Department. Hi, Michele.
MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning.
GREENE: So explain exactly what Pompeo's doing here.
KELEMEN: So he came in to discuss this next phase of the pressure campaign, you might say. As you mentioned, the administration pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal a year ago, and it's been reimposing sanctions that were suspended under that deal. And that includes what we call secondary sanctions - that is, sanctions on countries that import oil from Iran.
The U.S. gave seven countries and Taiwan a waiver for six months the last time, but that period is now coming to an end. The administration says it won't extend those waivers any further. They say the oil market is well-supplied now. So they argue that this is a good time to push countries to get to zero, to stop importing Iranian oil completely.
GREENE: So is it just that it's a good time, or do they feel like taking away these waivers could really, you know, hurt the Iranian economy even more?
KELEMEN: Well, that's the big part. I mean, oil is the No. 1 source of cash for Iran's economy. Pompeo says that they've so far denied Iran, he claims, more than $10 billion in oil revenue. But the Trump administration faced some criticism from the right for giving too many waivers the last time around. So now they're cracking down harder.
It's not clear what they're contemplating, as far as punishments are concerned, if these countries do continue to buy oil from Iran. Pompeo says the risks aren't worth the benefits, but his aides really wouldn't say if, you know, these are going to be targeted sanctions or if they're going to go for sanctions that are really going to affect trade relations with these countries. And remember, David, we're talking about countries like China, India and Turkey.
GREENE: Well, can we talk about one of the complexities with the nuclear deal that you and I have spoken about? I mean, when the United States pulled out, other countries did not, and there were all these questions about what the United States could or couldn't do to change other countries' behaviors - is that part of the context here?
KELEMEN: Yeah. I mean, proponents of the deal say that it's working, that Iran is abiding by it, it's limiting Iran's nuclear program. Pompeo downplays that, though. He talks about an enormous coalition which is countering Iran now. He talks about the Gulf states and Israel and some Europeans.
But you know, as you mentioned, there were other world powers that are invested in this - Russia, China, U.K., France and Germany all helped negotiate the deal. The Trump administration always argued that the deal was too weak, and it also didn't cover all these other problems with Iran - Iran's support for militias throughout the region, its ballistic missile programs - and they're trying to really push on that.
GREENE: And as they push on things like this, the ultimate goal of the Trump administration is still - what? - regime change in Tehran?
KELEMEN: Well, they say it's about changing the behavior of Iran. But, of course, there's a lot of questions about how you do that, and it's hard right now to see a pathway for diplomacy on this - a way to get back to some sort of deal, either the Iran nuclear deal or something broader.
GREENE: NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen at the State Department this morning. Michele, thanks, as always.
KELEMEN: Thank you.

U.S. Officials Plan To End Sanction Waivers On Iranian Oil,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715908729/u-s-officials-plan-to-end-sanction-waivers-on-iranian-oil?station=KXJZ_FM,"The U.S. on Monday will tell five countries that they will lose sanctions waivers if they continue to import oil from Iran. David Greene talks to Demetri Sevastopulo of the Financial Times .
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The U.S. State Department is expected to tighten the screws on Iran's oil industry today. And in doing so, the U.S. government is also going to be putting pressure on some of its own allies, like Turkey and Japan. Those countries and a few others have been given waivers from sanctions to continue buying Iranian oil. Those waivers are expected to end.
And joining us to talk about it is Demetri Sevastopulo. He is the Washington bureau chief for the Financial Times. He's been reporting on this. Good morning.
DEMETRI SEVASTOPULO: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So these are waivers to sanctions that are expected to be taken away. Can you just step back and remind us what these sanctions were in the first place?
SEVASTOPULO: Sure. Well, I mean, the U.S. has had sanctions on Iran for a long time. But when the Obama administration signed a deal with Iran in 2015, the landmark Iran nuclear deal with the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, they essentially arranged for waivers so that sanctions that were in place before would not be enforced. Now, when Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018, he signaled that he was going to snap back on those sanctions that had been waived for a long time.
In connection with that, the U.S. had been trying for a long time to get its allies and some partner countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil anyway. And then leading up to November, when the broad sanctions on Iran were put back on last year, the administration said it was going to make sure that its allies and partners reduced oil imports from Iran to zero.
However, when it got close to the point, it actually did give a set of eight waivers to the countries that you mentioned and said it would give them more time - 180 days - to start trying to reduce their imports and their reliance on Iran. Some of those countries - Greece, Italy and Taiwan - actually got their imports, I think, pretty much down to zero. But the others - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - still have a way to go. So basically, what's happening this morning is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to say, on May 2, the waivers will no longer exist, and you will face the potential of U.S. sanctions if you import Iranian oil.
GREENE: And is the expectation that this could have a big effect on Iran and, as always the goal in tough moves like this, to try and change the behavior of the regime?
SEVASTOPULO: Well, it's definitely going to have a greater impact on the Iranian economy, which is already suffering very hard under existing sanctions. So it's going to have more of an effect there. And one of the other questions, obviously, is whether it's going to impact oil prices in the global market.
GREENE: And to what extent could it do that? I mean, could we see, you know, a big spike in gas prices over the summer?
SEVASTOPULO: Well, a year ago, the Trump administration justified giving the waivers. It said, listen; oil markets are very tight right now. If we put the squeeze on, it could be bad for the U.S. economy. Well, oil prices are actually reasonably high right now, as well. They hit a high of $74 in Asia trading overnight, which is not far from where they were a year ago. What the administration here is counting on is that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will actually step in and provide output to make up for the shortfall from putting - Iranian output.
Now, whether it can do that or not will obviously be the test. They say - I talked to an official last night who said that they've arranged that. But you know, these things can fall through. So I think that's got to be the real test.
GREENE: And briefly, why now? Why is the administration doing this now?
SEVASTOPULO: Well, they say that - their logic, they say, is that it's not conducive to do this because oil prices aren't as tight as they were a year ago. But there are a number of people who would doubt that. I think it's also partly that it's just - there is a gradual push to keep ramping up the rhetoric on Iran to try and change the behavior of the regime in Tehran.
GREENE: Demetri Sevastopulo is the Washington bureau chief for the Financial Times, joining us this morning. Thanks for your time, Demetri.
SEVASTOPULO: Thank you.

"After A Decade Of Calm, Explosions Kill Nearly 300 People In Sri Lanka",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715901525/after-a-decade-of-calm-explosions-kill-nearly-300-people-in-sri-lanka?station=KXJZ_FM,"The series of blasts were set off on Easter Sunday — flaming political and social tensions. Rachel Martin talks to Jeffrey Feltman, former under-secretary-general for Political Affairs at the U.N.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Officials in Sri Lanka are trying to determine who knew what and when. Coordinated attacks killed nearly 300 people on Easter Sunday, wounding hundreds more. Authorities in the capital city, Colombo, are blaming a small local Islamist group for the attacks. About two dozen people have now been arrested. Local police reportedly told national authorities about threats to churches weeks ago, but it's unclear whether anyone acted on that information. The bombings come as Sri Lanka is about to mark 10 years since the end of a decades-long civil war.
Jeffrey Feltman is here with us in the studio. He traveled to Sri Lanka frequently as the under-secretary-general for political affairs at the United Nations until 2018, and he happened to have been in Sri Lanka just last month. Thank you so much for being here.
JEFFREY FELTMAN: Thank you very much for inviting me.
MARTIN: May I first ask if you happen to know anything about this group that's being blamed for the attack? I think the name is National Thowheeth Jama'ath.
FELTMAN: Rachel, the first I had heard of this group was this morning in waking up and seeing the news. In fact, I talked to a couple of Sri Lankan friends and contacts this morning, and they also had never heard of this group. So it's completely unknown to even prominent political figures in Sri Lanka. Whether or not the intelligence community there knew or not is a different matter.
And I think it's worth noting that the Muslim community in Sri Lanka has tended to be quiet, has tended to stay out of the news. It's less than 10% of the population. They did not participate in the almost-30-year civil war. And in fact, the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, as recently as a year ago, was victim themselves of sort of mob violence by extremist Buddhist elements. So this is, I think, a shock to at least all the Sri Lankans I've talked to.
MARTIN: So are you saying there was no - was there any religious element to the civil war in Sri Lanka?
FELTMAN: I mean, the civil war was more ethnic - between the Tamil minority, which is 11%, 12% of the population, against the Sinhala Buddhist majority, which is 70%, 74% of the population. It was more ethnic than it was religious, with Tamils extremist group called the Tamil Tigers, a terrorist group - trying to - or basically, it was an independence insurgency for 30 years, finally defeated in May 2009. But it was not religious; it was more ethnic.
MARTIN: So that leads us to the current moment. I mean, as we think about the broader context of these attacks that happened on Sunday - Easter Sunday, what is the political and social situation in Sri Lanka like today?
FELTMAN: Well, I mean, there's been an effort to promote reconciliation, reform, accountability in the aftermath of the end of that civil war. The end of the civil war had a lot of basic human rights - war crimes to end the war. But it did end the war. And so there's been a 10-year attempt to try to do reconciliation, economic development, etc. And it's been - there's been some progress - incomplete homework, I would say, but some progress.
And there's been an increase in tourism. There's been some economic development. I think all of this will certainly be affected by what is a, you know, massive, massive attack that took place on Easter Sunday. And it certainly will eventually play into the politics as they're - in Sri Lanka.
Right now, of course, the government has tried to come together in a unified way to look at what happened, to see how to react. But eventually, there will be political and economic ramifications, I would guess.
MARTIN: I want to get to those in a moment. But I do want to ask about the tactics of response here. The government in Sri Lanka is blocking major social media and messaging services in the country. What does that tell you?
FELTMAN: Well, I think that's a very mixed picture because, obviously, it's hard to get the truth out if you're blocking the vehicles by which people use to communicate between families and loved ones and more broadly. But this is a direct reaction to what happened a year ago, when the Muslim community in the central city of Kandy was attacked by extremist Buddhist mobs who incited their followers to go out using social media. So there's sort of a bad history in Sri Lanka of using Facebook, etc., to spread false information and incite violence.
So I think that explains the government's reason behind stopping the use of social media. But obviously, it has - it's a very mixed bag.
MARTIN: So you alluded to political ramifications. Just when it comes to the situation today - I mean, the prime minister has acknowledged that there may have been some intelligence missteps - that the, quote, ""information was there"" when it came to warnings about potential attacks like this but that he was never personally informed. Does that reflect a deeper rift within the Sri Lankan government?
FELTMAN: Well, there's a - you know, there's a very uneasy relationship between the president of the country, President Sirisena, and the prime minister, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. In fact, in October, the president tried to replace the prime minister with the person the president had defeated in office back in 2015. And he failed constitutionally and judicially, politically to replace the prime minister. But it's clear there's an uneasy relationship between the president and the prime minister.
But I would expect that there would be an attempt to unify the response to this horrible, horrible attack. The issue, though, is that there are presidential elections that must take place constitutionally by the end of the year. And will this become an issue by which the former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was defeated in 2015, tries to promote his party's fortunes by saying he defeated terrorism in 2009 when he exterminated the Tamil Tigers and now he can protect Sri Lanka again?
So I expect this will play out politically inside Sri Lanka over the next few months, even if right now the immediate issue is the aftermath, the investigation, security.
MARTIN: Right - and lives lost and grieving those lives. Jeffrey Feltman, former under-secretary-general for Political Affairs at the United Nations. Thank you so much for coming into the studio.
FELTMAN: Thank you very much for having me.

A lifetime after India cast off colonial rule, it's embracing a new identity and its majority Hindu faith is playing a big part.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The world's biggest democracy, India, is holding elections right now. Voting actually began earlier this month, and it lasts for five weeks. During these elections, we're looking at a big trend in India. As its economy has opened to the world and grown really robustly, so has Hindu pride. Some call it Hindu nationalism. A lifetime after India cast off colonial rule, it is embracing a new identity, and its majority-Hindu faith is a big part of that.
NPR's India correspondent Lauren Frayer joins us now to talk about this theme and also tell us about the story she's going to be bringing us in the coming days. Hi, Lauren.
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Hi there.
GREENE: So can I start with a really basic question? What is Hindu nationalism?
FRAYER: Sure. So Hinduism is the biggest religion in India. Polytheistic. That means that there are many gods. And it's historically been open to embracing of diversity of traditions. About 80 percent of Indians are Hindus. Now, Hindu nationalism is political. It's the idea that the Hindu faith and culture should shape the state and its policies. And the movement has its roots in the 19th century, in opposition to liberal Hindu reformers, colonialism and Christian missionaries.
GREENE: OK. So this is something that started in opposition to something else a long time ago. Why is it on your mind now? Why are we thinking about it?
FRAYER: Because Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a Hindu nationalist. He belongs to a Hindu nationalist political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. And he spent his formative years working for this group called the RSS. Some members call it, like, a Hindu version of the Boy Scouts, focusing on values in civic life. But, you know, they also train with weapons and have participated in anti-Muslim riots. Modi is running for a second term, and many see this election as a real turning point for India. Milan Vaishnav, who directs the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C., says this election will determine...
MILAN VAISHNAV: India's future as a secular republic that embraces pluralism and, you know, kind of adheres to the founders' notion that India's unity is strengthened by its diversity. And over the past five years, we have seen the rise of a Hindu Nationalist Party and the spread of this kind of nationalist ideology.
FRAYER: And that ideology is often at odds with the secularism that is enshrined in India's constitution, the whole system that India has really had since independence from Britain in 1947.
GREENE: So this is really quite a moment in this country. I mean, it's been secular for - I mean, I'm just doing the math - for, like, 70 or so years. Where's this drive to change that coming from?
FRAYER: Right. So let's go back to India's founding - 1947, freedom from the British, India decided to become secular. And here's why. India is so diverse. I mean, there are hundreds of languages, ethnic groups, castes and the founding fathers, among them Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, believed that really only a pluralist democracy could hold such diversity together. Hindu nationalists, though, were really miffed. They wanted a Hindu state, and they didn't get it. And it was actually a Hindu nationalist who, less than a year later, assassinated Gandhi.
And so Gandhi's death sort of shut down this whole debate, and secularism took hold. And now, a lifetime later, the debate is opening up. India elected a Hindu nationalist, Prime Minister Modi. Right now, like, even secular parties are scrambling to brandish their Hindu nationalist cred because it's just so popular with voters.
GREENE: OK. You have a prime minister who's a Hindu nationalist. I mean, Hindu nationalism is now mainstream. This party's been in power for five years. How has India as a country, as a culture, changed?
FRAYER: Beef bans, for example. Cows are sacred to Hindus. I can get a hamburger in my Mumbai neighborhood, but it's buffalo meat. Ayurveda is all the rage. That's food, health and beauty products based on ancient Hindu healing traditions. You know, in the U.S., you've got this wellness craze, Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop. Well, here it's a Hindu wellness industry, and it's absolutely booming. The very map of India is changing. Cities and landmarks with Muslim-sounding names - Allahabad, for example, a city in northern India built by Muslim kings in the 16th century, they've changed its name to Prayagraj, a word that refers to a Hindu holy site there.
I went to that city, and I spoke with Yogeshwar Tiwari. He's the head of the local university history department. And he calls those Muslim kings invaders who forcibly converted Hindus, and he says now history has to be revised.
YOGESHWAR TIWARI: People now certainly feel history has not been presented and narrated and understood in the way that it should have been understood. Every nation goes through course correction.
FRAYER: And that makes Indian Muslims pretty uncomfortable. This is their heritage. One in 6 Indians is Muslim. They're a bigger minority than African-Americans are in the U.S. We're talking about 180 million people here.
GREENE: So if India moves farther and farther away from the secular past, and Hindu identity really takes hold even more, what does that look like? What are the implications?
FRAYER: So some say India could become a Hindu homeland in the way Israel is a homeland for Jews worldwide. In fact, Modi's government has introduced a new citizenship amendment bill that would give Indian citizenship to anybody persecuted in neighboring countries, except if they're Muslim. So India would be using religion as a criteria for citizenship for the first time. Another possible model is Turkey, a secular republic that's seen its majority-Muslim faith brought into public life in a more overt way under Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
GREENE: Well, so you're covering an election right now, and this whole conversation seems very central. I mean, it's really a debate about getting to the heart of who India wants to be. And a lot will ride on whether Prime Minister Modi wins this or not. What do you think? What are the polls suggesting?
FRAYER: So most observers say he will win, and the question is by how much. And that would really determine his mandate to change the country. But it's not just Modi. Tanika Sarkar is a historian, retired from Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, and she says Hindu nationals have grown these really deep roots into Indian society.
TANIKA SARKAR: They have associations among students, trade unions, retired army people. You know, religion, of course, temples. They have penetrated the everyday lives of Hindus in a very big way. Whether they win the election or lose the election, this work will go on.
FRAYER: India's still a young country, 72 years old. It's still really working out who it wants to be. And increasingly, Hindu nationalism is going to be a part of the answer to that.
GREENE: Such interesting stuff. Well, you have me interested in this election very much now. I can't wait to follow your stories as you bring them to us later this week.
FRAYER: Thanks so much, David.
GREENE: Thank you. That's NPR's Lauren Frayer speaking to us this morning from Mumbai.

Just one of the many questions about his potential candidacy is whether he is too centrist for today's Democratic Party. Here's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Donald Trump has a theory of the case for the 2020 election - according to his campaign strategists, any Democrat who wins the nomination will have moved so far to the left, they'll be an easy target for the president to disqualify as a Socialist.

LIASSON: And at least right now, the frontrunner in the Democratic race is a self-identified Democratic Socialist.

BERNIE SANDERS: Democratic socialism, to me, is creating a government and an economy and a society which works for all rather than just the top 1%.
LIASSON: One of Bernie Sanders' goals is the textbook definition of socialism - he wants a government takeover of the health insurance industry, ""Medicare for All."" But other Democrats don't want socialism; they just want a stronger social safety net in order to reduce extreme inequality, restore economic mobility and make sure free market capitalism creates broadly shared prosperity. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says that Bernie Sanders may be leading the pack right now, but his brand of democratic socialism isn't embraced by the majority of Democratic primary voters.
CELINDA LAKE: Every single Democrat out there wants to have some kind of guaranteed medical insurance for everyone, and they want it to be affordable. Eighty-three percent want to invest more resources in infrastructure and dealing with climate change. Now, is that a Green New Deal or something else? Is that Medicare for All or something else?
LIASSON: The answer to those questions will be determined next year. Meanwhile, there are a lot of clues that actual Democratic voters may be less liberal than the image created by Donald Trump or the disproportionate media coverage given to the most left-leaning members of Congress. For example, a Gallup poll in December found that 54% of Democrats want their party to be more moderate; a smaller number, 41%, want their party to be more liberal. And, says Lake, there's another important data point about Democratic voters.
LAKE: For the first time, people actually think that the person that they like the best might be different from the person who can most beat Donald Trump. Always before, people kind of pick their person as the person they thought was most electable.
LIASSON: So right now Democratic voters are feeling a lot more pragmatic than they have in the past. And despite all that youthful energy coursing through the party, Celinda Lake points out that in primary states like New Hampshire and South Carolina, a fresh, new face might not be in demand.
LAKE: In all of the early states, about two-thirds of the voters are over 50, and that older electorate likes experience.
LIASSON: J. Ann Selzer, who conducts the Iowa poll, asked Democrats there whether it's important to have a younger candidate. Her poll specifically asked about Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
J ANN SELZER: In both cases, running before and the experience in office won out over saying, the time for either of those candidates has passed. So there is no sense in this poll - and this was done in March - that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are too old.
LIASSON: Biden's allies also have a theory of the case for 2020, and it's the polar opposite of Trump's - Biden's strategists believe the majority of Democratic voters are not living in woke-a-topia (ph). Instead of reflecting the voices of Democratic activists on social media, Biden's aides believe the Democratic voters value experience and pragmatism, and they think it's a good thing - not a bad thing - to work across the aisle. So if Biden's advisers are right, age and ideology won't stop his campaign. But as he's already seen, Biden will have plenty of other obstacles to clear.

"Believe It Or Not, Brexit Is Actually Helping The European Union",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875284/believe-it-or-not-brexit-is-actually-helping-the-european-union?station=KXJZ_FM,"When the United Kingdom voted for Brexit nearly three years ago, some thought it might mark the beginning of the end of the European Union. But a Brexit domino theory has remained just that.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
So when the United Kingdom voted for Brexit nearly three years ago, some thought it might mark the beginning of the end of the European union; instead, it is the U.K. itself that has descended into political chaos, and now many other countries in Europe see Brexit as a cautionary tale. Here's NPR's Frank Langfitt.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: After the 2016 Brexit referendum, many wondered if France, the Netherlands or Italy might follow the U.K.'s lead.
(SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: After the Brexit, is a Frexit (ph) possible?
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Recent polls show half of Dutch voters want a referendum on EU membership.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Will we see the end of the EU as we know it?
LANGFITT: But a Brexit domino theory has remained just that. Isabell Hoffman tracks opinion in the EU for Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German independent foundation. She says Brexit hasn't hurt the EU's standing; it's actually helped it.
ISABELL HOFFMAN: We do see a Brexit effect in the numbers when it comes to support for the European Union, actually. They go up in a significant manner, and they stay up ever since.
LANGFITT: Hoffman says support is up 10 percentage points since the referendum.
HOFFMAN: Which means that there are now roughly 70% of people who'd say, we would vote for our country to stay in the European Union.
LANGFITT: The EU's a political union and trading bloc of 28 nations. Observers say more people are rallying to support it these days because it's under siege, and they're wary of leaving because the Brexit process has been a disaster. George Papaconstantinou, who served as Greece's finance minister, says much of Europe has watched Brexit play out with horror.
GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU: With disbelief, astonishment - a country which prides itself as having an extremely robust parliamentary system suddenly finds itself completely adrift.
LANGFITT: He says the chaos has served as a warning to other countries that might want to follow Britain's path.
PAPACONSTANTINOU: The whole process of Brexit being so complicated, so difficult, made people realize that you don't leave the EU so easily.
LANGFITT: Euroskeptic parties in France, the Netherlands and Sweden have since backed off calls for Frexit, Nexit (ph) or Swexit (ph) referenda and focused on changing the EU from inside. In the last decade, the EU has weathered an immigration and a financial crisis. Papaconstantinou, who spoke over Skype, says some people appreciate it more these days.
PAPACONSTANTINOU: It's much more than just fearing the divorce. I think that there is a shift in attitudes of people actually believing in some kind of a common destiny in a way that they didn't five years ago.
LANGFITT: But the European Union continues to face big problems - economic growth is slowing, the population is aging, and its critics are gaining more political power.
MATTHEW GOODWIN: I think you can make a convincing case for why the challenges to the EU have gained momentum.
LANGFITT: Matthew Goodwin is a professor of politics at the University of Kent.
GOODWIN: Populism is a bigger issue today for Europe than it was in 2016. We've got populists running Italy, which also happens to be the third-largest economy in the eurozone. You've got breakthroughs for similar parties in Sweden, now Spain, Germany, Austria, now Estonia.
LANGFITT: Goodwin says the EU has the upper hand now, and the Brexit mess has strengthened it. But he thinks the long-term success of the European Union is far from certain. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, London.

Nearly 300 People Are Killed In Easter Sunday Attacks In Sri Lanka,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875277/nearly-300-people-are-killed-in-easter-sunday-attacks-in-sri-lanka?station=KXJZ_FM,"A curfew has been lifted, the day after a series of explosions hit churches and hotels. David Greene talks to freelance journalist Lisa Fuller in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Coordinated bombings across Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday killed at least 290 people and wounded more than 500 others. These blasts hit luxury hotels as well as churches. The country's health minister confirms that all the suicide bombers were local, but they had the help of an international network. The Archbishop of Colombo spoke after the attacks.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MALCOLM RANJITH: And I ask all our Sri Lankan people not to take the law into their own hands and to maintain peace and harmony in this country.
GREENE: The U.S. State Department, in a revised travel advisory, is warning that terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Sri Lanka. Journalist Lisa Fuller is in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo. Lisa, thanks for taking the time for us this morning.
LISA FULLER: Thanks for having me.
GREENE: So what are we learning about who carried this out?
FULLER: So we have rapidly changing and evolving information. So the health minister gave a press conference saying that the attacks were carried out by a group called the National Thowheeth Jama'ath and that they may have had the assistance of an international network but that they - all of the bombers were Sri Lankan. But at that same time, there was another minister giving a briefing saying that the attacks were carried out by a gang and not an organized outfit. So basically, throughout the last 24 hours, the only thing that is completely clear is that there are divisions within the government. And sort of that lack of coordination may have had something to do with the lapses in security.
GREENE: Who is the group who you did mention, who might have done this?
FULLER: They're not a group that anyone - or not very many people are familiar with. They are purportedly Islamic extremists, but it's not a name that is known well within Sri Lanka.
GREENE: As I understand it, you have a relative who was right outside one of the churches when an explosion there happened. Can you tell me what you've heard from that relative?
FULLER: Yeah. My sister-in-law was parking her motorcycle outside one of the churches, about to go in for the Easter service, when the bomb went off. So yeah, she's safe and fine, but there were children that were sort of thrown from the blast right out in front of her. So it was pretty gruesome in terms of, you know, the bodies and the carnage that she was describing, which I guess is what you expect in attacks like this.
GREENE: Yeah. Well, I'm glad she's OK. These attacks - I mean, this comes - what? - like, 10 years after the civil war in Sri Lanka ended. I mean, are people suggesting this is somehow tied to the forces that were at work in that conflict?
FULLER: So - yeah, it's almost exactly 10 years after - in fact, next month it'll be 10 years. But this violence looks nothing like anything in the civil war. That was fought between the majority Sinhala Buddhist government and a separatist group from the minority Tamil communities. Tamils are Christian and Hindus. And Muslims are not only a separate religion, but they're also a separate ethnic group in Sri Lanka.
So I mean, even after the civil war, there were much lower levels of violence. But this - in terms of scale and in terms of form in Sri Lanka, we haven't seen anything like this in recent history.
GREENE: Journalist Lisa Fuller is in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, on Skype with us this morning. Thanks for your reporting.
FULLER: Thank you.

'Invisibilia' Team Takes A Deep Dive Into The Science Of Desire,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875270/invisibilia-team-takes-a-deep-dive-into-the-science-of-desire?station=KXJZ_FM,"Most of us have a ""type"" — certain quirks and qualities we're just more into, that pique our sexual desire. But why are we attracted to the people we're attracted to?
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
The fifth season of NPR's podcast Invisibilia just wrapped. And in it, the team drove deep into the science of desire with a story of one young woman who diagnosed a problem with her own sexual attractions - a problem not too many people would be willing to talk about publicly. We are using the first initial of this woman's name to protect her privacy.
Also, a warning - this story may not be suitable for younger listeners. Here's NPR's Yowei Shaw.
YOWEI SHAW, BYLINE: It was 2013. L was a sophomore in college procrastinating yet again on Reddit when she happened upon a thread about sexual attraction. One of the posters was asking people what races they were most sexually attracted to. And L was like, interesting question. And she posted...
L: I'm mostly attracted to white and Asian guys. But, you know, I'd like - I like to be open-minded.
SHAW: L thought nothing of it until someone replied to her comment.
L: Oh, so you won't date brown guys or black guys.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
L: I was just like, oh, like, I think you're mistaken. Like, oh, no. Like, I'm not racist. I said I'm open-minded to dating other people.
SHAW: L was proud to be Chinese American. She was even creating safe spaces online for other Asian American women to process the racism and misogyny they had to deal with every day. So the call-out blindsided her. Until one night, L was lying in bed, swiping on Tinder with her index finger.
L: I started to realize, as I was swiping past faces, I was unconsciously, like, rejecting people because of, like, the color of their skin. And it shook me. It made me feel bad.
SHAW: There's been a lot written about how our sexual attractions are programmed by the culture - what movies we watch, what we learn about race growing up, what our families teach us. So here's my question. Once your racial preferences have been programmed by your cultural bubble, can you change them?
I started calling around to sex researchers. But before I tell you what I found out, one quick note - basically, almost all the researchers I spoke to told me there's a huge difference between something like sexual orientation and racial preference. Sexual orientation is much more biologically based, whereas racial preferences are not written into your genes, not even if you feel a racial preference strongly.
GONZALO QUINTANA ZUNINO: It's kind of sad that people would just say, I just have one type - when they haven't even tried more.
SHAW: Gonzalo Quintana Zunino is a neuroscientist in Canada about to start his postdoc at the University of Toronto. He's done several studies, mostly with rats, trying to understand how people might form their partner preferences on the level of skin color or dimples.
And he has an idea about why they could be hard to change. In a recent study, he conditioned rats to develop preferences for perfumed rats and found that the male rats that had all their early sexual experiences with perfumed females...
ZUNINO: They obviously prefer the female that was bearing the scent.
SHAW: But if rats had climaxed for the first time with a non-perfumed rat - even if they went on to have a lot of sex with perfumed partners, the rats did not show a preference for perfume...
ZUNINO: Exactly.
SHAW: ...All of which taught to Zunino a crucial lesson that might even apply to people.
ZUNINO: The first sexual experience - the first cut was very deep.
SHAW: That's because, whenever you have your first sexual experience with pleasure, your brain is activating two key chemicals, dopamine and oxytocin. And together, they increase pleasure and desire, arousal and bonding. And once you experience their effects, you will never forget the circumstances that made it all happen.
ZUNINO: Whatever that is around and whatever that - your partner looks like.
SHAW: And once you have an orgasm, you will pay even more attention to those cues in the future.
ZUNINO: Absolutely.
SHAW: And if you repeat the pleasure with those characteristics over and over...
ZUNINO: Well, that will just constantly reaffirm to your brain, this is what you like.
SHAW: But that doesn't mean any preference is set in stone. Zunino thinks you can't subtract what's already been laid down. But you can probably add new preferences by exposing yourself to new kinds of people.
ZUNINO: We're not prisoners of our past.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Laughing).
SHAW: People are actually trying to think through how to do this in a systematic way, like Russell Robinson, a professor at Berkeley Law School who, for the past 10 years, has been teaching students about the ways in which social structures influence are romantic choices.
RUSSELL ROBINSON: I don't believe in any sort of firm rules like everybody must be open to every race or everybody must stay within their race.
SHAW: His position is, basically, we live in a structurally racist world. So the solution isn't to shame individuals for the romantic choices. Instead, just look at your own attraction patterns and try to understand what might be shaping them.
ROBINSON: Might you rethink that, might you expose yourself to different types of people and try to shed the bias that has created those preferences if that's the reason behind the preferences.
SHAW: Robinson doesn't even think having a racial preference is necessarily wrong. You might have very good reasons for having one. But here's what he says is key. It shouldn't be based in a racial stereotype, potentially even including stereotypes about white people. One day in class, a Latino student told Robinson she could never date a white man because a white man could never see her as fully human.
ROBINSON: And so I told that to my dear friend who is herself Latina. And she said, you just know the universe is going to send her an amazing white man. So I like that idea that, like, you know, establishing these rules and thinking that, you know, you figured it out - it's, like, then life happens.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SHAW: Remember L from the beginning? Well, she accidentally stumbled into a version of Robinson's advice on her own. After the Tinder epiphany, she set off on a personal journey to evaluate the patterns of her own romantic attraction.
L: I remember thinking, like, well, why do you like him so He's - honestly, like - it's just like, he's so basic.
SHAW: And over the next few years, she began to notice new people on the street and on dating apps.
L: Sure. Oh, OK - great. He likes me. Hey.
SHAW: Pausing over all kinds of people she used to instinctually swipe away.
L: Then I would stop and like look at you, just really give a hard look at the whole picture.
SHAW: Yowei Shaw, NPR.

It Appears A Sitcom Star Will Be The Next President Of Ukraine,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875246/it-appears-a-sitcom-star-will-be-the-next-president-of-ukraine?station=KXJZ_FM,"With most of the votes counted, it appears a comedian with no political experience will become president. He made a name for himself on TV playing a teacher who becomes president by a twist of fate.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Art is imitating life in Ukraine. Almost all the votes have been counted in the presidential election there, and the winner is a comedian who plays a president on television.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKIY: (Foreign language spoken).
(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)
MARTIN: And that is the voice of Vol - Volodymyr - I'll get it out - Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He was greeting supporters Sunday night after his landslide victory. He made a name for himself in a TV show, called, ""Servant Of The People,"" in which he plays a high school teacher who becomes Ukraine's president by a twist of fate. NPR's Lucian Kim has been covering the election, and we've got him on the line from Moscow. Hi, Lucian.
LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning.
MARTIN: So Zelenskiy has no political experience, unless you count playing a president on TV as experience. Clearly, Ukrainians were willing to take a risk here. Why?
KIM: Practically everybody in Ukraine knows Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanks to his various TV shows and especially that show, ""Servant Of The People,"" where he plays this honest, incorruptible guy who ends up being president. What's amazing is that despite Zelenskiy being a household name, people don't really know what he stands for.
And during the election campaign, he was very vague about his positions. And in that way, he really became a blank slate for people to project whatever they wanted on him. Ukrainians expected real change from the incumbent Petro Poroshenko, whom they elected five years ago. They wanted a resolution to a Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine. They wanted an end to corruption and a turnaround in the economy.
And I think the fact that they chose Zelenskiy shows how desperate people are. But at the same time, I think it's worth noting that this was a victory for democracy in Ukraine. Poroshenko almost immediately conceded defeat. And now there will be a peaceful transfer of power.
MARTIN: Right. So that is significant. But what about Ukraine's conflict with Russia? It's been going on for years now. I mean, what will Zelenskiy's victory mean for that?
KIM: Well, this is the big question, and maybe even the biggest question. Poroshenko, the incumbent, had tried to portray himself as the only candidate who could stand up to Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. This is what Poroshenko said after conceding on Sunday night.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PETRO POROSHENKO: You may just look at the celebration in the Kremlin of the occasion of the election. They believe that with a new, inexperienced Ukrainian president, Ukraine could be quickly returned to the Russian orbit of influence.
KIM: So there's been a real personal animosity between Poroshenko and Putin in recent months, and Putin pretty much made clear that he didn't want to deal with Poroshenko anymore. So now with Zelenskiy's victory, there may in fact be an opening. I think by voting for Zelenskiy, Ukrainians showed that they're really tired by this low-level war with Russia.
MARTIN: What about Ukraine's relationship with the U.S.? I mean, Poroshenko was a close ally. Does Zelenskiy see the United States in the same way?
KIM: Well, Poroshenko has certainly made a lot of his relationship to the U.S. And as we just heard, he portrayed Zelenskiy as someone who could be easily manipulated by the Kremlin. So it remains to be seen how Zelenskiy will develop his relations with the U.S. We're hearing that President Trump has already congratulated Zelenskiy and said that the U.S. would continue to support Ukraine.
But Ukraine's big problem has always been that it's never really been front and center in U.S. foreign policy. Zelenskiy may actually have a chance to meet President Trump at the beginning of June. They're both expected to be at the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France.
MARTIN: All right. NPR's Lucian Kim for us from Moscow. Lucian, thanks. We appreciate it.
KIM: Thanks, Rachel.

College Admissions Scandal Reveals Difficult Path To Acceptance,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875260/college-admissions-scandal-reveals-difficult-path-to-acceptance?station=KXJZ_FM,"Getting into college is already difficult and unnerving for many students. For low-income students, the recent college admissions scandal is prompting a crisis of faith about how fair the practice is.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Trying to get into college is already difficult and unnerving for many students, but the massive college admissions scandal is prompting a crisis of faith about the fairness of the process. Max Larkin from member station WBUR has more.
MAX LARKIN, BYLINE: Sitting inside Harvard's gleaming new campus center, Jose Larios doesn't have many illusions about how the system works.
JOSE LARIOS: Wealth is extremely influential in college access. If you come from a well-off family in, say, Beverly Hills, odds are you've heard of college, the SAT, the ACT. Your child, from a very young age, has that as an expectation.
LARKIN: But famous families using bribes and fraud to get their kids in - that caught Larios by surprise. It felt like overkill.
LARIOS: So how someone could, like, already be extremely advantaged already and then decide, let me actually break the law, break the system more than already is, and commit fraud - that is shocking to me.
LARKIN: Walking across campus, Larios explains that he didn't have those same advantages growing up in Jamaica, Queens. He remembers telling his parents - who immigrated from Honduras - about his plan for the SAT.
LARIOS: I actually had to explain to them what I was actually doing with these, like, large volumes of books I would, like, borrow from the library.
LARKIN: Larios took the subway to free preparatory programs across New York City. They taught him some of the hard truths about higher education.
LARIOS: Student from, like, my background would have, like, a graduation rate of less than 10%.
LARKIN: Now in his junior year, Larios is beating those odds. And he gives a lot of credit to programs designed to expand college access for people like him. They don't just demystify financial aid or offer test prep. They give students from low-income backgrounds a place to strategize, celebrate and vent. And now they're coping with questions of fairness.
ZAIRA GARCIA: There's a lot of work that is put into going to college. To see that they just reap the benefits without putting in that work - I was like, wow, that's basically telling us to, like, screw off.
LARKIN: That's Zaira Garcia, a senior at East Boston High School. Most of that school's students come from low-income households. And less than half of its graduates were enrolled in college in the spring after graduation. Garcia works with the school's GEAR UP office - a state-run college prep program. She's an athlete, and she's in at Northeastern with a generous scholarship.
But her classmate, Naylene Rivera, wasn't so lucky. Rivera says she's a good student, also an athlete, and engaged in her school. But that left one big problem - SAT stress.
NAYLENE RIVERA: I was just, like, staring at my tests, thinking about how I'm not going to do well because I don't have enough time. I studied, but I'm forgetting everything in the moment. So I just think it's not fair.
LARKIN: For all the GEAR UP seniors at school that day, the memory of the SAT is tied up with panic and mostly disappointing results. And though a few say they know their lives won't be determined by test scores or college acceptances, they add that sometimes it can feel that way, especially coming from their background. It's a paradox for young adults at public city high schools. They may have more to gain than anyone from attending top-flight colleges, but those colleges still aren't set up to welcome them en masse.
Back at Harvard, Jose Larios understands how that school could change his own future.
LARIOS: I can absolutely see, like, why this is a springboard for someone, like, from a low-income background. There's professional experiences straight out of college where they pay you six-figure salaries.
LARKIN: But he says, for now, he has other plans. He wants to go into public policy to try to even the odds for students like him. For NPR News, I'm Max Larkin in Boston.

Profile: U.S. Attorney Zachary Terwillger May Prosecute WikiLeaks Case : NPR,www.npr.org,Carrie Johnson,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/23/716039558/key-u-s-attorney-swept-into-russia-investigation-may-prosecute-wikileaks-case,"12 Years Of Disruption: A WikiLeaks Timeline
Terwilliger's current and former colleagues said he embodies a quality that is sometimes unusual in the Washington area: sincerity.
""First and foremost in my mind about Zach is, he's genuine,"" said Alice Fisher, who tried to hire Terwilliger when she ran the Justice Department's criminal division in the George W. Bush years.
""He really cares about his colleagues as well — not only the mission, but who the people are and how their work environment is and about the things that really matter, not only in the work environment but the personal environment,"" Fisher said. Highlights From The Mueller Report, Annotated
Eventually, Virginia's two Democratic senators recommended Terwilliger to serve as U.S. attorney there. In August 2018, he was sworn in to the historic post.
The top federal prosecutor's office in Alexandria dates to 1789. The first U.S. attorney there was John Marshall, who went on to become chief justice of the United States.
Neil MacBride was the chief prosecutor in the place he calls E.D.V.A. in the Obama years.
""E.D.V.A. has had a front-row seat in everything from Cold War espionage cases to post-9/11 terrorism cases to some of the biggest financial fraud and extraterritorial cases from threats around the world,"" MacBride said. Mueller Report Raises New Questions About Russia's Hacking Targets In 2016
But the case getting the most attention these days involves Assange. About two weeks ago, American prosecutors finally unsealed their case against him. He faces a single charge: conspiracy to commit computer hacking.
On Monday, a federal appeals court turned back a bid by former Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning to be released from federal custody while she fights a subpoena in the case. Manning has refused to testify before a grand jury, despite a grant of immunity from prosecutors. Manning delivered sensitive diplomatic cables and war logs to WikiLeaks.
But authorities are continuing to investigate and could bring more charges in the next month or so. Experts say those new charges could cover the disclosure of secret CIA hacking tools or the 2016 election. See How Much Of The Mueller Report Is Redacted
In a recent interview, Terwilliger didn't want to get into the specifics.

It was a lucrative business strategy because such clinics could charge higher rates, on the premise that they were part of a hospital. Medicare's recent rule change puts a damper on all that.
Hero Images/Getty Images Eric Lewis' plans of expanding his community hospital's reach have been derailed.
As CEO of Olympic Medical Center, he oversees efforts to provide care to roughly 75,000 people in Clallam County, in the isolated, rural northwestern corner of Washington state.
Last year, Lewis planned to build a primary care clinic in Sequim, a town about 17 miles from the medical center's main campus of a hospital and clinics in Port Angeles.
Shots - Health News Patients Can Pay A High Price For ER Convenience But those plans were put aside, Lewis says, because of a change in federal reimbursements this year. Medicare has opted to pay hospitals that have outpatient facilities ""off campus"" a lower rate — equivalent to what it pays independent doctors for clinic visits.
Over the past decade, hospitals have been rapidly building outpatient clinics or purchasing existing independent ones. It was a lucrative business strategy because such clinics could charge higher rates, on the premise that they were part of a hospital.
With its new policy, Medicare is essentially saying that an off-campus office is an off-campus office, regardless of whether it's owned by a hospital, a group of doctors or a solo practitioner.
Taking that position will save Medicare — and possibly patients — money.
The federal insurer bore the brunt of its members' extra charges, but beneficiaries sometimes picked up part of that expense through deductibles and copayments. Patients with commercial insurance often were blindsided by high bills — going to what seemed to be a normal primary care clinic, only to discover they were charged a hospital facility fee , for example.
Shots - Health News When The Hospital Is Boss, That's Where Doctors' Patients Go Health policy analysts say the new policy represents an important step in rationalizing payments. Part of a strategy called ""site neutral"" payment, the new policy has its roots in the Obama administration and was part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.
""You don't care about where [your treatment is] happening. You care that it's a safe and inexpensive procedure,"" says Gerard Anderson , director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance and Management. ""And the facility fee just adds to the cost with very little added value.""
The new payment structure may financially hurt some hospitals, he and other experts acknowledge. But making reimbursements more uniform across providers facilitates competition and may lead commercial insurance to follow suit — which could translate to more savings for patients.
This year, the policy's two-part phase-in cut Medicare payments for clinic visits to outpatient departments by 30%, according to the rule finalized in November. By 2020, the payment rates will be cut by 60% compared with what they were last summer.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimates that the change will save the federal government $380 million this year and patients an average of $7 every time they visit a hospital-owned clinic. Clinic visits are the most commonly charged service for hospital outpatient care under Medicare.
It could also cut down on consolidation in the industry, health care economists say, by closing the loophole that created incentives for hospitals to purchase independent physician practices and charge higher rates for services at taxpayers' expense.
The American Hospital Association filed a lawsuit late last year alleging that CMS overstepped its authority when setting the new reimbursement schedule. Olympic Medical Center is among the plaintiffs.
Shots - Health News CVS Looks To Make Its Drugstores A Destination For Health Care The hospital association claims that the new rule infringes on a precedent Congress set with the 2015 budget law. That legislation standardized Medicare payments for clinic visits to physicians' offices and new hospital outpatient facilities, but allowed most hospital-affiliated departments that existed at that time to continue receiving a higher rate, according to a comment letter from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. The group is a nonpartisan agency that advises Congress.
The differential for site-based payments was designed originally to help hospitals offset the higher costs they incur for maintaining the staff and equipment to handle a wide variety of treatments, says Christopher Whaley, an associate policy researcher at the research organization Rand Corp.
But that financial relief became an incentive for hospitals to buy independent practices, says Dr. Ateev Mehrotra , associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School. Hospitals were able to charge higher prices for services performed at newly acquired clinics.
Mehrotra says the new CMS rule could be a way to slow down the trend.
""This isn't going to fully put the brakes on it,"" he says, ""but it could be one push on the brakes here — to kind of push that consolidation down.""
Some health care analysts have urged the government to expand the number of services covered by the site-neutral policy, including paying hospitals' on-site clinics a rate equivalent to what independent doctors receive.
Hospitals acknowledge that the change implemented by CMS could lead to savings in the health care system, but they say it comes at the cost of patients' convenient access to medical care. In Washington state, Lewis anticipates a loss of $1.6 million for his hospital.
The lack of a clinic in Sequim means ailing patients there will not be able to get care close to their homes, Lewis says.
""If you're well-to-do financially, these aren't big problems,"" Lewis adds. ""But I think the poorest, elderly, sickest of our society will pay the price of this policy.""
Melinda Hatton, general counsel for the hospital association , agrees. ""I think access trumps a couple extra dollars in copays every single time,"" she says.
On the other hand, many independent physicians support the change. Marni Jameson Carey, executive director of the Association of Independent Doctors , says she hopes the rule will curb consolidation.
According to a recent report by the consulting firm Avalere, the number of hospital-owned physician practices more than doubled from 35,700 to 80,000 between July 2012 and January 2018. Hospitals own more than 31% of all physician practices, the report found.
Jameson Carey says such mergers can also cause problems for the local economy. When a nonprofit hospital acquires an independent clinic, it effectively removes a tax-paying business from the area. That's because nonprofit hospitals are exempt from paying certain federal, state and local taxes — in exchange for providing community benefits.
""So, not only do they [hospitals] get the facility fee,"" Jameson Carey says, ""they don't have to pay taxes.""

Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments Over 2020 Census Citizenship Question : NPR,www.npr.org,Hansi Lo Wang,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/23/705210786/a-decade-of-implications-at-stake-supreme-court-hears-census-citizenship-questio,"Enlarge this image The Supreme Court justices are hearing oral arguments Tuesday over the citizenship question the Trump administration wants to add to forms for the 2020 census. Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP The Supreme Court justices are hearing oral arguments Tuesday over the citizenship question the Trump administration wants to add to forms for the 2020 census.
Susan Walsh/AP Updated April 25 at 5:28 p.m. ET
The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court appear split along ideological lines on whether a citizenship question can be included on forms for the upcoming 2020 census.
Based on their questions during Tuesday's oral arguments at the high court, the justices appear ready to vote 5-4 to allow the Trump administration to add the hotly contested questions to forms for next year's national head count.
The liberal justices, led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, almost immediately began peppering the Trump administration's attorney, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, with questions after the arguments were underway, criticizing the administration's justification for the question.
""There's no doubt that people will respond less"" to the census if it includes the question, Sotomayor said.
Justice Elena Kagan noted that the record of evidence for the case shows the need for a citizenship question is a ""contrived one.""
The conservative side of the bench, however, pointed to the discretion of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch nodded to the history of the U.S. census, asking questions about citizenship status in the past.
In multiple lawsuits brought by dozens of states, cities and other groups , three federal judges at U.S. district courts have issued rulings blocking the administration's plans for the question . It asks, ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?""
All three judges — in New York, California and Maryland — ruled that Ross' decision to include the question violated procedures for adding new census questions under administrative law. The judges in California and Maryland have also ruled that adding the question is unconstitutional because it hurts the government's ability to carry out the constitutional mandate for a once-a-decade head count of every person living in the U.S.
Unclear motivation behind the question
Population counts from the 2020 census will determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets for the next decade. The data also guide the distribution of an estimated $880 billion a year in federal funding for schools, roads and other public services.
National How The 2020 Census Citizenship Question Ended Up In Court ""This is not benign information,"" says Hermann Habermann, a former deputy director at the Census Bureau. ""People's lives are going to be affected by it.""
The Trump administration has maintained that Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, added the question to collect more detailed citizenship data to enforce part of the Voting Rights Act. The district court judges, however, have all concluded that was not the real reason for the administration's last-minute push for the question.
""We've had the Voting Rights Act for 50 years. For its entire life, this data has not been available, and the Voting Rights Act has been enforced,"" says Andrew Pincus, an attorney representing former Census Bureau directors who have filed a brief in the Supreme Court , referring to citizenship data the Trump administration wants to collect from every U.S. household.
In fact, six of the bureau's former directors, who have served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, have warned that adding the citizenship question would jeopardize the accuracy of the population count.
""The issue isn't whether or not the administration or the United States has a right to know how many citizens are there,"" Habermann says. ""The issue is what's the best way to get that piece of information so that you do not harm the census.""
In the current political climate, Census Bureau research indicates the question is likely to discourage households with noncitizens, including unauthorized immigrants, from taking part in the count. The bureau estimates 6.5 million people will not respond to the 2020 census themselves if a citizenship question is included. That estimate may climb higher after the agency conducts its first field test of the question on a 2020 census form beginning in June.
Still, Ross overruled the unanimous advice of experts at the Census Bureau, who recommended compiling existing government records on citizenship from other federal agencies rather than adding a citizenship question. He later testified repeatedly before Congress that he added the question only because the Justice Department wanted it on the census form.
The litigation uncovered emails from Ross and other Commerce Department officials showing the idea for adding the citizenship question had roots not in the Justice Department, as Ross testified in Congress, but in discussions between Ross, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped lead President Trump's now-defunct voter fraud commission.
The emails also show that despite repeated entreaties, Justice Department officials refused at first to ask for the addition of the question, saying that it was unnecessary.
The limits of Ross' discretion
The Trump administration does have the support of 17 Republican-controlled states, including Oklahoma. That state's solicitor general, Mithun Mansinghani, notes that attorneys at the Justice Department, which is representing the administration, are arguing that the courts do not have the authority to second-guess the commerce secretary's decision about the census.
""The question is, does the secretary have the discretion to weigh the costs and benefits between asking a citizenship question and not asking one? And the department maintains he does have that discretion,"" Mansinghani says.
But Ross' discretion is not unlimited, argues New York State Attorney General Letitia James. Her office represented plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits at the New York district court under her predecessor.
""He has a constitutional and a statutory obligation to pursue an accurate count. And the record is clear, that by including the citizenship question, it would result in an inaccurate count,"" James says.
The administration contends that all it has to show is that Ross made a rational decision. The lower courts found that the decision, in fact, was not rational, but arbitrary.
The path to the Supreme Court
The Supreme Court is reviewing the ruling by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in New York — as well as whether adding the question is constitutional — in an expedited and complicated case.
It appears that Trump administration officials have long been preparing for the case.
""Since this issue will go to the Supreme Court we need to be diligent in preparing the administrative record,"" a Commerce Department official wrote to Ross in an internal email about the citizenship question sent in August 2017, months before the administration's formal request for the question became public.
National What You Need To Know About The 2020 Census The justices decided in February to take on a sped-up review of Furman's ruling after receiving an unusual request from the Trump administration to not wait for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the administration's appeal.
A week before the first courtroom trial was scheduled to begin in November in New York, the administration's attorneys asked the high court to delay the proceedings. The administration wanted the justices to first rule on its separate appeal of Furman's order for Ross to sit for questioning under oath by the plaintiffs' attorneys. The Supreme Court ultimately denied that emergency request , with Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Neil Gorsuch dissenting from the majority vote.
Ross' deposition has been temporarily blocked by the high court. All of the justices are still considering whether to allow it to proceed.
Gorsuch and Thomas have indicated that they are not convinced there was enough evidence of ""bad faith"" to justify allowing the plaintiffs' attorneys to question Ross.
""There's nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction, soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views, disagreeing with staff, or cutting through red tape,"" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion released in October for Thomas and himself.
Furman said he ordered Ross' deposition mainly because he ""found reason to believe that Secretary Ross had provided false explanations of his reasons for, and the genesis of, the citizenship question.""
National Appeal To Census Lawsuit Ruling Adds Uncertainty To Citizenship Question's Fate Looming deadlines
Tuesday's oral arguments lasted around 80 minutes, including time for the general counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives to argue against the question as a friend of the court in support of the lawsuits' plaintiffs.
The Census Bureau says it needs a final ruling on whether to include a citizenship question by June in order for the printing of paper forms for the census to begin this summer as scheduled. But a recent 4th Circuit appeal by plaintiffs in one of the Maryland lawsuits, who are challenging a ruling on a racial discrimination claim , could complicate the timeline.
If Congress provided additional funding, the bureau could extend its June deadline for finalizing census forms to as late as Oct. 31, the bureau's chief scientist testified during the New York trial .
That would, however, put yet more pressure on the head count, which is set to officially begin in January 2020 in remote Alaska before rolling out to the rest of the country by April."

In its place are more droning instruments — sounds more suited for church than the concert hall, including a recurring, small choir. The subject for the album is God and our culture's relationship with God, from deep introspection to the trivial, everyday use of that ever-present expression ""oh my God.""
The origins of his album Oh My God began in 2016 with events at the forefront of American politics, including mass shootings at the Bataclan and Pulse nightclubs, the death of Freddie Gray and, for Kevin Morby, the day-to-day news, including the Presidency of Donald Trump. (Kevin Morby wrote a one-off song in 2016 about the heartbreak of the world called ""Beautiful Strangers,"" and donated proceeds to charity.)
On this edition of All Songs Considered we look at the origin story behind Oh My God, including Nina Simone's cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Suzanne,"" music from Ethiopia and the quirky, groundbreaking New York duo Suicide.

Susan Walsh/AP The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments Tuesday in a legal battle with lasting implications that could dramatically affect political representation and federal funding over the next decade.

toggle caption Mallory Falk/KRWG Sergio, a Guatemalan migrant, recently visited a mobile medical van with his 2-year-old son, Dylan. Sergio thinks his son became sick in a holding facility, where they spent two days.
Mallory Falk/KRWG Dr. Eugene Marciniak recently examined about a dozen patients at a Catholic retreat center in Las Cruces, N.M. He set up shop at a corner table in the cafeteria and called families over one by one: a mother with belly pain, a child with a low-grade fever, a teen girl with a cracked and possibly infected tooth. They had just been released from government custody and were staying at the center for a night or two before joining relatives in other parts of the United States.
""We just check them in; we assess them; we get the history,"" Marciniak, a volunteer, says. ""Our main goal is to make sure that they're not really acutely ill, that they're gonna be able to travel in the next couple days wherever their final destination in the United States is. And to be sure they're not so sick that they would need to be evaluated in an emergency room.""
Similar scenes are playing out across southern New Mexico, where a growing number of shelters and churches are taking in migrant families seeking asylum. Some migrants arrive in need of medical care. Others become sick while they're in government custody. Volunteer medics are stepping in to provide care once those families are released. They do their best with limited resources, sometimes conducting exams in makeshift clinics and paying for medical supplies out of pocket. The New Mexico Department of Health is also sending out a mobile medical van.
Last December, two migrant children died in government custody after being held in New Mexico. Since then, immigration officials have strengthened screenings for minors in custody. But volunteer medics say there's still more need, once they've been released.
""We have private rooms; we have an examination table. I have medications in cupboards and the equipment I need,"" says volunteer physician Dr. John Andazola, who works out of a mobile medical van. ""So what this brings to me is a more safe, clinical experience and more privacy for the patients.""
Andazola has been volunteering since 2014. He says most patients have routine colds or mild dehydration. But without screenings, ""we would miss the really sick kids. If we miss those kids, they're at risk of serious illness. Death.""
National A Surge Of Migrants Strains Border Patrol As El Paso Becomes Latest Hot Spot A Guatemalan migrant named Sergio recently visited the medical van with his 2-year-old son, Dylan. He asked that we not use their last name because of their precarious immigration status. Sergio thinks his son became sick in a holding facility, where they spent two days. It was cold there, he says, and agents took away their blankets. By the time they arrived at a shelter, Dylan had a runny nose and slight fever. Andazola gave him some cold medicine and two grape-flavored rehydration packets.
Volunteer Freida Adams coordinates the doctors and nurses in southern New Mexico. She recently left her job at the state health department to do this volunteer work full time. Adams says the care her team provides families like Sergio and Dylan goes beyond basic medicine.
As soon as these families arrive at a shelter or church, ""we start handing out water, we start handing out snacks,"" she says. ""Because the thing they need the most is a place to sit, to set their babies down. They've been carrying their babies for 2,000 miles, and ... many times they hold that child constantly. So to be able to set your child down and rest your arms is a big thing.""
The federal government isn't paying for these humanitarian services. Volunteers often buy supplies themselves, mostly over-the-counter medications like cold syrup and pain relievers.
The New Mexico Department of Health is chipping in gas and a driver for the mobile medical van, which it's leasing from Santa Fe County. In total, the service costs about $1,000 per month, according to spokesperson David Morgan. He says the department could use many more volunteers.
""I certainly understand how divided we are as a community, as a country, about the subject of immigration,"" Morgan says. ""But at the end of the day, it's important to us to be able to not lose sight of the fact that these are people who need help.""
Morgan says the medical van is one way the state can meet the growing need along this stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border."

toggle caption Mallory Falk/KRWG Sergio, a Guatemalan migrant, recently visited a mobile medical van with his 2-year-old son, Dylan. Sergio thinks his son became sick in a holding facility, where they spent two days.
Mallory Falk/KRWG Dr. Eugene Marciniak recently examined about a dozen patients at a Catholic retreat center in Las Cruces, N.M. He set up shop at a corner table in the cafeteria and called families over one by one: a mother with belly pain, a child with a low-grade fever, a teen girl with a cracked and possibly infected tooth. They had just been released from government custody and were staying at the center for a night or two before joining relatives in other parts of the United States.
""We just check them in; we assess them; we get the history,"" Marciniak, a volunteer, says. ""Our main goal is to make sure that they're not really acutely ill, that they're gonna be able to travel in the next couple days wherever their final destination in the United States is. And to be sure they're not so sick that they would need to be evaluated in an emergency room.""
Similar scenes are playing out across southern New Mexico, where a growing number of shelters and churches are taking in migrant families seeking asylum. Some migrants arrive in need of medical care. Others become sick while they're in government custody. Volunteer medics are stepping in to provide care once those families are released. They do their best with limited resources, sometimes conducting exams in makeshift clinics and paying for medical supplies out of pocket. The New Mexico Department of Health is also sending out a mobile medical van.
Last December, two migrant children died in government custody after being held in New Mexico. Since then, immigration officials have strengthened screenings for minors in custody. But volunteer medics say there's still more need, once they've been released.
""We have private rooms; we have an examination table. I have medications in cupboards and the equipment I need,"" says volunteer physician Dr. John Andazola, who works out of a mobile medical van. ""So what this brings to me is a more safe, clinical experience and more privacy for the patients.""
Andazola has been volunteering since 2014. He says most patients have routine colds or mild dehydration. But without screenings, ""we would miss the really sick kids. If we miss those kids, they're at risk of serious illness. Death.""
National A Surge Of Migrants Strains Border Patrol As El Paso Becomes Latest Hot Spot A Guatemalan migrant named Sergio recently visited the medical van with his 2-year-old son, Dylan. He asked that we not use their last name because of their precarious immigration status. Sergio thinks his son became sick in a holding facility, where they spent two days. It was cold there, he says, and agents took away their blankets. By the time they arrived at a shelter, Dylan had a runny nose and slight fever. Andazola gave him some cold medicine and two grape-flavored rehydration packets.
Volunteer Freida Adams coordinates the doctors and nurses in southern New Mexico. She recently left her job at the state health department to do this volunteer work full time. Adams says the care her team provides families like Sergio and Dylan goes beyond basic medicine.
As soon as these families arrive at a shelter or church, ""we start handing out water, we start handing out snacks,"" she says. ""Because the thing they need the most is a place to sit, to set their babies down. They've been carrying their babies for 2,000 miles, and ... many times they hold that child constantly. So to be able to set your child down and rest your arms is a big thing.""
The federal government isn't paying for these humanitarian services. Volunteers often buy supplies themselves, mostly over-the-counter medications like cold syrup and pain relievers.
The New Mexico Department of Health is chipping in gas and a driver for the mobile medical van, which it's leasing from Santa Fe County. In total, the service costs about $1,000 per month, according to spokesperson David Morgan. He says the department could use many more volunteers.
""I certainly understand how divided we are as a community, as a country, about the subject of immigration,"" Morgan says. ""But at the end of the day, it's important to us to be able to not lose sight of the fact that these are people who need help.""
Morgan says the medical van is one way the state can meet the growing need along this stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border."
"'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' Kurt Cobain's Anti-Anthem For Generation X",www.npr.org,"Danny Goldberg, former Nirvana manager",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/23/714359881/nirvana-kurt-cobain-smells-like-teen-spirit-generation-x-american-anthem?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Kurt Cobain in the studio with Nirvana in late 1991.

toggle caption Michel Linssen/Redferns/Getty Images Kurt Cobain in the studio with Nirvana in late 1991.
Michel Linssen/Redferns/Getty Images There's a grainy video of the first time Nirvana played ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" live, at a small club in Seattle in April 1991. Nirvana was largely unknown outside of punk and indie rock circles in the Pacific Northwest. The band hadn't even recorded the song yet, which meant that nearly everybody in the room was hearing it for the very first time.
Still, the reaction was intense.
""They started playing the new song and people erupted,"" says Jennie Boddy. She was a friend of the band and a publicist for Sub Pop Records, the indie label that put out Nirvana's first record, Bleach . ""We were being slimed on by shirtless guys, just moshing,"" Boddy says. 'My friend Susan started hyperventilating, she thought it was so good: 'I cant, gasp, believe what they just played!' It was just instantaneous; it was crazy.""
YouTube Within months, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" would make Nirvana famous around the world. The song forged an instant connection with Generation X — the generation sandwiched between baby boomers and millennials — which was deeply skeptical about the music and culture of its parents.
An anthem, in other words, for a generation that didn't want one.
""I just remember feeling as though it was this inescapable presence in my life,"" says Hua Hsu, a staff writer at The New Yorker . He was a 14-year-old in suburban Northern California when he first heard the song in September 1991.
The album Nevermind had just come out on a major label. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was all over the radio. The music video , featuring cheerleaders with the anarchy symbol scrawled on their black uniforms, was in heavy rotation on MTV. Nine months after playing the song live for the first time, Nirvana was performing it on Saturday Night Live .
""Like millions of kids my age, this is the first thing that felt like it was mine,"" Hsu says. ""As a teenager, I think you're really trying to figure out your place in the world. This song in particular felt so ambivalent about its own success.""
Lyrics like ""I found it hard, it was hard to find / Oh well, whatever, never mind"" cut to the heart of Gen X, a group that includes this reporter. We were too jaded for a feel-good, sing-along anthem.
That was the genius of the song: It combined a fierce commentary on shallowness while still having a mass-appeal musicality.
Danny Goldberg, former Nirvana manager
"" 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' is an unusual anthem because it refuses the role of the anthem,"" says NPR Music critic Ann Powers. ""It's perfect for the generation it represented because this was a cohort that was so ambivalent about any traditional values [or] conventional success.""
There's that word again: ambivalence. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was famously ambivalent about the band's success. Boddy, now vice president of publicity at Capitol Records, says you can see that in the handmade T-shirt Cobain wore for the band's 1992 cover shoot with Rolling Stone magazine, which read "" Corporate Magazines Still Suck .""
""People often will say, 'Well, they ushered in the new generation,' "" Boddy says. ""But what are you supposed to say? 'A mosquito, my libido.' That's the spokesperson.""
Cobain often warned interviewers against reading too much into his lyrics.
""I was just using pieces of poetry and just garbage — you know, just stuff that just would spew out of me at the time,"" he told the Canadian TV channel MuchMusic in 1993. ""A lot of times when I write lyrics, it's just at the last second because I'm really lazy. And then I find myself having to come up with explanations for it.""
Danny Goldberg, Nirvana's former manager and author of the memoir Serving the Servant: Remembering Kurt Cobain, isn't convinced. ""I don't believe that at all,"" he says. ""I think he worked as carefully on the lyrics as he did on everything else.""
Goldberg says the chorus of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" pulls off a tricky balancing act: mocking the culture of mainstream arena rock, while at the same time celebrating the joys of listening to your favorite underground band in a dimly lit club.
American Anthem A Thousand People In The Street: 'For What It's Worth' Captured Youth In Revolt American Anthem The Legacy Of 'Adam's Song,' An Anthem To Darkness, Loss — And Recovery "" 'With the lights out, it's less dangerous / Here we are now, entertain us.' It was rock and roll, and kind of an ironic commentary on rock and roll, at the same time,"" Goldberg says. ""That was the genius of the song: It combined a fierce commentary on shallowness while still having a mass-appeal musicality.""
Cobain's struggle with his own demons — including heroin addiction — ended in April 1994, 25 years ago this month, when he took his own life at age 27. By the end of Nirvana's time together, Nevermind had sold millions of copies — but the band had dropped ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" from its live shows.
Cobain openly worried that the band was attracting the kind of fans he would have hated in high school. He championed feminism and gay rights, and he put this request in the liner notes for the album Incesticide: ""If any of you in any way hate homosexuals, people of different color, or women, please do this one favor for us — leave us the f*** alone! Don't come to our shows and don't buy our records.""
""Kurt Cobain was always questioning his authority, questioning his masculinity,"" Powers says. She adds that that may be one reason why ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" still resonates — especially with teenagers.
""That experience, of warring impulses and of ambivalence, is the adolescent experience,"" she says. ""It's exactly what teenagers go through when they are trying to come into their own authority and power, but they're also questioning everything around them and questioning their own self-worth. Kurt Cobain captured that adolescent feeling better than anybody of his generation.""

Prosecutors are continuing to investigate the site and its founder, Julian Assange, who faces a conspiracy charge for an unrelated hack.
The man who may end up prosecuting that case has a long backstory at the Justice Department. Zachary Terwilliger started there as an intern during high school in 1999. Now, he is the U.S. attorney in the backyard of the intelligence community.

Justice Department via AP Veterans of the office in Alexandria, Va., remember that Terwilliger used to mop the floors and stack boxes in this office of 140 federal prosecutors.
""For me, this really is home,"" Terwilliger said.
He grew up around law enforcement. His father was deputy attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush. FBI agents attended his family barbecues. But Terwilliger said it was watching the trial of two gang members who stabbed a witness and left her to die on a riverbank that sealed his own fate.
National Security What Does Julian Assange's Arrest Mean For WikiLeaks And U.S. Elections? ""It was watching what the law could do to achieve justice for that victim, and frankly watching two people in court as assistant United States attorneys who just blew me away,"" he said. ""And I just thought, 'If I'm going to work this hard to study the law and become a lawyer, that's where I want to put my efforts.' ""
He did. Terwilliger went on to prosecute gang members himself. At the start of the Trump administration, he moved over to Justice Department headquarters. He expected to be busy. Then the president fired the FBI director. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — Terwilliger's boss — appointed a special counsel.
Terwilliger spent a lot of nights on his office couch.
""Those were 18-to-20-hour days,"" he said. ""And I had worked like that in lead-up to trials, but never in a sustained period. And you just learn to operate at a different level.""
National Security How Much Did WikiLeaks Damage U.S. National Security? National Security 12 Years Of Disruption: A WikiLeaks Timeline Terwilliger's current and former colleagues said he embodies a quality that is sometimes unusual in the Washington area: sincerity.
""First and foremost in my mind about Zach is, he's genuine,"" said Alice Fisher, who tried to hire Terwilliger when she ran the Justice Department's criminal division in the George W. Bush years.
""He really cares about his colleagues as well — not only the mission, but who the people are and how their work environment is and about the things that really matter, not only in the work environment but the personal environment,"" Fisher said.
Analysis Highlights From The Mueller Report, Annotated Eventually, Virginia's two Democratic senators recommended Terwilliger to serve as U.S. attorney there. In August 2018, he was sworn in to the historic post.
The top federal prosecutor's office in Alexandria dates to 1789. The first U.S. attorney there was John Marshall, who went on to become chief justice of the United States.
Neil MacBride was the chief prosecutor in the place he calls E.D.V.A. in the Obama years.
""E.D.V.A. has had a front-row seat in everything from Cold War espionage cases to post-9/11 terrorism cases to some of the biggest financial fraud and extraterritorial cases from threats around the world,"" MacBride said.
Politics Mueller Report Raises New Questions About Russia's Hacking Targets In 2016 But the case getting the most attention these days involves Assange. About two weeks ago, American prosecutors finally unsealed their case against him. He faces a single charge: conspiracy to commit computer hacking.
On Monday, a federal appeals court turned back a bid by former Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning to be released from federal custody while she fights a subpoena in the case. Manning has refused to testify before a grand jury, despite a grant of immunity from prosecutors. Manning delivered sensitive diplomatic cables and war logs to WikiLeaks.
But authorities are continuing to investigate and could bring more charges in the next month or so. Experts say those new charges could cover the disclosure of secret CIA hacking tools or the 2016 election.
National Security See How Much Of The Mueller Report Is Redacted In a recent interview, Terwilliger didn't want to get into the specifics.
""The Justice Department and Lady Justice herself are patient, so we'll watch this process play out, but I for one am happy that it's starting,"" he said.
Terwilliger's office has also picked up other offshoots from the special counsel investigation of Russian election interference. He has indicted an accountant for the Internet Research Agency, the Russian troll farm accused of attacking the 2016 race .

That case is set for trial later this year.
As for what's next for Terwilliger, he said he can't imagine a better job than the one he has now.
""This is a dream come true for me,"" he said of an idea that started in high school, when he was mopping the floors of the office he now runs."

Mueller Report Could Impact Trump's Business Empire Down The Road : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/23/716258099/mueller-report-could-impact-trumps-business-empire-down-the-road,"The report left behind tantalizing clues. The Trump Inc. team, a joint reporting project from member station WNYC and ProPublica, highlight some of the items that may have been overlooked.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So there were all the headlines from special counsel Robert Mueller's report, right? No conspiracy with Russia. President Trump not exonerated.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
But buried inside the report were some oddities, like a $30,000 jar of caviar.
GREENE: That's right, caviar. It's one thing the team at ""Trump, Inc."" caught. That's the podcast from WNYC and ProPublica. They've been looking at the impact this report could have on the president's business empire. And we're joined by Ilya Marritz from ""Trump, Inc."" Hi, Ilya.
ILYA MARRITZ: Good morning.
GREENE: So a lot to chew on in this report. You guys are really looking at the business angles and Trump's businesses. What exactly caught your attention?
MARRITZ: Yeah. Well, when Robert Mueller got started, there was a lot of speculation that he was going to look at Donald Trump's tax returns or maybe his loans from Deutsche Bank. In the end, the thing that Robert Mueller has the most to say about involving The Trump Organization is this project called Trump Tower Moscow. Donald Trump wanted for many years to build a big tower in Moscow. And during the campaign, actually starting as early as 2015, his people, particularly Michael Cohen, were very involved in an effort to find a site, find a partner and begin building.
What's fascinating in Robert Mueller's narrative is the way the campaign takes off at the same time that this effort to build a Trump Tower Moscow is also taking off. In addition, we see for the first time - you know, a lot of the details here had been reported other places, but Mueller brings it together in a narrative that makes sense. And we learned for the first time that there was quite a bit of outreach from highly placed Russians to The Trump Organization saying we can offer help.
GREENE: But the president has always maintained like he was still allowed to do business. This was another business project. I mean - but so many questions here because of the country where it was happening, Russia. Like, did Mueller make ties in a way that makes something seem like it shouldn't have been happening, illegal or just sort of circumstantial stuff?
MARRITZ: I'd say there's just a lot of questionable stuff. For example, when Michael Cohen was looking into traveling to Russia, he would need an invitation actually to get there. Also he was talking with a sanctioned Russian bank - actually with a bank whose - one of whose major shareholders had been expelled from the United States. He was guilty of felonies here. So again and again, we see very irregular and unusual activity and not only irregular and unusual but also concealed from the American people. You'll remember in one of the debates, Donald Trump said he had no business in Russia. We now know that that was definitely not true, that Trump Tower Moscow was not canceled until after the election and after Donald Trump had won.
GREENE: Yeah, and the timing - I mean, it was going on longer than they were suggesting. What about the caviar?
MARRITZ: Yes, the caviar. So Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had a message exchange with a Russian Ukrainian named Konstantin Kilimnik during the 2016 campaign. It included the phrase black caviar. It actually referred to the guy who gave Manafort the caviar. We now know the answer to that mystery of what seemed like a very coded message. It turns out it was the former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, someone Manafort worked for for a long time. I think what this incident really does is it just underlines the ways in which Manafort kept up his ties in the former Soviet Union while also working for Donald Trump for free - a lot of questions.
GREENE: A lot of questions, and you're trying to answer them for us. Ilya Marritz from the podcast ""Trump, Inc.,"" thanks so much.
MARRITZ: You're very welcome.

She's out with a film: Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story , about life after the controversy.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Comedian Kathy Griffin posted a photo of herself holding up a Donald Trump mask made to look like a severed head. That was May 2017. And since then, she's been blacklisted. But now, Kathy Griffin is trying a comeback. NPR's Sam Sanders has the story.
SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: The thing that almost killed Kathy Griffin's career, it actually happened during some downtime.
KATHY GRIFFIN: In between, like, gigs, I will just do a million crazy things to try to make you laugh. And on that day - no joke - I had done a photo shoot. We had no paperwork. There was no publicist, like...
SANDERS: Where were the photos supposed to go?
GRIFFIN: Anywhere. Like, I - when we had done the photo shoot before...
SANDERS: You just post them online, or what?
GRIFFIN: ...He just put them online.
SANDERS: Oh.
GRIFFIN: And...
SANDERS: Griffin says the whole shoot took 20 minutes or so. And it was pretty nonsensical, except for one photo.
GRIFFIN: I did say, I want to do some kind of a picture to shame Trump.
SANDERS: Griffin said she was mad at Trump for what he said about Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News host, after she grilled him in a presidential debate in 2015.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her - wherever. But...
SANDERS: So Griffin wanted a photo of a bloody Trump.
GRIFFIN: No joke, like, I sent a friend of mine out to, like, a party store or, like, a Halloween store or something. And I said, just bring back anything, like, America/Trump-y (ph).
SANDERS: In the picture, Griffin holds up a Trump mask covered in ketchup. She put it online, and then...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Kathy Griffin fired by CNN over that photo of her holding a bloody Trump head.
SANDERS: Kathy Griffin lost work immediately. Federal officials threatened to charge her with conspiracy to assassinate the president.
GRIFFIN: I couldn't fly for two months.
SANDERS: OK.
GRIFFIN: I mean...
SANDERS: At all.
GRIFFIN: The no-fly list, like a terrorist.
SANDERS: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Griffin says when she was taken off the no-fly list...
GRIFFIN: I was detained at every single airport. And that is something I want people to know. People have a myth - they think, oh, they can't take your phone and SIM card. Oh, they can, and they did at LAX, at London Heathrow.
SANDERS: And LAX is bad enough.
GRIFFIN: Right?
SANDERS: Jesse David Fox is a senior editor at vulture.com. He also hosts the comedy podcast called ""Good One."" Fox says Griffin's story shows how hard it is right now to make good jokes about President Trump. And yet...
JESSE DAVID FOX: Comedians feel about joking about Trump like a couple who the love is faded feel about having intercourse on their anniversary, where, like, no one wants to do it, but everyone feels like they have to go through the motions. Like...
SANDERS: (Laughter).
FOX: But the ability to just do the job, to show up and say the president is bad, is very important as a stabilizing factor of our society, to be reminded that we are allowed to do that.
SANDERS: And Kathy Griffin sees that as her role.
GRIFFIN: In my opinion, it is within my lane. So when people first came out - stay in your lane, tell your jokes - I'm like, hold on. Learn your comedy history. There are many, many comedians, you know, that at some point will do something that is half-statement, half-joke.
SANDERS: Griffin recently finished a comedy special. It's called ""A Hell of a Story."" In it, she talks all about the fallout from the photo, what it's like to be neighbors with the Kardashians and how she's coming back.
GRIFFIN: I'm going to have to do this one myself. Like, nobody's got a shovel for me and is going to help me dig my way out of it. I'm keeping the faith. I'm being positive. I'm a little bitter, but hopefully funny first.
SANDERS: But it's only funny if you can hear the jokes. Right now, Griffin's new comedy special is on ice. So far, she can't find a distributor.
Sam Sanders, NPR News.

GREENE: And you can hear Sam's full interview with Kathy Griffin, including the story of her dinner party with Kris Jenner.
GRIFFIN: She's, like, cutting a steak. And God love her, she's cold as ice. And I do think she's killed people. Now, I can't prove it. But would you cross her?
GREENE: You can hear it on the podcast It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders.

Today we take you to a holy place in northern india; it's where, nearly 30 years ago, Hindu activists tore down a historic mosque. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from Ayodhya.
SYED IKHLAQ LATIFI: (Foreign language spoken).
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Syed Ikhlaq Latifi (ph) is 80 years old, with a bushy white beard, but he's still able to scramble upstairs to his roof to describe what he watched from here in horror back in 1992.
LATIFI: (Through interpreter) A mob broke through barricades around the 16th-century Babri mosque, just over there. They climbed on top of the domes and tombs. They were carrying hammers and these three-pronged spears from Hindu scripture. They started hacking at the building; by night, it was destroyed, and then they set fire to nearby Muslim homes.
FRAYER: Latifi watched as flames lit up the night sky, and then he fled for his life.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Foreign language spoken).
FRAYER: Footage from that day shows the mob rampaging through Muslim homes and businesses. Riots spread across India and neighboring countries. Thousands were killed, including Tayab-un-Nisa's (ph) husband. Now in her 70s, she sits with her granddaughters...
UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Hello.
FRAYER: ...Paging through photo albums.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken).
FRAYER: That's a picture of her husband.
Her father-in-law had been the imam of the famous Babri Masjid - Babri mosque. It was built nearly 500 years ago, under India's then-Muslim rulers, the Mughals. Her husband was from a prominent Ayodhya family. But the mosque is now gone, and her husband was bludgeoned to death right next to her front gate.
TAYAB-UN-NISA: (Foreign language spoken).
FRAYER: ""I've wept a lifetime of tears,"" she says.
TAYAB-UN-NISA: (Foreign language spoken).
FRAYER: Hindu activists from all over India came to Ayodhya that day to correct what they perceived as a historical injustice - the building of a mosque more than four centuries earlier and the cropping up of a Muslim community around it in a spot sacred to Hindus, the place where they believe one of their gods, Lord Ram, was born. It would be the equivalent, faithful say, of a mosque on the exact spot in Bethlehem where Jesus is said to have been born or a church on top of the Prophet Muhammad's birthplace in Mecca.
SHRIRAJ NAIR: Even bigger than that; even more significant than that, we believe, yeah. I felt very proud when the mosque was demolished.
FRAYER: Shriraj Nair (ph) is a suburban dad in Mumbai. Back then, he was 19 years old and passionate about his Hindu faith. He was and still is active in the RSS, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - it's one of the Hindu volunteer groups whose members wielded hammers at the Babri mosque that day. Nair couldn't go - he had a family commitment - but he watched on TV as his comrades travelled to Ayodhya from all over India.
NAIR: People travelled. It was a huge, huge mob. The Hindus came on their own, and they fought for demolishing the mosque. And from that time onward, the word Hindutva, or the feeling of being Hindu, came in everybody's mind. It was a big success.
FRAYER: It was a milestone for that word he just used - Hindutva; it means Hindu pride. Some call it Hindu nationalism. It was then that India began to shed the secularism that had defined it since independence from Britain. It's when Hindu priorities gained prominence in Indian politics. For Hindu voters who cared deeply about Lord Ram's legendary birthplace, step one was destroying the Babri mosque. Step two is building a Hindu temple in its place, and that's what Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has promised to do if reelected. Party chief Amit Shah at a rally in January.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
AMIT SHAH: (Through interpreter) Our party wants a temple to Lord Ram built on that same spot, as soon as possible; no doubt about it.
FRAYER: The 1992 killings in Ayodhya were a horrible bout of sectarian violence. But to many of India's majority Hindus, they were also a new beginning - of removing remnants of a Muslim civilisation and restoring a Hindu one. Now nearly 30 years later, Modi's party is making those sentiments a priority, in a way that no other government has ever done before.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken).
FRAYER: Demonstrations have erupted across India, calling for the immediate construction of a temple in Ayodhya. But this is sensitive; it could spark more clashes. Modi initially promised construction would begin in his first term - it hasn't happened. India's Supreme Court now controls the property and is hearing petitions on what can be built. Some on the far right accuse Modi of dragging his feet. The temple, which doesn't yet exist, nevertheless already has a chief priest in waiting.
SATENDRA DAS: (Singing in a foreign language).
FRAYER: Satendra Das (ph) is also 80 years old, with a long white beard. He wears a bright saffron orange Hindu robe, and unlike Syed Ikhlaq Latifi, who watched the destruction of the Babri mosque from his roof, Das charged into the melee that day.
DAS: (Foreign language spoken).
FRAYER: He explains how, decades earlier, Hindus had managed to place a small Lord Ram statue inside the Babri mosque. Das was its caretaker, so he was allowed to enter the building. And when the mob attacked in 1992, Das ran in to grab that idol and, afterward, placed it atop the mosque's ruins, where it still sits today.
UNIDENTIFIED POLICE: (Foreign language spoken).
FRAYER: Hundreds of police now patrol the heart of Ayodhya. I had to pass through a maze of wire cages and metal detectors, surrender my passport, get patted down by female guards, just to get within view of the Babri mosque's ruins - and there's nothing left. This is probably India's most incendiary spot. In the old city of Ayodhya, where three Islamic domes once towered for more than 450 years, there's a small blue tarp draped over stilts, and under it, that idol of the Hindu god Lord Ram. With me in line are thousands of Hindus, pilgrims from all over India. Many of them are barefoot. One woman is weeping.
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in a foreign language).
FRAYER: ""Long live Lord Ram,"" they chant and shuffle past. There are so many of them, and they are determined to be heard, both here and at the polls in this Indian election. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, Ayodhya, India.

Sri Lanka Orders State Of Emergency After Bombings Killed Hundreds,www.npr.org,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/23/716258085/sri-lanka-orders-state-of-emergency-after-bombings-killed-hundreds,"Rachel Martin talks to Jeffrey Gettleman of The New York Times and Alaina Teplitz, U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, about the explosions in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday that killed hundreds.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Sri Lankan officials may have discovered a motive for the Easter Sunday bombings - retribution. The Sri Lankan state defense minister told Parliament that the bombings were carried out in retaliation for the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand. He says that two domestic Islamist groups are believed to be responsible. The bombings targeted several hotels and churches. More than 300 people have now died, and the country is currently in a state of emergency.
The Islamic State has claimed credit for the attacks, though they've done the same for attacks around the world with little proof. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan prime minister says his government is monitoring its citizens who may have connections to the Islamic State. The New York Times' Jeffrey Gettleman has been reporting on this and is on the line with us from Colombo.
Jeffrey, thanks for being here. What more can you tell us about this revelation that the Easter bombings were in retaliation for the attacks in Christchurch?
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Well, everybody here is struggling to figure out how this happened because the small, home-grown Islamist group that has been held responsible has never done anything on this scale. And there's a real mystery of how they've had the capacity to pull off six extremely large and devastating simultaneous suicide attacks across this island. And the government's foreign intelligence agencies, people who study Islamic movements around the world, just are shrugging their shoulders because this came totally out of the blue. And the country remains deep in shock about what happened on Sunday.
MARTIN: I mean, the main group, the first group, that they held accountable was this Islamist militant group - little-known group called National Thowheeth Jama’ath. They have since not named but said that there was a second group involved. Can you just talk about the public perception of this particular group? I mean, I say it's little-known. But was it on the radar of government officials?
GETTLEMAN: Not really. Indian intelligence agents had been following a couple of these groups but just in the last month or so. And they've sent a very alarming and detailed memo that explained to the Sri Lankans that there was a possibility of massive suicide attacks at churches. Nothing was done about that. And people are very frustrated and furious that the government got this detailed intelligence information and didn't act on it. And it included names, addresses, phone numbers, lots of information about the people who supposedly did these attacks.
MARTIN: The death toll in these attacks is enormous. As we said, at least 320 people killed. I imagine you've talked with the families of those victims. Are the memorial services taking place yet?
GETTLEMAN: Yeah, it was really sad today because this one neighborhood outside of Colombo is like a giant mourning ground. There are dozens of houses, one after the other, with these white flags fluttering out front. And there's posters of people who were killed from old man to couples who died together to little children. And all throughout the day, there's been these processions to the graveyard, one after another, of people crying after these coffins. And there's holes being dug in the ground. And there's so many that bulldozers are moving back and forth, clearing more space. And it's just this sense of shock and confusion and grief that something like this could happen.
MARTIN: Right.
GETTLEMAN: And it's striking people who were celebrating the holiday when this was the last thing on their mind. It's been very haunting for anybody connected to it.
MARTIN: Right. Jeffrey Gettleman with The New York Times in Colombo, reporting; thank you so much.
GETTLEMAN: Sure.
MARTIN: We turn now to Alaina Teplitz. She's U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives. She joins us from the U.S. Embassy in Colombo.
Ambassador, thank you so much for being with us.
ALAINA TEPLITZ: Yeah. Good morning, Rachel.
MARTIN: We just heard from Jeffrey Gettleman that two Islamist groups have now been identified as being responsible for these attacks. What more can you tell us about the revelations by the Sri Lankan government?
TEPLITZ: Yeah. I can't speculate on who was really responsible for the attacks. I think we can just look at how devastating they were and the need to focus on the investigation, making sure that we positively identify the perpetrators if possible, bring collaborators and others to justice and look at the healing that this nation and many others are going to need to undertake in the wake of these tragic events.
MARTIN: Have you seen or been shown any evidence that would suggest that these attacks were retaliation for the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand?
TEPLITZ: We're looking, you know, at all sorts of information. And the investigation is really ongoing. I don't want to speculate where that's going to lead us. And I think, you know, we're in early days now. There's a lot of information coming at everybody from all sides.
MARTIN: I understand it is early days. But there are reports the FBI is now assisting with the investigation in Sri Lanka. Can you confirm that?
TEPLITZ: That's right. We're working to support the government of Sri Lanka's investigation. We've brought all the resources we can to bear on it, including the FBI.
MARTIN: And that's because Americans were killed in these attacks. I understand you visited a hospital and talked with victims and their families. What can you tell us about those conversations?
TEPLITZ: Yes. We have talked with some of the victims, some of the family members. And, of course, it's just heartbreaking that people were worshipping peacefully at Sunday services, that they were having an early Sunday morning breakfast. And this is the fate that befell them. These people are innocent. And I think, at this point, the government of Sri Lanka has declared a national day of mourning. And that's part of what we do need to focus on at this point - is making sure that we recognize the victims and support those who were injured, support the families that survived.
MARTIN: This comes after a decade of peace in Sri Lanka after a long and violent civil war. What do these attacks portend for the country, do you think?
TEPLITZ: That's right. This is a country that's engaged in reconciliation. I hope, as a result of everybody's efforts, that people can be resilient and look at the fact that these acts were not the acts of a whole community but of certain individuals. And we're certainly encouraging the government's efforts to pursue and continue to pursue reconciliation.
MARTIN: U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Alaina Teplitz, thank you so much for your time.
TEPLITZ: Thank you.

2020 Election Revives Debate: Should Religious Faith Guide One's Voting?,www.npr.org,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/23/716258078/2020-election-revives-the-question-should-religious-faith-guide-one-s-voting,"Enlarge this image This year, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is making the same argument Republicans have for years: that a vote based on Christian values would turn the country around.

toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP This year, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is making the same argument Republicans have for years: that a vote based on Christian values would turn the country around.
Charlie Neibergall/AP For most of the last 40 years, the notion that one's Christian beliefs should guide one's voting has largely been promoted by conservative Republicans.
Two Republican presidential candidates from that period — Pat Robertson and Mike Huckabee — are former Southern Baptist preachers and one, Ted Cruz, is the son of a conservative evangelical pastor. All three on repeated occasions tied the Christian vote to the Republican cause.
""If Christians will simply show up and vote our values,"" Cruz told the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2015, ""we'll turn this country around.""
This year, a Democratic presidential candidate, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., is making the same argument, with a twist: A vote based on Christian values, Buttigieg suggests, would indeed turn the country around, but in a ""progressive"" direction.
Buttigieg says protecting the poor and welcoming immigrants is a Christian obligation that is inconsistent with Republican priorities.
""It has a very clear set of moral and policy implications, none of which are things I would associate with the right wing,"" Buttigieg said in an interview last week with the Now This website. ""Christianity to me is about humility, it's about love, and if we want to put those values into political practice, at least by my lights, they lead us in a very progressive direction.""
The Christian faith has been tied to liberal politics before. It happens regularly at places like Riverside Church in New York City, famous for its promotion of progressive causes. Pastor Amy Butler used her Easter Sunday sermon to lament U.S. immigration policy, misogyny, police violence and environmental neglect.
""We need a new way to see the world, and we need it fast,"" Butler said. ""Thank goodness Easter is here.""
Butler believes it is appropriate to tie a message of Christ's resurrection to what people encounter each day in the news. ""[With] the constant barrage of indignities coming from the White House,"" she said, ""I don't think you can talk about resurrection and second chances without addressing some of those things.""
It's uncommon, however, for Democratic presidential candidates to draw such connections. The Republican Party is more often associated with the religious right than Democrats are with an analogous movement on the left.
Buttigieg's suggestion that liberals be willing to say that ""Christian faith is going to point you in a progressive direction,"" as he told USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers, provoked some outrage on the right. One conservative academic argued that Buttigieg "" doesn't get to make up his own Christianity ,"" and another conservative dismissed Buttigieg's comments as "" partisan nonsense .""
Such objections would presumably apply as well to Republican politicians who have not hesitated to interpret Christianity as supportive of their agenda.
Peter Wehner, a speechwriter for then-President George W. Bush, is among those who have raised concerns about Buttigieg's connection of Christianity and progressivism, writing in The Atlantic that such claims ""ought to worry Christians regardless of their politics.""
Civility Wars Pastoring A Purple Church: 'I Absolutely Bite My Tongue Sometimes' Wehner said he has the same objection to conservatives associated with the religious right.
""They've crossed the line time and time again,"" Wehner told NPR. ""They've issued Christian score cards, and they've said implicitly or explicitly that if someone is a faithful Christian, they're going to believe certain things on a whole range of public policy issues. And I don't think that's a responsible position to take.""
Such an approach, Wehner says, reduces the Bible to a ""governing blueprint.""
""Christianity as a faith stands in judgment of all political ideologies and all political parties,"" Wehner says, ""so to try and say that the Christian faith will lead you only to a set of liberal or conservative policies, or only the Republican or Democratic Party, I think is wrong.""
In times of uncertainty about how to act in the modern world, Christians sometimes wonder, ""What would Jesus do?""
""It's an important question to ask,"" says Pastor Duke Kwon, a popular minister at Grace Meridian Hill church in Washington, D.C. ""Jesus is the truest example of love and justice we've ever had in human history.""
""That question can be problematic at times, though,"" Kwon adds,"" because at times we don't know exactly what Jesus would have done in X, Y, Z case study or circumstance. So we end up speculating, and that can get Christians into trouble.""
""I think there is a problem when we try too quickly to say that our view of this or that matter of public policy is the only legitimate Christian view,"" Kwon says. ""I think one of the hallmarks of Christian discourse in the public square ought to be humility, respect, patience, self-control. [Those are] virtues that are informed by the Gospel of Christ, and all too often that's the opposite of what you hear from Christians when speaking out on policy issues.""
If politicians on the left start claiming that Christian beliefs support their agenda, however, it could at least balance those on the right who have made that argument before, and it could encourage voters to consider more carefully what implications their faith may have for their political preferences.
""There is such a thing as a Christian ethic,"" says Wehner, now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. ""We're required to pursue justice, to care for the weak and the powerless, to promote human dignity and human flourishing.""
On that, Kwon agrees. ""I believe that the Gospel of Jesus Christ does inform politics,"" he says. ""It has vast implications for all of life."""
Sports Bettor Smashes 'Jeopardy!' Records,www.npr.org,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/23/716258061/sports-bettor-smashes-jeopardy-records,"James Holzhauer, a Las Vegas professional sports bettor, has breezily won the last 13 games in a row. He also is drawing attention for his unique strategy and big bets.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So Rachel, are you a ""Jeopardy!"" fan?
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Indeed, but really only when the category is about either ""Star Trek: Next Generation"" or '80s glam rock songs.
GREENE: Very specific areas of expertise.
MARTIN: Sweet spots.
GREENE: Yeah. All right. Well, I used to play with my nana (ph), and she would beat me every time when we were watching in her apartment. But I don't think even she could have taken down James Holzhauer.
MARTIN: Right. So he is the professional sports bettor from Vegas who is on a hot streak. Alex Trebek asked some other contestants, how does it feel to come into a buzzsaw?
GREENE: Right, because he's won 13 games and made almost a million dollars already. On the list of single-day winning records, he holds the top six slots.
NEAL POLLACK: Well, I mean, it's the most extraordinary quiz show performance I've ever seen. You know, what this guy is doing blows everything away. It's unbelievable.
MARTIN: That's Neal Pollack talking about what makes this guy so good. Pollack is a writer who won on ""Jeopardy!"" in 2013.
GREENE: And he says, No. 1, you have to know, like, everything. And No. 2, what sets Holzhauer apart is his willingness to go big, like, bet his whole bankroll even when he's way ahead.
POLLACK: And that just boggles the mind. I mean, it's the right way to play. It's the absolute correct game theory strategy. But it's just - it's amazing that someone's finally had the guts to do it.
MARTIN: And No. 3, Pollack says, athleticism - you need a quick thumb to buzz in.
POLLACK: I think he's 34 years old. You know, I was 43 when I played. And I just - I didn't have the reaction time. I wasn't able to accumulate the cash necessary to make bets like that.
GREENE: So there's a guy named Ken Jennings. He actually holds the ""Jeopardy!"" record for longest winning streak, though his average winnings were way less than Holzhauer.
MARTIN: Jennings tweeted, I don't feel I get enough credit for making small, sensible ""Jeopardy!"" wagers, which helped the show with its prize budget.
