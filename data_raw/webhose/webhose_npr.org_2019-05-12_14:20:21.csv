Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf On Trump And 'Sanctuary Cities',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997016/oakland-mayor-libby-schaaf-on-trump-and-sanctuary-cities?station=KXJZ_FM,"President Trump said he is considering sending detained immigrants in the country illegally to ""sanctuary cities."" Scott Simon gets reaction from Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, a ""sanctuary city.""
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Could detained migrants be moved into places that call themselves sanctuary cities? President Trump says he's strongly considering the idea, placing apprehended migrants in cities that have declared themselves sanctuaries. That is cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. President Trump said in a tweet, the radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy, so this should make them very happy. Libby Schaaf is the mayor of Oakland, Calif., a sanctuary city. Mayor Schaaf, thanks so much for being with us.
LIBBY SCHAAF: Oh, thanks for having me.
SIMON: Do you welcome this chance for Oakland to welcome migrants?
SCHAAF: Listen. Oakland is a city that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. We are proud of the immigrant community that we have right now. And it's our job to not build walls but build bridges and welcome all people and celebrate the richness that diverse cultures bring to our city. We also know that immigrants actually make a safer city, despite the lies and the divisive rhetoric that this president continues to drive to separate the American people. We know that data proves that undocumented or documented immigrants commit far fewer crimes. So not only is our community richer and more loving. But it also is safer because we are a sanctuary city and a diverse city.
SIMON: But let me hone this down to the point that's at issue now. If sometime, let's say, in the middle of next week, a number of buses arrive in Oakland with 5,000 migrants, do you say, welcome to Oakland?
SCHAAF: I always say, welcome to Oakland. But this is much less about immigration or sanctuary. This is about an outrageous abuse of power. The idea that you could use human beings, families as instruments of political payback to use public resources to exact retribution on your political enemies. This is not America. It is not democratic. And this is what should outrage all Americans, regardless of their stance on immigration or sanctuary cities.
SIMON: I've gotten two very complete answers from you to essentially the question, would you welcome more migrants? I haven't heard a yes.
SCHAAF: I said yes. Oakland welcomes all people.
SIMON: So specifically in this case, if more migrants show up, that's fine with you?
SCHAAF: My job as a mayor is to welcome people. I don't build walls. It's our job to welcome everyone into our city, ensure their safety, ensure that their families can thrive. And that is my job no matter where those people came from or how they got there.
SIMON: Do you think the president is testing the sincerity of liberal Democrats?
SCHAAF: I think the president is trying to whip up his base. He's trying to continue to drive lies, racist lies about immigrants. And he's trying to distract from the fact that his cutting of aid to countries that now have conditions that force families to flee and seek political asylum in our country - the fact that he's not addressing some of the pressing problems that are within America and tries to distract the public with this hate-mongering - that is the biggest problem.
SIMON: Would, let's say, a thousand more immigrants greatly tax the resources of Oakland?
SCHAAF: Oakland is growing very quickly. And we welcome families. We welcome people that seek to make better lives for their families, that are willing to work hard and become wonderful members of our community.
SIMON: Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, thanks so much for being with us.
SCHAAF: Thank you.

Army Reservist On Transgender Military Ban,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996981/army-reservist-on-transgender-military-ban?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Scott Simon talks to Elliot Sommer, a graduate student in the Army Reserves, about the Trump administration's policy barring transgender personnel from serving in the military.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
The Trump administration's policy barring transgender people from serving openly in the military went into effect yesterday. The policy has forced transgender soldiers and other personnel to either try to conceal their identity and keep quiet or file paperwork to get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before Friday. If a service member did not get that diagnosis and is openly transgender, they will be discharged. Elliot Sommer is a graduate student in the U.S. Army Reserves and has been waiting for that diagnosis for months, yesterday finally discovered what's next for him. And he joins us now.
Mr. Sommer, thanks for being with us.
ELLIOT SOMMER: Well, thank you for having me.
SIMON: And will you still be able to serve?
SOMMER: Yes, the Army Reserve surgeon had signed my paperwork, and I will be able to continue serving.
SIMON: What's it been like for you waiting?
SOMMER: Incredibly stressful. We are coming down to a pretty tight timeline to try to get everything done. But it's been tough, especially with everything being out of my hands.
SIMON: When you say getting everything done, help us understand what that entails.
SOMMER: So as a reservist, I had to submit a packet of paperwork that included a plan for my transition and a diagnosis from a civilian medical provider of gender dysphoria through my chain of command. And it had to travel up through different levels of command to the reserve surgeon. And she had to approve that diagnosis that was made by a civilian provider.
SIMON: Now, the administration has said that this policy does not ban transgender people from serving because they can still serve, just in the sex in which they were born. I wonder how you answer that.
SOMMER: Transition is a medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria. And not every transgender person experiences dysphoria. But barring those from medically necessary treatment based on a medical condition - that's where the ban is.
SIMON: You're transitioning from woman to man. And I understand treatment doesn't begin until December. Is that correct?
SOMMER: So my transition has already begun. Hormone replacement therapy has begun by civilian provider. And the military is aware. However, the treatment plan that I had submitted includes other things, such as potential surgeries - and this is for every service member. They have to submit a treatment plan. Once that treatment plan is completed, there's a timeline in that treatment plan of when your gender marker will change in the eyes of the Department of Defense. So the plan that I had submitted would result in a gender marker change of female to male in December of this year.
SIMON: Forgive me for not knowing, but how will you mark it? How will you present yourself differently?
SOMMER: So currently, to the military, I am female, which means that I have to follow all regulations - physical presentation and housing and bathroom and every female regulation that is on the books. And then in December, once that changes from female to male, I will then be required to fall under all of the appearance, physical fitness, bathroom, housing, all of the male regulations for that.
SIMON: Are these going to be tough months ahead for you, feeling and identifying as one way but having to live as a woman?
SOMMER: I think that I have it better than some others that have to live as someone that they're not full time. Being a reservist on the civilian side, I live as male full time. And everybody at my unit that I have come out to has been absolutely wonderful. So I'm hoping that in these next few months, as things progress and paperwork gets approved further and we get closer to that December change, I'm hoping that it becomes easier and easier.
SIMON: Why did you enlist, Mr. Sommer?
SOMMER: My grandfather was an infantryman in World War II. And growing up hearing his stories made me want to be a part of something bigger than myself. My other grandfather was a Marine during Korea. And I want to be involved in researching PTSD to help people that have been affected by PTSD from a variety of traumatic incidences, especially combat.
SIMON: So even after all these trials, you want to serve your country in the military.
SOMMER: Absolutely.
SIMON: Elliot Sommer, a graduate student in the U.S. Army Reserves, thank you so much.
SOMMER: Thank you.

"Under Employers' Gaze, Gen Z Is Biting Its Tongue On Social Media",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/702555175/under-employers-gaze-gen-z-is-biting-its-tongue-on-social-media?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Only about 1 in 10 teenagers say they share personal, religious or political beliefs on social media, according to a recent survey from Pew Research Center.

toggle caption Karly Domb Sadof/AP Only about 1 in 10 teenagers say they share personal, religious or political beliefs on social media, according to a recent survey from Pew Research Center.
Karly Domb Sadof/AP Malak Silmi was taking her first real journalism class last January when her professor said something that changed her life: Watch what you post on social media because it might just come back to bite you.
Silmi's Twitter account at the time was one she'd had since she was 14. It was a public profile with her content ranging from memes and status updates to opinions on foreign policy. But she decided something had to change if she wanted to be taken seriously as a journalist. So, she deactivated it.
""I understand the need to censor oneself, but sometimes I don't think it's fair,"" said the 19-year-old. ""Even liking on Twitter is hard because people can see what you like — it pops up on their timeline even if they're not looking through your account.""
Silmi and many of her peers say they worry about being unable to express any opinions on social media out of fear of self-sabotaging a potential career opportunity. The oldest members of Generation Z are around 22 years old — now entering the workforce and adjusting their social media accordingly. They are holding back from posting political opinions and personal information in favor of posting about professional accomplishments.
In fact, only about 1 in 10 teenagers say they share personal, religious or political beliefs on social media, according to a recent survey from Pew Research Center.
Employers are watching — and asking job seekers to walk a careful line between sharing the wrong kind of information and staying away from social media altogether. These days, 70 percent of employers and recruiters say they check social media during the hiring process, according to a survey conducted by CareerBuilder, a company that connects employers and candidates. More than half of employers said they have not hired a candidate because of content they found on social media, but a similar number said if they can't find an applicant online, they are less likely to call that person in for an interview.
Technology Facebook Promises To Stop Asking You To Wish Happy Birthday To Your Friend Who Died Civility Wars Keeping It Civil: How To Talk Politics Without Letting Things Turn Ugly ""Hiring is always kind of a judgment call,"" says Michelle Armer, the chief people officer at CareerBuilder. ""Employers are eager to find more information that will support the decision that they're making.""
Silmi realized the only way to beat those employers was not to leave social media completely, but to join their game.
From the ashes of her old account that detailed her youth, a new one arose: This account was public, too, but it depicted a professional persona that was lacking in the other account. She uses this new account to share credible news articles and the latest updates on her journalism career — with a few sports tweets scattered in between.
Super excited to announce that I’ll be a part of this year’s class with the @nyt_institute ! #NYTSJI

— Malak Silmi (@MalakSilmi) April 6, 2019 Silmi's generation grew up with social media. Generation Z, nicknamed ""iGen,"" is the post-millennial generation responsible for 'killing' Facebook and for the rise of TikTok .
Twitter went live in 2006, and Snapchat in 2011, when the older members of Gen Z were only 14. A lifetime of exposure, some experts say, actually makes them the most prepared generation for this kind of social media surveillance.
""In a sense, [Gen Zers] are actually in better positions than millennials who embrace a much more rigid social network, like Facebook,"" said Taylor Lorenz, an Internet culture reporter at The Atlantic . ""Because [Gen Z] has grown up with a lot of these platforms, they are cognizant of their image from the time that they're getting on social media.""
In fact, Lorenz notes, some children start thinking of their online presence in the third grade . Because of this awareness, they're very careful of curating their online branding. According to Colby Zintl, the vice president of external affairs for Common Sense Media, this opens up a need to teach youth about social media.
""We teach people to drive, how to have safe sex, and how to eat well: the Internet is just another one of those things that need to come with some instructions,"" said Zintl. Curricula like Common Sense Education's digital citizenship program are working to educate the younger generation on how to use social media, something the older generations were never taught.
Because of this extra education and hands-on learning, teenagers are often more savvy of these social platforms than the employers that are searching through them — it's just a matter of making social media work for them, rather than against them.
Some users are regularly cleaning up — ""re-curating"" — their online profiles. That can mean changing the people they follow and the things they post, or deleting old posts that no longer reflect a personal brand. Cleanup apps, like TweetDelete , exist to help during this process.
""There's an expectation right now that you have control over your own feed, because you do,"" said Lorenz. ""So you need to be constantly re-curating them.""
Gen Zers also use social media in more ephemeral ways than older generations — Snapchat stories that disappear after 24 hours, or Instagram posts that they archive a couple of months later.
Where Facebook is usually tied directly to a user's real name and identity, the personas on the platforms Gen Zers use, like Twitter and Instagram, can be altered and controlled. Gen Zers already use a multitude of strategies to make sure their online presence is visible only to who they want: They set their account to private, change their profile name or handle, even make completely separate"

Tom Brenner/Getty Images The New York Post is facing a barrage of criticism after its cover on Thursday featured an image of the World Trade Center, burning in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, below a terse quote by one of the first Muslim women serving in Congress.
""Rep. Ilhan Omar: 9/11 was 'Some people did something,' "" the cover read . A caption underneath added, ""Here's your something ... 2,977 people dead by terrorism.""
The quote came from a speech Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., gave last month. She was speaking at a banquet hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, discussing how terrorism has led to a rise in Islamophobia.
National Minnesota Congresswoman Ignites Debate On Israel And Anti-Semitism ""Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,"" she told the crowd. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" (The Sept. 11 attacks occurred in 2001. CAIR was was founded in 1994.)
Days after the banquet, critics zeroed in on her description of the terrorist attacks, inciting outrage that bore resemblance to the condemnation she received after making remarks about Israel .
On Fox & Friends , co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers, ""You have to wonder if [Omar] is an American first.""
""This woman is a disgrace,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted .

— Harry Siegel (@harrysiegel) April 11, 2019 Rep. Dan Crenshaw , R-Texas, a former Navy SEAL who lost an eye in a bombing in Afghanistan, said it was ""unbelievable."" ""You described an act of terrorism on American soil that killed thousands of innocent lives as 'some people did something.' It's still unbelievable,"" he later wrote on Twitter .
Rep. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., and assistant speaker in the House, told MSNBC , ""Those statements were not only hurtful to me, but extremely hurtful to everyone that was personally impacted by those terrorist attacks.""
But the Post 's incendiary cover, released at a time when owner Rupert Murdoch and Fox have come under intense scrutiny , has made it the target of a different strain of anger.
""Their intention was to be inflammatory, to generate sales at the expense of dividing our country,"" Hassan Shibly, head of CAIR's Florida chapter, tells NPR.
""Far too many people have tried to blame, even retaliate, against Muslim communities when we are victims of that attack just like all Americans,"" Shibly says.
Omar continues to receive death threats, he says. ""Obviously the first hijab-wearing, American Muslim woman [in Congress] is going to be the first target,"" he says. ""People's deep-seated hatred for the Muslim community is now being projected onto her.""
Joseph Azam, one of Murdoch's former top executives, described the newspaper cover as ""the virulent anti-Muslim bigotry being put out by various parts of the Murdoch empire."" Azam recently told NPR he left his post because he was sickened by the coverage of Muslims, race and immigration in Murdoch's outlets. ""They are going to get ppl killed - is that the goal?"" Azam tweeted Thursday.
House colleagues came to Omar's aid. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted, ""The NY Post knows exactly what it's doing - taking quotes out of context and evoking painful imagery to spread hate and endangering the life of Rep. Omar. Shame on them, and shame on Rupert Murdoch.""
Media Former Murdoch Executive Says He Quit Over Fox's Anti-Muslim Rhetoric Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,‏ D-N.Y., called the cover ""horrifying"" and ""hateful,"" before adding that Omar co-sponsored the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. She told reporters that the wrath against Omar was ""not a normal level of political debate or rhetoric.""
The New York Post did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.
On Friday, Omar herself quoted words uttered in the wake of Sept. 11 by former President George W. Bush, adding, ""Was Bush downplaying the terrorist attack?""
The newspaper cover wasn't the first time Omar was linked to the Sept. 11 attacks. A poster at a winter event sponsored by the Republican Party of West Virginia showed a photo of the congresswoman, wearing a hijab, beneath a photo of the twin towers engulfed by flames.
National Sign Falsely Linking Muslim Congresswoman To Sept. 11 Sparks Outrage In West Virginia A group called ACT for America, which had set up a table near that poster, describes itself as a national security organization and is labeled as an anti-Muslim hate group, promoted the Post cover on Twitter. It called Omar's rhetoric ""dangerous.""
According to a 2018 Pew Research Center estimate , Muslims made up about 3.45 million people in the United States in 2017, slightly more than 1 percent of the total population."
"Former 'Ebony' Publisher Declares Bankruptcy, And An Era Ends : Code Switch : NPR",www.npr.org,Karen Grigsbates,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/04/13/712437648/former-ebony-publisher-declares-bankruptcy-and-an-era-ends,"Enlarge this image Founder of Ebony magazine and Johnson Publishing Company John H. Johnson. Almost 15 years after the company was handed down to his daughter, JPC is filing for bankruptcy. Bettmann/Getty Images Bettmann/Getty Images Founder of Ebony magazine and Johnson Publishing Company John H. Johnson. Almost 15 years after the company was handed down to his daughter, JPC is filing for bankruptcy.
Bettmann/Getty Images Ebony magazine was more than a publication — to black America, it was a public trust. It held a place of prominence in millions of African-American households whose members did not otherwise see themselves in the mainstream media. So back in 2015, when Johnson Publishing Company announced it was spinning off its flagship magazine, Ebony , and also its news magazine sibling, Jet , people knew something was up.
""They were just waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" the late Ken Smikle, a longtime observer of the Johnson Publishing Company's evolution, told NPR's Michel Martin.
Smikle founded Target Market News, a Chicago-based service that tracks black consumer power and patterns for the business market. He felt JPC was in for a rough ride. This week, the other shoe finally dropped: JPC announced it was filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. The company says it's selling the remainder of its assets, a comprehensive archive of photos from some of black America's most pivotal 20th Century moments , and a beloved cosmetics line that, toward the end, accounted for more than 40 percent of JPC's bottom line.
How did it get to this? Ebony has been around for so many decades, it saw the terminology for its target audience change from ""Colored"" to ""Negro"" to ""Black"" to ""African-American."" People thumbed through its glossy pages for stories of black success and achievement. Founder John H. Johnson used to say his magazines ""gave readers the feeling that there were black people in other cities and in other countries like themselves who were doing well,"" he told NPR in a 2002 interview. ""It inspired them to do better.""
So there were doctors and lawyers, entertainers and sportsmen, pastors and politicians — including ones from black countries. Ebony covered Ivorian president Félix Houphouët-Boigny's state visit to the White House in 1962, and put his glamorous new wife on the cover next to Jacqueline Kennedy. Mme. Houphouët-Boigny shone. Black America swooned. It was a high point.
Changing times ... and the Internet
But times had begun to change. The civil rights movement gave way to the Black Power movement. The old assimilationist aesthetic became challenged by the new Afrocentric aesthetic. People's reading habits changed. By the time the Internet became a thing, it was only a matter of time before online ads began to siphon dollars away from the ones magazines had been commanding. Subscriptions of Johnson publications started to dwindle. (Eventually Jet , the magazine that shocked America with the gruesome lynching photos of Emmett Till, went digital in 2014 to cut costs.)
John H. Johnson died in 2005, and by prearrangement, the reins passed to daughter Linda Johnson Rice. Although she was literally raised by John and wife Eunice in the JPC offices, and was familiar with the magazine's business and editorial practices, Rice was unprepared — as were many other publishers — for the rapid shifts in the publishing industry, the downsizing and mergers. And perhaps most of all, the loss of those critical advertising dollars to the dreaded Internet. In 2010, Rice sold the iconic JPC Tower on tony Michigan Avenue (designed by a black man, built for a black man, as locals proudly pointed out), to Columbia College, and moved the staff to smaller quarters. In 2016 she sold Ebony , Ebony.com and Jet.com to Clear View Ventures, a Texas-based, black-owned private equity firm that promised to "" position the enterprise for long-term growth . Our team,"" promised Clear View CEO Michael Gibson, ""has a true understanding of the Ebony brand as well as its legacy.""
Clear View had a less-than-clear understanding of the need to pay its freelance writers, who, because of the staff cuts and downsizing before the magazine's sale, had become Ebony 's lifeblood. After several entreaties, then demands for payment, a group of contributors went public with its complaint and sued for payment. Clear View settled before going to court , but not before an embarrassingly effective social media campaign made the new owners national news.
Not a good start.
Soon after, despite its intention to keep most of the staff, many were let go. The magazines remain in Clear View's hands.
Selling the remains
It isn't just the magazine people will miss. John Johnson's wife, Eunice, created a traveling fashion show that drew tens of thousands of mostly black women for decades. Ebony Fashion Fair established a theme each year, and featured black models who strutted down the runways in clothes by Yves Saint Laurent, Bill Blass and up-and-coming black designers like Stephen Burroughs and Patrick Kelly. Money from the popular show went to black nonprofit organizations. Fashion Fair Cosmetics, the first high-end cosmetics line for women of color to be sold in department stores, was born when Eunice Johnson noticed her models mixing their own makeup shades before they walked the runway. She consulted with chemists to develop luxury makeup in deeper tones, and by 1973, had them introduced in department stores — not drug stores. Fashion Fair had sold fantastically well when white cosmetics companies were only selling foundations and powder that went the gamut from pale to paler. Then, some people began to realize there was a great, untapped market out there, and it had a brown face.
By the 1990s, former makeup artist Bobbi Brown introduced her own line of foundations that included deeper shades for women of color . And there was more competition: Canadian company MAC brought a line to U.S. stores that also became quickly popular with women of color for its rich palette. Fashion Fair no longer had the field all to itself. Then mega cosmetics chains like Sephora and Ulta arrived, marketing both in ubiquitous brick and mortar stores and ... yes, the Internet. There were problems with distribution. And not much was put into social media campaigns.
Fashion Fair faltered. Its original pink compacts and lipstick tubes looked ... dowdy. The line was refreshed and reintroduced in sleek bronze packaging to great enthusiasm several years ago, but either there wasn't enough product being made or it wasn't being distributed widely. (Explanations vary.) The end result was bare shelves, much to the consternation of worried customers and beauty bloggers. Some stores gave up — they couldn't afford to hold a space for product they weren't sure was coming.
Makeup artist Lashelle Farrington made what amounts to a video obituary for Fashion Fair . As she makes up her face and explains which Fashion Fair products she's using and shows how to apply them, Farrington muses about the increasing difficulty of finding the product over the past year. ""I know that at the counter in my city, the person that works at the counter doesn't even know when they're going to get items in stock,"" she sighs.
JPC's move this week to file Chapter 7 is the final chapter in its storied history. If the tendered offer for the company's remaining assets is accepted, Fashion Fair and JPC's vast photo archive will be bought. And with that sale, whenever it occurs, the last vestiges of a vision that John H. Johnson made a reality for 77 years will come to an end."

(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Illegal entry into Canada for seven people. He now faces 21 criminal charges, which could come with a hefty jail sentence. The owner says he's going to stay calm and really hopes police don't find out about his other business, the every cake contains a nail file to help you break out of prison bakery.

SAGAL: Bill, how did Alonzo do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Well, he raced to the lead with five right.
FARSAD: Wow.
KURTIS: 10 more points - total of 13.
SAGAL: Very well done.
FARSAD: Did so much better than Maeve.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: How many, then...
FARSAD: Noticing that.
SAGAL: ...Does Negin need to win?

FARSAD: Yeah.
SAGAL: Here we go, Negin.

HIGGINS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: I'm going to give it to you.
FARSAD: They don't eat elephants.

(APPLAUSE)
FARSAD: (Laughter).
SAGAL: According to the police report, the officer volunteered to role play the part of a drunk driver for a Breathalyzer demonstration and proceeded to blow above the legal limit.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That means he was either drinking on the job or just really that good an actor.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He is currently being investigated on charges of being really, really, really dedicated to his job.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, I think Negin did well enough to win. Did she not?

Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
T J: Hey. This is T.J. (ph) calling in from Waterbury, Vt.
SAGAL: Hey. Waterbury is a great place. What do you do there?
T J: I groom ski trails for Sugar Bush terrain parks.
SAGAL: You're - so you're a ski guy. That's cool.
T J: I'm a snowboarder. But yeah, we're up there every night just laying down corduroy for the people.

ALONZO BODDEN: I just want to ask - you live in Vermont. If you had a million dollars...

T J: Oh, man. I'd probably buy 400,000 snowboards.
SAGAL: Yeah, I was about to say.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: All right.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Why wouldn't you just get one really big one, though?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, T.J., welcome to the show. Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three news-related limericks with the last word or phrase missing from each. If you can fill in that last word or phrase correctly in two of the limericks, you'll be a winner. You ready to play?
T J: Yeah. Let's do it.
SAGAL: All right. Here is your first limerick.
BILL KURTIS: My pet is a bit of a brat. I'm the servant in his habitat. Those who own a sweet dog all live high on the hog. I feel lousy 'cause I have a...
T J: Cat.
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Dog owners are happier than cat owners.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It turns out it's been proven with a new survey showing how dog owners self-identify as very happy, whereas cat owners identify as very ow, why did it bite me again?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The survey found dog owners are happier than those with cats. The survey also found - and this is true - that people with cats are less happy than people who have no pets at all.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that cats make you unhappy. It may just be that cat owners are miserable losers for entirely different reasons.
(LAUGHTER)
NEGIN FARSAD: Can I just say #NotAllCats? Because...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I grew up with a really great cat that was basically like a dog. And now I have a dog, and there were like this - I can't even tell them apart. So just...
BODDEN: It's funny how cat people always say that.
SAGAL: Yeah, they always do.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: No, no. My cat is different. No, it's not.
SAGAL: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: No, it's a cat.
SAGAL: Yeah. Here is your next limerick.
KURTIS: For podcasts, we've got an idea. A Swedish voice sleep panacea. Now HEMNES and MALM will help you stay calm. Our podcast reads names from...
T J: IKEA.
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Very good.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Do you need a new sleep aid? Is our show no longer doing it for you? Ikea is launching a podcast made to help people go to sleep...
FARSAD: Oh, my god.
SAGAL: ...That's what it's for - in which two Swedish men read the names of products...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...From the IKEA catalog, which is a great idea. It's much better than their original idea of reading from the illustrated assembly manual.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Because, like, I don't know, a man with a hammer is sad, and the corner of his table hurts. I...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The podcast is advertised as a great way to help people fall asleep. And if you listen to a clip, you can hear why.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: BJORKSNAS - chest of five drawers. PUDERVIVA - queen quilt cover set.

KURTIS: On airplanes, the sound can be crushing when vacuum-sucked water is rushing. Since kids can be scared to use bathrooms mid-air, we have softened the noise of our...
T J: Flushing.
SAGAL: Flushing, right.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Physicists are working to improve airplane travel but not by making sure your plane doesn't crash. No, they're trying to make sure the toilet isn't too loud. People have been complaining for years about the deafening roar of the airplane toilet flush, saying it terrifies children and masks the other bathroom sounds they do want to hear.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Apparently, designing a quieter mechanism that can function at high altitudes has been a challenge. But engineers have found a way to cut the noise of the flush by 16 decibels - you just put your fingers in your ears...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Brace your elbows. Unfortunately, they haven't found a way to reduce the sound of the guy in the seat next to you who can't hear himself farting because his headphones are on.

From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. We're playing this week with Maeve Higgins, Alonzo Bodden and Negin Farsad. And here again is your host from Trinity University's Laurie Auditorium in San Antonio, Peter Sagal.

Right now, panel, it is time for a game that we call...
BILL KURTIS: The 2020 dump.
SAGAL: With millions of Americans signing up each day to run for president as a Democrat...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...News about all the candidates is coming in hard and fast. So we're going to ask you about some of them rapid-fire style. Get your question right, you get a point, true or false. Ready to go? Maeve, true or false - at a campaign event in Iowa, Beto O'Rourke got asked for his autograph while in the bathroom.
MAEVE HIGGINS: I would say that's true, actually.
SAGAL: No, it was false. What happened was Beto started talking to this stranger in the bathroom who then asked him, hey, are you here to see Beto O'Rourke?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I was imagining that he kind of, like, off - you know, he seems to be very over-familiar. Like, and he gets up on countertops and stuff.
SAGAL: Yes.
HIGGINS: So I was imagining him at a u-rye-nal (ph) kind of stretching across to offer and...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I'm sorry, excuse me.
HIGGINS: ...To offer a shake.
ALONZO BODDEN: Yes, she did say...
SAGAL: At a what?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: U-rye-nal.
BODDEN: Beautiful.
NEGIN FARSAD: It's wrong.
BODDEN: You - no, that is the new way it's pronounced.
SAGAL: Yes. Oh, u-rye-nal.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: You know, the thing that men stand in front of.
SAGAL: Oh, I know what you're talking about. I've just never heard it...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Described that way. Is that what they call them in Ireland - a u-rye-nal?
HIGGINS: Yeah. Honestly, I've never used one. But...
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I know that they've got cakes in them, and I'm always so jealous.
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Negin, true or false. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his husband Chasten were immortalized in a butter sculpture.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
FARSAD: That feels true.
SAGAL: No, it's false. It was a diorama made of Marshmallow Peeps.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Alonzo, true or false. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, who's considering a run, tweeted out a picture of himself as a crab standing on the head of an alligator representing Donald Trump.
BODDEN: Oh, absolutely true.
SAGAL: Absolutely true. We have no idea what it means, but that's what he did.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Negin, true or false. Candidate Andrew Yang made empowering firefighters part of his official platform.
FARSAD: True.
SAGAL: No, false. He made empowering mixed martial arts fighters part of his official platform.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And, of course, as for the Republican candidate in 2020, Alonzo, true or false - on a visit to George Washington's residence, Mount Vernon, President Trump said, I'm here to honor the legacy of President Vernon?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: I'm going to go with true on that one also.
SAGAL: No. It's false. What he really said was, quote, ""if Washington was smart, he would have put his name on it. You got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's it for our 2020 dump, even though six more people declared while we were playing the game.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Right now, panel, some more questions for you from the week's news. Maeve, a woman in Taiwan suffering from what she thought was an eye infection learned of this week it was actually what?
HIGGINS: Oh, she was just obsessed.
SAGAL: No.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: She had been working at - does anybody know? This made a lot of news this week. People were, like...
FARSAD: Bumblebees in her...
SAGAL: Yes.
FARSAD: ...Eyeballs?
SAGAL: She had bees living in her eyes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
HIGGINS: Oh, there was a lot of buzz around this story.
SAGAL: There was, yeah. And the bees were feeding on her tears.
(GROANING)
SAGAL: No, we'll skip the gross parts - which means we will never speak of this again.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: No, these bees had gotten in there while she was gardening. And she started having some eye pain, as will happen, you know, when your eye has bees in them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: She went to the doctor, and she got her first clue that there might be something seriously wrong when he approached her wearing a head-to-toe white suit and holding one of those smokers.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I thought he was, like, holding a piece of toast and, like, with butter...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...And, like, making breakfast.
BODDEN: But how small were these bees?
SAGAL: These were tiny, little bees.
BODDEN: I didn't know bees...
FARSAD: Yeah.
BODDEN: ...Came in...
HIGGINS: Like humming-bees.
BODDEN: ...Eye-size.
SAGAL: Apparently...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: They're small enough to fit in there, and she couldn't see them until they looked.
BODDEN: That's one more thing to worry about.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.

DEVIN O'DONNELL: Hi. This is Devin O'Donnell (ph) from Salt Lake City, Utah.
SAGAL: Salt Lake City is a beautiful place. What do you do there, Devin?
O'DONNELL: So I work at a warehouse during the day, go to cosmetology school at night. And I also work as a drag performer here in the city.
SAGAL: Oh. What - can I ask what your...
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: I have a number of questions.

SAGAL: That's true.

SAGAL: Well, Devin, it's nice to have you with us. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. What is the topic, Bill?
KURTIS: America, will you go to prom with me?
SAGAL: It's prom season. And that means two things - one, photos your children will regret forever and two, new prom trends. Our panelists are going to tell you about what's new at prom this year. Pick the one who's telling the truth, you'll win our prize - the WAIT WAITer of your choice on your voicemail. You ready to play?
O'DONNELL: Absolutely.
SAGAL: All right. Let's hear first, then, from Negin Farsad.
FARSAD: The 1990s hip-hop duo Kris Kross made an unlikely resurgence at Boise, Idaho's Centennial High School. You might remember them from that one hit jump, jump. The Daddy Mac'll make you jump...
MAEVE HIGGINS: (Laughter).
FARSAD: ...Jump. Kris Kross will make you...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...Jump, jump. The Daddy Mac'll make you jump, jump.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I'm sure it was a huge hit with NPR audiences. Anyway...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...You may also remember the curious fact that they wore their pants backwards. The kids at Centennial High could not get enough of Kris Kross and started dressing backwards on campus. While there were a few awkward adjustments at the boys urinal, school administrators viewed the whole thing as a passing throwback fad. But the trend continued to grow. And the senior class decided to make the theme of prom backward. So they renamed it morp (ph), which is prom backwards...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...For those of you who lack backward-speaking facility. Not only did the students decide to dress backwards - long dress trains flowing forward on girls and corsages pinned on boys' backs - but they made everything backward. Morp night started with the after party, where students got exceedingly drunk and made mistakes they would soon regret for the rest of their lives.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: As they danced through the night, they turned their moonwalks forward and their flossing upward. Their twerking had more chest and less booty. And their Gangnam style looked like a horse was riding them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The backwards prom.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Where everything is backwards, including the progression of events in Boise. Your next promposal will come from Alonzo Bodden.
ALONZO BODDEN: Is your prom really chaperoned when the chaperone is Charlie Sheen?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: You might have to figure that out, especially as the trend of celebrity prom chaperones is spreading and also because Mr. Sheen is looking for work.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: TMZ reporter Selena Jones (ph) says it started at Calabasas High School in Southern California. Now, Calabasas is well known as the home of the Kardashian family. One parent called in a favor from her friend Kris Jenner. And the next thing you know, Khloe Kardashian is at the prom, checking kids for alcohol. Not to be outdone, ICM super agent Ian Arougheti has a friend whose daughter is at Beverly Hills High School of the Arts. So now their prom will be monitored by Idris Elba.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
BODDEN: Interestingly, there may be more mom volunteers than actual students at that.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: News travels fast and even faster on Snapchat. LA kids bragging got Nashville kids jealous. So their parents got into the act. And now country stars Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire will be at the Nashville High School senior prom, making sure the kids don't do anything that they'll have to later write country songs about.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Not to be outdone, New York started rumors of Jay-Z at a Brooklyn high school. But these were unfounded. So Brooklyn Tech will have to settle for Chris Rock.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: All of this led to the nightmare scenario possibly coming true. Charlie Sheen, through his lawyers, asked if chaperoning the LA performing arts high school prom would count as part of his community service.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: TMZ is waiting for the judge's decision.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Celebrity chaperones is the new trend.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Your last story of what's new under the sea comes from Maeve Higgins.
HIGGINS: This year's big prom trend is inspired by a texting fail. Teens across the country texted their dates to check what kind of corsage they wanted, only to find that their phones autocorrected the word corsage to croissant.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Croissant. Seems like a rose by any other name is a pastry. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, a Dallas bakery, is now selling the croissant corsage after the quirky autocorrect mistake blew up on social media. So instead of wearing delicate carnations and pretty lilies, youngsters are getting their prom dates' corsages made from actual croissants. It's a lovely way to make memory and a grease stain that will last forever.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Surely, this is just a first in a long line of carbohydrate accoutrements from - why is there so many French words?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Surely, this is a first in a long line of carbohydrate accessories from bagel buttonholes, cupcake cufflinks and, of course, a cumber sticky bun.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: It's all part of a lovely trend of having some fun and providing gluten-intolerant people with yet another activity they can't participate in.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Which of these...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Is a real prom theme or trend this year? Was it from Negin, the backwards prom or morp, in which everything happens backwards; from Alonzo, celebrity chaperones, a famous person standing there at the door for you or from Maeve Higgins, kids wearing croissants instead of corsages because of an autocorrect failure? Which of these is the real story of a prom trend?
O'DONNELL: Well, I think I'm going to go with the croissant corsage.
SAGAL: You're going to go with the croissant crosage (ph). I can't even say it - the croissant - croissant corsage.
HIGGINS: Croissant corsage.
SAGAL: All right. Well, to bring you the correct answer, we spoke to someone playing a role in the real story.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN FELTON: They would be asking a prom dates what kind of corsage they wanted. And autocorrect on their phone would change that text to croissant.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: That was John Felton from Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, which is making croissant corsages for this year's promgoers. Congratulations, Devin. You got it right.
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
O'DONNELL: Yeah. Thank you.
SAGAL: You earned a point for Maeve for her...
HIGGINS: Thanks, Devin.
SAGAL: ...Pronunciation of croissant.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: And you've won our prize, the voice of your choice on your voicemail. Thank you so much for playing with us.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Panelists, now some questions about the rest of the week's news for you. Alonzo, a tourist getting a ride in a fighter jet in France got the full experience when the pilot accidentally did what?
ALONZO BODDEN: Ejected him.
SAGAL: Yes, that's what happened...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
NEGIN FARSAD: What?
SAGAL: ...You know, the whole thing with the canopy blowing off and the seat rocketing into the air. Don't worry. He parachuted safely to the runway below. French authorities say he's fine. Or wait - French authorities actually said, quote, ""his health is not a cause for concern.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Weirdly, that's exactly what the same guy who rented the island had to say.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The 64-year-old man was riding along in a French Air Force fighter jet, which isn't supposed to eject passengers just because it feels like it. It's not a nightclub. It's a fighter jet.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Most likely - nobody knows exactly what happened, but most likely, the passenger came close to fulfill his lifelong dream of having his last words be, what does this button do?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Peter, as someone who used to work on fighter planes, I think that's exactly what happened. I think he saw that red lever and said, I wonder what this does?
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODDEN: And then he found out.
SAGAL: Maybe this fires the guns...
BODDEN: (Laughter).
SAGAL: ...Or something cool.
BODDEN: But that is the ultimate - I mean, you know, it's great to get a ride in a fighter jet, but it has to kind of be cooler to even be ejected from a fighter jet.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I know.
BODDEN: Imagine being at a party, and some guy's bragging that, yeah, man, I was riding in a fighter jet. Oh, you were only riding in one?
SAGAL: Oh, yeah.

Who's Bill This Time,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713004434/whos-bill-this-time,"Bill Kurtis reads three quotes from the week's news: ""Cabinet Cleaning,"" ""Who Doesn't Want To Be A Millionaire?"" and ""Star Power.""
BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. Remember the Bill-amo (ph).
(CHEERING)
KURTIS: I'm Bill Kurtis. And here is your host from Trinity University's Laurie Auditorium in San Antonio, Peter Sagal.
(CHEERING)
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, Bill. Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. We are so happy to finally be able to do our show here in San Antonio. And we made it just in time - right before the federal government forces the city to change its name to Saint Anthony, Texas.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Senator Cruz will be allowed to keep his name, but he has to start spelling it like Tom does.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Later on, we're going to be talking to a Texan who reported on just about every major story of the post-war era. Mr. Dan Rather himself will be with us.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: But first, you want to hear a live report from your house, give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAIT-WAIT - that's 1-888-924-8924. Now let's welcome our first listener contestant.
Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
MEGAN DOHERTY: Hi Peter. This is Megan Doherty (ph) from Oberlin, Ohio.
SAGAL: Oberlin, Ohio, Megan, is home, of course, of Oberlin University.
(APPLAUSE)
DOHERTY: Oberlin College.
SAGAL: Oh, excuse me - Oberlin College. Do you have any affiliation with Oberlin College?
DOHERTY: I am a campus rabbi.
SAGAL: Oh, you are. So you work at the Hillel.
DOHERTY: I am.
SAGAL: Yeah.
DOHERTY: I do.
SAGAL: Yeah. And how...
DOHERTY: I do.
SAGAL: And how do you find that work?
DOHERTY: It's really fun.
SAGAL: The characters on Lena Dunham's show ""Girls"" were all Oberlin graduates. Was that true to life in terms of what they're like?
DOHERTY: I have never seen ""Girls.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Given your job, I wouldn't recommend it.
(LAUGHTER)
DOHERTY: Thank you.
SAGAL: Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First, the comedian and host of the podcast ""Fake The Nation."" It's just been nominated for a Webby Award for news and politics. It's Negin Farsad.
(CHEERING)
DOHERTY: Hello.
SAGAL: Next, a comedian you can see in Philadelphia at the Helium Comedy Club on April 18 through the 20, Alonzo Bodden.
ALONZO BODDEN: Hello.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: And finally, a comedian whose new book ""Maeve In America"" is out now. It's Maeve Higgins.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Hi.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: Megan, welcome to the show. You're going to play Who's Bill This Time. Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three quotations from this week's news. If you can correctly identify or explain two of them, you'll win our prize - any voice from our show you might choose on your voicemail. You ready to play?
DOHERTY: Yep.
SAGAL: Here we go. Here's your first quote.
KURTIS: From Congress, I would ask for wall. We need wall.
SAGAL: That was a quote from a woman who got fired last week - and despite doing her best to get wall for the president.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Who is it?
DOHERTY: Kirstjen unpronounceable last name...
SAGAL: Yes.
DOHERTY: ...Nielsen.
SAGAL: Kirstjen unpronounceable last name...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...Nielsen, actually.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: You can pronounce it. You just can't spell it. The now former secretary of homeland security is the latest victim of the president's cabinet separation policy.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: It's an everyone-must-go sale at the White House. The president...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Also got rid of the guy who was supposed to head up ICE, the acting director. He's out. He wanted someone who was, quote, ""tougher."" And he fired the head of the Secret Service right while the guy was diving in front of him, yelling, no.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So now we have an acting secretary of defense, an acting homeland security secretary, an acting chief of staff and an acting head of the Secret Service. There are more actors in the president's cabinet...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Than there are in the wait staff of a Los Angeles restaurant.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You know what would be even better, though? An overacting secretary of defense.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You realize, of course, this means war.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: My favorite thing about Kirstjen Nielsen being the homeland security director, being anti-immigrant and everything else, is she spells Kirstjen with a J...
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODDEN: ...In the middle. Like, that's not American.
SAGAL: No, not at all.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Where you get that J from? What?
SAGAL: It's tough because, you know, you leave the Trump administration. You get fired. It's terrible. Your reputation is ruined. People yell at you wherever you go. And you know what the Trump administration's idea of COBRA benefits is to tie you into a sack with a cobra.
(LAUGHTER)
NEGIN FARSAD: But the thing about having all these acting secretaries...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Is that they're basically like temps. They're like substitute teachers.
SAGAL: Right.
FARSAD: Which means that our government is just a bunch of people doing whoopie cushion jokes and throwing spit wads at acting cabinet members. Like, it's chaos.
SAGAL: Yeah, that's true. Today at the Pentagon, they're just showing a movie.
FARSAD: Right, exactly.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: All right, Megan. Your next quote is someone who is known for attacking millionaires and billionaires.
KURTIS: I wrote a bestselling book. If you write a bestselling book, you can be a millionaire, too.
SAGAL: That is the new Democratic front-runner according to polls. Who is it?
DOHERTY: That was Bernie Sanders.
SAGAL: It was Bernie Sanders.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Senator Sanders caused a bit of a stir this week because the guy who for years has been saying we've had enough of our country being run by millionaires and billionaires revealed that he is, in fact, a millionaire - which is surprising because most millionaires can afford haircuts.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: We should have known things were changing for him economically when his stump speech changed to (imitating Bernie Sanders) we've had enough of our country being run by billionaires and zillionaires.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: But Bernie has promised not to enjoy the money because in his entire life, he has never enjoyed anything.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I just can't believe he got rich from writing a book because everybody I know who's written a book is so broke.
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: And also, like, what can you buy in Vermont for a millionaire?
BODDEN: I think with a million dollars in Vermont, you can buy, like, half of Vermont.
SAGAL: It's true.
HIGGINS: Yeah.
SAGAL: By the way, this is all in preparation for Bernie releasing his tax returns. Did you know that Bernie has not released his tax returns? Didn't do it in 2016. He says he's going to do it next week. He's the perfect candidate for people who both hate President Trump and are kind of jealous of Republicans for having him. Why can't liberals have an angry, old man with terrible hair who won't release his tax returns?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: I'm sitting here, Peter, trying to think of a joke that shows I care about rich, white men, but I've got nothing.
SAGAL: I know.
(LAUGHTER, CHEERING)
BODDEN: I've got...
FARSAD: It's tough.
BODDEN: I've got - listen. It's one more time...
FARSAD: I know.
BODDEN: ...White people complaining about, oh, man, I'd have made a million dollars. I don't know how to help you on that one.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Good luck with that. Yeah.
SAGAL: Megan, here is your last quote.
KURTIS: Einstein must be totally chuffed.
SAGAL: That was a very happy astronomer quoted in The New York Times talking about the first-ever photograph ever made of a what?
DOHERTY: A black hole.
SAGAL: A black hole.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: This week, we got to look at the first-ever photo of an actual massive, interstellar black hole in a galaxy known as Messier 87 about 55 million light years away. It looks like a - well, a black hole surrounded by a ring of orange light like the eye of Sauron or a...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Really, really evil bagel.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Nonetheless, the photo was a scientific triumph. It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen - except for the people who asked for photos of their colonoscopies. Interestingly...
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Wait, is that what...
SAGAL: It made us think of that - all I can tell you.
FARSAD: How many colonoscopy...
BODDEN: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Photos...
BODDEN: I guess.
FARSAD: ...Do you look at, Peter?
SAGAL: Well, you know.
FARSAD: (Laughter).
SAGAL: Interestingly - and this is pretty cool - because of the time it takes the light to get here - 55 million years - the photo is the black hole when it was much younger than it is now. So what do you know? The black hole is just like everyone on Tinder.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: My first thought when I saw that photo was, like, wow, that's a really great use of portrait mode...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...You know? So the...
BODDEN: That's why really - I really feel happy for those astrophysicists and the other science - the geniuses who spend their whole life studying and working, and they can finally say, that's what I do. This is what I do. Like...
SAGAL: Here you go.
BODDEN: People have always - what do you do at work?
(APPLAUSE)
BODDEN: This is what I do.
SAGAL: And this is really cool. It turns out that in order to take this picture of this extraordinarily distant object that there's no single telescope that's strong enough to do it. So they had to get data from telescopes all around the world and combine them in an incredibly complicated way figured out by a 29-year-old astrophysicist named Rachel (ph).
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: And they say that the precision of this virtual instrument they created was so precise they could see an orange on the moon - which makes you say, why are they going on about a black hole? There are oranges on the moon.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: When I was reading about this, I read, like, if you were - they were trying to explain what happens if you go into the black hole.
SAGAL: Right.
FARSAD: And so you pass through the event horizon unscathed. And then you get to this point where the black hole stretches you like a noodle.
SAGAL: Yes.
FARSAD: Which, for a minute, I was, like, I'm OK with that as someone...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...Who might use, like, body distortion filters on...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Insta...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...That, like, you kind of go...
SAGAL: For a...
FARSAD: ...Like, your skinniest.
SAGAL: For an instant, a microsecond...
FARSAD: Yeah, for a microsecond...
SAGAL: You'll finally be a size one.
FARSAD: You're, like, super tall and skinny.
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: Exactly. That's kind of into that.
SAGAL: Yeah. That would be cool.
HIGGINS: But then do you just disintegrate?
FARSAD: And then you're dead.
HIGGINS: Worth it.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Megan do on our quiz?
KURTIS: She got them all right. She is a winner.
SAGAL: Megan, thank you so much for playing.
(APPLAUSE)
DOHERTY: Thank you.
SAGAL: Bye-bye.
DOHERTY: Goodbye.

Not My Job: We Quiz Journalist Dan Rather On What He Actually Said,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712576151/not-my-job-we-quiz-journalist-dan-rather-on-what-he-actually-said,"Enlarge this image Robin Marchant/Getty Images for AWXI Robin Marchant/Getty Images for AWXI We recorded the show in San Antonio, Texas, this week and invited journalist Dan Rather — Texas native and resident — to play our quiz. In addition to reporting on pretty much every major event of the last half century, Rather is also famous for ""Ratherisms"" — folksy sayings combining colorful metaphors with colorful wisdom. He's used so many of them, we're curious to see if he can pick out what he really said from the ones that we just made up.
Click the audio link above to hear how he does.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
And now the game where people live a rich, full life and yet somehow end up with us.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: If all the major events of the late 20th century had a single thing in common, it might be this. They were reported on by Dan Rather. He was at Dealey Plaza...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...When Kennedy was shot. He reported from Vietnam. He challenged Nixon on Watergate. He covered the Cold War and was there to cover its end. He is a proud Texas native and still a resident. We are honored to have him with us.
Dan Rather, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
DAN RATHER: Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: So you still have a home here in Texas. You grew up here in Texas. You're a Texan.
RATHER: I was born in Wharton, Texas. I grew up in Houston, and I'm not just from Texas. I am of Texas.
SAGAL: You are a Texan.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You started - and it turns out that many reporters, including Bill, started this way. You were a local guy. You - at one - you were doing minor league baseball games at one point.
RATHER: I did. I once - I've always been interested in news. But once to supplement my income at its lower levels, you know, broadcasting doesn't pay all that well. So I did play-by-play as a way of supplementing my income. I did play-by-play football and baseball, basketball, track. Track is really difficult to do play-by-play from...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Wait a minute. How would you do that? Well, he's running.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He seems to be running more.
RATHER: Or he's vaulting, or he has this shot put in his hand. And he takes five steps, and he throws.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Do you think there's one moment that - in which you sort of got your start that started your career that we've all sort of been watching lo these many decades?
RATHER: Well, I do. That - there was a great hurricane in 1961, Hurricane Carla, which was at that time and I think still the largest in terms of sheer size hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico. And I had just started in television. I had made my move from radio into television. I was still new to television. And we wound up in the right place at the right time on Galveston Island as the hurricane came in. And that was picked up by other stations. Nobody else was there broadcasting. So if I had to point to one moment that sort of, quote, ""made my career,"" that was probably it.
SAGAL: Yeah, it's funny because Bill got his sort of start with a great tornado in Kansas.
BILL KURTIS: Tornado - same thing. You have to be there.
SAGAL: It turns out maybe these weather events are being caused by ambitious, young reporters.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You were known and - for many things but certainly for being fearless, not only the places you went, like war zones, but also the way you treated people in power. There was a famous incident where you got up, and you asked President Nixon a question. It was during Watergate. And he didn't like it. And I believe he said, are you running for something? And your famous response was...
RATHER: No, sir, Mr. President. Are you?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's pretty good. You, of course, took over as the anchor of the ""CBS Evening News,"" taking the baton from Walter Cronkite, another legend who, I guess, took it from Edward R. Murrow. So you're part of that line. And one of the things that people were noticing as you settled into that role was you were looking for your signoff because famously, of course, Cronkite would end his broadcast, well, that's the way it is on this day.
RATHER: Right.
SAGAL: And what was your thinking? You said, I needed something different? You needed something for yourself?
RATHER: Well, it was suggested to me that you need a signoff.
SAGAL: Yeah.
RATHER: But you know what? Following a legend like that is not the easiest thing in the world (laughter). At any rate, my first suggestion was maybe I can say, well, that's some of the way it is.
SAGAL: Yeah, OK. That's not bad.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Nobody took to that idea. We tried to. But at any rate...
SAGAL: That's the way it might be.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Doesn't have quite the same ring.
SAGAL: No, not at all.
RATHER: But at any rate, I was thinking, you know, my father's - late father's favorite word was courage for a lot of reasons. So I thought, well, maybe we could just pause and say, you know, and that's the ""CBS Evening News"" - Dan Rather reporting courage. And the more I thought about it, the more I kind of liked it because it had a nostalgic ring for me. I will say that the executives in the company were horrified that this whole...
SAGAL: Really.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: So it lasted about a week. And at the end of that week, it was pretty much you either stop using this as a signoff, or we stop using you.
SAGAL: Whoa.
RATHER: So it was an easy decision.
SAGAL: I understand. And what did you change to?
RATHER: I just decided not to have one.
SAGAL: Yeah, just went with the plain goodnight.
RATHER: I've giving it my best shot, didn't work out. So we...
SAGAL: There you go. I know. Hey, we could talk to you about your career all night, but out of all the people you've interviewed - and you interviewed just about every, you know, major historical player in the last 50 years - was there a particular favorite, somebody who you were glad to talk to?
RATHER: Well, I'm glad you put the preface because let's face it - I've been lucky and mightily blessed. I could give you the names maybe seven people. But if I had to pick one, it would be I was assigned - my first major assignment for CBS News was to cover Dr. Martin Luther King and what was then the emerging civil rights movement.
(APPLAUSE)
RATHER: Covering Dr. King changed me as a professional, and it changed me as a person. And for that reason, I would say if I had to pick one, I would say interviewing Dr. Martin Luther King and covering him day to day for almost two years.
SAGAL: Wow. Sure. I imagine that's - I'm envious that you had the chance.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Do you ever - when you're watching whomever, do you ever, like, miss it? Are you ever like, if I was there, I would have the questions?
RATHER: Like every second.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I can imagine. Well, Dan Rather, it is an absolute honor to talk to you, but today we have, in fact, asked you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: This game is tougher than the hide of an armadillo in the hot sun that forgot its sunblock.
SAGAL: As I'm sure you know, you are famous for what people call Ratherisms, folksy sayings with colorful metaphors and colorful wisdom. You've used so many of them over your career. We want to see if you can pick the one you actually came up with....
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...From some fake ones that we made up in tribute to you. So if you can do that two times out of three, you'll win a prize for one of our listeners.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, who is Dan Rather playing for?
KURTIS: Corey Henderstine (ph) of Washington, D.C.
SAGAL: All right. Here's your first Ratherism. This was when you were covering the 2000 election. And did you say, A, this race is tight like a too-small bathing suit in a too-long ride home from the beach...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, Poppa, wear your good suit because we got ourselves a tie...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, this race is tighter than Aunt Tilly after a third Moscow Mule.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Definitely A.
SAGAL: It was definitely A.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: I've always wondered before we move - did you just make those up off the top of your head? Or did you, like, have them ready to go?
RATHER: Well, in the beginning, they came from working in the oil fields when I was a kid. This is the way men talk with one another.
SAGAL: You have got to be kidding me.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Oh, absolutely. You know, you can only say it's hot as hell so many times.
SAGAL: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: So as the day wears on, you say, you know, it's hotter than a Laredo parking lot or some way to use colorful language.
SAGAL: All right. We have two more. You did well with that one. This is now - we're moving through time to the election of 2004. That was George W. Bush re-elected versus John Kerry. During that evening's coverage on CBS, did you say, A, John Kerry's wife might own Heinz, but this is one night he won't catch up...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, we used to say if a frog had side pockets, he'd carry a handgun; or C, it all comes down to O-H-I-O, which stands for, oh, hi, it's over.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Definitely B.
SAGAL: Yes, if a frog...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...Had side pockets, he'd carry a handgun. I think you're doing really well.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Here's your last question. This is a great metaphor you used while commenting on the 2016 election. Was it, A, this race is a back country tilt-a-whirl - it could go either way; B, like the talking horse said to the hopping bull, I can't believe what I'm seeing...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, if Clinton wins Florida, this race will go faster than a ""Hamilton"" ticket at face value.
RATHER: I don't recall saying any of those.
SAGAL: Really? Do you know which one you wish you had said?
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: I guess that would be B.
SAGAL: You'd be B, like the talking horse said to the hopping bull. It is a good one, but the one that we were told you said if Clinton wins Florida, this race will go faster than a ""Hamilton"" ticket at face value, which I thought was great because you're updating your cultural references.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Meanwhile, Bill, how did your old friend Dan do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Well, he had won anyway. Two out of three is a big win for us.
(APPLAUSE)
KURTIS: Good going.
SAGAL: Dan Rather is a legend of broadcast news and the creator of News and Guts Media. The new season of ""The Big Interview With Dan Rather"" starts April 16 at 8 p.m. on AXS.
Dan Rather, thank you for being with us. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Dan Rather, everyone.
RATHER: Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""(AIN’T THAT) GOOD NEWS"")
SAM COOKE: (Singing) Ain't that good news? Man, ain't that news? Baby's coming home tomorrow.
SAGAL: In just a minute, we finally settle that whole cat versus dog debate in our Listener Limerick Challenge. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on the air. We'll be back in a minute with more of WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME from NPR.

"After Coachella Premiere, Childish Gambino's Film 'Guava Island' Is Streaming",www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713028614/after-coachella-premiere-childish-gambinos-film-guava-island-is-streaming,"Enlarge this image Donald Glover in a still from Guava Island , which he stars in with Rihanna. The film premiered at Coachella, where Glover's musical act Childish Gambino headlined on Friday. courtesy of Amazon Prime Video courtesy of Amazon Prime Video Donald Glover in a still from Guava Island , which he stars in with Rihanna. The film premiered at Coachella, where Glover's musical act Childish Gambino headlined on Friday.
courtesy of Amazon Prime Video Guava Island , Childish Gambino 's long-awaited new project, has finally arrived. Hot off a headlining Coachella performance Friday night, Guava Island is the proverbial cherry on top of Donald Glover's wildly successful year as a rapper, following his first Billboard No. 1 with ""This Is America"" in 2018 and that song's wins for Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the Grammy awards earlier this year — the first rap song to ever win both those prizes.
Anticipation for Guava Island was first stoked months in advance with a single photo of Glover and Rihanna on set in Cuba, spurring grandiose speculation as to what the project would entail — especially since it's tied to Glover's retirement of the Childish Gambino project. Longtime collaborator Hiro Murai directed (Murai is also the director of the ""This Is America"" video and many episodes of Glover's TV series Atlanta ) and the screenplay was written by Stephen Glover, Donald's brother and a writer on Atlanta.
Almost as if to curtail the expectations, the film itself is a modestly stunning — and at times unnerving — extended music video, shot in 4:3 aspect ratio, about music's power to unite in the face of tyranny and greed. It features three new songs, ""Die With You,"" ""Time"" and the flamenco-tinged ""Saturday,"" as well as renditions of the previously released ""Summertime Magic,"" ""Feels Like Summer"" and notably, a sequence showcasing ""This Is America"" that recalls Murai's music video from last year.
A quick summary of the plot: Glover stars as Deni Maroon, a Purple Rain-esque folk hero and local celebrity on the island — exploited for its natural splendor and transformed into a factory spinning silk run by a single despot, played by Nonso Anozie. Rihanna plays his partner, Kofi Novia. The pair meets in a gorgeous animated backstory at the start of the film. Deni's set on uniting the island with a music festival, but it comes at a cost. Black Panther's Letitia Wright also plays a role.
YouTube
Guava Island is streaming on Amazon for free today until 9 p.m. EST. After that time, it'll be available only to Amazon Prime members. It will also stream once on YouTube's Coachella live stream , starting at 8 p.m ET / 5 p.m. PT."

He's most famous as the star of the CBS sitcom ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" one of the most successful recent examples of the old-fashioned multi-camera TV sitcom. But he's also challenged himself as an actor, starring in such dramatic roles as a man with a midlife crisis in TNT's ""Men Of A Certain Age,"" a photographer on the autism spectrum in NBC's ""Parenthood"" and a record promoter in HBO's ""Vinyl.""
Terry Gross spoke to Ray Romano in 2016, the year ""Vinyl"" premiered. This year, Ray Romano returned to the format that got him started - stand-up comedy in a Netflix special called ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around the Corner."" It was his first stand-up special in 23 years. Here he is on the topic of being a father of a 16-year-old son.
(SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, ""RAY ROMANO: RIGHT HERE, AROUND THE CORNER"")
RAY ROMANO: And now he drives. Why do we give 16-year-olds licenses? My son doesn't care about anything. He called me today like, hey, Dad, I'm in the car. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'm out of gas right now.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: What do you mean you don't know, Joe? Are you moving?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Is the car moving? I'm not moving. I'm not moving. I put my foot on the pedal, I'm not going anywhere right now. All right. Well, all right. Where are you, Joe? And he's very calm, now, he's la-de-da (ph). I'm here. I'm on the 101. The 101 is a five-lane highway.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Nothing. So I assume, like anybody would, oh, you're on the side of the road, now? No, I'm in the middle lane right now.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: What do you mean, Joe? Where's the urgency? I swear to you, this is the exchange 'cause I'm panicking now. What's the traffic like? Well, behind me, it's bad. But it's moving in front of me.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'm going to kick your ass, Joe, 'cause you need fear. You need fear in your life.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And my wife tries to spin it. You know, whatever he does, she puts the spin on it. Well, he doesn't panic. He's Zen. He's a very Zen-like boy, like astronauts. Maybe he'll be an astronaut one day. Oh, you think so? Really? I don't want to burst your bubble, but if he can't interpret the gas gauge on a Mazda...
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: ...No, he ain't getting in a space shuttle, I'll tell you right now. Give that up.
BIANCULLI: It was 24 years ago, in 1995, when David Letterman gave Ray Romano his big break by inviting him to do stand-up on ""The Late Show."" A week later, Ray got a call from Letterman's production company, saying they were interested in creating a sitcom around him, which turned out to be the show ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" Here's that 1995 stand-up routine from Romano's original appearance on ""Letterman.""
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN"")
ROMANO: I have a 3-year-old daughter and twin 2-year-old boys.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Wow. Thank you. Single people are here.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Single people are like, yay, twins. Parents - oh, that could have been us. Oh, my God.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'll tell you. You know, it doesn't matter if you laugh or not. I'm just happy to be out of the house right now. I'll be honest with you.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I will be honest. You know, it's horrible. I make little excuses now just to get out of my house for a few minutes. I'll do anything. Anybody, do you need anything? Anything at all, anything?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Anything from the motor vehicle bureau? How about that?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Can I register something? It's on my way. I'm going that way. I'm just going to go apply for jury duty, that's all. Let me out.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: So when David Letterman had you on the show for the first time in 1995, and he...
ROMANO: Yeah.
GROSS: ...Was so taken with your comedy that he wanted to build a sitcom around you, you must have been shocked.
ROMANO: Yeah. They called my house, by the way. I lived in Queens. I was in a small house in Queens. And it was a Saturday. First of all, who's calling your house - what executive producer from the show is calling you at your house, and not your manager or agent, and on a Saturday?
And here's where I was. I was - I had been doing stand-up for 11 years. I did Johnny Carson in 1991. I did Leno a couple times. I did every stand-up show they had, ""Evening At The Improv,"" the MTV - all those shows. I had my own HBO half-hour, and I loved doing it. I loved doing stand-up.
I was happy to be doing what I loved, but I was - I kind of reached a plateau, I guess, of where I was going to go. And if that's all I did for the rest of my career, you know, it's - it doesn't suck to be doing what you love to do. And Letterman, after I'd done my Letterman set, I kind of thought, well, that was a really good set. So let's see if it had - you know, maybe somebody? And it was Letterman. It was Letterman who was watching from 20 feet away.
And they called me. And I remember my wife saying, Rob Burnett's on the phone. I was in the backyard. I don't know what I was doing. I was hosing off the kids. And I picked the phone up. I was kind of surprised. And he said, listen, Dave liked what he saw. And so we just want to - we just want to say, I just want to tell you that we're interested. So let's see what happens.
Just know, don't - before you sign anything else with anybody else, we're interested. And then, right away - I told them right there, nobody's - there is nobody else. You know, if you're interested, I'm interested. And sure enough, we signed a deal. And here I am.
GROSS: (Laughter) You know, in watching back your appearance - your last appearance on the Letterman show, you started to tear up. Your voice cracked on that.
ROMANO: Yeah, I did.
GROSS: You got very emotional because he had, you know, giving you the green light to have a sitcom. I mean, he really changed your life so profoundly. That show was so successful.
ROMANO: Yeah. Yeah, I'm getting emotional now when I think about it. But yeah, it's true. Look; there are many things that happened in my life. There are many milestones. There are many things that got me to where I am but none more so than the five minutes I did on ""Letterman"" that night. And then I did - you know, for the next 20 years, I was on his show at least once - sometimes twice. And then - so for him - when he was retiring, it was something. I mean, it changed my life. It changed my children's life. I mean, I'd still like to think we'd be the same people. I think I am - but so many more opportunities. So just to see him go away into - yeah. I mean, it all kind of welled up in me.
I'll tell you one little story. I'm kind - I'm a kind of superstitious guy - and sometimes too superstitious. But the night that I did the first ""Letterman,"" he was doing a bit about - it was springtime, so he was doing a bit about cutting your pants - summer-izing (ph) your pants. And he took someone from the audience, and he cut their pants into shorts. And then he took Paul Schaefer, and he cut Paul Schaefer's pants into shorts. And then Mel Gibson was the first guest. And he took Mel Gibson's, and he cut his. And then he said, well, I've got to do mine. And he cut his own pants into shorts.
So I was backstage, and I'm watching this. And you know - so I'm talking with my manager (unintelligible). And we're like - and I'm like, should I - do I cut my pants? Do I go out with my pants? And they're like, you've got to do it (laughter). And one of the one of the writers - producers came over with, like, scissors and says, well, you've got to go out - when they introduce you, you've got to go out with your pants cut. And I - we literally were - I had the scissors in my hand. I'm making a big deal out of this, and I probably shouldn't.
But I had the scissors in my hand, and we were ready to cut my pants into shorts. So when Dave Letterman announces this new comic - Ray Romano, here he is - and I walk out, you're going to see my bare calves and knees and I'm part of the joke. And at the last second, I thought, I'm not going to do it. I'm going to just - I don't want to assume I'm part of the clique. I'm part of - you know, I'm the - they don't even know who I am. And now I'm going to go out and be in on the joke. And I don't know. It's too presumptuous; it's too whatever. So I decided not to.
And I went out, and I had the - what I thought was probably one of my best TV sets. And it turned into this - and I still believe had I cut those pants into shorts, the dynamic - something's different. Maybe I have a good set, but there's something. And who knows whether or not all of this happens if I cut my pants into shorts?
GROSS: Well, that's really interesting.
ROMANO: (Laughter).
GROSS: You know what? I'm - here's part of the - how the dynamic might have been different. It would have not only been that, like, you were in on the joke - you know, a part of the clique or whatever. But the audience's first reaction to you would've been like - oh, he's got bony legs or something like that, or, like, doesn't he look funny in those foolish looking shorts that used to be pants a few minutes ago.
ROMANO: Yes, it's distracting. It's distracting.
GROSS: And it takes away from thinking - oh, it's a new comic. I wonder what he's going to talk about.
ROMANO: I don't know if you're kidding or not, but I think...
GROSS: No, I'm not kidding.
ROMANO: ...You're absolutely right.
GROSS: No, I mean that sincerely. Like, it would've...
ROMANO: Well, good. You're...
GROSS: ...Been so off-topic to distract people into thinking about, like, your bony legs and laughing at that when you had, like, genuine comedy to deliver.
ROMANO: Well, I want to say two things. One, I have - my bottom half of my legs are...
GROSS: I didn't mean to assume about your legs (laughter).
ROMANO: ...Fantastic. But that might have been distracting - that they're too good looking. But...
GROSS: Get a load of those gams.
ROMANO: ...I believe that, you know?
GROSS: Yeah.
ROMANO: I have told this story to other people. And they're like, you would have been fine. Don't worry about it. And then what - a little end to this story is when ""Raymond"" was going off the air - when the last episode was airing, I appeared on ""Letterman"" that night. And so to bring it full circle, I cut my pants into shorts on that episode just 'cause, you know, what I didn't do 10 years ago, I did for the last episode, yeah.
GROSS: Oh, that's funny. Yeah.
ROMANO: Yeah. So that was cool.
GROSS: That's great.
ROMANO: But I believe those kind of things. I'm like, who knows what would have happened, the whole trickle-down effect? Who knows?
GROSS: Yeah.
BIANCULLI: Ray Romano speaking to Terry Gross in 2016 - more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONNY ROLLINS AND TOMMY FLANAGAN'S ""H.S."")
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2016 interview with comic actor and writer Ray Romano. His first stand-up comedy special in 23 years, ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around The Corner,"" is now on Netflix.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: So when you started on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" the show was - it was kind of billed as like very loosely based on your life - you know, a married man, father of three kids - a daughter and two twin boys and whose parents lived very nearby and who are always kind of showing up and visiting a little too long. And (laughter)...
ROMANO: Yes.
GROSS: ...You know, it's kind of interfering with the married life of this couple.
Did you have a long talk with your family before the show started and say - you know, to say - hey, people are going to be making assumptions about who you really are based on the characters in the sitcom. Some of those assumptions will be true; some of them will be false. Some of the portrayals are going to be more negative than the way I really feel about you. Or you know, like, what kind of (laughter) - what kind of heart-to-heart did you have?
ROMANO: Well, I didn't have a talk before. But I had a couple of talks during (laughter). First of all, let me just say that, you know, I - thank God for Phil Rosenthal, who - you know, they hooked me up with Phil Rosenthal, who wrote the pilot script. And we talked about our families together. And Phil took his parents and my parents and kind of melded them together to become those parents. So it wasn't an exact portrayal of every - down to, you know, the nitty-gritty of my family.
But the only real issue was maybe the brother character 'cause my brother is a New York police officer - or was then at that time. And he actually coined the phrase - I don't know how many people know this. But the title ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" it's - I mean, I guess most people do, but some still don't. It's said sarcastically in the pilot - in the pilot episode.
And this is a quote from my brother, my real-life brother, who was a police officer. And he would come in and - in real life, he would come over. And he'd see - what? - I got an award, or I got something for stand-up comedy. And he would jokingly, kind of tongue-in-cheek he'd say, well, look at Raymond. Raymond gets awards when he goes to work. You know, when I go to work, people shoot at me.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: People spit at me. When Raymond goes, everybody loves Raymond. So I told this story to Phil. And Phil said, oh, that's - we have to use that. We have to use that as the title. And I said, well, please don't. And he said, well, let's just use it as the working title. And then we'll change it when - you know, when it comes time to go to pilot. And of course, Les Moonves, the head of CBS, fell in love with the title. And he would not - I tried desperately to change that title.
GROSS: Why?
ROMANO: Nobody wants (laughter) that. It's just asking for trouble.
GROSS: People taking it at face value, thinking that you think that everybody loves you.
ROMANO: Well, even if they don't take it at face value, to this day - to this day, someone will start an article with, well, not everybody loves Raymond, and this and that.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: And yeah, but as far as my family, my brother, who was this tough street cop and a real good cop and really dedicated - and the way Brad Garrett was being portrayed - was portraying him - was slightly goofy. And my mother used to say to me, why - why do they have to make him so goofy? Why did - and I'm - Ma, it's just - it's fictional. It's nothing, you know.
But my brother then became - first of all, he loved what Brad Garrett, the character that he became. And - and we did a couple episodes to show what a good cop he was and what a good soul he was. And my brother was very into that. And he met Brad. And he told Brad that he's proud that he's portraying him.
And not only that, my brother was single at the - at the time, or some point at the time. And he became a little mini - mini celebrity. So I think he was more than happy to be portrayed in this - you know, in any TV show.
GROSS: So what was it like when you started on ""Everybody Loves Raymond""? You're the star of this network sitcom. And I don't think you'd ever really had an acting job before. (Laughter).
ROMANO: No.
GROSS: So everybody's relying on you to be really great in this, and you're, like, not experienced.
ROMANO: No, I had - the one experience I had was getting fired from a sitcom. I got fired from ""NewsRadio."" I don't know if you remember the show ""NewsRadio.""
GROSS: I do remember the show.
ROMANO: Yeah, I was - I was in the original cast. I was - I was hired for the original cast. And on day two of rehearsal for the pilot, I got - I got let go (laughter). Or they went in another direction is what - is what they told us. And I - and I deserved to be fired, I think.
And, you know, I can - I can say now - and even then I kind of knew I was out of my league. I was - I wasn't ready. It just - it didn't feel right. I had a great audition. I - the showrunner saw me, saw my HBO special and asked for me to come in and read. And I had a great audition. He was cracking up. And he just wanted to hire me right there. And he did.
And then I performed for the network. And then at the table read, I could feel I wasn't quite getting it. And then during rehearsal I could feel it also. I was just stiff. I just - I just wasn't ready. And I got let go. I got fired. And then five months later, I want to say, is when I did my ""Letterman"" spot. And the following year is when ""Raymond"" came.
But I was stiff in the beginning of ""Raymond,"" too. They got an acting coach for me. HBO was also one of the producers, along with Worldwide Pants. And somebody from HBO said, listen, we want to hire an acting coach for you. What do you think? And I said, all right, you know. They said, yeah because, you know, it's a little different than stand-up. When you talk, people talk back to you now. I go, oh, yeah, that's - OK, let's see how I can find out how to do that.
BIANCULLI: Ray Romano speaking to Terry Gross in 2016. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF SCOTT JOPLIN'S ""STOPTIME RAG"")
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2016 interview with comic, actor and writer Ray Romano. His current Netflix special, ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around The Corner,"" is his first stand-up comedy special in 23 years. Here's a taste.
(SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, ""RAY ROMANO: RIGHT HERE, AROUND THE CORNER"")
ROMANO: You know, the other day, my wife got all of us together, all the men. And she passed a new ordinance in the house, new law. She said, I'm not answering any stupid questions. She goes, from now on, if you ask me a question that you should know the answer, I'm just walking away.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And I was like, whatever. You know, I don't want to show fear in front of my kids.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'm not going to show fear. I have an image for the boys. I didn't think about it. I let her go. And then the next day, I really didn't think about it till I couldn't find my sweatpants. I couldn't find my sweatpants. And I was walking up to ask her, and then I stopped myself. And I go, oh, no, is this one of those?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And then I thought, I can't live like this.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And I just - I, look, I said, whatever happens, happens. I said, I can't find my sweatpants. And she looked. And she didn't say anything for a second. And then I got to admit, my heart started beating a little faster.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And then finally she just goes, check the dryer. They're probably in the dryer. I go, OK. I walked away and went, I got away. I got away. It worked. She scared me. I got away with it. And then I thought, I can't ask her where the dryer is.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I got to find that dryer. I got to - we got the boys. You know, we all talked about it. Nobody knew. Nobody really knew. We all went in separate directions.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: What was it like for you when you first became famous? It's probably something that you wanted for yourself. But the experience of it might have been very different than what you were expecting.
ROMANO: You know, when you say famous, I guess the first time anyone ever recognized me - I was telling my wife about this the other day that I remember exactly when ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" started. I remember the first person. I was - we had gone back to Queens. It was during a hiatus weekend. I went to a gas station, and I was pumping my gas. And a woman said, hey, aren't you on that show? And I said, yeah, I am. Thank you, you know. And that was it.
And then, you know, it was still a long ways off before I ever had to worry about being somewhere - and not that I have to worry. I mean, nobody is, you know, I'm not Justin Bieber. My fans can't - I can outrun my fans. Put it that way. But yeah. But it's - I want to say strange, but it's not - it doesn't really affect my life too much really. I mean, yes, it does. I - here's what I say. Before I thought my cab driver hated me, and now I think my limo driver hates me.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: I think it's all the same, yeah. And this is maybe a negative way to look at it, but I'm just as neurotic if I had never gotten famous or rich. I think I would be equally neurotic because I was neurotic before, and I'm neurotic now. And I'm - I think I'm just as happy as I was then.
GROSS: So a question of ""Men Of A Certain Age,"" in which you played 1 of 3 men dealing with middle age, men who'd been friends since college. And you co-created the show. So a lot of people, when they reach middle age, just try to act like they're not. You know, like, people want to seem like they're young forever, whether that means, like, getting surgery or just dressing a certain way or behaving a certain way.
And so I think it's great that you decided to, you know, write a show about men who are middle aged and really examine in both dramatic and comic way the range of some of those experiences of reaching midlife. And I'd be interested in hearing, like, why you decided to do it and to do something that had, you know, at least as much, if not more, drama in it than comedy.
ROMANO: Well, when ""Raymond"" ended, I was at first very excited - not very excited for it to end, but excited that I was going to, I guess, see what life was like. It was a bit of a cool feeling in the beginning because now you're - all of a sudden, you've got all this time. And you've got this money and this fame now. And - but it was like coming out of a submarine. It was like, what is this now? My kids are teenagers. And I live here. I live in LA.
It was kind of an odd, new feeling. I finally talked with my friend, Mike Royce, who was also a writer on ""Raymond."" And he said he's got the same feeling. And, you know, it's kind of this this weird, where am I, what am I doing now? What's, you know, where's my next passion and purpose? Am I at a part - a time in my life where I accomplished what I wanted to? And we said, let's write about it we.
That's what ""Raymond"" was. ""Raymond"" was writing about what you know. Let's do that. We're not going to do a sitcom, of course. Let's do a single camera and write about it. And that's where ""Men Of A Certain Age"" came out of. And we won a Peabody Award, and then they canceled us. And I have to give credit to TNT because they put us on the air. So I'm not blaming them, but it ultimately didn't find the right home, I don't think. We still miss it. I still miss that show. It was a passion of both of ours.
GROSS: Ray Romano, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much.
ROMANO: Well, I appreciate it very much. Thank you, too.

Remembering Oscar-Nominated Character Actor Seymour Cassel,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712673652/remembering-oscar-nominated-character-actor-seymour-cassel?station=KXJZ_FM,"Cassel, who died April 7, performed as a child during matinees of his mom's burlesque shows and went on to appear in movies directed by John Cassavetes and Wes Anderson. Originally broadcast in 2006.
DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. Actor Seymour Cassel, a character actor familiar to fans of the movies of John Cassavetes and Wes Anderson, died last Sunday at age 84. His first screen appearance was a small, uncredited role in the first film Cassavetes ever directed, in ""Shadows,"" in 1958. More than 50 years later, Cassel appeared in an episode of the HBO musical comedy series, ""Flight Of The Conchords,"" and kept working until very recently.
Terry Gross spoke with him in 2006. Overall, Cassel amassed more than 200 acting credits. His later work involved independent films, including Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" In the 1992 film ""In The Soup,"" he starred opposite Steve Buscemi. Buscemi played an aspiring writer with a massively clunky screenplay, and Cassel played the shady character willing to act as the film's finance guy.

SEYMOUR CASSEL: (As Joe) Hello.
STANLEY TUCCI: (As Gregoire) Hello.
CASSEL: (As Joe) Gregoire.
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) Yes, Gregoire.
CASSEL: (As Joe) Bobby Azaro from Queens.
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) Bobby Azaro.
CASSEL: (As Joe, laughter) Guess what?
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) What?
CASSEL: (As Joe) We just developed a mutual friend, Angelica Peena (ph).
JENNIFER BEALS: (As Angelica Pena) Pena.
CASSEL: (As Joe) Pena - what's the difference?
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) My wife?
CASSEL: (As Joe) Point is, you owe her 3,500.
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) Supposed to be 3,000 - 3,000.
BEALS: (As Angelica Pena) Three thousand.
CASSEL: (As Joe) It's 3,500 now. I just bought the debt.
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) You bought...
CASSEL: (As Joe) That's right.
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) Explain yourself.
CASSEL: (As Joe) What the f*** is there to explain?
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) OK. OK. Look. Look.
CASSEL: (As Joe) I thought you'd like that tone.
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) OK. OK. OK. Good. OK. Fine. Fine. Fine.
CASSEL: (As Joe) Sounds good.
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) We can work something out.
CASSEL: (As Joe) I'll send someone by. (Laughter) Happy New Year.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Seymour Cassel, welcome to FRESH AIR. This was kind of like your - your comeback film. Did you and Buscemi hit it off right away?
CASSEL: Yes, we did. I mean, I started in this business a long time ago. And in New York, I used to follow people down the street and imitate their walks. And so I can do Steve's walk, you know...
GROSS: (Laughter).
CASSEL: And I - and it sometimes drives people crazy, and sometimes they say, that's not the way I walk. And believe me. I'm pretty good at it. But we hit it off well. I didn't really know him or know his work. But Steve, I think I'd seen him in one or two films in some small parts. And it was a great discovery for me. He's an actor that reacts. And by that, I mean he listens, and you see him enjoying you.
GROSS: I assume that Steve Buscemi was a fan of yours before casting you. Did he already know you before meeting you? Did he already know your work...
CASSEL: He knew my work.
GROSS: ...Before meeting you in ""In The Soup.""
CASSEL: He's a big John Cassavetes fan.
GROSS: Yeah, I figured. So before we talk about your work with Cassavetes, I want to talk about your your early - and I mean very early show business career. Although, career is probably not exactly the right word. Your mother was in burlesque on the Minsky circuit when you were...
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: ...A child. And it sounds like you toured with her when you were...
CASSEL: I toured with her, yeah.
GROSS: ...When you were very young. What was her act like?
CASSEL: Well, she was a chorus girl. Then she became a specialty act. And if you know burlesque, Minsky had the main theater here. And he had roadshows. And you'd go from New York to Baltimore to D.C., Kansas City, Mo., St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo, Boston. But I got to get on stage when I was about 3 1/2. And I'd do the matinees in a little checkered suit and - with the baggy pants comics. And I could only work a matinee.
And I loved that world - you know, to me, the life on a train and then coming back to New York City and - you know, and had some downtime here. And I wasn't in school yet. And when I had to go to school, I was not very happy about that.
GROSS: So your mother had a specialty act. Does that mean a specialty strip act?
CASSEL: That's right.
GROSS: So what was her specialty?
CASSEL: Oh, she - she tried dancing with the feathers for a while - you know, the big feather fans. And then she tried a balloon once. But it was just natural for me backstage, you know, chorus girls getting dressed, getting undressed. And hi, Seymour, how are you? And hi, Rosie, how are you? You know, you're just - I learned very early that this was my world. And I was going to learn how to live in it.
GROSS: Now, your mother got married when you were young to - and your stepfather won a casino in a crap game. This must have been...
CASSEL: That's not true. He said that.
GROSS: That's not - I keep reading this every place. So what...
CASSEL: Well, it's true...
GROSS: What happened?
CASSEL: ...That's what I was told. I was 9. And I was living in - on 42nd with his mother and sister. He was a master sergeant in the Air Force during World War II, I guess. He'd been in 17 1/2 years. And we lived down in Fort Myers, Fla. We lived in Miami Beach. I remember the end of the war riding in a car with him and him saying, remember this day. A great man died today. And that was Franklin Roosevelt. And then, you know, we lived in Birmingham, Ala. And then the next thing I know, they were going to Panama.
And that's what he told me, that he won it in a crap game. I later figured out, I got a feeling that he did a little business with some guys in Brooklyn and in the Bronx, you know. I mean, where else would - because we lived in a club - we had the whole corner on Ancon in Panama City. Ancon is the first little town in the Canal Zone. And he also had card games for the officers from the Canal Zone. So he was - he was a busy guy. And I'm not sure what he did, but I'm sure some of it was a little illegal. But he made it work.
GROSS: So you were - you were - you were a pretty streetwise kid.
CASSEL: Oh, totally. And I'm still a streetwise guy. I mean, when people start to talk trash with me, I say, you don't know I've been there. Snoop Dogg, I did a movie with him. And he started with me. And he said, where'd you learn that? And I said, well, between 42nd Street and New York, Snoop, I was doing no good and rapping before you ever started.
GROSS: Cassavetes has been such an influence on independent filmmaking. I mean, he's probably one of the most influential filmmakers in the world of independent film. And he was improvising in movies before that became a popular thing to do. What was his approach to getting the actors to improvise a scene? What were you given before the scene, and how would you work it?
CASSEL: Well, John, with ""Shadows"" we would do an improvisation. And John would see where the actors' tendencies and their instincts would take them. Then he would write, you know. But with ""Shadows,"" we would just rehearse it again and again and improvise it again and do it.
Once he started writing and wrote ""Too Late Blues"" and wrote ""Faces,"" you know, there was very - actually, the only improvisation in ""Faces"" is the songs I make up with the girls in - that I pick up at the Whiskey A Go Go, you know, where I say, put on the red meat, mama, don't want no taters, no onions - because we had no money for music. So John knew that I could kind of make up songs. I'd been doing it, you know, in the late '50s.
But when you get to know an actor and, you know, their instincts as well as John knew mine and Gazzara and, you know, and Gena, he could lead you. You can always add something to a scene because your instincts are to embellish it somewhat to contribute to the text. And ideas come to you, and you try them. And if they're good, you keep them. If they're not, you just eliminate them.
GROSS: You had a pretty major part in ""Faces."" You don't come into the film until around two-thirds of the way in. But then it's a pretty important part. ""Faces"" is about - it's basically about a middle-aged, middle-class, very unhappy couple.
So the husband in the couple goes off with Gena Rowlands, who plays a prostitute in it. And his wife goes to the Whiskey A Go Go with her girlfriends. They pick you you up or you pick them up. And you end up going to bed with the wife of this unhappy couple. And she's so miserable by the time, you know, later on about, like, what her life has become that she tries to overdose on sleeping pills.
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: And then you try to revive her.
CASSEL: I do revive her.
GROSS: Successfully.
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: And then I want to play the scene that happens right after that, after you've stuck your fingers down her throat to revive her...
CASSEL: Yeah.
GROSS: ...And kind of slapped...
CASSEL: To make her throw up, yeah.
GROSS: ...Her awake. You're talking with her, and here's part of that scene.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""FACES"")
CASSEL: (As Chet) I like you. I caused you a lot of pain and a lot of grief, and I almost killed you. And I prayed, man, oh, I prayed to God. God, please, dear God, don't let anything happen to her 'cause I love her so much, and I'll do anything you say, God. And, man, I don't even believe in him, you know? But, I mean, it doesn't matter. We protect ourselves. So when you're taught ethics and values and honesty and I'm a nice guy and you're a nice guy and this and that, you know, I mean, it just doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody has the time to be vulnerable to each other, so we just go on. You know, I mean, right away our armor comes out like a shield and goes around us, and we become like mechanical men. (Laughing) And I called you a mechanical woman. All you got to do is, I'm so mechanical. Honey, it's absolutely ludicrous how mechanical a person can be. (Imitating robot) I am the sexiest guy in the world. (Imitating robot) I have blond hair. (Imitating robot) I can get all the women I want. (Laughing) You're waking up, aren't you?
LYNN CARLIN: (As Maria, laughing) Uh-huh.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: That's Seymour Cassel in a scene from John Cassavetes' movie ""Faces."" Seymour Cassel, tell us a little bit about making that scene.
CASSEL: We were shooting it, and John - as I say to her the dialogue, you know, you think you're mechanical, honey. I'm so mechanical. Look, and I smoke a cigarette mechanically. And John said to me off camera, do the - do a mechanical man. So I did that (imitating robot) you know, kind of a - look at this, honey. And but that's the relationship you have with a director that knows you, that trusts you, that you respect. And you will try anything for him because you know he won't let you look foolish.
BIANCULLI: Seymour Cassel speaking to Terry Gross in 2006. He died last Sunday at age 84. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2006 interview with character actor Seymour Cassel. He first became noticed for his roles in films by John Cassavetes. He died last Sunday at age 84.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: There's so many, like, myths and legends about, you know, the Cassavetes movies and the people who made them and their adventures together making movies and their adventures together off the set. The impression I always get is that there's a lot of, like, partying and drinking that everybody making the movies did together.
CASSEL: Well, in the '50s, that's what people did. Dope wasn't around. Only up in Harlem could you get a nickel - a matchbox of marijuana. But - so we drank, and it was a social - socially accepted. And people drank highballs and cocktails, and every bar had a piano bar with a pianist who sang and, you know, and entertained.
And then there were joints like Jilly's that Sinatra hung out at and made famous. But there was the Five Spot and Basin Street and, you know, Birdland. And then, you know, 52nd street, I mean, you could stand outside at 16 years old and hear Billie Holiday sing because they always had the door open in the summer. And then, you know - all those clubs.
GROSS: Did any of the partying and drinking interfere with the moviemaking?
CASSEL: No. No. If you got too drunk, we - you know, we would wrap. But, I mean, we didn't drink that much when we worked. We would wait till afterward. John had a basketball court built on his house on Woodrow Wilson. And we'd finished shooting the older actors - Marley, you know, and Dorothy Gulliver.
And some would tire maybe around 3:30 in the morning, at 3. And we'd go out there, put the lights on, you know, take a couple of six-packs of beer and play basketball and beat the hell out of each other. It didn't bother anybody because Frank Zappa lived right next door, and he had a recording studio there. So who the hell were we bothering?
GROSS: John Cassavetes died in '89 of cirrhosis of the liver. What impact did that have on you? Were you still close then?
CASSEL: That - it still has an impact on me. I think of him almost every day. I mean, it was the older brother I never had, and it was the closest male friend that I ever had. And he was extremely influential in how - in creating my career and guiding it and - by loving me as much as he does or did. Yeah, that was the closest person in my life ever 'cause I never knew my father. And my mother, I only knew until I was about 12, and I went back to live with my godmother.
So John became a really - very close person in my life. And we were like - he had lost a brother - excuse me - very young before I met him of a heart attack and misdiagnosed and - so to me, it was the older brother I never had. And I don't know what I was to him, but I know that he loved me. And I love him very much. I mean...
GROSS: Now, I understand that you gave up drinking after he died.
CASSEL: I did. Well, I did it just - when I saw how bad he was, I quit. I quit everything. It was 20 something years ago. But...
GROSS: Your comeback wasn't long after that. Were the two connected?
CASSEL: Well, probably - people were less fearful of me because I was crazy. I mean, people would have one foot in Dan Tana's in LA and one foot inside the door and one out. What's Seymour going to do now? I got to see it, but I don't want to be here when he does it. I mean, I...
GROSS: What were you doing? What were you doing...
CASSEL: Anything I wanted. I was - you know, when I would get a little drunk, I would just be funny and stupid. And that's what people do when they - they either get stupid and mean, or they get funny and stupid. I chose to be funny. Mean was not something I liked to be.
GROSS: So you gave up drinking, and...
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: ...That's when you started to make your comeback. You said people were afraid to work with you before that.
CASSEL: I was unpredictable.
GROSS: And I think it was largely, like, independent filmmakers that you made your comeback with. You know, your first film was ""In The Soup"" that co-starred Steve Buscemi. Wes Anderson, for example, has cast you in three movies - ""Rushmore""...
CASSEL: ""Rushmore.""
GROSS: ...""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" How did he first approach you?
CASSEL: He was at Sundance when we won - he had a short called ""Bottle Rocket."" And what impressed me most was his knowledge of film. And I liked the script, and I liked the part. And so after that, he insisted I be in ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""
I didn't want to do ""Life Aquatic."" I was doing another movie. He said, you got to be in this movie. You got to be. And I had to fly to Rome. And then he looks at me, and he said, can we shave your head? I said, Wes, who the hell do you think you are? I'm shooting another movie.
GROSS: (Laughter).
CASSEL: I have already established my hair. He says, well, you could wear a wig. I said, for Christ sake, Wes, you're not the only filmmaker in the world, you know? I'm - why don't I wear a wig here? He said, well, no, the character has to be bald. I said, then do the skullcap. And that was miserable. It's 2 1/2 to 3 hours to put that on.
GROSS: Your new movie ""Lonesome Jim"" - you play the father in a nuclear family - husband, wife, two sons. And I'm thinking that must be very exotic to you, in a way, because you never really had that kind of nuclear family. Well, I guess maybe you had it as an adult, but you certainly didn't have it as a boy. Does the idea of, like, a real nuclear family seem somewhat exotic to you?
CASSEL: Well, it - I thought being as crazy as I was and knowing that very early - I was my own source of entertainment. When I had my own family - and I still do it with my grandchildren - I created the craziness that my kids grew up around in LA - The Rolling Stones, you know, and Jimi Hendrix and Cassavetes and all this. And their father was a bit crazy, but he loved them very much because it was what I never had. And I was grateful to have it.
Playing a straight family and a guy like that - people suppress themselves, and they get comfortable with a specific way of life. And they don't take chances anymore. And I've - I just knew from 3, 4, 5, 6 years old that life is a chance, and everything you do in it is. And, you know, I wasn't going to climb up the side of a tenement until I was sure I could make it.
You know, and then we'd go up that brick that sticks out on the edge of a - on 42nd Street - on those buildings. We'd go up to the roof. There were only about three of us that could do that when I was, you know, 8. And a new kid would move in, and we'd, you know, say, hey, can you climb? Yes. Come on. Try - he'd get stuck a floor and a half up, and we got to call the firetrucks to come and rescue him, you know? But, I mean, that's - that was kids here. So I was always an adventurer, you know?
And to play this character that I played in ""Lonesome Jim"" - to play Don - I met the guy, and I met his wife. And to play someone like that - it was tough for me to be that quiet, you know? And I understood who he was. And it's just the safe way, and I've never done anything safe.
GROSS: Well, Seymour Cassel, thank you so much.
CASSEL: Thank you.

'Game Of Thrones' Keeps Its Finger On The Pulse As It Enters The Home Stretch,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712274776/game-of-thrones-keeps-its-finger-on-the-pulse-as-it-enters-the-home-stretch?station=KXJZ_FM,"Over the years, the HBO series has risen from being a nifty potboiler to a timely expression of a zeitgeist that contests everything from gender roles to climate change to immigration.
TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. As everyone has surely heard by now, on Sunday night, HBO will begin airing the final season of ""Game Of Thrones"" - a show with a huge and fanatical international fan base. Although HBO hasn't made any episodes available for screening, our critic at large, John Powers, couldn't resist talking about why it's a show that defines our era.
JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: When ""Game Of Thrones"" premiered eight years ago this month, I was skeptical. I mean, who wanted to see a ""Dungeon & Dragons"" epic loosely based on the 15th century War of the Roses? Then I watched the first episode, which built to the most shocking ending I'd ever seen on TV. A knight who's been caught making love to his own sister pushes a 10-year-old boy from a hundred-foot tower. That got my attention, and obviously not just mine.
As it starts down the homestretch on Sunday, this HBO franchise has become the world's most popular show. Some journalists are even writing elegiac articles about how, given our fragmented media environment, ""Game Of Thrones"" may be the last TV series that everyone watches at the same time in order to be part of the conversation.
It's easy to understand its popularity. Set on the imaginary continent of Westeros, invented by novelist George R. R. Martin, ""Game Of Thrones"" tells a juicy story of heroic knights, canny eunuchs, religious fanatics, psychopathic kings, fire-breathing dragons, savage wars, strong women, naked women and men whose castration anxiety is caused by actual castration.
All this lurid stuff is deftly orchestrated by series creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who give us a changing world of changing characters. For instance, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's handsome, villainous Jaime Lannister - he's the one who pushes the little boy off the tower - gradually develops a complicated moral sense.
Over the years, ""Game Of Thrones"" has risen from being a nifty potboiler to a timely expression of a zeitgeist that contests everything from gender to climate change to immigration. Heck, Westeros even has a big wall to keep out aliens. It's become so much of our cultural lingua franca that when liberals compare Donald Trump to King Joffrey or conservatives compare Hillary Clinton to Cersei Lannister, they assume you know what they mean.
Of course, like any truly great piece of pop entertainment, the show doesn't make an obvious political statement. It is a stew of energizing contradictions. In fact, it sometimes feels like a strange collaboration between Dick Cheney and Rachel Maddow. The world it depicts is Cheneyesque (ph) in its doom-laden vision of life as a dog-eat-dog struggle for power. Without power, the show suggests, you are nothing, and your ideals are pointless. Without strong authority, there is chaos.
At the same time, the series is shot through with a jaunty Maddowesque (ph) liberalism, a belief that not only is compassion possible, but that the most compassionate people are apt to be outsiders - the debauched but honorable dwarf Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, who gets the show's best lines; Kit Harrington's bastard Jon Snow, who is literally resurrected to help save the world; and Emilia Clarke's Daenerys Targaryen, who, after being forced to marry a hunky barbarian, mothers three dragons and becomes the slave-freeing Khaleesi who offers potential followers a rather steely vision of freedom, as we can hear in this speech from last season.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""GAME OF THRONES"")
EMILIA CLARKE: (As Daenerys Targaryen) I'm not here to murder, and all I want to destroy is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it. Or refuse and die.
POWERS: From the show's beginnings, we've heard dark mutterings that winter is coming - the show's obvious analogue to climate change - and with it, the arrival of the White Walkers, humanoid ice creatures that will slaughter everyone in their path. And season after season, we've watched this existential threat be ignored by leaders and would-be leaders, sunk in their smaller obsessions with revenge, family, sadistic pleasure and, of course, personal power.
In the upcoming episodes, the main characters will face the consequences of such carelessness, and ""Game Of Thrones'"" true vision will finally reveal itself. Will Westeros be saved by the alliance between Jon Snow and the mother of dragons? Will Cersei truly join with others to fight the army of death, or will she still be scheming? And, if the latter, who will finally kill her?
The smart money is on her brother and lover, Jaime. I'm not kidding. There are already gambling pools on who will live and who won't. That's because the series' great narrative strength has always been its ruthlessness. With most shows, you know who's safe. Don Draper isn't going to die in Season 2 of ""Mad Men."" But here, you don't.
Major characters have been killed off every season, and we know that some of our favorites will die this time out. In fact, what makes the show special is that, given the Hobbesian reality of Westeros, we can't be completely sure they won't all die. Naturally, I don't hope that this will happen, but I do find it exciting that, for once, it just might.
GROSS: John Powers is our critic-at-large. We want to congratulate our classical music critic, Lloyd Schwartz, who is also a poet, and just received a Guggenheim Fellowship in poetry.

Isabella Vosmikova/HBO ""I knew that I wanted to act since I was old enough to reason,"" says Henry Winkler. ""I never had a Plan B. I never deviated. I never thought that there was anything else that I could possibly do in this world except to try and be a working actor.""
After Winkler graduated with an M.F.A. from the Yale School of Drama in 1970, one of his earliest roles was as the cool, leather-jacket-wearing Fonz on the classic sitcom Happy Days, which ran from 1974 until 1984.
It was an iconic role — but the typecasting was tough to shake: ""It took me maybe eight years after the Fonz to really get a good acting role,"" Winkler says.
Pop Culture Happy Hour A Contract Killer Walks Into An Acting Class, On HBO's 'Barry' Arts & Life Bill Hader On Sketch Comedy, His Love Of Old Films Eventually, Winkler was able to move on. He appeared for decades in movies and TV shows, including recurring comic roles in Parks and Recreation and Arrested Development. In 2018, he won a best supporting actor Emmy for his role on the HBO series Barry.
On Barry, Winkler plays a self-important acting teacher to a hitman played by Bill Hader. Winkler draws on his own experiences — both as an actor and a teacher — for the role.
""A lot of acting teachers, they talk about breaking bad habits, they talk about breaking you down, and I totally get that,"" he says. ""But I've taught four classes in my life and I think you can get an actor to move off their position without making them feel like poop from a whale at the bottom of the ocean.""
Interview Highlights On doing commercials early in his career
Sanka coffee, which was a decaffeinated coffee. American Airlines. H&R Block taxes. Gleem toothpaste, which is the whitening toothpaste. At the time, I had really nice teeth. Like that, and on and on, I got great at getting commercials and I didn't have to do another job to make ends meet. I made my living and I could do plays for free at the Manhattan Theatre Club at night. ...
Everybody I went to Yale with said, ""I don't know how you can do commercials; we are trained for theater."" Except that the money I made from commercials allowed me to go to California for a month and be able to survive, and within two weeks I got Happy Days .
On learning he had dyslexia at age 31
[I found out] after my stepson was tested, because he was so verbal, and he is so smart, but he couldn't do reports. He couldn't write. He couldn't organize his thoughts. And when we had him tested, everything that they said about Jed was true about me, and I realized ... ""I actually have something with a name."" ...
Author Interviews Dyslexia Made Henry Winkler Feel 'Stupid' For Years. Now, He's A Best-Selling Author The first thing, I got very angry, because all of the arguments in my house with the short Germans — who were my parents — were for naught. All of the grounding was for naught. Like, I couldn't go to the dance on Friday night because ... my grades were horrible. ... I now understand, possibly, if I didn't fight through my dyslexia I would not be sitting at this microphone chatting with you. ...
The reading is still difficult for me. When we did Happy Days, I embarrassed myself for 10 years reading around that table with the producers, the other actors, the director, all of the department heads. On Monday morning, we read the scripts. I stumbled over every word. I was completely embarrassed.
On his dyslexia now
We're sitting around the table and sometimes people who sit next to me have to point out that I have dropped a line, that I just missed it on the page, and I'm sitting there thinking, ""Oh my God! I wonder whose line it is?"" There's a big silence here. It turns out it's me! I'm still embarrassed. And not only that, but also I want to be perfect, and I hate when I miss the timing, or I screw another actor's timing up because I have screwed the line up so badly, or I have to go back again. Ugh, I hate it. Sometimes I just — I hate my brain.
On his family leaving Germany during World War II
My father knew that it was time. He got a six-week visa from Germany to come and do work in New York but was expected to come right back. ... He took his mother's jewelry, bought a box of chocolate, melted the chocolate down, put the pieces of jewelry in the chocolate box, poured the chocolate over the jewelry [and] put the box under his arm. So when he was stopped by the Nazis, and they said, ""Are you taking anything of value out of Germany? Now you can open every bag?"" — we've got nothing.
The jewelry that he encased in chocolate he sold when he came out of Ellis Island into New York, and was able to start a new life here, slowly but surely. I have the actual letters from the government each time my father requested to stay a little longer, and they would say yes. And I was born, and thank God, because I love our country.

Lauren A. Terrazas/Texas Public Radio World-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma brought his Bach Project to the sister cities of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, on Saturday. The ""Day of Action"" featured performances in both cities to celebrate the relationship between the two communities.
Ma played the opening notes of Johann Sebastian Bach's Suite No. 1 for Unaccompanied Cello in a park next to the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge, one of the crossings that connect the U.S. and Mexican cities.
The Laredo performance took place on an elevated stage before an audience of officials and onlookers. Concerns over possible rain disappeared as Ma began to play in the morning sunshine.
Texas Public Radio via YouTube It was part of his Bach Project, which uses the composer's 300-year-old music to explore connections between cultures. The project has taken Ma all over the world. On Friday it brought him to Laurie Auditorium at Trinity University in San Antonio, and on Saturday it brought him to Laredo, within a few feet of the Rio Grande.
""As you all know, as you did and do and will do, in culture, we build bridges, not walls,"" he said. After his performance, he gestured to the bridge to his right. ""I've lived my life at the borders. Between cultures. Between disciplines. Between musics. Between generations.""
Mateo Bailey, 16, lives in San Antonio. He grew up in El Paso, plays the cello and is the son of Grammy Award-winning cellist Zuill Bailey.
He felt Ma's performance had special significance ""because this event is on the border. And I'm half-Mexican as well as half-American ... and for him to connect cello with what's happening in the world is like, it's a cultural bridge that was just built, and it's amazing.""
Betty DeLeon praised the cellist for visiting. ""It speaks of him. What a wonderful human being to take his time and come to our tiny little town to share the importance of culture. On the border. It's amazing. It's a privilege to be a part of this.""
Pete Saenz, mayor of Laredo, said that despite the river and despite the bridge spanning overhead, the border is one community.
""And although people may perceive us as being so different, we're not,"" he said. ""Here the border is extremely unique in that it's one organism. I've always said we're interdependent, interconnected. We survived because the border side survives, especially here on the border area.""
Tiny Desk Yo-Yo Ma: Tiny Desk Concert This Day of Action also included a performance in Plaza Juarez in Nuevo Laredo, a few blocks from the international crossing. Its overall theme was an appreciation for the connections between the two cities, which see themselves as one community.
Ma was originally scheduled to play on the actual bridge, which would have been briefly closed. The planned closure would have been a collaborative effort between officials and residents on both sides of the border. But the traffic and pedestrian delays that the performance would have caused convinced officials to move the locale to the Tres Laredos Park right next to the bridge.
The famous cellist has studied and performed the German composer's music for six decades.
In 2018, Ma set out on a two-year journey to perform Bach's six suites for solo cello in 36 locations around the world. He believes the music has an ability to connect cultures and humanity from all walks of life. He said that this is what motivated him to launch the project."
"Viral Stars, The 'Syncopated Ladies,' Shake Up Tap Dancing",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097764/viral-stars-the-syncopated-ladies-shake-up-tap-dancing,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with tap dancer Chloe Arnold, of the Syncopated Ladies, about their viral dance videos and annual tap festival.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Finally today, let's talk about tap dance. And we're not talking about politicians trying to get out of answering hard questions. And we're not even talking about another image you might have of old guys in tuxedos from the 1940s. No, we're talking about the Syncopated Ladies, an all-female tap squad that has become an Internet sensation for their tight moves set to popular music, think Prince and Beyonce.
(SOUNDBITE OF SYNCOPATED LADIES PERFORMANCE)
MARTIN: You might have caught them on the TV show ""So You Think You Can Dance"" or featured on Beyonce's home page. Two sisters, Maud and Chloe Arnold, founded the group. They're here in Washington, D.C., this weekend for their annual concert and showcase. So we thought this was a good time to hear more about the group and how they're changing the look of tap.
And Chloe Arnold is with us now to represent both sisters. And she's with us now. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
CHLOE ARNOLD: Thank you Michel. I'm so, so happy to be here. And I'm really excited to talk about tap dancing.
MARTIN: And thanks for taking time out of a really busy schedule of master classes and all the things that you're doing. As I mentioned, this is your hometown. How did you get started in tap dancing? Was it, like, the usual you had too much energy, so mom put you in a class?
ARNOLD: Well, my mom did dance for fun when she was growing up. And so it was something that she wanted to just share with her kids. And then she saw that we were really loving it. And so she started to seek out more opportunities.
MARTIN: What is it that you think you love about tap?
ARNOLD: I think that, for me, when you're tap dancing, you are a musician and a dancer. And what I love about tap is you can, you know, it's percussive, so you can do it to any kind of music. And I have a broad taste of music. So it allows me to lock into any pocket and to really express myself.
And there's an element of improvisation within tap that fits my personality well because I love to improvise and freestyle and make things up in the moment.
MARTIN: And I noticed that after college, you formed a dance company with your sister, Maud. And I wondered what made you think this could be a career because, you know, frankly, tap isn't something that - well, when you were kind of developing the form, it isn't something that you saw a lot of except on - say, on period pieces, on Broadway...
ARNOLD: Correct.
MARTIN: ...You know like - you know, or, you know, or The Rockettes, which is just, you know, not everybody's cup of tea. So what made you think that you could kind of take this someplace?
ARNOLD: So when we were growing up here in D.C., an incredible woman, Debbie Allen, came and we got to be in a play of hers at the Kennedy Center. And so that was my first initial thing of seeing a black woman of excellence be able to shape her own way. And it gave me the confidence that I could do the same.
And so then I actually went to Columbia University. And I studied film. And I thought to myself you know how I'm going to do this? I'm going to put tap dance in TV, music videos and film. And so the way that Syncopated Ladies started to make our imprint was to show people the way that I imagined our art, meaning full of black girl magic, full of rhythm, syncopation, body, curves. We say fierce footwork with a female force.
And so when we're creating, you know, what I was seeing when I was in college in New York was there were just not really any roles for African-American women in tap dance. If you were going to be on Broadway, it's all chorus girls, which means a line of women, and you really have to - at that time - fit into that line, right? And my body type with curves and - there's just not a lot of black women, and they're definitely not curvy women.
MARTIN: There's just so many - a couple things I wanted to dig into. Like, first of all, one of the things that I saw at your shows is exactly the point that you just made. One of the things that really struck me is there was every kind of person in it. There was young people. There were kids. There were older. They were every race. And they were all different kinds of body types...
ARNOLD: Yes.
MARTIN: ...And one of the biggest applauses went to a larger-sized woman - frankly, not the type of body type that I think most people associate with professional dance. And it was just, you know, it was just kind of eye opening. And I was wondering how your philosophy around this came about, that not just that anybody could take your classes, but that people with all these different body types can perform?
ARNOLD: Yes, the woman that you're speaking of, she was our student from when she was 10-years-old. And when she came first to us, she did have self-doubt and was under the lens and microscope of not fitting in. And we literally have worked with her over the past 10 years to get her to a place where she can walk on that stage in that bright yellow shirt shining whereas before as a kid, she would been hiding. And so it takes time. And it takes effort. And it takes, like, a vision that you see - again, the deeper excellence in a human. And that is the part that makes artists amazing. It's not being cookie cutter.
MARTIN: Well, also, your work is being recognized. I mean, you earned an Emmy nomination for your work on ""The Late Late Show With James Corden."" Congratulations for that.
ARNOLD: Thank you. Thank you so much.
MARTIN: But I also - tell us about the episode that you choreographed. It just sounds crazy.
ARNOLD: Oh, my God. So first of all, I love James Corden. I love ""The Late Late Show"" because it is literally unlimited adventure. You know, this particular one is called Crosswalk Musical. And this one was with Hugh Jackman, Zendaya and Zac Efron and James Corden in the crosswalk on Broadway in New York City with a cast of 16 dancers. And we put on basically 40 second musicals in the crosswalk.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN"")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) The people ride in a hole in the ground. New York, New York, it's a hell of a town. Cars, cars, cars. Wow. Wow.
ARNOLD: And it is absolutely hysterical. And people ask me all the time, is that real? And it is totally real. We are literally in the street during the time that the light is red. We put on a musical. And when they are running, they are running because the light is going to change.
MARTIN: That is crazy. That sounded crazy.
ARNOLD: It is absolutely nuts. And it's so fun. And it's really been great for dance and for art to just again, expand the creativity and create more opportunity.
MARTIN: Well, you certainly are expanding, I think, people's vision of what tap can be. Finally, before I let you go, what do you think it is that we still like about tap? As I said that for people whose only vision of it is like, you know, The Rockettes - no disrespect to The Rockettes - you know, or the Hines brothers back in the day, I mean, Savion Glover, of course. So I mean, maybe people will have seen him. But what is it that you think we still like about it because one of the things, again, that was fascinating about your showcase is that all kinds of people were there. There was every kind of person there - all ages, all races, all, you know, what is it that you think we still like about it?
ARNOLD: Well, artistically speaking, you know, percussion is mesmerizing. I mean, the drum is the essence, honestly, of the heartbeat. It is from - it is the origin - original African expression and music. So the drum and that idea that our feet are, you know, we are the drum in our physicality our oral and visual presentation. And I think that that is just honestly an innate human connection that people have.
So I think that rhythm is what draws everyone together. And I think, though, then the part that keeps you is style because then the style is reflective of the individual person's journey and experience and culture and where they come from. And then that, again, captivates different people based around their own life experience.
MARTIN: That is the Emmy nominated choreographer and dancer Chloe Arnold. She's the co-founder with her sister of Syncopated Ladies. And she's teaching and performing this weekend in Washington, D.C., at the D.C. Tap Festival. And Chloe Arnold, thank you so much for talking with us.
ARNOLD: Thank you for having me. I love NPR. And I really, really appreciate being here.

NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Abderrahim Foukara, Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C. bureau chief, about the recent regime changes in Algeria and Sudan.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Over the course of just two weeks, two longtime autocratic rulers have been driven from power - Omar al-Bashir in Sudan and Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algeria. In both cases, the question now is, what comes next? And will these countries see full regime change or just more of the same? We wanted to take up that question with Abderrahim Foukara. He's the Washington, D.C., bureau chief of Al Jazeera, and he's with us in our studios now in Washington, D.C., to help us understand the regional picture.
Abderrahim, thanks so much for joining us.
ABDERRAHIM FOUKARA: Thank you, Michel.
MARTIN: So how do you understand what's happening in the region right now?
FOUKARA: Well, I understand it as a continuation of what started happening way back in 2011. A lot of governments in the region thought that at some point after 2011, things started to go back to normal. But obviously, many of the reasons why we had the 2011 uprisings in the first place have not been solved. And obviously, everyone in the region, whether they are peoples or governments - they're watching to see where the region goes to from here in light of what's happening in Sudan and Algeria.
MARTIN: And what do you think message the demonstrators are drawing from the events of 2011 - and also, what message you think the governing bodies are drawing from the events of 2011? Because, for example, in Sudan, the defense minister has said that a military council will rule for the next two years before any democratic elections are held. You know, it's hard to see that the protesters will find that acceptable. So I'm just wondering what you see. Like, what are both sides drawing from the sort of recent past about what the path forward should be?
FOUKARA: The protesters in Sudan - they say they've learned a lot from what happened way back in 2011. They've learned not to trust the military. They've learned to say that the military's role is basically to secure the border and to maintain stability - not to run the people's affairs. To what extent will the military in Sudan and the militaries throughout the region actually watching what's happening in Sudan will be convinced by that remains to be seen.
MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit more about what the roots of this are? Because I think many people with even a cursory understanding of the region will know that these leaders have been in power for many, many years, that economic stagnation has been the rule, not the exception. So what are the sparks? Like, what is it that finally caused people to say, enough?
FOUKARA: Well, I mean, in the case of Sudan, the Sudanese, they've had two revolutions. They had one in the '60s, and they had one in the '80s. And in each one of those, obviously, the developments yielded a civilian government, but then the military took over. The protesters - they tried to avoid that same fate for a third time. Life is hard in Sudan, as it is in many other parts of the Middle East and Africa. Prices are high. Bread is not always easy to come by. Salaries are very low. There's a lot of unemployment. There's a youth bulge. Not many jobs are available. And add to that the issue of freedoms. A lot of people are in jail. A lot of people have been in jail in Sudan and other parts of the region.
This spark, obviously, this time round was bread, higher - high bread prices. You know, the government was squeezed for funds - although its critics are saying there's a lot of corruption, that there's a lot of money that's been embezzled and stolen. But here we are. Now Bashir is gone. A military council has taken its place, and the Sudanese are trying to fumble the next step into their future.
MARTIN: And what about in Algeria? What about with Bouteflika? I mean, he's been suffering health problems. He hasn't been visible. What is the spark there?
FOUKARA: There are similar reasons in terms of the hardships of daily life. And in the case of Algeria, the spark was that the former president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who to all intents and purposes - I mean, when you see him in - on TV, he's in a wheelchair. He doesn't always seem to be conscious. And yet, it was announced that he was going to run for a fifth term. Algerians took to the street to say no. We cannot have that. He must be just a puppet. There are other players behind him trying to manipulate the situation for their own advantage. That's how it started.
MARTIN: In each of these cases, in Sudan and in Algeria, is there a sort of an opposition figure like we've seen in Venezuela, for example, where Juan Guaido has sort of - has become recognized as the face of the opposition - like, the preferred leader? Is that the case in either of these places?
FOUKARA: That has been a unique characteristic of all these revolutions throughout North Africa and the Middle East since 2011. They have not actually produced a particular figurehead, so to speak, to lead them. And maybe that was done by design because the people who have risen against their governments - they don't always trust the conventional opposition, and they often feel that it's in cahoots with the regime that they're trying to topple.
But we have seen the downside of that in terms of these protesters needing somebody to rally around and, you know, make their word heard much more forcefully than it would have been otherwise. In the specific case of Sudan, that's also - definitely that has been the case of a lot of protests, a lot of protesters, but so far, we haven't seen one person who can take all these events and galvanize them to actually help push for change. And the opinion is different whether that's a good thing or or a bad thing. It depends who from the protesters you talk to.
MARTIN: And so, finally, what is the U.S. role in all this? Or how has the U.S. responded? I mean, in recent years, you know, obviously, Sudan has been an international pariah because of its treatment of the - because of its conduct in Darfur, the military's conduct in Darfur. But the U.S. has been cooperating with Sudan on intelligence in recent years. So what's the U.S. role now? Or how is the U.S. responding?
FOUKARA: Well, the stakes for the U.S. in all these places are very high. They are higher in Sudan than they are in Algeria, for example. Algeria is much more tied to France and so on. In the case of Sudan, there's the issue of Darfur. There's the issue of relations between North Sudan and the young South Sudan. And, you know, the U.S. was very supportive of the independence of South Sudan.
But there's also the issue of terrorism, and the U.S. is very invested in that. Sudan was under sanctions, but the U.S. did get to a point where it was working with Bashir very closely in combating terrorism. So it's obviously a very complex situation. Sudan is a central country to different regional groupings and central to a lot of issues that are of interest to various players, including the United States.
MARTIN: That's Abderrahim Foukara. He is the bureau chief of news for Al Jazeera in Washington, D.C., and he was kind of to join us in our studios in Washington, D.C.
Abderrahim, thanks so much for talking to us once again.

Following the re-election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Nadine Epstein, editor-in-chief of Moment Magazine, about the American Jewish community's impact on Israeli politics.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
In Israel this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won re-election for his fourth consecutive term, his fifth term overall. And as the campaign unfolded, we heard about Netanyahu's imprint on Israeli politics over the years. But we found ourselves interested in what may have an influence on him. Specifically, we were wondering if the American Jewish community remains an important factor in his point of view.
For that perspective, we're joined in our studios by Nadine Epstein. She's editor-in-chief and CEO of Moment Magazine. It's a magazine that was co-founded in 1975 by the late Nobel Peace Prize human rights activist and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. And Nadine Epstein is here with us in our studios now. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
NADINE EPSTEIN: Thank you.
MARTIN: Could you just describe historically what the relationship has been, say, in recent years over the last, say, 15 or 20 years between the American Jewish community and Israeli politics overall? I mean, did Americans - see themselves as influential, were they influential?
EPSTEIN: I think American Jews saw themselves as very influential on Israel, and they were part of the building of the whole Zionist enterprise for decades. And this changed dramatically really over the last 10 years in part after Benjamin Netanyahu was elected again for his second term in 2007. He had been prime minister also for three years in the 1990s. And what happened in Israel was a new kind of - more religious messianic Zionism began to take root which was much more supportive of settlements. And it was a different kind of Zionism than I think most American Jews are comfortable with.
MARTIN: It's my understanding that the majority of American Jews lean Democratic, and yet we see that President Trump has made an aggressive effort to reach out to conservative Jewish people. He's also made an effort to reach out to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Benjamin Netanyahu has reached back to him. How is that being perceived in the American Jewish community? How is that understood?
EPSTEIN: It depends on where you are in the Jewish - American Jewish community. And you'll see that the 25 percent of Jews who are on the right are now embracing the Netanyahu government. And then you'll see the 75 percent of people voting Democrat are very uncomfortable not with Israel but with the policies of the Netanyahu government.
And that's very important to make that distinction because I think the vast majority of Americans are all very supportive of Israel. And certainly the vast majority of American Jews care deeply about Israel. But what has happened as the bigger picture has changed, you see more and more American Jews in the middle, feeling disaffected, feeling less connected with Israel. That's something very concerning in the American Jewish community.
MARTIN: Now that Donald Trump's aides have leaked that the president is expected to release a peace plan once the prime minister forms a coalition government, as he is expected to do, how do you see that playing out among the American Jewish community?
EPSTEIN: Well, first of all, the new concern is that right before the election, that Netanyahu brought up annexation. And that has sent shivers through much of the American Jewish community. You see a number of high-ranking members of Congress who are actually normally very close to AIPAC speaking out against annexation. You see center-establishment organizations very concerned and publicly speaking out against annexation. So annexation is sort of like the new fear among, I think, many in the Jewish community. And again, I'm speaking for the middle, not so much for the right or for the left here.
MARTIN: So do people feel less connected to Israel than they had been in the past? I mean, do they feel less welcome there?
EPSTEIN: I wouldn't say that they feel less welcome there, but there's definitely been a long process now of disaffection. And I actually just interviewed Ehud Barak, former prime minister of Israel. I spoke to him before the election, and he was voicing what I hear all the time from Israeli leaders and Israelis, that young American Jews no longer feel the same kind of connection that young Jews and different generations felt towards Israel. And studies show that that is true. But there's another element that
I think many people like Barak and also other Israelis are missing and that there are many middle-aged and elderly American Jews who are also feeling disaffected and who have just had to step back because this has been going on so long. And they're so disappointed. And they just don't feel that connection to Israel that they once did. And in the long term, the American Jewish community doesn't want any of that. In the long term, Israel doesn't want that. There is a really important connection between the American Jewish community and Israel. And it's a very important one for Israel. And it's a very important one for American Jews. We don't want to lose that.
MARTIN: That's Nadine Epstein, editor-in-chief and CEO of Moment Magazine. She's also the author of the new book ""Elie Wiesel, An Extraordinary Life And Legacy."" She was kind of to join us our studios in Washington, D.C. Nadine Epstein, thank you so much for joining us.

Robert W. Lee tells NPR's Michel Martin what it's like to grapple with the legacy of his ancestor, Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He wrote about this in a memoir, ""A Sin by Any Other Name.""
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
In the South, the name Robert E. Lee is everywhere. Schools, parks, streets, entire counties bear the name of the leader of the Confederate Army during the Civil War. More recently, statues in his honor have been at the center of heated debates including in Charlottesville, Va., where the statue was the purported emphasis for the white supremacist rally there in 2017.
My next guest is also a Robert Lee - the Reverend Robert W. Lee. He is the nephew of the famous general many generations removed and grew up with reverence for him. He still has that reverence, but he's also grappling with the meaning of his legacy. And he's urging others, specifically others who share that heritage, to do the same.
He offers his thoughts about all this in a new book, ""A Sin By Any Other Name: Reckoning With Racism And The Heritage Of The South."" And he's with us now from WFAE in Charlotte, N.C. Reverend Lee, welcome. Thank you so much for talking to us.
ROBERT W LEE: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So you talk in the book about the first time that you learned you were related to Robert E. Lee from a picture hanging in your grandmother's house. Do you remember, you know, what that felt like when you heard about this, when you learned this?
LEE: I think in the South, there is a certain reverence, as you said, and a certain awe for the man named Robert E. Lee. Regardless of what you think of him and what he did, he is a staple of Southern culture. And so when I found out that I was related to him, and a close relation at that, it was as if my world had been shaken in the best way possible. It's like told - being told you're related to a celebrity down here.
MARTIN: One of the things about your book that I like is that, you know, what we often as journalists report on history as these big cataclysmic moments, right? But you describe, like, a series of smaller, quieter moments that influenced your thinking. Could you just talk a little bit about how your image of him first became complicated or more nuanced?
LEE: I grew up under the care of a nurse named Janie Bowman (ph) who really cared for me. She was a woman of color. She was someone who was 60, 70 years my senior at the time that I met her. And she would cook me sausage. She would take me for a walk. She would read the Psalms to me.
But she also understood that down here in the south, even in the 1990s when I was a kid, Jim Crow still lived. And so she wouldn't eat after me. She wouldn't use the same utensils or the same glasses that we had at my house because it was Robert Lee's house. You don't do that. That was just her understanding of the Jim Crow South at the time. And I've struggled with that ever since, this reality that I bear a name that has caused such pain not only for people that I love, but for this nation as well.
MARTIN: But you still went to an all-white Christian academy - right? - one of those seg academies that was set up specifically to avoid the court-ordered desegregation of the public school system there, right? Did you ever ask about that? Did you ever wonder, like, why?
LEE: To this day, I still wonder why. And it was an all right school. They were nice to me. But we had lunch catered from outside venues - from fast food joints or from the local Japanese restaurant while our friends over at Statesville Middle School were eating lunches that probably shouldn't have been eaten by anyone.
So this was a dichotomy and a juxtaposition that I still live with to this day. And I hope and pray that this book will give us a chance to reconcile those realities.
MARTIN: In the book, the events in Charlottesville in 2017 were a turning point for you. That's when the - of course, I think most people will remember that these white nationalists were marching through the city. And it purportedly started as a protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. And then of course, the activist young woman Heather Heyer was killed. A number of people were injured.
The fact that reverence for Robert E. Lee allegedly was at the center of that chaos and violence, was that something that was transformative for you?
LEE: It broke my heart. I've had the opportunity to befriend Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer who was killed in Charlottesville. And when my book came out, she said, stay strong. Keep the faith and keep fighting. And that gave me a lot of hope because if she can reconcile with herself the fact that my ancestor's statue caused this problem, then we can work together still. We can still confront racism as we do together with her foundation, the Heather Heyer Foundation. We can do this.
MARTIN: I'm wondering if - I don't think you have kids yet, you and your wife. But if you should have a son, what are you thinking about - Emmett? I don't know. What - Bill? Is Robert still on the table?
LEE: Well, I can tell you - and my wife - first of all, for all of you who are worried, my wife gave me permission to say this - we are not going to name our child Robert Lee if we have a boy. We are going to end it here because for us, the weight of this name is growing as people seek to create a racist reality. People are venerating this name instead of living into it as a sinful past.
So my wife and I have thought about Elliott, which is the middle name of my mentor who preached my ordination service. We've thought about a few different names. But those are some that come to mind. And we just want to have a future filled with hope, not one filled with a past that is deeply broken.
MARTIN: Well, good luck. Keep us posted on all of those developments if you don't mind. All right.
LEE: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

Barbershop: The Curious Case Of Julian Assange,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097734/barbershop-the-curious-case-of-julian-assange,"In the Barbershop, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Margaret Sullivan and former CIA deputy director John McLaughlin about whether Julian Assange's actions are heroic or treacherous.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to begin the program today by taking another look at the arrest of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. The details on the optics of the arrest Thursday were certainly dramatic - a bearded Assange dragged from Ecuador's Embassy in London after nearly seven years inside. Demonstrators and op-ed writers rallied to his defense while critics leaked negative details about everything from his hygiene to his cat.
Apart from all of that, though, Assange's actions and his arrest raise serious questions about the seriousness of the accusations against Assange and what the response should be. And these are questions, it has to be said, that divide journalists and national security experts, so we've decided to take this up in our weekly Barbershop because this is where we talk to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds. And for this conversation, we've called upon Margaret Sullivan, media columnist with The Washington Post. She's with us from New York City.
Margaret, thanks so much for joining us once again.
MARGARET SULLIVAN: Thanks, Michel. Nice to be with you again.
MARTIN: And John McLaughlin is the former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He's been kind enough to join us from Virginia.
Mr. McLaughlin, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us as well.
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Hi, Michel.
MARTIN: So I think most people know who care about this or the basic facts - the government says that Assange conspired with former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a classified Defense Department password, and he was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
Now, Margaret, you are clear that journalists are divided about this, saying on the one hand, some people think that he engaged in, you know, reckless, thoughtless behavior, but that others say that while he may be a bit radical about his position about government transparency, at his core, he is a publisher who takes a position for the sake of government accountability, and thus he should be afforded protection. Would it be fair to say that that's the direction you lean on this?
SULLIVAN: Well, you know, I guess my stance on this is a little - it's a little bit in between those things. I don't actually see Julian Assange at this point of his career or his life as a journalist. I don't think we can call him a journalist. I think we can say that Wikileaks is a publisher. He may be all of those negative things that you said. He may be reckless. He may have done bad things.
My concern is that in going after him and indicting him and prosecuting him, what happens within that is that regular journalists - you know, legitimate journalists - will also suffer the consequences because many of the sort of methods that have been identified in the indictment are things - are actually best practices for national security journalists and others around the country and around the world.
MARTIN: Well, give an example.
(CROSSTALK)
MARTIN: You did write a whole column about this, so I would refer people to it. But just give me an example of what you think he did that legitimate journalists also do besides publish things that other people don't want them to see. Because some of - you know...
SULLIVAN: He protected...
MARTIN: Some journalists say no - say that, you know, hacking into things, inducing somebody else to hack into a classified entity - that is not something other journalists would do.
SULLIVAN: Right. This doesn't - this is not, in my mind, a judgment on whether we like Julian Assange or what he has revealed. It's not at all that. The question is, in pursuing this, are we going to criminalize best practices that journalists use - such as using encryption, such as source protection, such as asking a source for information?
MARTIN: OK. Mr. McLaughlin, what about you? You say - you've written about this as well, and you said that you don't consider Assange's activity journalism for a number of reasons. You say his main target is the United States, not corruption more broadly. Others have written about the fact that he had ample opportunity to publish information about Russia's activities in Ukraine, for example, and didn't do so. So what do you say about all this?
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, that's the main point, Michel. The fact that - I don't see him as a legitimate journalist because a couple of reasons. First, it isn't just that he published material that people don't want to see published. That's not really the issue. If he actually conspired to help break into a Pentagon computer, that's not something a legitimate journalist does.
Also, when he gave this material to mainstream journalists, my understanding from what I've heard said by people who worked with him is that many people wanted to take out material that would have endangered the lives of Afghans and Iraqis who had given information to the United States about al-Qaida, for example. And he didn't want to do that, whereas a legitimate journalist will at least listen to that case. And that's basically my objection to him. I don't see him as a legitimate journalist at all.
MARTIN: And what about Margaret's point, though, that by - that arresting him and prosecuting him will have a chilling effect on legitimate journalists who do protect sources and who sometimes do come into possession of materials that governments would not want them to have? What would you say about that?
MARTIN: Well, I don't think journalists should be prosecuted or arrested for those practices, which are all legitimate, freedom of speech practice that we all support. That's not why he will be accused, I think. He not only apparently - we have to find out, give him a fair trial if it gets a trial - might have broken into, helped break into a Pentagon computer. But also, if you look at Robert Mueller's indictments of the 12 Russian GRU officers who were instrumental in interfering in our election, it's quite clear from that and also from what the intelligence community published and declassified in January of 2017 that that dump of documents went to WikiLeaks and - via a couple of online personages that the Russians invented - Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.
So again, I don't know whether that's going to turn out to be something on which he can be legitimately indicted. I just have no idea. But when Mueller's report is fully revealed, we may discover that there's an angle there that goes beyond what we would normally think of a legitimate journalist as doing.
MARTIN: So, Margaret, what about Mr. McLaughlin's point that journalists would engage in some form of test, best balancing test, within their own organization before choosing to publish something? I mean, he in - Mr. McLaughlin in his writing about this said this is more like an intelligence activity. He just sort of threw this information out there. There doesn't seem to have been any discretion, any thought about sort of balancing the public interest in knowing versus the harm that it could do. What do you say about that?
SULLIVAN: Well, I think that Mr. McLaughlin is 100 percent right about that. There was a time earlier on - you know, it's getting to be 10 years ago - when Julian Assange did more of that kind of thing - redacting things that could be problematic or harmful, even, I think, consulting or allowing the information to be worked over by government sources or seen by government sources.
But I think those issues are - they don't go to the heart of my concern. It may well be that Julian Assange is - as I said, is reckless, is a negative force, has done things that have hurt people. I recognize that. However, I am fearful that in going after him - you know, again, going after him in this particular way and casting his method of protecting his source of - this is all in the indictment.
This is part of - you know, seen as part of the so-called conspiracy, that he conspired to protect his source, that he conspired to encrypt information. And again, if those things are seen to be criminal, we're all in big trouble. And, you know, we've suffered a very difficult blow to the kinds of reporting that, you know, that do serve the public interest.
MARTIN: You know, it's interesting because, Mr. McLaughlin, you also expressed ambivalence about prosecuting him. You said that - you know, you were asked if - do you think that the U.S. government could and should charge him for publishing these secrets? And you said, I think it's a close call. You said emotionally, you would say yes, you know. But you also said that you were ambivalent because it's clear that he will seek martyr status. You can already see it. You know, people are going to be...
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...Printing up T-shirts. So tell me more about your feelings about that. Are you saying you really - even though you are a career intelligence officer, you're saying maybe he shouldn't be prosecuted - not because he didn't do wrong in your view but because you think of the effect that it would create among people who support him?
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, my heart tells me yes, but my head tells me no. No, because I don't think we want to conspire in an effort for - that he would like to have us conspire in - for him to be a martyr. And I also take Margaret's point that I don't think anyone here wants to do anything that jeopardizes journalists' ability to keep the security of their sources - after all, intelligence officers have that same interest - and - nor interfere with their ability to encrypt things and so forth.
So if that's part of an indictment, I think prosecutors and defenders will have to work through that to sort of segregate what is it that he can be legitimately charged with here without endangering freedom of speech, the First Amendment or the rights of journalists. I'm all for avoiding those dangers.
Again, my objections are if journalists - legitimate ones - do not conspire to break into government computers, if we condone that, then your computer isn't safe, and my computer isn't safe. And also, when I've had journalists call me when I've been in government with a story that conceivably could harm sources, for example, or could bring harm to other Americans, they would give you a chance to make your case. And sometimes, they would hold parts of a story, and sometimes they wouldn't. You would lose your case sometimes, and sometimes you would win it. And I've done that with major newspapers and found them extremely responsible and recognized the dilemma they struggle with. There was none of that with him.
MARTIN: OK.
MCLAUGHLIN: It was just all out the door. And I think that's to be condemned.
MARTIN: All right. As this case continues, we'll call you both back and ask you both your opinion of it and what you think should happen next and in the future. That was John McLaughlin, former deputy director of the CIA. He's now teaching at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Margaret Sullivan was with us, media columnist with The Washington Post. She's the former public editor for The New York Times.
I thank you both so much for talking with us today.
MCLAUGHLIN: Thanks, Michel.
SULLIVAN: Thanks very much.

Yo-Yo Ma Plays Bach In Shadow Of Texas Border Crossing,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713092703/cellist-yo-yo-ma-plays-bach-in-shadow-of-border-crossing?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Yo-Yo Ma brought his Bach Project to the sister cities of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.

Terrazas/Texas Public Radio Yo-Yo Ma brought his Bach Project to the sister cities of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The project uses the music of Johann Sebastian Bach to explore connections between cultures.
Lauren A. Terrazas/Texas Public Radio World-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma brought his Bach Project to the sister cities of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, on Saturday. The ""Day of Action"" featured performances in both cities to celebrate the relationship between the two communities.
Ma played the opening notes of Johann Sebastian Bach's Suite No. 1 for Unaccompanied Cello in a park next to the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge, one of the crossings that connect the U.S. and Mexican cities.
The Laredo performance took place on an elevated stage before an audience of officials and onlookers. Concerns over possible rain disappeared as Ma began to play in the morning sunshine.
Texas Public Radio via YouTube It was part of his Bach Project, which uses the composer's 300-year-old music to explore connections between cultures. The project has taken Ma all over the world. On Friday it brought him to Laurie Auditorium at Trinity University in San Antonio, and on Saturday it brought him to Laredo, within a few feet of the Rio Grande.
""As you all know, as you did and do and will do, in culture, we build bridges, not walls,"" he said. After his performance, he gestured to the bridge to his right. ""I've lived my life at the borders. Between cultures. Between disciplines. Between musics. Between generations.""
Mateo Bailey, 16, lives in San Antonio. He grew up in El Paso, plays the cello and is the son of Grammy Award-winning cellist Zuill Bailey.
He felt Ma's performance had special significance ""because this event is on the border. And I'm half-Mexican as well as half-American ... and for him to connect cello with what's happening in the world is like, it's a cultural bridge that was just built, and it's amazing.""
Betty DeLeon praised the cellist for visiting. ""It speaks of him. What a wonderful human being to take his time and come to our tiny little town to share the importance of culture. On the border. It's amazing. It's a privilege to be a part of this.""
Pete Saenz, mayor of Laredo, said that despite the river and despite the bridge spanning overhead, the border is one community.
""And although people may perceive us as being so different, we're not,"" he said. ""Here the border is extremely unique in that it's one organism. I've always said we're interdependent, interconnected. We survived because the border side survives, especially here on the border area.""
This Day of Action also included a performance in Plaza Juarez in Nuevo Laredo, a few blocks from the international crossing. Its overall theme was an appreciation for the connections between the two cities, which see themselves as one community.
Ma was originally scheduled to play on the actual bridge, which would have been briefly closed. The planned closure would have been a collaborative effort between officials and residents on both sides of the border. But the traffic and pedestrian delays that the performance would have caused convinced officials to move the locale to the Tres Laredos Park right next to the bridge.
The famous cellist has studied and performed the German composer's music for six decades.
In 2018, Ma set out on a two-year journey to perform Bach's six suites for solo cello in 36 locations around the world. He believes the music has an ability to connect cultures and humanity from all walks of life. He said that this is what motivated him to launch the project."
"Calls For More Police Training On Disabilities Like Autism, Down Syndrome",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/705887493/how-one-mothers-battle-is-changing-police-training-on-disabilities?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Patti Saylor says that after her son Ethan's death in 2013, she realized that police officers need more training in working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Meg Anderson/NPR Working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, like Down syndrome or autism, can be complex and challenging even for those with years of training. But one group — law enforcement — often encounters people with these conditions in high-stress situations, with little or no training at all.
Patti Saylor knows all too well what the consequences of that can be.
Her son Ethan, who had Down syndrome, died after an encounter with law enforcement when he was 26. It's a tragedy she believes could have been prevented.
In January 2013, Ethan went to see the movie Zero Dark Thirty at a mall in Frederick County, Md. Afterward, when his support aide went to get the car, Ethan went back inside to try to see the movie a second time, but he didn't buy a new ticket.
Three off-duty sheriff's deputies, who were working as security guards, confronted him.
""He didn't cooperate, of course,"" Patti Saylor says. ""He didn't want to leave. At that point, I believe, he wouldn't know what was going on.""
According to a civil lawsuit filed by Ethan's parents, the deputies ""tried to drag him from the theater,"" and Ethan ""ended up on the floor with at least one deputy on top of him."" The deputies said Ethan was asked to leave before they took him by the arms. They denied any wrongdoing in the case, which reached a settlement last year .
There on the floor of the movie theater, Ethan stopped breathing. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. His death, from asphyxia, was ruled a homicide . A Frederick County grand jury cleared the deputies of criminal charges.
Ever since, Patti Saylor has been fighting to change the way law enforcement personnel are trained when encountering people like Ethan. She says families like hers — with firsthand knowledge — have a unique perspective.
""We know something the police don't know,"" Patti Saylor says. ""I felt like we needed to teach them, and then hold them accountable.""

Meg Anderson/NPR ""It's not always resistance""
Ethan Saylor's death highlighted the lack of training many law enforcement officers have when it comes to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.
StoryCorps A Mother Of A Son With Autism Thanks A Stranger Who Helped: 'Nobody Does What You Do' Instead, much of their training revolves around how to gain and maintain control of a situation. Police training programs nationwide spend, on average, 168 hours teaching officers about use of force, weapons and defensive tactics, according to the most recent statistics from the Justice Department. That compares with only 10 hours spent on mental illness, for example. For that report, the government did not track the training time devoted to intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Police training often creates the mindset: ""I am the boss. You do what I tell you to do,"" says Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and now a University of South Carolina law professor who studies police regulation. ""And if someone doesn't do what I tell them to do, it is indicative of a potential threat.""
Experts say people with intellectual disabilities may have trouble processing those orders. They may struggle to follow directions or manage emotions.
""It's not always noncompliance. It's not always resistance. Sometimes it's inability,"" Stoughton explains. ""The officer very often will perceive that inability as a refusal.""
Some police training addresses intellectual and developmental disabilities within what is known as crisis intervention training, which largely focuses on mental illness and substance abuse. At least 27 states and the District of Columbia require officers to be taught how to respond to someone with mental health or substance abuse issues, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Stoughton says the skills taught in those types of training — good communication skills, practicing patience, and earning a person's cooperation — may apply when responding to a person with an intellectual or developmental disability.
But, he says, the signs of a mental health crisis don't always apply to someone with this type of disability. Without specific training on these disabilities, he says, an officer might not recognize that they should adjust their behavior.
""Different tools to use on the street""
Six years after Ethan Saylor's death, Maryland has become a leader among states in requiring police training on how to respond to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions adopted the new requirements statewide in 2014. The next year, the state established the Ethan Saylor Alliance , which helps ensure that people with these types of disabilities play a central role in the training.
Two professors at Loyola University Maryland, Lisa Schoenbrodt and Leah Saal, developed one such training. With a state grant , they hired 10 adults with a range of disabilities to role-play common scenarios with police. Last fall, they piloted the class at Prince George's Community College.

Meg Anderson/NPR ""If we can provide a different perspective and give them different tools to use on the street, I just think that's great,"" says Percy Alston, the director of the college's Public Safety and Security Institute.
Alston is responsible for training new and experienced police officers on how responding to people with these disabilities might be different than what officers are used to. He cites one very basic example: A lot of police officers don't like to be touched.
""Once I put my uniform on, I'm like Superman; you can't touch my cape. But there are people with certain disabilities that do like to touch,"" Alston explains. ""So them touching you is not going to be an assault.""
On a Friday morning at the police academy, Alston leads about a dozen officers through the first half of the class, and then the Loyola trainers role-play with some of the officers. In one scenario, trainer Elaina Camacho, who has autism, played a daughter who threatens her mom. Officer Joseph Powell, who works with the Prince George's County public schools, calmed Camacho down by doing something unusual: He asked to play her video game while they talked.
Alston says that moment gets at the heart of what the class is all about. He knows that officers have to think fast and respond quickly, and they must protect their own safety. But when they encounter someone who has an intellectual or developmental disability, they may need to slow down and approach things in a different way.
Patti Saylor believes that could have made the difference for Ethan.
""So many police officers have asked me, what should they have done? And I said, 'Well, you've got to use your bag of tricks,' "" she says. In Ethan's case, ""if you really wanted him to leave, you may have said, 'let's go on out here and get a snack while we wait for your mother.' ""
""There's no magic pixie dust,"" she adds. ""It is relationship."""
"Viral Stars, The 'Syncopated Ladies,' Shake Up Tap Dancing",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097764/viral-stars-the-syncopated-ladies-shake-up-tap-dancing?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with tap dancer Chloe Arnold, of the Syncopated Ladies, about their viral dance videos and annual tap festival.
Finally today, let's talk about tap dance. And we're not talking about politicians trying to get out of answering hard questions. And we're not even talking about another image you might have of old guys in tuxedos from the 1940s. No, we're talking about the Syncopated Ladies, an all-female tap squad that has become an Internet sensation for their tight moves set to popular music, think Prince and Beyonce.
(SOUNDBITE OF SYNCOPATED LADIES PERFORMANCE)
MARTIN: You might have caught them on the TV show ""So You Think You Can Dance"" or featured on Beyonce's home page. Two sisters, Maud and Chloe Arnold, founded the group. They're here in Washington, D.C., this weekend for their annual concert and showcase. So we thought this was a good time to hear more about the group and how they're changing the look of tap.
And Chloe Arnold is with us now to represent both sisters. And she's with us now. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
CHLOE ARNOLD: Thank you Michel. I'm so, so happy to be here. And I'm really excited to talk about tap dancing.
MARTIN: And thanks for taking time out of a really busy schedule of master classes and all the things that you're doing. As I mentioned, this is your hometown. How did you get started in tap dancing? Was it, like, the usual you had too much energy, so mom put you in a class?
ARNOLD: Well, my mom did dance for fun when she was growing up. And so it was something that she wanted to just share with her kids. And then she saw that we were really loving it. And so she started to seek out more opportunities.
MARTIN: What is it that you think you love about tap?
ARNOLD: I think that, for me, when you're tap dancing, you are a musician and a dancer. And what I love about tap is you can, you know, it's percussive, so you can do it to any kind of music. And I have a broad taste of music. So it allows me to lock into any pocket and to really express myself.
And there's an element of improvisation within tap that fits my personality well because I love to improvise and freestyle and make things up in the moment.
MARTIN: And I noticed that after college, you formed a dance company with your sister, Maud. And I wondered what made you think this could be a career because, you know, frankly, tap isn't something that - well, when you were kind of developing the form, it isn't something that you saw a lot of except on - say, on period pieces, on Broadway...
ARNOLD: Correct.
MARTIN: ...You know like - you know, or, you know, or The Rockettes, which is just, you know, not everybody's cup of tea. So what made you think that you could kind of take this someplace?
ARNOLD: So when we were growing up here in D.C., an incredible woman, Debbie Allen, came and we got to be in a play of hers at the Kennedy Center. And so that was my first initial thing of seeing a black woman of excellence be able to shape her own way. And it gave me the confidence that I could do the same.
And so then I actually went to Columbia University. And I studied film. And I thought to myself you know how I'm going to do this? I'm going to put tap dance in TV, music videos and film. And so the way that Syncopated Ladies started to make our imprint was to show people the way that I imagined our art, meaning full of black girl magic, full of rhythm, syncopation, body, curves. We say fierce footwork with a female force.
And so when we're creating, you know, what I was seeing when I was in college in New York was there were just not really any roles for African-American women in tap dance. If you were going to be on Broadway, it's all chorus girls, which means a line of women, and you really have to - at that time - fit into that line, right? And my body type with curves and - there's just not a lot of black women, and they're definitely not curvy women.
MARTIN: There's just so many - a couple things I wanted to dig into. Like, first of all, one of the things that I saw at your shows is exactly the point that you just made. One of the things that really struck me is there was every kind of person in it. There was young people. There were kids. There were older. They were every race. And they were all different kinds of body types...
ARNOLD: Yes.
MARTIN: ...And one of the biggest applauses went to a larger-sized woman - frankly, not the type of body type that I think most people associate with professional dance. And it was just, you know, it was just kind of eye opening. And I was wondering how your philosophy around this came about, that not just that anybody could take your classes, but that people with all these different body types can perform?
ARNOLD: Yes, the woman that you're speaking of, she was our student from when she was 10-years-old. And when she came first to us, she did have self-doubt and was under the lens and microscope of not fitting in. And we literally have worked with her over the past 10 years to get her to a place where she can walk on that stage in that bright yellow shirt shining whereas before as a kid, she would been hiding. And so it takes time. And it takes effort. And it takes, like, a vision that you see - again, the deeper excellence in a human. And that is the part that makes artists amazing. It's not being cookie cutter.
MARTIN: Well, also, your work is being recognized. I mean, you earned an Emmy nomination for your work on ""The Late Late Show With James Corden."" Congratulations for that.
ARNOLD: Thank you. Thank you so much.
MARTIN: But I also - tell us about the episode that you choreographed. It just sounds crazy.
ARNOLD: Oh, my God. So first of all, I love James Corden. I love ""The Late Late Show"" because it is literally unlimited adventure. You know, this particular one is called Crosswalk Musical. And this one was with Hugh Jackman, Zendaya and Zac Efron and James Corden in the crosswalk on Broadway in New York City with a cast of 16 dancers. And we put on basically 40 second musicals in the crosswalk.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN"")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) The people ride in a hole in the ground. New York, New York, it's a hell of a town. Cars, cars, cars. Wow. Wow.
ARNOLD: And it is absolutely hysterical. And people ask me all the time, is that real? And it is totally real. We are literally in the street during the time that the light is red. We put on a musical. And when they are running, they are running because the light is going to change.
MARTIN: That is crazy. That sounded crazy.
ARNOLD: It is absolutely nuts. And it's so fun. And it's really been great for dance and for art to just again, expand the creativity and create more opportunity.
MARTIN: Well, you certainly are expanding, I think, people's vision of what tap can be. Finally, before I let you go, what do you think it is that we still like about tap? As I said that for people whose only vision of it is like, you know, The Rockettes - no disrespect to The Rockettes - you know, or the Hines brothers back in the day, I mean, Savion Glover, of course. So I mean, maybe people will have seen him. But what is it that you think we still like about it because one of the things, again, that was fascinating about your showcase is that all kinds of people were there. There was every kind of person there - all ages, all races, all, you know, what is it that you think we still like about it?
ARNOLD: Well, artistically speaking, you know, percussion is mesmerizing. I mean, the drum is the essence, honestly, of the heartbeat. It is from - it is the origin - original African expression and music. So the drum and that idea that our feet are, you know, we are the drum in our physicality our oral and visual presentation. And I think that that is just honestly an innate human connection that people have.
So I think that rhythm is what draws everyone together. And I think, though, then the part that keeps you is style because then the style is reflective of the individual person's journey and experience and culture and where they come from. And then that, again, captivates different people based around their own life experience.
MARTIN: That is the Emmy nominated choreographer and dancer Chloe Arnold. She's the co-founder with her sister of Syncopated Ladies. And she's teaching and performing this weekend in Washington, D.C., at the D.C. Tap Festival. And Chloe Arnold, thank you so much for talking with us.

Nephew Of Robert E. Lee Grapples With Legacy Of American Race Relations In New Book,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097741/nephew-of-robert-e-lee-grapples-with-legacy-of-american-race-relations-in-new-bo?station=KXJZ_FM,"Robert W. Lee tells NPR's Michel Martin what it's like to grapple with the legacy of his ancestor, Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He wrote about this in a memoir, ""A Sin by Any Other Name.""
In the South, the name Robert E. Lee is everywhere. Schools, parks, streets, entire counties bear the name of the leader of the Confederate Army during the Civil War. More recently, statues in his honor have been at the center of heated debates including in Charlottesville, Va., where the statue was the purported emphasis for the white supremacist rally there in 2017.
My next guest is also a Robert Lee - the Reverend Robert W. Lee. He is the nephew of the famous general many generations removed and grew up with reverence for him. He still has that reverence, but he's also grappling with the meaning of his legacy. And he's urging others, specifically others who share that heritage, to do the same.
He offers his thoughts about all this in a new book, ""A Sin By Any Other Name: Reckoning With Racism And The Heritage Of The South."" And he's with us now from WFAE in Charlotte, N.C. Reverend Lee, welcome. Thank you so much for talking to us.
ROBERT W LEE: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So you talk in the book about the first time that you learned you were related to Robert E. Lee from a picture hanging in your grandmother's house. Do you remember, you know, what that felt like when you heard about this, when you learned this?
LEE: I think in the South, there is a certain reverence, as you said, and a certain awe for the man named Robert E. Lee. Regardless of what you think of him and what he did, he is a staple of Southern culture. And so when I found out that I was related to him, and a close relation at that, it was as if my world had been shaken in the best way possible. It's like told - being told you're related to a celebrity down here.
MARTIN: One of the things about your book that I like is that, you know, what we often as journalists report on history as these big cataclysmic moments, right? But you describe, like, a series of smaller, quieter moments that influenced your thinking. Could you just talk a little bit about how your image of him first became complicated or more nuanced?
LEE: I grew up under the care of a nurse named Janie Bowman (ph) who really cared for me. She was a woman of color. She was someone who was 60, 70 years my senior at the time that I met her. And she would cook me sausage. She would take me for a walk. She would read the Psalms to me.
But she also understood that down here in the south, even in the 1990s when I was a kid, Jim Crow still lived. And so she wouldn't eat after me. She wouldn't use the same utensils or the same glasses that we had at my house because it was Robert Lee's house. You don't do that. That was just her understanding of the Jim Crow South at the time. And I've struggled with that ever since, this reality that I bear a name that has caused such pain not only for people that I love, but for this nation as well.
MARTIN: But you still went to an all-white Christian academy - right? - one of those seg academies that was set up specifically to avoid the court-ordered desegregation of the public school system there, right? Did you ever ask about that? Did you ever wonder, like, why?
LEE: To this day, I still wonder why. And it was an all right school. They were nice to me. But we had lunch catered from outside venues - from fast food joints or from the local Japanese restaurant while our friends over at Statesville Middle School were eating lunches that probably shouldn't have been eaten by anyone.
So this was a dichotomy and a juxtaposition that I still live with to this day. And I hope and pray that this book will give us a chance to reconcile those realities.
MARTIN: In the book, the events in Charlottesville in 2017 were a turning point for you. That's when the - of course, I think most people will remember that these white nationalists were marching through the city. And it purportedly started as a protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. And then of course, the activist young woman Heather Heyer was killed. A number of people were injured.
The fact that reverence for Robert E. Lee allegedly was at the center of that chaos and violence, was that something that was transformative for you?
LEE: It broke my heart. I've had the opportunity to befriend Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer who was killed in Charlottesville. And when my book came out, she said, stay strong. Keep the faith and keep fighting. And that gave me a lot of hope because if she can reconcile with herself the fact that my ancestor's statue caused this problem, then we can work together still. We can still confront racism as we do together with her foundation, the Heather Heyer Foundation. We can do this.
MARTIN: I'm wondering if - I don't think you have kids yet, you and your wife. But if you should have a son, what are you thinking about - Emmett? I don't know. What - Bill? Is Robert still on the table?
LEE: Well, I can tell you - and my wife - first of all, for all of you who are worried, my wife gave me permission to say this - we are not going to name our child Robert Lee if we have a boy. We are going to end it here because for us, the weight of this name is growing as people seek to create a racist reality. People are venerating this name instead of living into it as a sinful past.
So my wife and I have thought about Elliott, which is the middle name of my mentor who preached my ordination service. We've thought about a few different names. But those are some that come to mind. And we just want to have a future filled with hope, not one filled with a past that is deeply broken.
MARTIN: Well, good luck. Keep us posted on all of those developments if you don't mind. All right.
LEE: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
MARTIN: The Reverend Robert W. Lee. He's the nephew many generations removed of the Confederate General Robert E. Lee. His new book, ""A Sin By Any Other Name,"" is available now. Reverend Lee, thank you so much for talking with us.
LEE: Thank you.

Barbershop: The Curious Case Of Julian Assange,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097734/barbershop-the-curious-case-of-julian-assange?station=KXJZ_FM,"In the Barbershop, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Margaret Sullivan and former CIA deputy director John McLaughlin about whether Julian Assange's actions are heroic or treacherous.
We're going to begin the program today by taking another look at the arrest of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. The details on the optics of the arrest Thursday were certainly dramatic - a bearded Assange dragged from Ecuador's Embassy in London after nearly seven years inside. Demonstrators and op-ed writers rallied to his defense while critics leaked negative details about everything from his hygiene to his cat.
Apart from all of that, though, Assange's actions and his arrest raise serious questions about the seriousness of the accusations against Assange and what the response should be. And these are questions, it has to be said, that divide journalists and national security experts, so we've decided to take this up in our weekly Barbershop because this is where we talk to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds. And for this conversation, we've called upon Margaret Sullivan, media columnist with The Washington Post. She's with us from New York City.
Margaret, thanks so much for joining us once again.
MARGARET SULLIVAN: Thanks, Michel. Nice to be with you again.
MARTIN: And John McLaughlin is the former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He's been kind enough to join us from Virginia.
Mr. McLaughlin, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us as well.
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Hi, Michel.
MARTIN: So I think most people know who care about this or the basic facts - the government says that Assange conspired with former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a classified Defense Department password, and he was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
Now, Margaret, you are clear that journalists are divided about this, saying on the one hand, some people think that he engaged in, you know, reckless, thoughtless behavior, but that others say that while he may be a bit radical about his position about government transparency, at his core, he is a publisher who takes a position for the sake of government accountability, and thus he should be afforded protection. Would it be fair to say that that's the direction you lean on this?
SULLIVAN: Well, you know, I guess my stance on this is a little - it's a little bit in between those things. I don't actually see Julian Assange at this point of his career or his life as a journalist. I don't think we can call him a journalist. I think we can say that Wikileaks is a publisher. He may be all of those negative things that you said. He may be reckless. He may have done bad things.
My concern is that in going after him and indicting him and prosecuting him, what happens within that is that regular journalists - you know, legitimate journalists - will also suffer the consequences because many of the sort of methods that have been identified in the indictment are things - are actually best practices for national security journalists and others around the country and around the world.
MARTIN: Well, give an example.
(CROSSTALK)
MARTIN: You did write a whole column about this, so I would refer people to it. But just give me an example of what you think he did that legitimate journalists also do besides publish things that other people don't want them to see. Because some of - you know...
SULLIVAN: He protected...
MARTIN: Some journalists say no - say that, you know, hacking into things, inducing somebody else to hack into a classified entity - that is not something other journalists would do.
SULLIVAN: Right. This doesn't - this is not, in my mind, a judgment on whether we like Julian Assange or what he has revealed. It's not at all that. The question is, in pursuing this, are we going to criminalize best practices that journalists use - such as using encryption, such as source protection, such as asking a source for information?
MARTIN: OK. Mr. McLaughlin, what about you? You say - you've written about this as well, and you said that you don't consider Assange's activity journalism for a number of reasons. You say his main target is the United States, not corruption more broadly. Others have written about the fact that he had ample opportunity to publish information about Russia's activities in Ukraine, for example, and didn't do so. So what do you say about all this?
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, that's the main point, Michel. The fact that - I don't see him as a legitimate journalist because a couple of reasons. First, it isn't just that he published material that people don't want to see published. That's not really the issue. If he actually conspired to help break into a Pentagon computer, that's not something a legitimate journalist does.
Also, when he gave this material to mainstream journalists, my understanding from what I've heard said by people who worked with him is that many people wanted to take out material that would have endangered the lives of Afghans and Iraqis who had given information to the United States about al-Qaida, for example. And he didn't want to do that, whereas a legitimate journalist will at least listen to that case. And that's basically my objection to him. I don't see him as a legitimate journalist at all.
MARTIN: And what about Margaret's point, though, that by - that arresting him and prosecuting him will have a chilling effect on legitimate journalists who do protect sources and who sometimes do come into possession of materials that governments would not want them to have? What would you say about that?
MARTIN: Well, I don't think journalists should be prosecuted or arrested for those practices, which are all legitimate, freedom of speech practice that we all support. That's not why he will be accused, I think. He not only apparently - we have to find out, give him a fair trial if it gets a trial - might have broken into, helped break into a Pentagon computer. But also, if you look at Robert Mueller's indictments of the 12 Russian GRU officers who were instrumental in interfering in our election, it's quite clear from that and also from what the intelligence community published and declassified in January of 2017 that that dump of documents went to WikiLeaks and - via a couple of online personages that the Russians invented - Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.
So again, I don't know whether that's going to turn out to be something on which he can be legitimately indicted. I just have no idea. But when Mueller's report is fully revealed, we may discover that there's an angle there that goes beyond what we would normally think of a legitimate journalist as doing.
MARTIN: So, Margaret, what about Mr. McLaughlin's point that journalists would engage in some form of test, best balancing test, within their own organization before choosing to publish something? I mean, he in - Mr. McLaughlin in his writing about this said this is more like an intelligence activity. He just sort of threw this information out there. There doesn't seem to have been any discretion, any thought about sort of balancing the public interest in knowing versus the harm that it could do. What do you say about that?
SULLIVAN: Well, I think that Mr. McLaughlin is 100 percent right about that. There was a time earlier on - you know, it's getting to be 10 years ago - when Julian Assange did more of that kind of thing - redacting things that could be problematic or harmful, even, I think, consulting or allowing the information to be worked over by government sources or seen by government sources.
But I think those issues are - they don't go to the heart of my concern. It may well be that Julian Assange is - as I said, is reckless, is a negative force, has done things that have hurt people. I recognize that. However, I am fearful that in going after him - you know, again, going after him in this particular way and casting his method of protecting his source of - this is all in the indictment.
This is part of - you know, seen as part of the so-called conspiracy, that he conspired to protect his source, that he conspired to encrypt information. And again, if those things are seen to be criminal, we're all in big trouble. And, you know, we've suffered a very difficult blow to the kinds of reporting that, you know, that do serve the public interest.
MARTIN: You know, it's interesting because, Mr. McLaughlin, you also expressed ambivalence about prosecuting him. You said that - you know, you were asked if - do you think that the U.S. government could and should charge him for publishing these secrets? And you said, I think it's a close call. You said emotionally, you would say yes, you know. But you also said that you were ambivalent because it's clear that he will seek martyr status. You can already see it. You know, people are going to be...
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...Printing up T-shirts. So tell me more about your feelings about that. Are you saying you really - even though you are a career intelligence officer, you're saying maybe he shouldn't be prosecuted - not because he didn't do wrong in your view but because you think of the effect that it would create among people who support him?
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, my heart tells me yes, but my head tells me no. No, because I don't think we want to conspire in an effort for - that he would like to have us conspire in - for him to be a martyr. And I also take Margaret's point that I don't think anyone here wants to do anything that jeopardizes journalists' ability to keep the security of their sources - after all, intelligence officers have that same interest - and - nor interfere with their ability to encrypt things and so forth.
So if that's part of an indictment, I think prosecutors and defenders will have to work through that to sort of segregate what is it that he can be legitimately charged with here without endangering freedom of speech, the First Amendment or the rights of journalists. I'm all for avoiding those dangers.
Again, my objections are if journalists - legitimate ones - do not conspire to break into government computers, if we condone that, then your computer isn't safe, and my computer isn't safe. And also, when I've had journalists call me when I've been in government with a story that conceivably could harm sources, for example, or could bring harm to other Americans, they would give you a chance to make your case. And sometimes, they would hold parts of a story, and sometimes they wouldn't. You would lose your case sometimes, and sometimes you would win it. And I've done that with major newspapers and found them extremely responsible and recognized the dilemma they struggle with. There was none of that with him.
MARTIN: OK.
MCLAUGHLIN: It was just all out the door. And I think that's to be condemned.
MARTIN: All right. As this case continues, we'll call you both back and ask you both your opinion of it and what you think should happen next and in the future. That was John McLaughlin, former deputy director of the CIA. He's now teaching at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Margaret Sullivan was with us, media columnist with The Washington Post. She's the former public editor for The New York Times.
I thank you both so much for talking with us today.
MCLAUGHLIN: Thanks, Michel.
SULLIVAN: Thanks very much.

toggle caption courtesy of Amazon Prime Video Donald Glover in a still from Guava Island , which he stars in with Rihanna. The film premiered at Coachella, where Glover's musical act Childish Gambino headlined on Friday.
courtesy of Amazon Prime Video Guava Island , Childish Gambino 's long-awaited new project, has finally arrived. Hot off a headlining Coachella performance Friday night, Guava Island is the proverbial cherry on top of Donald Glover's wildly successful year as a rapper, following his first Billboard No. 1 with ""This Is America"" in 2018 and that song's wins for Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the Grammy awards earlier this year — the first rap song to ever win both those prizes.
Anticipation for Guava Island was first stoked months in advance with a single photo of Glover and Rihanna on set in Cuba, spurring grandiose speculation as to what the project would entail — especially since it's tied to Glover's retirement of the Childish Gambino project. Longtime collaborator Hiro Murai directed (Murai is also the director of the ""This Is America"" video and many episodes of Glover's TV series Atlanta ) and the screenplay was written by Stephen Glover, Donald's brother and a writer on Atlanta.
Almost as if to curtail the expectations, the film itself is a modestly stunning — and at times unnerving — extended music video, shot in 4:3 aspect ratio, about music's power to unite in the face of tyranny and greed. It features three new songs, ""Die With You,"" ""Time"" and the flamenco-tinged ""Saturday,"" as well as renditions of the previously released ""Summertime Magic,"" ""Feels Like Summer"" and notably, a sequence showcasing ""This Is America"" that recalls Murai's music video from last year.
A quick summary of the plot: Glover stars as Deni Maroon, a Purple Rain-esque folk hero and local celebrity on the island — exploited for its natural splendor and transformed into a factory spinning silk run by a single despot, played by Nonso Anozie. Rihanna plays his partner, Kofi Novia. The pair meets in a gorgeous animated backstory at the start of the film. Deni's set on uniting the island with a music festival, but it comes at a cost. Black Panther's Letitia Wright also plays a role.
YouTube
Guava Island is streaming on Amazon for free today until 9 p.m. EST. After that time, it'll be available only to Amazon Prime members. It will also stream once on YouTube's Coachella live stream , starting at 8 p.m ET / 5 p.m. PT."
Writers Guild of America Tells Writers To Fire Their Agents After Talks Fail : NPR,www.npr.org,Sasha Ingber,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713030206/uncharted-waters-union-tells-hollywood-writers-to-fire-their-agents,"Enlarge this image Writers Guild of America West President David Goodman speaks in Los Angeles at the 2019 union award ceremony.

toggle caption Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Writers Guild of America West President David Goodman speaks in Los Angeles at the 2019 union award ceremony. The WGA instructed is writers to fire their agents on Friday.
Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Thousands of Hollywood writers have been told by the Writers Guild of America to fire their agents — a drastic move that could impinge the production of new TV shows and films.
The abrupt directive on Friday followed a breakdown in negotiations over proposed changes to the agreement that has guided the basic business relationship between writers and agents for the past 43 years.
With talks stalled ahead of a midnight deadline, the WGA sent its 13,000 writers an email with instructions to notify their agents in writing that they cannot represent them until signing a new code of conduct.
""We know that, together, we are about to enter uncharted waters,"" the message stated. ""Life that deviates from the current system might be various degrees of disorienting. But it has become clear that a big change is necessary.""
It was a bold move for a group accustomed to writing its own scripts. ""I guess the idea of taking on our agents is something people never thought we would do,"" said David Goodman, the president of the Writers Guild of America West, in an interview with NPR.
""Studios and networks still need writers to do the work so until agents figure out that they need us more than we need them, we will carry this out,"" said Goodman.
Movies Meet Marsai Martin, The Youngest Executive Producer In Hollywood At the center of the conflict is a complaint among writers that their agents are not just drastically out-earning them, but preventing them from receiving better pay. The dispute threatens to hinder production at a time when the major broadcast networks are typically staffing up for their fall lineups. It could also lead to job losses in the industry.
""This whole fight is really about the fact that in a period of unprecedented profits and growth of our business ... writers themselves are actually earning less,"" said Goodman.
A main point of contention involves what are known as packaging fees, the money that agents get from a studio when they provide a roster of talent for a film or TV project. Traditionally, agents would earn a 10 percent commission for the work their clients receive from a studio. But with packaging fees, they are compensated by the studios directly. ""They are not incentivized to increase the income of those writers,"" Goodman said.
Writers are also protesting a shift in the business model in recent years at some of Hollywood's largest talent agencies. Agents have increasingly entered the film and TV businesses as producers, and writers contend that such a dual-hat arrangement represents a conflict of interest.
Goodman said that in order to break the impasse, the industry needs to return ""to the traditional agent-writer relationship"" where an agent takes 10 percent of a writer's income.
On Saturday, some writers posted images of the letters they had signed and sent to their agents, showing solidarity if not total support.
""I have an amazing agency that represents me,"" screenwriter, actor and comedian Patton Oswalt said on Twitter. ""But I have an even better guild which stands for me.""
""Dammit,"" wrote David Simon , a Baltimore-based author and television writer best known for The Wire . ""Just realized that the [agency agreement] midnight deadline is PST. So I have to stay up another three hours and one minute to send a pic of my naked a** to [the Creative Artists Agency].""
The Association of Talent Agents, which represents the agencies, has promised more transparency when agencies are involved in the production of a film or TV show. The association committed to reopening talks on the issue after two years if the Writers Guild determines that members aren't benefiting.
The association also offered concessions leading up to Friday's breakdown, including a chance to share 80 percent of ""a percentage"" of their profits when packaging fees for a television series are involved.
The guild said that based on the offer they received from agents, that ""percentage"" amounted to 0.8 percent of the money agents make from packaging fees.
ATA also said agencies would spend $6 million over six years to foster a more inclusive environment and insisted they ""are, and always have been, on the side of the writer.""
In a statement, Karen Stuart, the executive director of the ATA, said Friday's failure ""was driven by the Guild's predetermined course for chaos."" She said it would ultimately harm artists.
""The WGA is mandating a 'Code of Conduct' that will hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to mid-level and emerging writers, while dictating how agencies of all sizes should function.""
Goodman said writers are already hurt. He called the proposal ""a ridiculous offer given the fact that the writers are the reason that any television show succeeds.""
Until the impasse is solved, members of the guild have told writers they could turn to managers or lawyers to handle their business affairs.
Lawyers for the ATA threatened to sue the guild, contending that the union was violating California and New York licensing laws. As part of its argument, it said in a letter that the union ""cannot 'delegate' authority it does not have.""
Friday's breakdown in negotiations marked just the latest chapter in the Writers Guild's longstanding aversion to packaging fees. Goodman said the union sought reforms as far back as the 1970s.
""People are saying this is an unprecedented move, but it isn't in the sense that 43 years ago we tried to get rid of packaging and we failed and now it's gotten much worse,"" Goodman said."

SAGAL: It's on the sign. Canadian police arrested the owner of the Smuggler's Inn for organizing...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Illegal entry into Canada for seven people. He now faces 21 criminal charges, which could come with a hefty jail sentence. The owner says he's going to stay calm and really hopes police don't find out about his other business, the every cake contains a nail file to help you break out of prison bakery.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Alonzo do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Well, he raced to the lead with five right.
FARSAD: Wow.
KURTIS: 10 more points - total of 13.
SAGAL: Very well done.
FARSAD: Did so much better than Maeve.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: How many, then...
FARSAD: Noticing that.
SAGAL: ...Does Negin need to win?
KURTIS: She needs six to win in a very difficult field.
FARSAD: Yeah.
SAGAL: Here we go, Negin.
FARSAD: All right.
SAGAL: This is for the game.
FARSAD: OK.

SAGAL: I'm going to give it to you.
FARSAD: They don't eat elephants.
SAGAL: Killed by an elephant, then eaten by lions.

(APPLAUSE)
FARSAD: (Laughter).
SAGAL: According to the police report, the officer volunteered to role play the part of a drunk driver for a Breathalyzer demonstration and proceeded to blow above the legal limit.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That means he was either drinking on the job or just really that good an actor.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He is currently being investigated on charges of being really, really, really dedicated to his job.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, I think Negin did well enough to win. Did she not?

Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
T J: Hey. This is T.J. (ph) calling in from Waterbury, Vt.
SAGAL: Hey. Waterbury is a great place. What do you do there?
T J: I groom ski trails for Sugar Bush terrain parks.
SAGAL: You're - so you're a ski guy. That's cool.
T J: I'm a snowboarder. But yeah, we're up there every night just laying down corduroy for the people.
SAGAL: That's really cool. You sound like a snowboarder. I'm just going to go there.

ALONZO BODDEN: I just want to ask - you live in Vermont. If you had a million dollars...

BODDEN: ...What would you do with it up there?
T J: Oh, man. I'd probably buy 400,000 snowboards.
SAGAL: Yeah, I was about to say.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: All right.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Why wouldn't you just get one really big one, though?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, T.J., welcome to the show. Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three news-related limericks with the last word or phrase missing from each. If you can fill in that last word or phrase correctly in two of the limericks, you'll be a winner. You ready to play?
T J: Yeah. Let's do it.
SAGAL: All right. Here is your first limerick.
BILL KURTIS: My pet is a bit of a brat. I'm the servant in his habitat. Those who own a sweet dog all live high on the hog. I feel lousy 'cause I have a...
T J: Cat.
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Dog owners are happier than cat owners.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It turns out it's been proven with a new survey showing how dog owners self-identify as very happy, whereas cat owners identify as very ow, why did it bite me again?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The survey found dog owners are happier than those with cats. The survey also found - and this is true - that people with cats are less happy than people who have no pets at all.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that cats make you unhappy. It may just be that cat owners are miserable losers for entirely different reasons.
(LAUGHTER)
NEGIN FARSAD: Can I just say #NotAllCats? Because...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I grew up with a really great cat that was basically like a dog. And now I have a dog, and there were like this - I can't even tell them apart. So just...
BODDEN: It's funny how cat people always say that.
SAGAL: Yeah, they always do.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: No, no. My cat is different. No, it's not.
SAGAL: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: No, it's a cat.
SAGAL: Yeah. Here is your next limerick.
KURTIS: For podcasts, we've got an idea. A Swedish voice sleep panacea. Now HEMNES and MALM will help you stay calm. Our podcast reads names from...
T J: IKEA.
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Very good.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Do you need a new sleep aid? Is our show no longer doing it for you? Ikea is launching a podcast made to help people go to sleep...
FARSAD: Oh, my god.
SAGAL: ...That's what it's for - in which two Swedish men read the names of products...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...From the IKEA catalog, which is a great idea. It's much better than their original idea of reading from the illustrated assembly manual.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Because, like, I don't know, a man with a hammer is sad, and the corner of his table hurts. I...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The podcast is advertised as a great way to help people fall asleep. And if you listen to a clip, you can hear why.
(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: BJORKSNAS - chest of five drawers. PUDERVIVA - queen quilt cover set.

SAGAL: And if this isn't enough for you, you can turn into IKEA's next podcast from Guy Raz, How The Hell Do You Build This?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right, T.J. Here is your last limerick.
KURTIS: On airplanes, the sound can be crushing when vacuum-sucked water is rushing. Since kids can be scared to use bathrooms mid-air, we have softened the noise of our...
T J: Flushing.
SAGAL: Flushing, right.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Physicists are working to improve airplane travel but not by making sure your plane doesn't crash. No, they're trying to make sure the toilet isn't too loud. People have been complaining for years about the deafening roar of the airplane toilet flush, saying it terrifies children and masks the other bathroom sounds they do want to hear.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Apparently, designing a quieter mechanism that can function at high altitudes has been a challenge. But engineers have found a way to cut the noise of the flush by 16 decibels - you just put your fingers in your ears...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Brace your elbows. Unfortunately, they haven't found a way to reduce the sound of the guy in the seat next to you who can't hear himself farting because his headphones are on.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. We're playing this week with Maeve Higgins, Alonzo Bodden and Negin Farsad. And here again is your host from Trinity University's Laurie Auditorium in San Antonio, Peter Sagal.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Thank you, Bill. In just a minute, the rhymes of Texas are upon you in our listener limerick challenge. If you'd like to play, give us a call at 1-888-WAIT-WAIT - that's 1-888-924-8924.
Right now, panel, it is time for a game that we call...
BILL KURTIS: The 2020 dump.
SAGAL: With millions of Americans signing up each day to run for president as a Democrat...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...News about all the candidates is coming in hard and fast. So we're going to ask you about some of them rapid-fire style. Get your question right, you get a point, true or false. Ready to go? Maeve, true or false - at a campaign event in Iowa, Beto O'Rourke got asked for his autograph while in the bathroom.
MAEVE HIGGINS: I would say that's true, actually.
SAGAL: No, it was false. What happened was Beto started talking to this stranger in the bathroom who then asked him, hey, are you here to see Beto O'Rourke?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I was imagining that he kind of, like, off - you know, he seems to be very over-familiar. Like, and he gets up on countertops and stuff.
SAGAL: Yes.
HIGGINS: So I was imagining him at a u-rye-nal (ph) kind of stretching across to offer and...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I'm sorry, excuse me.
HIGGINS: ...To offer a shake.
ALONZO BODDEN: Yes, she did say...
SAGAL: At a what?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: U-rye-nal.
BODDEN: Beautiful.
NEGIN FARSAD: It's wrong.
BODDEN: You - no, that is the new way it's pronounced.
SAGAL: Yes. Oh, u-rye-nal.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: You know, the thing that men stand in front of.
SAGAL: Oh, I know what you're talking about. I've just never heard it...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Described that way. Is that what they call them in Ireland - a u-rye-nal?
HIGGINS: Yeah. Honestly, I've never used one. But...
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I know that they've got cakes in them, and I'm always so jealous.
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Negin, true or false. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his husband Chasten were immortalized in a butter sculpture.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
FARSAD: That feels true.
SAGAL: No, it's false. It was a diorama made of Marshmallow Peeps.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Alonzo, true or false. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, who's considering a run, tweeted out a picture of himself as a crab standing on the head of an alligator representing Donald Trump.
BODDEN: Oh, absolutely true.
SAGAL: Absolutely true. We have no idea what it means, but that's what he did.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Negin, true or false. Candidate Andrew Yang made empowering firefighters part of his official platform.
FARSAD: True.
SAGAL: No, false. He made empowering mixed martial arts fighters part of his official platform.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And, of course, as for the Republican candidate in 2020, Alonzo, true or false - on a visit to George Washington's residence, Mount Vernon, President Trump said, I'm here to honor the legacy of President Vernon?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: I'm going to go with true on that one also.
SAGAL: No. It's false. What he really said was, quote, ""if Washington was smart, he would have put his name on it. You got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's it for our 2020 dump, even though six more people declared while we were playing the game.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Right now, panel, some more questions for you from the week's news. Maeve, a woman in Taiwan suffering from what she thought was an eye infection learned of this week it was actually what?
HIGGINS: Oh, she was just obsessed.
SAGAL: No.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: She had been working at - does anybody know? This made a lot of news this week. People were, like...
FARSAD: Bumblebees in her...
SAGAL: Yes.
FARSAD: ...Eyeballs?
SAGAL: She had bees living in her eyes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
HIGGINS: Oh, there was a lot of buzz around this story.
SAGAL: There was, yeah. And the bees were feeding on her tears.
(GROANING)
SAGAL: No, we'll skip the gross parts - which means we will never speak of this again.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: No, these bees had gotten in there while she was gardening. And she started having some eye pain, as will happen, you know, when your eye has bees in them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: She went to the doctor, and she got her first clue that there might be something seriously wrong when he approached her wearing a head-to-toe white suit and holding one of those smokers.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I thought he was, like, holding a piece of toast and, like, with butter...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...And, like, making breakfast.
BODDEN: But how small were these bees?
SAGAL: These were tiny, little bees.
BODDEN: I didn't know bees...
FARSAD: Yeah.
BODDEN: ...Came in...
HIGGINS: Like humming-bees.
BODDEN: ...Eye-size.
SAGAL: Apparently...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: They're small enough to fit in there, and she couldn't see them until they looked.
BODDEN: That's one more thing to worry about.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.

Hi, you are on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
DEVIN O'DONNELL: Hi. This is Devin O'Donnell (ph) from Salt Lake City, Utah.
SAGAL: Salt Lake City is a beautiful place. What do you do there, Devin?
O'DONNELL: So I work at a warehouse during the day, go to cosmetology school at night. And I also work as a drag performer here in the city.
SAGAL: Oh. What - can I ask what your...
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: I have a number of questions.

SAGAL: First of all, what is your drag name?
O'DONNELL: It's Gemma Nai (ph).

O'DONNELL: Yeah.

SAGAL: Sounds exotic. And - so when you're in cosmetology school - you're going to be a hairstylist?
O'DONNELL: Yeah, absolutely - hair and makeup.

O'DONNELL: Yep, it's what got me started.

NEGIN FARSAD: Mmm hmm.
O'DONNELL: Really.
SAGAL: All right.
O'DONNELL: Who knows better how to do makeup than someone who beats their face weekly?
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, Devin, it's nice to have you with us. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. What is the topic, Bill?
KURTIS: America, will you go to prom with me?
SAGAL: It's prom season. And that means two things - one, photos your children will regret forever and two, new prom trends. Our panelists are going to tell you about what's new at prom this year. Pick the one who's telling the truth, you'll win our prize - the WAIT WAITer of your choice on your voicemail. You ready to play?
O'DONNELL: Absolutely.
SAGAL: All right. Let's hear first, then, from Negin Farsad.
FARSAD: The 1990s hip-hop duo Kris Kross made an unlikely resurgence at Boise, Idaho's Centennial High School. You might remember them from that one hit jump, jump. The Daddy Mac'll make you jump...
MAEVE HIGGINS: (Laughter).
FARSAD: ...Jump. Kris Kross will make you...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...Jump, jump. The Daddy Mac'll make you jump, jump.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I'm sure it was a huge hit with NPR audiences. Anyway...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...You may also remember the curious fact that they wore their pants backwards. The kids at Centennial High could not get enough of Kris Kross and started dressing backwards on campus. While there were a few awkward adjustments at the boys urinal, school administrators viewed the whole thing as a passing throwback fad. But the trend continued to grow. And the senior class decided to make the theme of prom backward. So they renamed it morp (ph), which is prom backwards...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...For those of you who lack backward-speaking facility. Not only did the students decide to dress backwards - long dress trains flowing forward on girls and corsages pinned on boys' backs - but they made everything backward. Morp night started with the after party, where students got exceedingly drunk and made mistakes they would soon regret for the rest of their lives.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: As they danced through the night, they turned their moonwalks forward and their flossing upward. Their twerking had more chest and less booty. And their Gangnam style looked like a horse was riding them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The backwards prom.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Where everything is backwards, including the progression of events in Boise. Your next promposal will come from Alonzo Bodden.
ALONZO BODDEN: Is your prom really chaperoned when the chaperone is Charlie Sheen?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: You might have to figure that out, especially as the trend of celebrity prom chaperones is spreading and also because Mr. Sheen is looking for work.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: TMZ reporter Selena Jones (ph) says it started at Calabasas High School in Southern California. Now, Calabasas is well known as the home of the Kardashian family. One parent called in a favor from her friend Kris Jenner. And the next thing you know, Khloe Kardashian is at the prom, checking kids for alcohol. Not to be outdone, ICM super agent Ian Arougheti has a friend whose daughter is at Beverly Hills High School of the Arts. So now their prom will be monitored by Idris Elba.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
BODDEN: Interestingly, there may be more mom volunteers than actual students at that.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: News travels fast and even faster on Snapchat. LA kids bragging got Nashville kids jealous. So their parents got into the act. And now country stars Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire will be at the Nashville High School senior prom, making sure the kids don't do anything that they'll have to later write country songs about.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Not to be outdone, New York started rumors of Jay-Z at a Brooklyn high school. But these were unfounded. So Brooklyn Tech will have to settle for Chris Rock.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: All of this led to the nightmare scenario possibly coming true. Charlie Sheen, through his lawyers, asked if chaperoning the LA performing arts high school prom would count as part of his community service.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: TMZ is waiting for the judge's decision.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Celebrity chaperones is the new trend.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Your last story of what's new under the sea comes from Maeve Higgins.
HIGGINS: This year's big prom trend is inspired by a texting fail. Teens across the country texted their dates to check what kind of corsage they wanted, only to find that their phones autocorrected the word corsage to croissant.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Croissant. Seems like a rose by any other name is a pastry. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, a Dallas bakery, is now selling the croissant corsage after the quirky autocorrect mistake blew up on social media. So instead of wearing delicate carnations and pretty lilies, youngsters are getting their prom dates' corsages made from actual croissants. It's a lovely way to make memory and a grease stain that will last forever.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Surely, this is just a first in a long line of carbohydrate accoutrements from - why is there so many French words?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Surely, this is a first in a long line of carbohydrate accessories from bagel buttonholes, cupcake cufflinks and, of course, a cumber sticky bun.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: It's all part of a lovely trend of having some fun and providing gluten-intolerant people with yet another activity they can't participate in.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Which of these...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Is a real prom theme or trend this year? Was it from Negin, the backwards prom or morp, in which everything happens backwards; from Alonzo, celebrity chaperones, a famous person standing there at the door for you or from Maeve Higgins, kids wearing croissants instead of corsages because of an autocorrect failure? Which of these is the real story of a prom trend?
O'DONNELL: Well, I think I'm going to go with the croissant corsage.
SAGAL: You're going to go with the croissant crosage (ph). I can't even say it - the croissant - croissant corsage.
HIGGINS: Croissant corsage.
SAGAL: All right. Well, to bring you the correct answer, we spoke to someone playing a role in the real story.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN FELTON: They would be asking a prom dates what kind of corsage they wanted. And autocorrect on their phone would change that text to croissant.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: That was John Felton from Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, which is making croissant corsages for this year's promgoers. Congratulations, Devin. You got it right.
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
O'DONNELL: Yeah. Thank you.
SAGAL: You earned a point for Maeve for her...
HIGGINS: Thanks, Devin.
SAGAL: ...Pronunciation of croissant.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: And you've won our prize, the voice of your choice on your voicemail. Thank you so much for playing with us.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Panelists, now some questions about the rest of the week's news for you. Alonzo, a tourist getting a ride in a fighter jet in France got the full experience when the pilot accidentally did what?
ALONZO BODDEN: Ejected him.
SAGAL: Yes, that's what happened...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
NEGIN FARSAD: What?
SAGAL: ...You know, the whole thing with the canopy blowing off and the seat rocketing into the air. Don't worry. He parachuted safely to the runway below. French authorities say he's fine. Or wait - French authorities actually said, quote, ""his health is not a cause for concern.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Weirdly, that's exactly what the same guy who rented the island had to say.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The 64-year-old man was riding along in a French Air Force fighter jet, which isn't supposed to eject passengers just because it feels like it. It's not a nightclub. It's a fighter jet.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Most likely - nobody knows exactly what happened, but most likely, the passenger came close to fulfill his lifelong dream of having his last words be, what does this button do?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Peter, as someone who used to work on fighter planes, I think that's exactly what happened. I think he saw that red lever and said, I wonder what this does?
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODDEN: And then he found out.
SAGAL: Maybe this fires the guns...
BODDEN: (Laughter).
SAGAL: ...Or something cool.
BODDEN: But that is the ultimate - I mean, you know, it's great to get a ride in a fighter jet, but it has to kind of be cooler to even be ejected from a fighter jet.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I know.
BODDEN: Imagine being at a party, and some guy's bragging that, yeah, man, I was riding in a fighter jet. Oh, you were only riding in one?
SAGAL: Oh, yeah.

Who's Bill This Time,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713004434/whos-bill-this-time?station=KXJZ_FM,"Bill Kurtis reads three quotes from the week's news: ""Cabinet Cleaning,"" ""Who Doesn't Want To Be A Millionaire?"" and ""Star Power.""
BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. Remember the Bill-amo (ph).
(CHEERING)
KURTIS: I'm Bill Kurtis. And here is your host from Trinity University's Laurie Auditorium in San Antonio, Peter Sagal.
(CHEERING)
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, Bill. Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. We are so happy to finally be able to do our show here in San Antonio. And we made it just in time - right before the federal government forces the city to change its name to Saint Anthony, Texas.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Senator Cruz will be allowed to keep his name, but he has to start spelling it like Tom does.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Later on, we're going to be talking to a Texan who reported on just about every major story of the post-war era. Mr. Dan Rather himself will be with us.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: But first, you want to hear a live report from your house, give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAIT-WAIT - that's 1-888-924-8924. Now let's welcome our first listener contestant.
Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
MEGAN DOHERTY: Hi Peter. This is Megan Doherty (ph) from Oberlin, Ohio.
SAGAL: Oberlin, Ohio, Megan, is home, of course, of Oberlin University.
(APPLAUSE)
DOHERTY: Oberlin College.
SAGAL: Oh, excuse me - Oberlin College. Do you have any affiliation with Oberlin College?
DOHERTY: I am a campus rabbi.
SAGAL: Oh, you are. So you work at the Hillel.
DOHERTY: I am.
SAGAL: Yeah.
DOHERTY: I do.
SAGAL: Yeah. And how...
DOHERTY: I do.
SAGAL: And how do you find that work?
DOHERTY: It's really fun.
SAGAL: The characters on Lena Dunham's show ""Girls"" were all Oberlin graduates. Was that true to life in terms of what they're like?
DOHERTY: I have never seen ""Girls.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Given your job, I wouldn't recommend it.
(LAUGHTER)
DOHERTY: Thank you.
SAGAL: Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First, the comedian and host of the podcast ""Fake The Nation."" It's just been nominated for a Webby Award for news and politics. It's Negin Farsad.
(CHEERING)
DOHERTY: Hello.
SAGAL: Next, a comedian you can see in Philadelphia at the Helium Comedy Club on April 18 through the 20, Alonzo Bodden.
ALONZO BODDEN: Hello.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: And finally, a comedian whose new book ""Maeve In America"" is out now. It's Maeve Higgins.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Hi.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: Megan, welcome to the show. You're going to play Who's Bill This Time. Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three quotations from this week's news. If you can correctly identify or explain two of them, you'll win our prize - any voice from our show you might choose on your voicemail. You ready to play?
DOHERTY: Yep.
SAGAL: Here we go. Here's your first quote.
KURTIS: From Congress, I would ask for wall. We need wall.
SAGAL: That was a quote from a woman who got fired last week - and despite doing her best to get wall for the president.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Who is it?
DOHERTY: Kirstjen unpronounceable last name...
SAGAL: Yes.
DOHERTY: ...Nielsen.
SAGAL: Kirstjen unpronounceable last name...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...Nielsen, actually.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: You can pronounce it. You just can't spell it. The now former secretary of homeland security is the latest victim of the president's cabinet separation policy.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: It's an everyone-must-go sale at the White House. The president...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Also got rid of the guy who was supposed to head up ICE, the acting director. He's out. He wanted someone who was, quote, ""tougher."" And he fired the head of the Secret Service right while the guy was diving in front of him, yelling, no.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So now we have an acting secretary of defense, an acting homeland security secretary, an acting chief of staff and an acting head of the Secret Service. There are more actors in the president's cabinet...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Than there are in the wait staff of a Los Angeles restaurant.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You know what would be even better, though? An overacting secretary of defense.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You realize, of course, this means war.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: My favorite thing about Kirstjen Nielsen being the homeland security director, being anti-immigrant and everything else, is she spells Kirstjen with a J...
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODDEN: ...In the middle. Like, that's not American.
SAGAL: No, not at all.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Where you get that J from? What?
SAGAL: It's tough because, you know, you leave the Trump administration. You get fired. It's terrible. Your reputation is ruined. People yell at you wherever you go. And you know what the Trump administration's idea of COBRA benefits is to tie you into a sack with a cobra.
(LAUGHTER)
NEGIN FARSAD: But the thing about having all these acting secretaries...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Is that they're basically like temps. They're like substitute teachers.
SAGAL: Right.
FARSAD: Which means that our government is just a bunch of people doing whoopie cushion jokes and throwing spit wads at acting cabinet members. Like, it's chaos.
SAGAL: Yeah, that's true. Today at the Pentagon, they're just showing a movie.
FARSAD: Right, exactly.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: All right, Megan. Your next quote is someone who is known for attacking millionaires and billionaires.
KURTIS: I wrote a bestselling book. If you write a bestselling book, you can be a millionaire, too.
SAGAL: That is the new Democratic front-runner according to polls. Who is it?
DOHERTY: That was Bernie Sanders.
SAGAL: It was Bernie Sanders.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Senator Sanders caused a bit of a stir this week because the guy who for years has been saying we've had enough of our country being run by millionaires and billionaires revealed that he is, in fact, a millionaire - which is surprising because most millionaires can afford haircuts.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: We should have known things were changing for him economically when his stump speech changed to (imitating Bernie Sanders) we've had enough of our country being run by billionaires and zillionaires.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: But Bernie has promised not to enjoy the money because in his entire life, he has never enjoyed anything.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I just can't believe he got rich from writing a book because everybody I know who's written a book is so broke.
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: And also, like, what can you buy in Vermont for a millionaire?
BODDEN: I think with a million dollars in Vermont, you can buy, like, half of Vermont.
SAGAL: It's true.
HIGGINS: Yeah.
SAGAL: By the way, this is all in preparation for Bernie releasing his tax returns. Did you know that Bernie has not released his tax returns? Didn't do it in 2016. He says he's going to do it next week. He's the perfect candidate for people who both hate President Trump and are kind of jealous of Republicans for having him. Why can't liberals have an angry, old man with terrible hair who won't release his tax returns?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: I'm sitting here, Peter, trying to think of a joke that shows I care about rich, white men, but I've got nothing.
SAGAL: I know.
(LAUGHTER, CHEERING)
BODDEN: I've got...
FARSAD: It's tough.
BODDEN: I've got - listen. It's one more time...
FARSAD: I know.
BODDEN: ...White people complaining about, oh, man, I'd have made a million dollars. I don't know how to help you on that one.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Good luck with that. Yeah.
SAGAL: Megan, here is your last quote.
KURTIS: Einstein must be totally chuffed.
SAGAL: That was a very happy astronomer quoted in The New York Times talking about the first-ever photograph ever made of a what?
DOHERTY: A black hole.
SAGAL: A black hole.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: This week, we got to look at the first-ever photo of an actual massive, interstellar black hole in a galaxy known as Messier 87 about 55 million light years away. It looks like a - well, a black hole surrounded by a ring of orange light like the eye of Sauron or a...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Really, really evil bagel.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Nonetheless, the photo was a scientific triumph. It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen - except for the people who asked for photos of their colonoscopies. Interestingly...
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Wait, is that what...
SAGAL: It made us think of that - all I can tell you.
FARSAD: How many colonoscopy...
BODDEN: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Photos...
BODDEN: I guess.
FARSAD: ...Do you look at, Peter?
SAGAL: Well, you know.
FARSAD: (Laughter).
SAGAL: Interestingly - and this is pretty cool - because of the time it takes the light to get here - 55 million years - the photo is the black hole when it was much younger than it is now. So what do you know? The black hole is just like everyone on Tinder.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: My first thought when I saw that photo was, like, wow, that's a really great use of portrait mode...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...You know? So the...
BODDEN: That's why really - I really feel happy for those astrophysicists and the other science - the geniuses who spend their whole life studying and working, and they can finally say, that's what I do. This is what I do. Like...
SAGAL: Here you go.
BODDEN: People have always - what do you do at work?
(APPLAUSE)
BODDEN: This is what I do.
SAGAL: And this is really cool. It turns out that in order to take this picture of this extraordinarily distant object that there's no single telescope that's strong enough to do it. So they had to get data from telescopes all around the world and combine them in an incredibly complicated way figured out by a 29-year-old astrophysicist named Rachel (ph).
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: And they say that the precision of this virtual instrument they created was so precise they could see an orange on the moon - which makes you say, why are they going on about a black hole? There are oranges on the moon.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: When I was reading about this, I read, like, if you were - they were trying to explain what happens if you go into the black hole.
SAGAL: Right.
FARSAD: And so you pass through the event horizon unscathed. And then you get to this point where the black hole stretches you like a noodle.
SAGAL: Yes.
FARSAD: Which, for a minute, I was, like, I'm OK with that as someone...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...Who might use, like, body distortion filters on...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Insta...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...That, like, you kind of go...
SAGAL: For a...
FARSAD: ...Like, your skinniest.
SAGAL: For an instant, a microsecond...
FARSAD: Yeah, for a microsecond...
SAGAL: You'll finally be a size one.
FARSAD: You're, like, super tall and skinny.
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: Exactly. That's kind of into that.
SAGAL: Yeah. That would be cool.
HIGGINS: But then do you just disintegrate?
FARSAD: And then you're dead.
HIGGINS: Worth it.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Megan do on our quiz?
KURTIS: She got them all right. She is a winner.
SAGAL: Megan, thank you so much for playing.
(APPLAUSE)
DOHERTY: Thank you.
SAGAL: Bye-bye.
DOHERTY: Goodbye.

Not My Job: We Quiz Journalist Dan Rather On What He Actually Said,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712576151/not-my-job-we-quiz-journalist-dan-rather-on-what-he-actually-said?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Robin Marchant/Getty Images for AWXI Robin Marchant/Getty Images for AWXI We recorded the show in San Antonio, Texas, this week and invited journalist Dan Rather — Texas native and resident — to play our quiz. In addition to reporting on pretty much every major event of the last half century, Rather is also famous for ""Ratherisms"" — folksy sayings combining colorful metaphors with colorful wisdom. He's used so many of them, we're curious to see if he can pick out what he really said from the ones that we just made up.
Click the audio link above to hear how he does.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
And now the game where people live a rich, full life and yet somehow end up with us.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: If all the major events of the late 20th century had a single thing in common, it might be this. They were reported on by Dan Rather. He was at Dealey Plaza...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...When Kennedy was shot. He reported from Vietnam. He challenged Nixon on Watergate. He covered the Cold War and was there to cover its end. He is a proud Texas native and still a resident. We are honored to have him with us.
Dan Rather, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
DAN RATHER: Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: So you still have a home here in Texas. You grew up here in Texas. You're a Texan.
RATHER: I was born in Wharton, Texas. I grew up in Houston, and I'm not just from Texas. I am of Texas.
SAGAL: You are a Texan.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You started - and it turns out that many reporters, including Bill, started this way. You were a local guy. You - at one - you were doing minor league baseball games at one point.
RATHER: I did. I once - I've always been interested in news. But once to supplement my income at its lower levels, you know, broadcasting doesn't pay all that well. So I did play-by-play as a way of supplementing my income. I did play-by-play football and baseball, basketball, track. Track is really difficult to do play-by-play from...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Wait a minute. How would you do that? Well, he's running.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He seems to be running more.
RATHER: Or he's vaulting, or he has this shot put in his hand. And he takes five steps, and he throws.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Do you think there's one moment that - in which you sort of got your start that started your career that we've all sort of been watching lo these many decades?
RATHER: Well, I do. That - there was a great hurricane in 1961, Hurricane Carla, which was at that time and I think still the largest in terms of sheer size hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico. And I had just started in television. I had made my move from radio into television. I was still new to television. And we wound up in the right place at the right time on Galveston Island as the hurricane came in. And that was picked up by other stations. Nobody else was there broadcasting. So if I had to point to one moment that sort of, quote, ""made my career,"" that was probably it.
SAGAL: Yeah, it's funny because Bill got his sort of start with a great tornado in Kansas.
BILL KURTIS: Tornado - same thing. You have to be there.
SAGAL: It turns out maybe these weather events are being caused by ambitious, young reporters.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You were known and - for many things but certainly for being fearless, not only the places you went, like war zones, but also the way you treated people in power. There was a famous incident where you got up, and you asked President Nixon a question. It was during Watergate. And he didn't like it. And I believe he said, are you running for something? And your famous response was...
RATHER: No, sir, Mr. President. Are you?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's pretty good. You, of course, took over as the anchor of the ""CBS Evening News,"" taking the baton from Walter Cronkite, another legend who, I guess, took it from Edward R. Murrow. So you're part of that line. And one of the things that people were noticing as you settled into that role was you were looking for your signoff because famously, of course, Cronkite would end his broadcast, well, that's the way it is on this day.
RATHER: Right.
SAGAL: And what was your thinking? You said, I needed something different? You needed something for yourself?
RATHER: Well, it was suggested to me that you need a signoff.
SAGAL: Yeah.
RATHER: But you know what? Following a legend like that is not the easiest thing in the world (laughter). At any rate, my first suggestion was maybe I can say, well, that's some of the way it is.
SAGAL: Yeah, OK. That's not bad.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Nobody took to that idea. We tried to. But at any rate...
SAGAL: That's the way it might be.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Doesn't have quite the same ring.
SAGAL: No, not at all.
RATHER: But at any rate, I was thinking, you know, my father's - late father's favorite word was courage for a lot of reasons. So I thought, well, maybe we could just pause and say, you know, and that's the ""CBS Evening News"" - Dan Rather reporting courage. And the more I thought about it, the more I kind of liked it because it had a nostalgic ring for me. I will say that the executives in the company were horrified that this whole...
SAGAL: Really.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: So it lasted about a week. And at the end of that week, it was pretty much you either stop using this as a signoff, or we stop using you.
SAGAL: Whoa.
RATHER: So it was an easy decision.
SAGAL: I understand. And what did you change to?
RATHER: I just decided not to have one.
SAGAL: Yeah, just went with the plain goodnight.
RATHER: I've giving it my best shot, didn't work out. So we...
SAGAL: There you go. I know. Hey, we could talk to you about your career all night, but out of all the people you've interviewed - and you interviewed just about every, you know, major historical player in the last 50 years - was there a particular favorite, somebody who you were glad to talk to?
RATHER: Well, I'm glad you put the preface because let's face it - I've been lucky and mightily blessed. I could give you the names maybe seven people. But if I had to pick one, it would be I was assigned - my first major assignment for CBS News was to cover Dr. Martin Luther King and what was then the emerging civil rights movement.
(APPLAUSE)
RATHER: Covering Dr. King changed me as a professional, and it changed me as a person. And for that reason, I would say if I had to pick one, I would say interviewing Dr. Martin Luther King and covering him day to day for almost two years.
SAGAL: Wow. Sure. I imagine that's - I'm envious that you had the chance.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Do you ever - when you're watching whomever, do you ever, like, miss it? Are you ever like, if I was there, I would have the questions?
RATHER: Like every second.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I can imagine. Well, Dan Rather, it is an absolute honor to talk to you, but today we have, in fact, asked you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: This game is tougher than the hide of an armadillo in the hot sun that forgot its sunblock.
SAGAL: As I'm sure you know, you are famous for what people call Ratherisms, folksy sayings with colorful metaphors and colorful wisdom. You've used so many of them over your career. We want to see if you can pick the one you actually came up with....
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...From some fake ones that we made up in tribute to you. So if you can do that two times out of three, you'll win a prize for one of our listeners.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, who is Dan Rather playing for?
KURTIS: Corey Henderstine (ph) of Washington, D.C.
SAGAL: All right. Here's your first Ratherism. This was when you were covering the 2000 election. And did you say, A, this race is tight like a too-small bathing suit in a too-long ride home from the beach...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, Poppa, wear your good suit because we got ourselves a tie...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, this race is tighter than Aunt Tilly after a third Moscow Mule.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Definitely A.
SAGAL: It was definitely A.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: I've always wondered before we move - did you just make those up off the top of your head? Or did you, like, have them ready to go?
RATHER: Well, in the beginning, they came from working in the oil fields when I was a kid. This is the way men talk with one another.
SAGAL: You have got to be kidding me.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Oh, absolutely. You know, you can only say it's hot as hell so many times.
SAGAL: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: So as the day wears on, you say, you know, it's hotter than a Laredo parking lot or some way to use colorful language.
SAGAL: All right. We have two more. You did well with that one. This is now - we're moving through time to the election of 2004. That was George W. Bush re-elected versus John Kerry. During that evening's coverage on CBS, did you say, A, John Kerry's wife might own Heinz, but this is one night he won't catch up...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, we used to say if a frog had side pockets, he'd carry a handgun; or C, it all comes down to O-H-I-O, which stands for, oh, hi, it's over.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Definitely B.
SAGAL: Yes, if a frog...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...Had side pockets, he'd carry a handgun. I think you're doing really well.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Here's your last question. This is a great metaphor you used while commenting on the 2016 election. Was it, A, this race is a back country tilt-a-whirl - it could go either way; B, like the talking horse said to the hopping bull, I can't believe what I'm seeing...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, if Clinton wins Florida, this race will go faster than a ""Hamilton"" ticket at face value.
RATHER: I don't recall saying any of those.
SAGAL: Really? Do you know which one you wish you had said?
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: I guess that would be B.
SAGAL: You'd be B, like the talking horse said to the hopping bull. It is a good one, but the one that we were told you said if Clinton wins Florida, this race will go faster than a ""Hamilton"" ticket at face value, which I thought was great because you're updating your cultural references.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Meanwhile, Bill, how did your old friend Dan do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Well, he had won anyway. Two out of three is a big win for us.
(APPLAUSE)
KURTIS: Good going.
SAGAL: Dan Rather is a legend of broadcast news and the creator of News and Guts Media. The new season of ""The Big Interview With Dan Rather"" starts April 16 at 8 p.m. on AXS.
Dan Rather, thank you for being with us. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Dan Rather, everyone.
RATHER: Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""(AIN’T THAT) GOOD NEWS"")
SAM COOKE: (Singing) Ain't that good news? Man, ain't that news? Baby's coming home tomorrow.
SAGAL: In just a minute, we finally settle that whole cat versus dog debate in our Listener Limerick Challenge. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on the air. We'll be back in a minute with more of WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME from NPR.

Mueller Report: Wait Almost Over Fore Release Of Redacted Report : NPR,www.npr.org,Jessica Taylor,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/712914976/the-wait-is-almost-over-for-the-almost-full-mueller-report-to-be-released,"Enlarge this image Activists participate in a Release the Report rally in Times Square on April 4 in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Drew Angerer/Getty Images Activists participate in a Release the Report rally in Times Square on April 4 in New York City.
Drew Angerer/Getty Images Democrats in Congress and an overwhelming majority of the American public are eagerly awaiting the expected release this week of the Mueller report.
First came the wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to conclude his investigation on Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election . That happened three weeks ago, but after Attorney General William Barr released a four-page summary of the nearly 400-page report, there has been a new anticipation — and growing acrimony — for the report to be released to members of Congress and the public. But even when the report is released, it's unlikely the politically divisive debate that has been the hallmark of President Trump's tenure in office will be resolved.
Politics READ: The Justice Department's Summary Of The Mueller Report Barr's summary letter on March 24, two days after Mueller delivered his report to the new attorney general, was met with glee from the White House, as he wrote that the lengthy investigation did not find that the Trump campaign ""conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.""
National Security Mueller Report Doesn't Find Russian Collusion, But Can't 'Exonerate' On Obstruction The president and most Republicans saw that rundown of Mueller's major findings as "" complete and total exoneration ,"" even though Mueller did not take a position on whether Trump obstructed justice , given his comments and actions around the ongoing investigation. Rather, Mueller's team wrote, according to Barr , that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""
Politics Democrats Demand Full Mueller Report, Lay Out Argument For Continued Investigations Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, however, concluded that Mueller's finding were ""not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."" But given what little Democrats have seen of Mueller's findings, they want more answers on exactly how the Justice Department came to that conclusion. Barr said he would release more of the report but would need time to make the necessary redactions before it could be made public.
Politics House Judiciary Approves Subpoena For Full Mueller Report In Party-Line Vote Key House Democrats didn't want to wait and had initially demanded it be made public by April 2. But Barr responded , saying he thought he could complete any redactions by ""mid-April, if not sooner,"" and the release anticipated for this week does hit that promised timeline. However, soon after that update from Barr, the House Judiciary Committee, along a party-line vote, authorized a subpoena for the full report and its underlying investigative evidence. Barr has said he's willing to testify before the House and Senate judiciary committees in early May.
National Security Barr: Mueller Report Out Within 1 Week; IG Report On Russia Inquiry This Summer Barr was on Capitol Hill last week testifying before a panel of the House Appropriations Committee on unrelated budget matters, and he was clear that he didn't want to talk much about the Mueller report — but Democrats certainly did. The attorney general indicated that he would be open to negotiating with congressional leaders who want to see Mueller's underlying evidence once the report is released.
National Security Citing 'Spying' On Trump, Barr Says He Is Looking Into Origins Of Russia Inquiry Then, the next day, before a panel of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Barr stoked a whole new controversy when he said he'd launched his own informal inquiry into the origins of the FBI's initial counterintelligence investigation into Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign, which began the summer of that year at the height of the White House race. Trump has often pointed to this as evidence of bias, and Barr seemed to concur, saying that ""spying did occur"" on the then-nominee's campaign — a claim Trump has regularly made without evidence. Later in the hearing, Barr clarified that he has no ""specific evidence"" of such surveillance but that he has ""questions about it"" and ""concerns about various aspects of it.""
All of that suggests the controversy is likely to be far from over even when the redacted, lengthy Mueller report is released. Here are other lingering questions:
What else could Mueller's report reveal about Trump and Russia? What will Mueller's Russia report mean for election security in 2020? After Barr's letter, what more does the public want?

Nam Y. Huh/AP Updated at 3:26 p.m. ET
When Molly Hewitt left South Bend, Ind., for college, she didn't think she'd return to live there again. Since the 1960s, the city had suffered the same brain drain that plagued many other Midwestern cities faced with industrial decline.
""The goal was always to be successful enough that you don't have to come back to South Bend,"" she said.
But while she was away, things were turning around. Hewitt's parents kept her in the loop and she decided to give another chance to the city led by Democratic mayor Pete Buttigieg.
""I came back, honestly because of Pete and I've seen a lot of my friends do that and a lot of people who didn't grow up here that want to come to South Bend,"" she said. Now Hewitt is 23, living in South Bend and volunteering for the campaign of James Mueller , the candidate Buttigieg endorsed to replace him in this year's mayoral election.
Buttigieg, 37, officially announced his candidacy for the presidency on Sunday. On the campaign trail he speaks a lot about how being mayor of South Bend since 2012 has prepared him to be president.
""We transformed the trajectory of our city,"" Buttigieg said in an interview on Morning Edition in January. ""This is a community that was written off as dying at the beginning of this decade. Now it's growing again.""
South Bend's population is up more than 1,000 people since 2010 following decades of hemorrhaging tens of thousands of residents.
Investment in the city's downtown, public private partnerships, economic development — including turning the long vacant Studebaker auto plant , which closed its doors in 1963, into a tech hub — have been credited with the change.

Editor's note: This story contains language that some may find offensive.
A lawyer and her future son-in-law argue furiously about politics on Facebook, each accusing the other of ignoring ""the facts.""
A newly married couple gets into an uncomfortably heated argument as they watch the confirmation hearings of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, until one finally leaves the room. ""I love you, but you're wrong,"" she says.
A Mexican-American college student argues with her Trump-supporting mother — also Mexican-American — about how she could possibly accept the idea of a border wall.
These, of course, are not isolated stories: Political differences can drive a wedge through even the closest families and friendships. A 2017 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of respondents said the 2016 election had caused them to end a relationship with a friend or relative. Nearly 40 percent said the election had provoked at least one argument with a loved one.
More broadly, Americans say they're worried that the United States is growing more polarized and that civility — respect, courtesy, kindness — is slipping away in many aspects of their lives. From road rage to Twitter feuds to the rancor at the highest levels of government, polls show that Americans think incivility is at crisis levels.
Recently, NPR has been traveling the country to explore how people are grappling with the idea of civility in polarizing times.
Here are five stories about the shaky line that people walk to keep things civil — or not — in their most intimate relationships. 'I Love You, But You're Wrong'
When Patricia ""P."" Price met Simone Perry in 2016, she was surprised when Simone told her she was Republican. As P. explains, ""Black, lesbian and Republican — it doesn't go in the same sentence."" They got married a year later, and Simone Perry became Simone Price. Loading...
Simone, who initially supported Ted Cruz and voted for Gary Johnson in 2016, says P. is more interested in ""how I carry myself and how I treat people than who I support politically."" P., a Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, says Simone is much more engaged in politics than she is and wins 90 percent of their political debates.
But several months ago, a debate flared into a fight that P. was not willing to concede. The confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court were on TV, and P. says she was ""completely turned off"" by his demeanor.
Simone, on the other hand, sympathized with Kavanaugh's need to defend himself. She remembers asking P., ""If someone we love is ever accused of something, are we going to grant them the benefit of the doubt?""
The argument got angry, uncomfortable. Both women say they often use prayer or meditation to calm themselves if they're fighting, but this political moment called for more immediate action: When P. felt she couldn't take it anymore, she walked out and went upstairs. The Fight Stays On Facebook
Christopher Kilpatrick and Cheryl Hume are about as politically different as two people can be. Chris, 38, describes himself as a ""far-right kind of guy"" who voted for Trump. Cheryl, his 58-year-old future mother-in-law, voted for Hillary Clinton and donates to causes like refugee resettlement and prisoner re-entry programs. They see each other only a few times a year but connect frequently on Facebook, where they clash overeverything from Trump's border wall to the latest conspiracy theory.

Their back-and-forth can get barbed — they sometimes attack each other for being ignorant — but before things get too nasty, one of them changes the subject. ""How's Kathy doing?"" Cheryl might ask.
Kathy is Chris' fiancée and Cheryl's foster daughter. Both Chris and Cheryl say it's their mutual love for Kathy that helps them put their political differences in perspective.
When the family gets together, Chris and Cheryl say, they avoid talking politics, partly to spare Kathy the misery of playing referee, but partly, they say, because they genuinely enjoy each other's company. Chris calls Cheryl ""big hearted,"" and Cheryl describes Chris as a ""good guy.""
But when they return home from a family gathering, Chris and Cheryl retreat to their respective corners on social media and resume sparring. Happily for them, Kathy doesn't pay that much attention to Facebook. Loading... The Reluctant Mediator
Lorraine Bank, 67, says she thinks her children were raised right and ""instilled with good values."" But somewhere along the way — through school, TV or the workplace — she thinks her two daughters ""got brainwashed."" Politically, the sisters lean liberal, while Lorraine is a staunch conservative. She says she and her husband mention Trump often enough so their children ""know we think he's a good president, but we don't rub it in.""
That's not always enough for daughter Valerie, 28, who voted for Clinton in 2016. She says she has to steel herself when she visits her parents.
""I do breathing exercises,"" she says. ""Before I get into a conversation, I give myself a pep talk and say, 'I'm going to keep calm, I'm not going to engage, and if someone tries to bait me, I'm not going to take the bait.' ""
Sometimes she has a few drinks to calm herself down. If all else fails, she leaves the room.
For the past few years, Valerie has had to deal with an additional family stress: Her older sister, Sarah, stopped talking to their mother after a serious fight. (Sarah declined to participate in this story.)
As their mother, Lorraine, tells it, after a series of political disagreements, she and Sarah got into a ""final straw"" argument about gay marriage shortly before the 2016 election.At one point, Lorraine referred to gay people as ""fags,"" and although she says she later apologized, Sarah still refuses to speak to her.
""I pray every day that whatever is wrong, she can get over it and she'll wake up and know we still love her,"" Lorraine says.
Now, on the few family occasions where everyone is together, Sarah won't interact directly with her mother. Valerie plays the reluctant mediator, trying to knit together a conversation between two people who can no longer find the words. Loading... From 'Oh Crap' To A Lasting Friendship
In 2016, Michael Beale and Francesco Mazza were assigned to be freshman roommates at High Point University in North Carolina. And before they met, they each formed an instant impression of the other.

Michael remembers that Francesco was wearing a bright red ""Make America Great Again"" hat in his Facebook profile photo.
""And I thought to myself, 'Oh crap, I gotta live with this kid for a year,' "" Michael says.
Francesco recalls that Michael's Facebook page had a picture of Bob Marley on it.
""So I'm like, 'Jesus, Mary and Joseph, he's probably like some hippie liberal,' "" Francesco recalls. (Michael actually voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson. And for the record, he doesn't remember a Bob Marley picture: ""It was probably me at a Grateful Dead concert,"" he says.)
Despite their respective knee-jerk reactions, both men decided to approach the year with open-mindedness — a trait that helped them avoid arguments and eventually build a friendship that has sustained to this day. Now 21-year-old juniors, the two recently returned from a spring break trip to Florida.
And almost since the day they met, they haven't been afraid to debate politics. 'Love Your Enemies' ... And Maaaybe You'll Get Them To Agree With You
""Michael will ask how I think Trump is doing,"" says Francesco. ""If I think he's doing something stupid, I'll say so.""
Francesco, the son of a police officer, grew up around guns in Norristown, Pa. Michael was raised in Connecticut near Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a devastating mass shooting made him wonder why anyone would own a gun.
Whenever there's a shooting in the news, they find themselves going back and forth about gun policy. Like many of their political debates, these conversations can be eye-opening — but rarely, they admit, mind changing. Loading... 'We Go Slowly, Trying Not To Hurt Each Other'
Nancy Richer, a 55-year-old Mexican-American, was born in Texas and spent half of her life in Mexico. Her daughter, Daniela Garduno, 19, was born in Mexico but grew up mostly north of the border. Each woman says she feels a stronger pull to one side of the Mexican-American hyphen: Nancy identifies more with her American side, Daniela with her Mexican side. Loading...
And that can cause tension. Daniela is against the border wall, while her mother supports it.
Nancy says she is proud of her older friends who went through the immigration process legally: ""They had to wait 18 years. They had to pay. They had to go through all the process,"" she says. ""Why not the others?""
Daniela says she's confused that her mother, a Trump supporter, ""can be Mexican and at the same time advocate for rights that are very anti-immigrant, anti-Latino."" She says she sometimes regrets that she and her mother aren't more politically aligned and can't have the relaxed, head-nodding conversations that some of her school friends have with their parents.
At the same time, both mother and daughter say they try to be respectful of each other's opinions, which helps keep their political arguments to a gentle roar.
""When I'm having these issues with my mom,"" Daniela says, ""I'll distance myself from the political part of it — I separate my mother from the politics.""
Of her daughter, Nancy says, ""When I see that she's responding as if I'm attacking her — instead of her points of view — that's when I stop. ... We go slowly, trying not to hurt each other."" Facebook"
Watch BTS Further Its Quest For World Domination On The 'SNL' Stage,www.npr.org,Stephen Thompson,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2019/04/14/712797129/watch-bts-further-its-quest-for-world-domination-on-the-snl-stage,"YouTube A multilingual K-pop juggernaut, BTS mashes up pop, hip-hop, rock and dance music with huge, infectious energy and kinetic choreography. It's one of the biggest bands in the world, and as of this weekend, it's got a Saturday Night Live performance under its belt, too. The South Korean septet has built a fan base that's broad (its videos are viewed many hundreds of millions of times each), deep (its fans tend to be intensely devoted, especially on social media) and fully worldwide (its new record, Map of the Soul: Persona, is almost certain to top the U.S. album charts this week).
Every generation gets its own crop of boy bands, but BTS feels like an unusually potent force: Its sound seems to straddle the whole world, the songs are catchy as anything and each member brings enormous charisma to the mix. Lots of bands can seem strangely diminished by the SNL stage on TV, but on Saturday night, BTS filled every inch of the frame with flashy motion — tight choreography, bright colors, bold energy — as it performed ""Boy With Luv"" (from Map of the Soul: Persona ) and ""MIC Drop"" (first heard on 2017's Love Yourself: Her ).
YouTube That BTS has crossed over into the U.S. mainstream pop-cultural consciousness is no surprise; the group has been ascending for years amid a prolific burst of thematically ambitious albums and EPs. But this new surge feels like a genuine tipping point: The SNL appearance dominated social media all weekend, and BTS will drop another heavily hyped spectacle at the Billboard Music Awards on May 1. The group will team up with Halsey — a guest on the studio version of ""Boy With Luv"" — for the latter performance, the news of which broke during commercials Saturday night. Twitter was extremely excited, so strap in: SNL was just the beginning."

In the last couple decades, South Carolina has emerged as an important early state primary. NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks to Jaime Harrison, associate chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
More Democrats have piled into the 2020 presidential race. Representative Eric Swalwell announced this past Monday. Cory Booker made it official yesterday. And Mayor Pete Buttigieg plans an announcement later today. Almost 20 people are scrambling for momentum in a crowded field. And while Iowa and New Hampshire have received outsized attention as the earliest presidential contests, South Carolina is a pivotal early state for candidates. It's the first state contest with a sizable African-American voting bloc. And black voters are expected to cast the majority of votes in the Democratic primary. It's early, but we asked Jaime Harrison, who's getting voters excited in South Carolina? He's exploring a run against Senator Lindsey Graham in 2020. And he's a former party chair and longtime Democratic politico.
JAIME HARRISON: Nobody has decided that they're married to anybody as of yet. And that's because the field is not set yet. You know, you got folks that are still out there, like Joe Biden, who has a long history in South Carolina. But right now there's a lot of energy for a lot of candidates. But I would say in particular right now there's a lot of buzz about Cory Booker - Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris. And we're seeing growing buzz with Pete Buttigieg. And again, you know, as folks come into the state and start to build out their operations, I think we'll see a number of shifts over the course of the next few months.
PFEIFFER: What are the issues that you think will resonate most with South Carolina voters?
HARRISON: Well, the first thing is - and the issues part is a really, really important thing. You know, right now in South Carolina we are a state where the Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid, where 300,000 people could be covered by health care right now. And as a result, they're not. So health care is a big issue. Education is a big issue. The quality of schools - South Carolina, in our constitution, has that all that the state is obligated to provide is a minimally adequate education. That's what's in our constitution. And so therefore, you see these disparities in terms of education in rural communities and in communities of color. It's something that Jim Clyburn, who is the majority whip and our highest ranking Democrat in the state, and myself as a candidate for the United States Senate is - we're going to focus on, and we're going to ask the candidates to focus on as they come here to South Carolina as well.
PFEIFFER: Do you see generational differences mattering in this election, particularly in terms of what it would take to get younger voters to the polls?
HARRISON: Well, I do see some generational differences. And we saw those in the '16 cycle as well. You know, you take, for instance, the issue of the crime bill. That was a big issue between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. You know, crime during the '80s and '90s was just seen very differently, you know, by these young - by the younger generations now - millennials and younger - as opposed to older generations that were going through that period in time and saw all of the impact that drugs was having on their communities. And I think on those type of issues, there will be some generational differences. You even see it on the issue like reparations. You're seeing some generational differences in terms of how older African-Americans look at the issue and how younger generations of African-Americans are approaching the issue. But, you know, just based on who has voted in the past, we know that African-American women are the highest performing demographic not only in South Carolina but across the nation and will really play a dominant role in determining who the nominee is coming out of South Carolina.
PFEIFFER: Right now the frontrunner in polling is believed to be Bernie Sanders. This is an older candidate. This is a candidate who, obviously, has a big generational divide with younger voters. Anything in particular you think Sanders would need to do to appeal to black voters in South Carolina?
HARRISON: Listen. You know, Bernie Sanders has gone through this presidential primary before. And he understands what's at stake and what he has to do in order to appeal to folks that he wasn't able to convince the last time around. And I've seen some changes in terms of how he's addressing the issues. It's not just about economic inequalities but also addressing some of the racial disparities that come along with it. And that is a marked shift in the Bernie Sanders that I saw in 2016.
PFEIFFER: That's Jaime Harrison. He's associate chairman of the Democratic National Committee and former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party.
Jaime, thank you.

'Debatable' List Of '100 Most Jewish' Foods Leaves Plenty Of Room For Kibbitzing : The Salt : NPR,www.npr.org,Alana Newhouse,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/14/711014732/debatable-list-of-100-most-jewish-foods-leaves-plenty-of-room-for-kibbitzing,"Enlarge this image Challah, borscht and a bialy are among the items listed in The 100 Most Jewish Foods.

Noah Fecks/The 100 Most Jewish Foods It's hard to talk about Jewish culture without talking about food. The bagels, the brisket, the babka. Oh, the babka.
Ask anyone who is spending this weekend filling their freezer with matzo balls for the upcoming Passover Seder, and they'll tell you that food is intertwined with Jewish culture and history — to the point,where it can become a theology in and of itself, the stage on which all sorts of Jewish values are performed. It's not surprising to learn that the code of Jewish law is called the Shulchan Aruch — the set table. And that the commentary on the book is the Mappah — the tablecloth. But that said, what exactly does it mean for a food to be Jewish ?
Alana Newhouse, editor of Tablet Magazine , the online journal which brands itself as a new read on Jewish life, attempts to answer this question (or operate from the place of having answered it) with a newly published book, The 100 Most Jewish Foods: A Highly Debatable List . In a series of short essays, contributors wax on about dishes from Mitteleuropa to the Middle East, probing through lines of history and sentiment (and making a collective case as to why the latter may be more important than the former).
From the outset (well, actually from the subtitle), Newhouse acknowledges this is loaded territory.
""This is not a list of today's most popular Jewish foods, or someone's idea of the tastiest, or even the most enduring,"" Newhouse lays out in the introduction. ""What's here, instead, are the foods that contain the deepest Jewish significance — the ones that, throughout the history of our people (however you date it), have been most profoundly inspired by the rhythms of the Jewish calendar and the contingencies of the Jewish experience.""
Significance and profound inspiration can of course be in the eye (or stomach) of the beholder. But the list is admirable. Sure, we could quibble with some of the choices (say, omitting Crisco's fine Jewish history ). But the book details what are clearly the greatest hits: the deli stalwarts, the Israeli favorites, the convenience foods that targeted the kosher market and became ingrained in diaspora tradition. Or, as Newhouse puts it, ""the salty, the sweet, the dense, the light, the beautiful, and the undeniably brown, stretching back over thousands of years of civilization and from nearly every region of the planet.""
But for those looking for a full picture of the histories and resonances of the particular foods that made the list — well, they may be somewhat disappointed.
This book grew out of an online project, and often it shows. Like a lot of quick turnaround writing of the Internet age, many pieces in this book are lightly sourced, and some more about clever constructions (that, say, some of the top bagel joints aren't run by Jews) than deeper-level history and fact (many of them still are, also: *Talmudic shrug*).

Amazon Independent Booksellers Zac Posen's article on borscht simply tells you that it is pink, and he developed a recipe for it, and life has sweet and sour moments. ( Lea Zeltserman thankfully comes in with a beautiful meditation on how this food, which defines Russian-Jewish cuisine, actually fits into the stories and tables of those Jews who lived through the Soviet era). And fine fish chef Eric Ripert weighs in on gefilte fish, just to ultimately tell you that it is ... not that bad?
More troubling are the entries that not only sidestep the rich stories of how particular foods became ""Jewish,"" but consciously disregard these histories in a deliberate attempt to nationalize them. Writer Liel Leibovitz urges readers to ""Forget the heated arguments about [hummus'] true national origins,"" because all you need to know is that it's the official dip of the NFL. And his entry for shakshuka shrugs, ""So what if the Moroccans make it, too. Never mind that the Tunisians eat it for breakfast each weekend, or that it delights the Greeks and satiates the Algerians: Shakshuka is Israeli now."" These are clearly attempts to be cheeky (humor being a fine Jewish value), but the glib gloss on appropriation can be difficult to stomach. As is editor Alana Newhouse's essay joking that terrible store-bought cookies served at temple are more of a threat to American Judaism than the BDS movement calling for an economic boycott to force Israel to recognize Palestinian statehood.
That said, there are some beautiful meditations on food and family and feeling within these pages. Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett writes an homage to everything that could be made from the whole chickens her mother and grandmother would get from the kosher butcher. The feet ended up enriching soup (after careful cleaning and prepping); the neck bones would add flavor and bits of meat to the broth; the neck skin would be stuffed with filling and sewn up with white cotton thread. The bird itself would be roasted to golden-crisp perfection, while the eyerlekh , the unhatched chicken eggs found inside freshly slaughtered chickens, would be floated in soup. (Because of salmonella-testing regulations, they aren't easily found anymore.)
There are stories of beloved grandmothers, of the wealth of Yiddish words for dill, and of the surprising role of sugar cereals in Orthodox homes. (They're a Sabbath morning treat, when religious prohibitions on work mean adherents can't cook the usual hot breakfast.) Leah Koenig (who provides context and commentary throughout the book) explains how after the destruction of the temple, religious rites were transferred to the Sabbath table, making breads like challah akin to a divine offering. And MaNishtana reflects on the special resonances of a Seder meal — and the mortar of charoset in particular — for African American Jews, for whom the legacy of slavery is lived on a daily basis.
There are also the personal recollections that are downright hilarious — like Josh Malina 's story of his grandmother's gribenes (chicken skin cracklings), and his own adoption thereof. (""For an elegant vegetarian version, simply don't eat anything at all."") And Wayne Hoffman serves up a pitch-perfect ode to the (shared) used tea bag on his parents' kitchen counter.
The book comes with 60 recipes, but that's almost beside the point. (And who can agree on the definitive version anyways?) This is about how food is tied up in sentiment, and the role it can play in life. These are the stories of snacks people ate when they came home from school, memories from the holiday table, treats from the sorts of bakeries that don't exist anymore. Its very existence is an engagement in the fine Jewish tradition of debate, and there is clearly room for the arguments to continue. But The 100 Most Jewish Foods is also a love letter — to food, family, faith and identity, and the deliciously tangled way they come together."

Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, is led by a Hindu priest and has banned the consumption of beef and changed some city names to reflect Hindu heritage.
Altaf Qadri/AP Indian elections are often called the world's largest exercise in democracy. This month, nearly 900 million voters are eligible to cast ballots in national elections that started Thursday and will continue for more than five weeks.
They are deciding whether or not to re-elect Prime Minister Narendra Modi and members of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP.
Their votes will also make clear the country's level of support for a growing trend in India's politics: Hindu nationalism.
""The shape of India is at stake,"" says Milan Vaishnav, who directs the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C. ""One of the important things this election is going to determine is India's future as a secular republic that embraces pluralism and adheres to the founders' notion that India's unity is strengthened by its diversity.""
Asia Polls Open In The World's Largest Democracy: Fun Facts On India's Election Modi's record has been mixed: In his five years in office, India's economy has grown robustly , but unemployment has also risen to a 40-year high. There was an outbreak of violence this winter, when India exchanged airstrikes with its arch-rival and nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan.
There has also been an elevation of Hindu-centric policy and discourse. Supporters call it Hindu pride, or Hindutva — Hindu-ness, the feeling of being Hindu. Others call it Hindu nationalism, an ideology of Hindu hegemony — and a danger to the republic.

Altaf Qadri/AP While Hinduism is India's majority religion ( almost 80 percent of Indians are Hindu), Hindu nationalism is political. It's the idea that Hindu faith and culture should help shape the state and its policies — and it negates the contributions of others.
Hindu nationalism has roots in the 19th century, when it emerged as a backlash to the ideas of liberal Hindu reformers, British and Portuguese colonialism and Christian missionaries. It has gained prominence in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, especially under Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP.
But it's often at odds with the secularism enshrined in India's constitution. Many see this election as a turning point in which India may decide to redefine itself according to its majority Hindu faith.
Beef bans, politician-monks, new names
The last five years under Modi have seen shifts, both gradual and not, as Hindu nationalists have grown increasingly assertive, inserting their priorities into Indian policy, laws and daily life.
Minority groups are shunted out or subordinated. As long as the majority is in the ascendency, it doesn't really matter what the conditions for minorities are.
Historian Romila Thapa
The ideology of a Hindu nationalist group called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — where Modi spent his formative years — has become especially prominent in recent years. The RSS is an all-male Hindu volunteer corps that says it aims to promote Hinduism in civic life. But its critics accuse it of stirring hatred and violence toward India's minorities.
One RSS priority that has become law in several Indian states in recent years is a ban on cow slaughter and the consumption or sale of beef. Hindus consider cows sacred. Police enforce the bans, punishable with up to 10 years in jail in some states or municipal fines in others.

Rajesh Kumar Singh/AP But self-appointed cow vigilantes — laypeople, sometimes affiliated with the RSS or BJP — have also taken it upon themselves to investigate and sometimes attack and even kill people suspected of dealing in beef on the black market.
The victims are often Muslims or lower-caste Hindus who traditionally consume and trade in beef and have been deprived of their livelihoods due to the new laws. There's been a rash of mob lynchings targeting those minorities in recent years. Between May 2015 and December 2018, at least 44 people — 36 of them Muslim — were killed in cow vigilante violence across 12 Indian states, according to Human Rights Watch . Hundreds more have been injured.
Meanwhile, Hindu monks and priests have risen to power in politics and business. Baba Ramdev, a monk and yoga guru with close ties to Modi, runs of one of the fastest-growing consumer goods empires in India, selling food, cosmetics and medicine based on ancient Hindu healing traditions.
The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, with more than 200 million residents, is a Hindu priest. Yogi Adityanath is a prominent member of Modi's party and a vocal Hindu nationalist, infamous for anti-Muslim rhetoric. His state government has enacted a beef ban and renamed cities and landmarks that previously had names rooted in Islam.
For example, the city of Allahabad, built in the 16th century by Muslim rulers of the Mughal Empire, was officially renamed last year as Prayagraj, a word that references an earlier Hindu settlement and pilgrimage site there.
Hindu nationalists argue that for centuries, British and Mughal dominance influenced how they view their own history — and they're now finally reinterpreting it through authentic Hindu eyes.

Bernat Armangue/AP ""India was subjugated under those Muslim rulers. People feel there was some injustice, and history has not been presented and narrated and understood in the way that it should have been understood,"" says Yogeshwar Tewari, head of the history department at Allahabad University (whose name remains unchanged for now). ""Every nation goes through course correction.""
The extent of what Tewari calls ""subjugation"" of Hindus is a question that has divided historians. But for many Indian Hindus, Muslim place names are like Confederate statues in the American South — reminders of a painful history, some of which are now being removed. During parts of the Mughal era, some Hindu temples were desecrated or destroyed, and for a time, a tax was levied on non-Muslims.
Others see the name changes as a dangerous process of erasing the history of an era in which the Mughals united India's disparate kingdoms, codified human rights and left behind some of the country's best-known architecture, including the Taj Mahal.
Today, more than 180 million Muslims make up nearly one-sixth of India's population, a bigger proportion of India than African-Americans are in the U.S.
""What is very clear from the kinds of alliances being made for the elections is that the purpose is to consolidate the Hindu vote,"" says historian Romila Thapar, professor emerita at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. ""Minority groups are shunted out or subordinated. As long as the majority is in the ascendency, it doesn't really matter what the conditions for minorities are. Fifty years ago, 70 years ago, everyone was equal. Today, it's majoritarianism.""
Shrinking space for secularism
That sense of Hindu primacy is squeezing other voices out, Thapar warns.
""As rationalists, we are dismissed because we are told, 'You're not people of faith. You don't understand,'"" she says. ""Now the question is, is politics going to be run by people of faith?""
In 1947, when India won its freedom from British colonial rule, the territory was partitioned into a new Muslim state — Pakistan — and a secular, pluralistic state, India.
At the time, India's founding fathers — including the freedom fighter Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who became the country's first prime minister — concluded that only a pluralistic democracy could hold together India's myriad ethnic groups, languages and castes.
Hindu nationalists were outraged. They had lobbied unsuccessfully for a Hindu state, with laws to be shaped by Hindu scripture. They accused Gandhi and Nehru of appeasing minorities by treating them as equals to Hindus under the law. Months later, a Hindu nationalist assassinated Gandhi.
Gandhi's death silenced any debate over his and Nehru's vision for a secular India. The RSS, to which Gandhi's assassin belonged, was banned after the murder — the first of three RSS bans, though all have been overturned and the group remains legal today. Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi went on to become elected prime ministers of India with the Congress party, which has dominated Indian politics for most of the post-independence era.
India voted the Hindu nationalist BJP into power briefly in 1996, and then again in 1998 and 2014. If Modi is reelected this spring and serves another full five-year term, his would be the longest streak of non-Congress party rule in modern Indian history.
These days, even major secular political parties like the Congress party don't talk about secularism anymore, says Vaishnav.
""One of the most remarkable things about the 2019 election is how little opposition politicians are talking about secularism. It's a four-letter word,"" he says. ""That's something that BJP and its Hindu nationalist allies have succeeded in bringing about.""
The question now is whether Indians voting over the next five weeks will endorse that vision for their country.

Hollywood Writers Vs. Agents : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195758/hollywood-writers-vs-agents,"NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks to writer and producer Keli Goff about members of the Writers Guild of America being told to fire their agents en masse.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
A Hollywood labor dispute got ugly this weekend between writers and their agents. The Writers Guild of America, the union that represents Hollywood writers, told them to fire their agents after negotiations between the two sides broke down Friday night. The fight is over packaging deals. That's where actors, directors and writers are bundled together for a fee. Keli Goff is a member of the Writers Guild. She's a writer and producer of the Netflix documentary ""Reversing Roe."" And I asked her why she thinks packaging disadvantages writers.
KELI GOFF: So, for instance, I'll give you an easy example. You're a writer. You go into negotiations on a project. And you say, you know, actually, they should be paying me more based on my experience, based on the fact that I'm a woman, for instance, and that I know they've paid male screenwriters a lot more previously for similar projects. If your agent has an interest as a producer on a project then their interest has to be to keep the costs low for the production. So they are not going to be inclined to hear ethical or other reasons for why you should be compensated more fairly. And there's a lot more profit for agencies to make as content creators and as our bosses than as those defending our interests against our bosses.
PFEIFFER: Could agents just be cut out of the process entirely? And could a manager or a lawyer be negotiating these deals for you?
GOFF: That's a great question, Sacha. And I think we're about to find out. So what I found from my friend whose sole income comes from screenwriting is there is such a culture of fear in Hollywood. I can speak out about this because I have other lines of income. For my friends who've only worked as screenwriters, many of them have told me their agents didn't get them their first job, their second job, their third job. And they really only stay signed with an agency because they're terrified of not saying they're with one. There's a fear that if you're a woman and a person of color, in particular, that if you talk openly about having bad experiences with agents, you will be deemed difficult, which we know that that's a word that tends to haunt women and people of color more than others. And now because we have been forced to fire them as part of our union membership, people now are going to go for possibly a month or three months without agents. And I think people are going to be in for a rude awakening. If people go for a few months without their agents and their careers actually go along just fine, I think a lot of people are going to have a tough sell being convinced to go back to relinquishing that 10 percent or more for someone who isn't actually pulling their weight.
PFEIFFER: But I remember, after the last major writers' strike, it's often attributed to helping give rise to reality television because Hollywood said, you don't want to write? Fine. We don't need writers. We'll just do reality TV. Any risk that there's now such a demand for content from Netflix and Amazon and other providers that you guys are going to be more easily replaceable than you realize?
GOFF: Well, I think, in this case, though, the agents are the ones that are actually replaceable. You know, when push comes to shove, even though reality television rose up during the last writers' strike, keep in mind, once writers came back, it gave rise to the golden age of Hollywood. What did we get? - ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Mad Men."" What ended up happening is people realized, actually, you need writers to create content. It's just if the content's not going to be on CBS or ABC and other places that came up with ""Survivor"" or ""The Bachelor"" when we went on strike, then it gave rise to other mediums like Netflix.
PFEIFFER: You clearly feel very strongly about your position. But how much of a consensus issue do you think this is among writers?
GOFF: Well, I have noticed that there is total consensus pretty much among every writer I've ever talked to that the way agencies do business does not benefit the overwhelming majority of writers. There seems to be a consensus on that. And we also know that the - what I would say, as someone who, again, is relatively new to the business, is that, in general, I think there is less tolerance for the culture of fear that has run Hollywood all these years. I would say that the same thing that gave us Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves is what we're talking about right now, which is powerful people getting away with unethical and bullying behavior and, essentially, assuming that people are either so scared and desperate that they will put up with it. If you look at something like Weinstein, that kind of behavior can only go unchecked when you have people who are willing to enable. There should have been agents who were looking out for those actresses in those situations. But what happened in most situations - you had the agents who were willing to defend the power structure. And that's, essentially, what we're talking about here is we need something that checks the people in power from engaging in bad behavior. And those checks and balances are disappearing with packaging. And that's simply all we're trying to take a stand for.
PFEIFFER: Keli Goff is a television writer and producer. She fired her agent about a day ago. Keli, thank you.
GOFF: Thank you.

How The Rock 'N Play Baby Sleeper Became Popular And Why It Was Recalled : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195723/how-the-rock-n-play-baby-sleeper-became-popular-and-why-it-was-recalled,"How The Rock 'N Play Baby Sleeper Became Popular And Why It Was Recalled How The Rock 'N Play Baby Sleeper Became Popular And Why It Was Recalled Embed Embed
NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks with baby sleep consultant and author Alexis Dubief about the recall of Fisher-Price's Rock 'n Play sleepers, which have had a devoted following among parents.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Fisher-Price has officially recalled 4.7 million Rock 'n Play sleepers, which have had a devoted following among parents of newborns. The Rock 'n Play is a portable sleeper that props a baby up at a slight incline. But last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics called the product deadly. In about the last eight years, 32 babies have died while sleeping in Rock 'n Plays - most because they couldn't breathe after rolling over while they weren't buckled in. Alexis Dubief is a baby sleep consultant and runs a Facebook group called Precious Little Sleep. She joins me now.
And welcome, Alexis, despite the grim topic.
ALEXIS DUBIEF: Thank you for having me.
PFEIFFER: For people who haven't seen one of these, could you explain in more detail what a Rock 'n Play is and does and why it's been so popular?
DUBIEF: So the reason why it's so popular is that it's a fairly inexpensive, small, sort of snuggly sleep option for infants. But they are not a flat surface. So the baby is sort of cradled in this mesh material. Newborns do not sleep well. They have a poorly regulated system. And so they need a lot of assistance to fall asleep and stay asleep. And babies do tend to sleep fairly well in them.
PFEIFFER: So in some ways, it sounds like the Rock 'n Play has been a godsend for a lot of parents. But what are the conditions that make it dangerous?
DUBIEF: What we know from the recall is very little. Thirty-two deaths in almost 10 years is concerning. And I am very concerned. And I respect the American Academy of Pediatrics. So, of course, we've said stop using the Rock 'n Play. But we also know that infants die on all sleep surfaces. So what we really are trying to understand - and what I would love to understand better - is, what is the relative risk of the Rock 'n Play compared to the crib or, what often is the fallback position, co-sleeping with an adult?
PFEIFFER: What are the other impacts of this recall for parents who had relied on this product?
DUBIEF: Well, I think the big impact is going to be just sleeplessness and possibly an increase in co-sleeping. I think there's a lot of stress because for many parents, they understand that sleep in the crib is the gold standard for safety. They understand that. These are not parents who are uninformed. But they're also miserably sleep deprived. The reality is people suffer seriously from sleep deprivation. What happens is we fall back into kind of desperation-based, unsafe behaviors. It's not a logical decision. It's a desperation decision. And that's where we end up co-sleeping - in many cases, co-sleeping on a couch or a chair, which is something that we know is, you know, associated with a 12x increase in the risk of SIDS. Highly risky situations occur when we're desperately sleep deprived and it's 2, 3, 4 in the morning and we've been up every 45, 60, you know, minutes for the entire evening.
PFEIFFER: I'm wondering if this recall has a disproportionate effect on parents who earn less because the Rock 'n Play, at the lower end, was relatively affordable. If you're going back to work in about two weeks or so after giving birth, which you might do if you don't have maternity leave or paternity leave, then you're even more tired. Do you feel like there's an income inequality aspect to this?
DUBIEF: Yes (laughter). Yes. A lot of the sort of things we use to help babies sleep better cost money - you know, swaddling blankets, fancy cribs. The Rock 'n Play was a relatively inexpensive and effective - in terms of helping children sleep better - tool to be used for a few months after birth that probably helped a lot of people who maybe couldn't afford other options. So absolutely, there's a huge amount of privilege in having the resources to get access to postpartum doulas and night nurses and have a spouse who has a job that would get them paid leave so they can help out at night.
PFEIFFER: In general, what kind of reaction are you hearing from the parents you know, your clients? Are people in a lot of distress about this?
DUBIEF: I think people are very distressed about this because it never feels good to feel that you might have unintentionally put your child at risk. I think, also, a lot of people in the group are reasonably looking at the Rock 'n Play and saying, if this product is recalled, then all infant swings and similar devices should also be recalled and are expecting for that to happen. I would love to see more research and insights from the AAP about the relative risk of various sleep options because simply telling people that the crib is the only option for your child in practicality is not a reasonable response.
PFEIFFER: Alexis Dubief is the author of ""Precious Little Sleep."" And she runs a Facebook group by the same name.
Thanks for talking with us.

'Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault': Essays By Cartoonist Cathy Guisewite : NPR,www.npr.org,Cathy Guisewite,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/712791381/after-decades-of-comics-cathy-cartoonist-found-writing-so-liberating,"Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault Essays from the Grown-Up Years
by Cathy Guisewite
Hardcover, 323 Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault Subtitle Essays from the Grown-Up Years Author Cathy Guisewite Cathy Guisewite, the creator of the ""Cathy"" comic strip, didn't really want the character to be named after her. People would think that ""Cathy"" was based on her own life, she reasoned, and ... they would be right. Or, at least, they wouldn't be wrong.
""Cathy was kind of my heart,"" Guisewite says. ""Other stronger characters in the strip like Andrea were more my brain. But Cathy was kind of my heart, that was me.""
When ""Cathy"" hit the newspapers in 1976, it struck a chord with a lot of women. Fans identified with her self-deprecating humor and her relentless insecurity about her looks and love life. Detractors railed against the strip for reinforcing stereotypes of women.
Now, more than 40 years after Cathy's debut, Guisewite has published a book of essays called Fifty Things that Aren't My Fault . And in it, she responds to some of Cathy's critics.
""Some people thought my work reinforced the negative stereotype of women being obsessed with shopping, weight and love,"" she writes. ""But it wasn't my fault we still live in a world that partly judges women by what we wear, how much we weigh, and whether or not and who or how we love. Not my fault that with every glorious new possibility for women came an extra sense of isolation when we not only couldn't keep up but were told we shouldn't talk about the things that held us back.""
By her mid 20s, Guisewite had a successful career in advertising. She was eager to take advantage of all the new opportunities that were opening up for women. But being single and independent had its drawbacks. She felt caught between what she calls ""the two Bettys"" — the 1950s icon of the ideal homemaker Betty Crocker, and the new, vibrant, feminist voice of Betty Friedan. She wanted what both had to offer.

Nick Ut/AP ""I wanted a career,"" Guisewite says. ""I wanted my independence. I wanted to put off marriage and children, and have my own success. But I also really wanted a boyfriend. You know? I was in my mid 20s. I wanted someone to love me.""
Guisewite found humor in her own insecurities and an outlet for them in the comic strip. (For all the jokes Guisewite made over the years about her character's obsession with food and weight, she herself is tiny.) Clearly she was not alone in feeling unsure of her footing in the new world that had been opened by feminism.
Guisewite retired the comic strip in 2010 when she needed more time for her aging parents and her teenage daughter. As she commuted between the two, she began jotting down her thoughts, which is how the book got started.
When I started writing these essays, it was like coming home and taking off the Spanx. This was so liberating.
Cathy Guisewite
""When I started writing these essays, it was like coming home and taking off the Spanx,"" she says. ""This was so liberating. I loved getting to write longer and more thoughtfully about a lot of the same things I wrote about in the strip.""
Guisewite still uses humor to sift through her feelings and she still obsesses over food, and clothes, and the people she loves. But she hopes she's gained some wisdom over the years that she can share with very different generation of women.
Young women lined up recently to meet Guisewite after a book event at The Wing — a communal workspace and social club for women — in New York's SoHo neighborhood. This generation has inherited the feminism that was brand new when Guisewite was young. And Guisewite fan Stephanie Roman says they are still grappling with some of the same issues.
""I'm a body image coach, so the whole theme about food, and dieting, and trying to accept ourselves, and willpower and lack of willpower — whatever it might be — is still definitely a big thread in my life,"" Roman says.
A lot of these women remember reading the ""Cathy"" comic strip as kids. Jessica Schwartz sports a Cathy button that reads: ""I don't have time for this mid-life crisis.""
""Cathy was such a real-seeming woman,"" Schwartz explains. ""I mean, screaming, and pulling her hair out, and freaking out about tiny things — literally the most relatable comic figure ever.""
As Schwartz approaches Guisewite, she pulls something out of her bag ... it's a cake pan, in the shape of Cathy's face . ""Oh my God, you have the cake pan,"" Guisewite says, recognizing the merch. Schwartz shows Guisewite photos of the Cathy cakes (and a meatloaf) she's made over the years.
As Guisewite takes in the array of desserts made in Cathy's image, it's clear she's delighted her character means so much to these young women. Guisewite hopes this new book will feel like a friend ... the kind who knows exactly what to say when you need some reassurance.
As for Guisewite's advice to this new generation of women? Never lose your sense of humor."
U.N. Envoy To Libya On Situation On The Ground,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195744/u-n-envoy-to-libya-on-situation-on-the-ground,"As fighting continues outside Libya's capital, NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with Ghassan Salamé, U.N. envoy to Libya about what the international community is doing to negotiate a ceasefire.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Fighting continues in Libya as different groups battle for control of the country's capital. In the last week alone, thousands of people there have been forced from their homes. And the U.N. estimates that at least 75 people have died and hundreds have been wounded. Ghassan Salame is the U.N. envoy to Libya and joins me from Tripoli.
Good morning.
GHASSAN SALAME: Good morning.
PFEIFFER: Could you tell us what are you seeing there in terms of what kind of fighting and what kind of impact on civilians?
SALAME: Unfortunately, we have seen a few violations of international humanitarian law. A school was hit yesterday in an area called Ain Sara. And already, eight ambulances have been hit since the beginning of the conflict. So we had, today, to remind everybody that these are serious violations of international law and that we are documenting them.
PFEIFFER: The general behind this attack has the support of countries, including not just Egypt and the United Arab Emirates but a Western country, France. How does that complicate the situation?
SALAME: The past week has been quite clear for that. I mean, when you have divisions in the international community, it shows immediately. And it has a very negative effect on the ground.
PFEIFFER: And didn't France block an effort by the EU to issue a statement condemning the general?
SALAME: France was not on the same line like the other members. And in the Security Council, it was Russia who also was not happy with the draft for a presidential statement of the Security Council.
PFEIFFER: And so what does that leave your options as? In terms of what the U.N. can do to try to broker peace, what do you feel like is left for you to do?
SALAME: On the political level, we are trying to bring the two sides to agree on a ceasefire. However, both sides are putting conditions for this ceasefire. The government in Tripoli wants, as a precondition, a retreat via Mr. Haftar's forces while Mr. Haftar doesn't accept this condition.
PFEIFFER: Do you think that Haftar's troops are getting support from other countries in terms of money and/or equipment and arms?
SALAME: Everybody's getting support from outside, including Mr. Haftar, of course.
PFEIFFER: About a year ago, you had said that it was extremely difficult getting consensus and even trying to figure out what would the roadmap forward be. Did you see this coming?
SALAME: Well, we have been trying, yes, to avoid that. That's why we accelerated our political process. We pushed for a national conference that was supposed to take place today. I was so happy, until 10 days ago, that all those Libyan forces invited have all accepted to come and attend. Unfortunately, this attack has compelled us, three days ago, to postpone that meeting because it's very, very hard to discuss and negotiate and agree while the fighting is taking place.
PFEIFFER: There have been protests in Tripoli requesting that the U.N. mission leave Libya. It seems like a loss of trust or a loss of belief that the U.N. can do anything. How do you try to win that trust back?
SALAME: I don't think there is a loss of trust. I think that people are somehow disappointed with the fact that in 2011, there has been a military action, basically allowed by the U.N. but operated by NATO, in order to give a push to those who are in a state of rebellion against Mr. Gadhafi. What Libyans do not understand is that the international system has changed dramatically since then. The Security Council is now in a configuration that does not allow for a resolution similar to the one that was taken then. This is what some Libyans have difficulty understanding.
PFEIFFER: That's Ghassan Salame. He's the U.N. envoy to Libya. Thanks for talking with us.
SALAME: Thank you.

NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks to Sudanese activist and protester Mayada Hassanain about President Omar al-Bashir being ousted and women's roles in the protests.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
In Sudan this weekend, demand for change continues. President Omar al-Bashir stepped down Thursday after 30 years in power. During that time, he sheltered terrorists and was accused of allowing genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur. His defense minister took his place, but that man stepped aside on Friday. Then yesterday, the country's head of security and intelligence resigned. And Sudanese activists are pressing for more. That includes Mayada Hassanain, an economist based in Khartoum. She's been protesting there for months, and she joins us now.
Mayada, welcome to the program.
MAYADA HASSANAIN: Thank you, Sacha. It's good to be here.
PFEIFFER: So I assume that the past few days have been an emotional roller coaster for Sudan. It finally ousted its leader, but then another autocrat took his place. And that spurred more protests. And suddenly, that person was also gone. How are you feeling now?
HASSANAIN: Yeah. I mean, it's definitely been - it feels a lot longer than a week, for sure. And you know, we've kind of been dealing with just so many emotions. And you know, I've been feeling very hopeful and then suddenly somewhat doubtful. And then, you know, it's back to just being, you know, persistent and making sure that everything that's happened so far is not lost.
And yeah, I mean, it's definitely been a very emotionally charged, you know, few months and especially just the last week. I mean, I think now morales are high. I think people are still, you know, just sort of keeping their eye on their prize of a full democratic transition to a civilian-led government and not a military-led government.
PFEIFFER: When the defense minister stepped in, was that viewed as a coup - and not in a good way?
HASSANAIN: Absolutely, absolutely. You're absolutely right. It was viewed as a coup. It was not - it was - it was viewed - it's sort of a little bit complicated because people were still celebrating the fact that Omar al-Bashir was no longer president. I mean, after 30 years, that is definitely something that you want people to feel happy about, you know?
But at the same time, what was very interesting was that the people still understood that even though they wanted to give themselves time to sort of celebrate on the streets, they knew that this is not the transition that they were going out on the streets protesting for. This was sort of an internal coup on Omar al-Bashir and the select, you know, few of the leaders in there in the National Congress Party and that it was sort of, like, theatrics of change as opposed to the actual, you know, complete transition out of military rule, out of authoritarian rule, out of, you know, NCP repression.
PFEIFFER: NCP is...
HASSANAIN: National Congress Party - that is the party that Omar al-Bashir is the head off.
PFEIFFER: You've said that you want civilian leadership eventually. Even beyond that, what's your long-term hope for Sudan and its government?
HASSANAIN: I mean - you know, as of now, ever since sort of the protests emerged, there was - there's a document called the Declaration of Freedom and Change. And it has, you know, nine main points that move from, you know, reparations to ending the war to women's empowerment to, you know, building civilian capabilities. And this document has sort of had, you know, so much support. So many of the protesters are aware of it. They're like, yes, this is what we want.
You know, there's just these demands like, you know, ending the war in Darfur and Blue Nile, South Kordofan; making sure that people in these conflict zones get, you know, the reparations that they're owed; you know, making sure that the institutions that were sort of built around the NCP and the ruling party and Omar al-Bashir are kind of dismantled. These are just some of the examples that people really and truly want.
And I think, most of all, they just want to make sure that the pillars of, you know, a democratic system that are unwavering and that can withstand, you know, future challenges are put in place now.
PFEIFFER: Mayada, just from your voice, we can hear that you're relatively young; you are youthful. And women and young people have taken on central roles in these protests. Why do you think that is?
HASSANAIN: Well, I think it's because, you know, they have the higher stake in this. You know, it's essentially their future that is being shaped right now by, you know - and that has been shaped by the policies of the NCP over the past three decades. And I think they, you know, unfortunately felt, you know, the brunt of all these unfair policies, of all the corruption, of all of the state repression. You know, it's incredible. So many of the protesters are, you know, as young as 15, 16. It's amazing to see all these people just out in the streets literally putting themselves on the front line of death to fight for their own futures and futures of future generations.
PFEIFFER: That's Mayada Hassanain, who's been among the protesters in Khartoum, Sudan.
Mayada, thank you so much.
HASSANAIN: Thank you very much for having me. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Twitter YouTube A multilingual K-pop juggernaut, BTS mashes up pop, hip-hop, rock and dance music with huge, infectious energy and kinetic choreography. It's one of the biggest bands in the world, and as of this weekend, it's got a Saturday Night Live performance under its belt, too. The Korean septet has built a fan base that's broad (its videos are viewed many hundreds of millions of times each), deep (its fans tend to be intensely devoted, especially on social media) and fully worldwide (its new record, Map of the Soul: Persona , is almost certain to top the U.S. album charts this week).
Every generation gets its own crop of boy bands, but BTS feels like an unusually potent force: Its sound seems to straddle the whole world, the songs are catchy as anything, and each member brings enormous charisma to the mix. Lots of bands can seem strangely diminished by the SNL stage on TV, but on Saturday night, BTS filled every inch of the frame with flashy motion — tight choreography, bright colors, bold energy — as it performed ""Boy With Luv"" (from Map of the Soul ) and ""MIC Drop"" (from 2018's Face Yourself ).
YouTube That BTS has crossed over into the U.S. mainstream pop-cultural consciousness is no surprise; the group has been ascending for years amid a prolific burst of thematically ambitious albums and EPs. But this new surge feels like a genuine tipping point: The SNL appearance dominated social media all weekend, and BTS will drop another heavily hyped spectacle at the Billboard Music Awards on May 1. The group will team up with Halsey — a guest on the studio version of ""Boy With Luv"" — for the latter performance, the news of which broke during commercials Saturday night. Twitter was extremely excited, so strap in: SNL was just the beginning.

A lawyer and her future son-in-law argue furiously about politics on Facebook, each accusing the other of ignoring ""the facts.""
A newly married couple gets into an uncomfortably heated argument as they watch the confirmation hearings of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, until one finally leaves the room. ""I love you, but you're wrong,"" she says.
A Mexican-American college student argues with her Trump-supporting mother — also Mexican-American — about how she could possibly accept the idea of a border wall.
These, of course, are not isolated stories: Political differences can drive a wedge through even the closest families and friendships. A 2017 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of respondents said the 2016 election had caused them to end a relationship with a friend or relative. Nearly 40 percent said the election had provoked at least one argument with a loved one.
More broadly, Americans say they're worried that the United States is growing more polarized and that civility — respect, courtesy, kindness — is slipping away in many aspects of their lives. From road rage to Twitter feuds to the rancor at the highest levels of government, polls show that Americans think incivility is at crisis levels.
Recently, NPR has been traveling the country to explore how people are grappling with the idea of civility in polarizing times.
Here are five stories about the shaky line that people walk to keep things civil — or not — in their most intimate relationships.
'I Love You, But You're Wrong' When Patricia ""P."" Price met Simone Perry in 2016, she was surprised when Simone told her she was Republican. As P. explains, ""Black, lesbian and Republican — it doesn't go in the same sentence."" They got married a year later, and Simone Perry became Simone Price.
Loading...
Simone, who initially supported Ted Cruz and voted for Gary Johnson in 2016, says P. is more interested in ""how I carry myself and how I treat people than who I support politically."" P., a Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, says Simone is much more engaged in politics than she is and wins 90 percent of their political debates.
But several months ago, a debate flared into a fight that P. was not willing to concede. The confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court were on TV, and P. says she was ""completely turned off"" by his demeanor.
Simone, on the other hand, sympathized with Kavanaugh's need to defend himself. She remembers asking P., ""If someone we love is ever accused of something, are we going to grant them the benefit of the doubt?""
The argument got angry, uncomfortable. Both women say they often use prayer or meditation to calm themselves if they're fighting, but this political moment called for more immediate action: When P. felt she couldn't take it anymore, she walked out and went upstairs.
The Fight Stays On Facebook Christopher Kilpatrick and Cheryl Hume are about as politically different as two people can be. Chris, 38, describes himself as a ""far-right kind of guy"" who voted for Trump. Cheryl, his 58-year-old future mother-in-law, voted for Hillary Clinton and donates to causes like refugee resettlement and prisoner re-entry programs. They see each other only a few times a year but connect frequently on Facebook, where they clash over everything from Trump's border wall to the latest conspiracy theory.

Hannah Yoon for NPR Civility Wars In An Increasingly Polarized America, Is It Possible To Be Civil On Social Media? Their back-and-forth can get barbed — they sometimes attack each other for being ignorant — but before things get too nasty, one of them changes the subject. ""How's Kathy doing?"" Cheryl might ask.
Kathy is Chris' fiancée and Cheryl's foster daughter. Both Chris and Cheryl say it's their mutual love for Kathy that helps them put their political differences in perspective.
When the family gets together, Chris and Cheryl say, they avoid talking politics, partly to spare Kathy the misery of playing referee, but partly, they say, because they genuinely enjoy each other's company. Chris calls Cheryl ""big hearted,"" and Cheryl describes Chris as a ""good guy.""
But when they return home from a family gathering, Chris and Cheryl retreat to their respective corners on social media and resume sparring. Happily for them, Kathy doesn't pay that much attention to Facebook.

The Reluctant Mediator Lorraine Bank, 67, says she thinks her children were raised right and ""instilled with good values."" But somewhere along the way — through school, TV or the workplace — she thinks her two daughters ""got brainwashed."" Politically, the sisters lean liberal, while Lorraine is a staunch conservative. She says she and her husband mention Trump often enough so their children ""know we think he's a good president, but we don't rub it in.""
That's not always enough for daughter Valerie, 28, who voted for Clinton in 2016. She says she has to steel herself when she visits her parents.
""I do breathing exercises,"" she says. ""Before I get into a conversation, I give myself a pep talk and say, 'I'm going to keep calm, I'm not going to engage, and if someone tries to bait me, I'm not going to take the bait.' ""
Sometimes she has a few drinks to calm herself down. If all else fails, she leaves the room.
For the past few years, Valerie has had to deal with an additional family stress: Her older sister, Sarah, stopped talking to their mother after a serious fight. (Sarah declined to participate in this story.)
As their mother, Lorraine, tells it, after a series of political disagreements, she and Sarah got into a ""final straw"" argument about gay marriage shortly before the 2016 election. At one point, Lorraine referred to gays as ""fags,"" and although she says she later apologized, Sarah still refuses to speak to her.
""I pray every day that whatever is wrong, she can get over it and she'll wake up and know we still love her,"" Lorraine says.
Now, on the few family occasions where everyone is together, Sarah won't interact directly with her mother. Valerie plays the reluctant mediator, trying to knit together a conversation between two people who can no longer find the words.

Nam Y. Huh/AP Updated at 3:26 p.m. ET
When Molly Hewitt left South Bend, Ind., for college, she didn't think she'd return to live there again. Since the 1960s, the city had suffered the same brain drain that plagued many other Midwestern cities faced with industrial decline.
""The goal was always to be successful enough that you don't have to come back to South Bend,"" she said.
But while she was away, things were turning around. Hewitt's parents kept her in the loop and she decided to give another chance to the city led by Democratic mayor Pete Buttigieg.
""I came back, honestly because of Pete and I've seen a lot of my friends do that and a lot of people who didn't grow up here that want to come to South Bend,"" she said. Now Hewitt is 23, living in South Bend and volunteering for the campaign of James Mueller , the candidate Buttigieg endorsed to replace him in this year's mayoral election.
Buttigieg, 37, officially announced his candidacy for the presidency on Sunday. On the campaign trail he speaks a lot about how being mayor of South Bend since 2012 has prepared him to be president.
""We transformed the trajectory of our city,"" Buttigieg said in an interview on Morning Edition in January. ""This is a community that was written off as dying at the beginning of this decade. Now it's growing again.""
South Bend's population is up more than 1,000 people since 2010 following decades of hemorrhaging tens of thousands of residents.
Investment in the city's downtown, public private partnerships, economic development — including turning the long vacant Studebaker auto plant , which closed its doors in 1963, into a tech hub — have been credited with the change.

Severe weather that moved across the southern U.S. on Saturday left at least eight people dead, injured dozens of others and ravaged numerous homes in its path.
Two children, ages 3 and 8, were killed in eastern Texas when a tree fell on the car in which they were traveling. Angelina County Sheriff Greg Sanches said in a statement that the children, who were in the car with their parents during the storm, were pronounced dead on the scene.
""They were at the wrong place at the wrong time,"" Capt. Alton Lenderman of the Angelina County Sheriff's Office told The New York Times. ""The tree fell just as they were going under it.""
In central Texas, approximately a dozen people were injured in Franklin where a tornado was confirmed by the National Weather Service, according to The Dallas Morning News.
In a preliminary damage report, the National Weather Service assigned the tornado an EF-3 rating, saying peak winds reached around 140 mph in Franklin.
About 100 miles northeast of Franklin, at least one suspected tornado swept through an outdoor event at the Caddo Mounds State Historic Site. Cherokee County Judge Chris Davis said one woman died of critical injuries, according to The Associated Press , which reports about two dozen additional injuries there.
The sheriffs office from nearby Houston County told KLTV that one woman was found dead near her home on Highway 21 West.
Video from the area showed damage to houses with roofs ripped off.

World War II pilot Dick Cole, the last surviving member of the Doolittle Raid, died last week at age 103.
Cole was renowned aviation pioneer Jimmy Doolittle's co-pilot in April 1942 on what was regarded as a suicide mission – the first counterattack against the Japanese mainland after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The raid caused Japan to contract its forces and start a battle with the United States over Midway Atoll, a small ring shaped island between North America and Asia. This battle, which the U.S. won, shifted the tide of the war into America's favor.
A memorial service for Cole will be held at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas on April, 18 — exactly 77 years after the raid occurred.

Dick Cole after one of his interviews with author Laura Hillenbrand in September 2018. Courtesy of David Mackintosh
Laura Hillenbrand, the author of Seabiscuit and Unbroken , knew Cole and wanted to write a book about him.
""[the pilots] were very likely to die ... and everyone had the opportunity to back out. Not a single man did,"" including Cole, Hillenbrand told NPR's Scott Simon for Weekend Edition . Interview Highlights
On why the mission was so dangerous
The United States was really knocked back by Pearl Harbor. And after that, the Japanese were just on a winning streak. And the United States could do nothing about it because they had no land base from which to launch bombers and go after Japan. And they had what I think is kind of an insane idea, which is they were going to take 16 B-25s, which are medium-sized bombers. They were going to hoist them onto the carrier Hornet, sail it out off the Japanese coast and launch them ... They had a plan that was going to take the planes over Japan, bomb Japan and then head on to friendly bases in China. And Japanese boats spotted their task force way early. They had to launch right at that moment. And they did. And the men knew they did not have enough fuel to make it.
On what happened to Lt. Col. Dick Cole during the mission
They flew over Japan, and they looked down. Cole remembered seeing people waving up and smiling at them as they flew over. They thought they were friendly planes ... They headed out over the China Sea, and they started to run out of fuel. And a tail wind caught them and carried them over the Chinese coast. And then their fuel ran out in the darkness in a wild thunderstorm over the mountains of China. And Cole had to jump out of the plane. He had never even practiced parachuting. He'd had no training at all. And he just dove out of the plane headfirst.
He walked for a day, and he found a building with a nationalist Chinese flag hanging over it. And a soldier was there — a Chinese soldier — and invited him in. And, the man took him to a dark room, and there was Jimmy Doolittle ... And from then, it was a race to get out of where they were because the Japanese were hunting them.
On why the mission was a success
The Japanese were so confident that they were spreading out over the globe and not concentrating their forces. And when this raid happened, that terrified them. And they contracted their forces. And they decided to take aim for Midway Atoll, which, if they could claim it, would give them a land base, making America more vulnerable and making themselves safer. And essentially, the raid lured them into that. We had the Battle of Midway. The United States won it triumphantly. And it turned the course of the war. So these guys - these 80 men on 16 planes - turned the course of history with that little raid.
On Cole's life after the war
He was a - kind of an institution at the Doolittle Raider reunions that were held every year. And they had a tradition there. The city of Tucson had made up 80 silver goblets inscribed with the names of the 80 men from the raid. And the names were written on one side right-side up and another side upside down. And each year, the men would privately gather and drink brandy in a toast to whoever had passed away the previous year. And then that man's goblet would be turned upside down. And there was one goblet that was still upright. And it actually still is now. But there's going to be a ceremony to turn over the very last one because they're all gone now.

Laughing with friends can be another way to start breaking the cycle of chronic stress and help keep your heart healthy, too.

The toll of chronic stress isn't limited to emotional suffering. High stress can set the stage for heart disease.
In fact, research shows that those of us who perceive a lot of stress in our lives are at higher risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems over the long term.
Shots - Health News This Is Your Stressed-Out Brain On Scarcity The latest evidence comes from a new study of siblings in Sweden. Researchers identified about 137,000 people who had been diagnosed with stress-related disorders; the diagnoses included post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress following a traumatic event, such as the death of a loved one or a violent episode. Then, the researchers identified about 171,000 of their brothers and sisters who had similar upbringings and genes — but no anxiety disorder.
Next, they compared the siblings' rates of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, cardiac arrest and blood clots, over a number of years.
The Swedes who had a stress disorder, it turns out, had significantly higher rates of heart problems compared to their siblings.
""We saw [about] a 60 percent increased risk of having any cardiovascular events"" within the first year after being diagnosed, says researcher Unnur A Valdimarsdóttir of the Karolinska Institute, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Iceland. Over the longer term, the increased risk was about 30 percent, Valdimarsdóttir says.
Shots - Health News Forest Bathing: A Retreat To Nature Can Boost Immunity And Mood The findings, published in the current issue of the medical journal BMJ , ""are quite consistent with other studies,"" says Simon Bacon of Concordia University, who studies the impact of lifestyle on chronic diseases. He points to other studie s that show depression, anxiety and stress increase the risk of cardiovascular events. He wrote an editorial that is published alongside the study .
So, when is stress just a normal part of life — something we all just need to deal with — and when does it become so problematic that it sets the stage for disease? Part of the answer depends on how we respond to stress, the scientists say, and on our own internal perceptions about how much stress we're feeling.
We've all experienced the fight-or-flight stress response.
""Imagine you're walking down the street and someone jumps out and gives you a scare,"" says Bacon. What happens? Your heart rate increases and your blood pressure climbs. ""You have that immediate activation,"" Bacon says. In the short term, this temporary response is good. It gives you what you need to flee or take action.
The problem comes if you start to experience these stress response ""activations"" even when there's not an imminent threat.
""When people have stress disorders, these systems are being activated at all the wrong times,"" Bacon says. For instance, with PTSD, ""you can get very exaggerated stress responses just thinking about something that happened.""
Shots - Health News Dialing Back Stress With A Bubble Bath, Beach Trip And Bees People who experience chronic stress seem to be at highest risk of health problems.
""Over the long term, repeated, persistent [stress] responses will activate the immune system and contribute to inflammation,"" says Dr. Ernesto Schiffrin , a physician and professor of medicine at McGill University. He says inflammation can set the stage for atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries . Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood to your heart and body. When the arteries narrow, this limits blood flow — increasing the likelihood of a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event.
Since we can't wave a magic wand and make stress disappear, what are the best coping options? There's no magic bullet, but day-to-day habits can help tamp down stress.
Schiffrin says he gives his patients this advice: Eat in a healthy way, attempt to have good relationships, have a good attitude, spend time in nature, and exercise. ""I think exercise is critical,"" Schiffrin says.
Let's take a closer look at each of these.
Exercise: When researchers analyzed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data from more than a million adults in the U.S., they found that people who exercised reported fewer days of bad mental health compared to those who didn't exercise. And, as we've reported , there was an extra 'boost' in mental health linked to playing team sports. But whether you choose a simple walk, forest-bathing , or a group activity, who doesn't feel a little better after moving their body? Cultivate friendships: Loneliness is an epidemic . And, as we've reported, a recent survey found 2 in 5 respondents reported lacking companionship or said they felt isolated from others. Yet, spending time with friends can really boost our mood. No matter your stage of life, signing up for a group activity or volunteering are good options for getting and staying engaged in the community around you. Learn meditation or relaxation techniques: Mindfulness meditation has been shown to tamp down the stress response and even help reduce blood pressure among people who can maintain the habit. As we've reported , one study found that meditation helped 40 out of 60 patients reduce their blood pressure enough to reduce some of their medications. Eat well: There is indeed a link between food and mood. As we've reported , a diet full of refined carbohydrates and sugar (the sort you'll find in packaged snacks and sodas) can lead to a metabolic roller coaster that can influence your mood, too. On the other hand, a Mediterranean-style diet — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish — can leave you feeling nourished. Seek help for anxiety disorders: These day-to-day habits may help reduce the amount of stress you feel, but for people with stress disorders such as PTSD, it may be best to reach out to a professional for help. ""People should treat their mental health issues,"" says Bacon. You don't have to ""grin and bear it."" Mental health professionals have lots of tools. ""You don't want to put yourself in a position where you could make your health worse by not doing anything,"" Bacon says."

Shots - Health News This Is Your Stressed-Out Brain On Scarcity The latest evidence comes from a new study of siblings in Sweden. Researchers identified about 137,000 people who had been diagnosed with stress-related disorders; the diagnoses included post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress following a traumatic event, such as the death of a loved one or a violent episode. Then, the researchers identified about 171,000 of their brothers and sisters who had similar upbringings and genes — but no anxiety disorder.
Next, they compared the siblings' rates of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, cardiac arrest and blood clots, over a number of years.
The Swedes who had a stress disorder, it turns out, had significantly higher rates of heart problems compared to their siblings.
""We saw [about] a 60 percent increased risk of having any cardiovascular events,"" within the first year after being diagnosed, says researcher Unnur A Valdimarsdóttir of the Karolinska Institute, and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Iceland. Over, the longer term, the increased risk was about 30 percent, Valdimarsdóttir says.
Shots - Health News Forest Bathing: A Retreat To Nature Can Boost Immunity And Mood The findings, published in the current issue of the medical journal BMJ , ""are quite consistent with other studies,"" says Simon Bacon , of Concordia University, who studies the impact of lifestyle on chronic diseases. He points to other studie s that show depression, anxiety and stress increase the risk of cardiovascular events. He's written an editorial that is published alongside the study .
So, when is stress just a normal part of life — something we all just need to deal with — and when does it become so problematic that it sets the stage for disease? Part of the answer here depends on how we respond to stress, the scientists say, and on our own internal perceptions about how much stress we're feeling.
We've all experienced the fight-or-flight stress response.
""Imagine you're walking down the street and someone jumps out and gives you a scare,"" says Bacon. What happens? Your heart rate increases and your blood pressure climbs. ""You have that immediate activation,"" Bacon says. And, in the short term, this temporary response is good. It gives you what you need to flee or take action.
But, the problem comes if you start to experience these stress response 'activations' even when there's not an imminent threat.
""When people have stress disorders, these systems are being activated at all the wrong times,"" Bacon says. For instance, with PTSD, ""you can get very exaggerated stress responses just thinking about something that happened.""
Shots - Health News Dialing Back Stress With A Bubble Bath, Beach Trip And Bees People who experience chronic stress seem to be at highest risk of health problems.
""Over the long term, repeated, persistent [stress] responses will activate the immune system and contribute to inflammation,"" says Dr. Ernesto Schiffrin , a physician and professor of medicine at McGill University. He says inflammation can set the stage for atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries . Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood to your heart and body. When the arteries narrow, this limits blood flow — increasing the likelihood of a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event.
So, since we can't wave a magic wand and make stress disappear, what are the best coping options? There's no magic bullet, but day-to-day habits can help tamp down stress.
Schiffrin says he gives his patients this advice: Eat in a healthy way, attempt to have good relationships, have a good attitude, spend time in nature, and exercise. ""I think exercise is critical,"" Schiffrin says. So, let's take a closer look at each of these.
Exercise When researchers analyzed CDC survey data from more than a million adults in the U.S., they found that people who exercised reported fewer days of bad mental health compared to those who didn't exercise. And, as we've reported , there was an extra 'boost' in mental health linked to playing team sports. But, whether you choose a simple walk, forest-bathing , or a group activity, who doesn't feel a little better after moving their body? Cultivate Friendships Loneliness is an epidemic . And, as we've reported, a recent survey found 2 in 5 respondents reported lacking companionship or said they felt isolated from others. Yet, spending time with friends can really boost our moods. No matter your stage of life, signing up for a group activity or volunteering are good options for getting and staying engaged in the community around you. Learn Meditation Or Relaxation Techniques Mindfulness meditation has been shown to tamp down the stress response, and even help reduce blood pressure among people who can maintain the habit. As we've reported , one study found that meditation helped 40 out of 60 patients reduce their blood pressure enough to reduce some of their medications. Eat Well There is indeed a link between food and mood. As we've reported , a diet full of refined carbohydrates and sugar (the sort you'll find in packaged snacks and sodas) can lead to a metabolic roller coaster, that can influence your mood, too. On the other hand, a Mediterranean-style diet — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish — can leave you feeling nourished. Seek Help For Anxiety Disorders These day-to-day habits may help reduce the amount of stress you feel, but for people with stress disorders such as PTSD it may be best to reach out to a professional for help. ""People should treat their mental health issues,"" says Bacon. You don't have to grin-and-bare it, he says. Mental health professionals have lots of tools. ""You don't want to put yourself in a position where you could make your health worse by not doing anything,"" Bacon says.

Trump Administration Considers Transferring Immigrants to 'Sanctuary Cities' : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304646/trump-administration-considers-transferring-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities,"Trump Administration Considers Transferring Immigrants to 'Sanctuary Cities' Trump Administration Considers Transferring Immigrants to 'Sanctuary Cities' 6:57 Embed Embed
Hogan Gidley, White House principal deputy press secretary, talks with NPR's Michel Martin about President Trump's proposal to relocate detained migrants to so-called sanctuary cities.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to start the program with the latest on an idea apparently being considered by the White House - to transfer detained asylum seekers and other would-be immigrants in so-called sanctuary cities. Several news organizations had reported last week that the idea had been floated within the Trump administration and then rejected. But on Friday, the president told reporters he is actually considering this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We might as well do what they always say they want. We'll bring the illegal - really, you call them the illegals. I call them the illegals. They came across the border illegally. We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it.
MARTIN: White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is here with us now to tell us more.
Mr. Gidley, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
HOGAN GIDLEY: Thank you so much. It's great to be with you.
MARTIN: As I indicated, the White House has had several conflicting statements about this when it was first reported. The White House in a statement knocked it down. Then the president on Friday said what we just heard him say. And then Sarah Sanders this morning said that this is a real proposal. What changed from Thursday night, when the White House said that this proposal was dead, to Friday, when the president said that it isn't? What happened?
GIDLEY: Well, we had looked at it before, and obviously, there were some challenges we faced that prevented us from moving forward on any real steps to make this happen. And then the president actually came to us and said, listen - I think this is a really good idea. We already have so many people pouring into this country in record-setting numbers - 100,000-plus just last month alone. And the problem is Democrats won't work with us to fix the current laws. And so they tell us, you cannot keep family units detained. You cannot keep family units - or they don't want us to keep family units on the Mexico side of the border while they await their day in court.
And you can't detain them here. So if you can't deport them, and you can't detain them, the only option is to release them. The problem is we consistently release these family units in the same communities - into San Diego, San Antonio, Yuma, Phoenix, El Paso, all along the southern border. And they should not be forced to bear the brunt of policies that they have no control over.
MARTIN: OK...
GIDLEY: So we looked at it and said, where are the logical places to spread the wealth, if you will? And places like San Francisco, for example, or a sanctuary city - they are designed and set up specifically to have people there who aren't here legally. That's what their stated goal is. So there's no reason we shouldn't be looking at a...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...Way to give them exactly what they want.
MARTIN: You mentioned impediments or obstacles. I'm not quite sure what the word you just used was. But it's been reported that the Cabinet-level agency which would be responsible for implementing this has had its own legal counsel reject this for legal reasons. He said it's illegal specifically to transfer people into specific areas for political retribution. On what legal grounds does the White House believe you can transfer people to specific areas of the country in order to retaliate against their political leadership?
GIDLEY: Well, wait a second. (Laughter) I just got through telling you that's completely a false premise. First of all, we already send them to specific places. The problem is we send them to the same specific places repeatedly. So you've got to spread it out a little bit. It's not political retribution. If anything, you should consider it on the Democrat side to be an olive branch. You've asked us to work with you on some things we've put forth, time after time, solution after solution. They will not come to the table.
So the logical answer is to give them something they want. Democrats say that if you even think about rejecting people into this country illegally that you are somehow racist. So the question then becomes, do Democrats want to allow these people to be shipped into their communities? That's what they said they wanted. It's not political retribution. It's a solution to a problem we face along the southern border.
MARTIN: Who are these entities who are specifically saying that we would like you to move these immigrant families or would-be immigrant families or would-be asylum seekers elsewhere? Who are these entities who are saying that to you?
GIDLEY: Sure...
MARTIN: Because we are getting different information from different political leaders. So who exactly is telling you that this is what they think the administration should do?
GIDLEY: Our contention is the conversations we have on the same towns along the southern border, as I just mentioned. NGOs, non-government organizations, are telling us they don't have enough resources to actually address the people that are being influxed (ph) into these communities. Democrats won't give us enough money to keep them along the border in detention facilities, won't give us enough ICE beds, won't give the resources we need to house them down along the southern border.
So the only thing remains is to send them into other locations across the country who are, again, specifically designed to handle it. It shouldn't be political retribution or considered such. What it should be is the Democrats beating down the gates at the White House trying to get in here to say, thank you, Mr. President. We have long said these people deserve the right to be here even though they're here illegally.
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: And anybody who disagrees is a racist. We want them in our communities. We've said so.
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: How do we work with the administration...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...To make sure they are transported safely into these sanctuary cities?
MARTIN: Two more questions for you. There is a bipartisan proposal, which was proposed by Xochitl Small Torres (ph), who represents New Mexico, and Dan Crenshaw, who's a freshman from Texas, and Will Hurd, who is a veteran from Texas. He's also the only Republican currently representing a border district. They have a bipartisan proposal which would offer a different option - which would offer additional support to border agents at the border, additional judges, additional immigration judges to process these asylum seekers and so forth. Is the White House considering this proposal - which is bipartisan, as we said?
GIDLEY: We are considering all proposals that would work to alleviate this problem, especially ones that are bipartisan, as you mentioned. I can't speak directly to that particular piece of legislation as I've not seen it, and I don't know exactly if we've taken a stand one way or the other. But until they pass something like that, these are all hypotheticals. Anybody who's willing to come forth and present a solution to the problem, we're happy to sit down and listen.
MARTIN: And before we let you go, I think many people might wonder why, when the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House for the first two years of this administration, if this is as significant a crisis as the White House says it is, why the issue wasn't addressed then legislatively.
GIDLEY: Yeah, that's a great question you'd have to ask Republicans. Don't think they're unscathed here for what they didn't accomplish. There's no doubt. Now, part of that is, as you know, the political realities exist that we didn't have a filibuster-proof Senate. So we could have gotten some of these things through had they gone nuclear. Obviously, that's something that Leader McConnell didn't want to do. But the fact is, they should have done a lot more.
But that's in the past. What we have now is a Democrat-controlled House, and they've got to work with us if they say they want to protect the American people. They voted for border walls and barriers in the past. They voted for measures along the southern border to give them resources...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...In the past. Even Barack Obama in 2014 called this a crisis from the Rose Garden. It's only gotten...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...Worse. So it's time to get some solutions out there so we can protect the American people.
MARTIN: That was Hogan Gidley, deputy White House press secretary.
Mr. Gidley, thank you so much for speaking to us.

Pyongyang Press Corps Pool via AP
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says he will visit Seoul ""in the near future,"" amid an ongoing summit with South Korea's Moon Jae-in in which he also renewed pledges to shut down a primary missile launch site and a key nuclear weapons complex if the U.S. takes ""corresponding"" measures.
Kim's remarks about traveling to Seoul were made during a news conference in Pyongyang with the South Korean president. It would be the first-ever visit to the South Korean capital by a North Korean head of state.
In their third summit, Kim and Moon also laid out plans to draw down forces along their heavily fortified border and announced an agreement for their athletes to compete as a single team at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and to submit a joint bid to host the games in 2032. Trump Says China To Blame For Hurting U.S.-North Korean Relations
In addition, the two leaders agreed that before the end of the year, they would participate in groundbreaking ceremonies to link railways along the east and west coasts of the Korean peninsula.
Moon said that the two sides agreed that the Koreas should become a ""land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats."" Kim called the agreement ""a leap forward"" toward peace between the two historically bitter rivals. In A Break From Recent Precedent, North Korean Anniversary Parade Features No ICBMs
In it, defense chiefs from Pyongyang and Seoul said they would establish ""buffer zones"" between their land and maritime borders to reduce the possibility of accidental military clashes. They also agreed to withdraw 11 guard posts from the Demilitarized Zone along the 38th parallel that acts as the de facto border between the two sides, who remain technically at war more than six decades after the Korean conflict ended without a peace treaty. Opinion: Moon Jae-In Can Put U.S.-North Korea Negotiations Back On Track. Here's How
North Korea would also shut down its Dongchang-ri missile engine testing and launch facility and allow the process to be monitored by international observers.
The North promised to dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear weapons facility as far back as 2007 and the significance of shuttering the two facilities is not clear. The North has demonstrated a capability for using mobile launchers to fire its ballistic missiles and some observers believe Pyongyang maintains secret nuclear facilities in addition to Yongbyon. Kim Hosts South Korea's Moon For Summit Talks In Pyongyang
Although it was not clear what ""corresponding"" U.S. steps North Korea expected as a condition to make good on the promise to shut down Yongbyon, President Trump, in a tweet just after midnight, appeared to deem the summit a success, calling it ""Very exciting!"" Kim Jong Un has agreed to allow Nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations, and to permanently dismantle a test site and launch pad in the presence of international experts. In the meantime there will be no Rocket or Nuclear testing. Hero remains to continue being — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2018 ....returned home to the United States. Also, North and South Korea will file a joint bid to host the 2032 Olympics. Very exciting! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2018
Even so, lasting rapprochement between the two Koreas has proved elusive in the past, with hopes for peace degenerating into renewed recriminations and saber rattling following two previous summits in 2000 and 2007.
Although Trump has remained optimistic about improved relations between Washington and Pyongyang, the initial euphoria following the Singapore summit in June — after which the president declared that North Korea was ""no longer a nuclear threat"" — quickly wore off. Follow-up meetings between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials failed to produce concrete results, and Pyongyang quickly returned to its bombastic anti-American rhetoric.
As The Associated Press notes of the agreement, ""... while containing several tantalizing offers, it appears to fall short of the major steps many in Washington had been looking for — such as a commitment by Pyongyang to provide a list of the North's nuclear facilities, a solid step-by-step timeline or an agreement to allow international inspectors in to assess progress or discover violations.""
Moon on Wednesday acknowledged, ""there will be challenges and trials, but the more we overcome them the stronger we will become.""
""We are not afraid of future challenges,"" he said.
Harry Kazianis , director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest in Washington, tells NPR that keeping the lines of communication open between North and South is paramount.
""If we are going to have change in the Korean Peninsula, if we're not going to have a war, you need to have some sort of political framework where all sides will keep talking,"" Kazianis says.
In a reference to some of Trump's harshest threats against the North before tensions finally eased, Kazianis says as long as dialogue continues, ""if there are rough patches, if there are problems, we can talk our way through and not go back to fire and fury."""
Playwright Suzan-Lori Parks Handles Heavy Themes In Racial Drama 'White Noise',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304695/playwright-suzan-lori-parks-handles-heavy-themes-in-racial-drama-white-noise,"Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks is back with a new controversial play that centers on a group of four interracial friends who get caught up in a contract that gets out of hand.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
And finally today, playwright Suzan-Lori Parks. She's one of the most productive and acclaimed people working in theater today, and she's known for pulling off remarkable feats like writing 365 plays in 365 days or finding humor and tragedy in a play about a black Lincoln impersonator who works in whiteface - that's ""Topdog/Underdog"" - for which she won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize.
Now she's back with a new play, and it's another high-wire act. It's called ""White Noise,"" and it focuses on a group of four people who've been friends since college. Misha is a black rising YouTube star who's decided to make blaxplaining (ph) to white people her thing. Ralph, Misha's boyfriend, is a white university professor with a trust fund. Dawn is a white lawyer with social justice on her mind, and she's dating Leo, a black artist who's been suffering with insomnia since childhood.
And yes, race does matter because in the beginning of ""White Noise"" we learn that Leo's insomnia keeps him up at night, so sometimes he walks. And late one night while walking, he's attacked by police. And that incident causes him to come up with an outrageous plan. And Suzan-Lori Parks is with us now from New York.
Thank you so much for being with us.
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: Thanks for having me on the show - so exciting (laughter).
MARTIN: And I just have to say that, you know, one of the pleasures of seeing a play early on is that you don't know anything about it. You can just walk in without knowing anything, and then your mind is blown. And I just have to say that there's - I feel badly, but there's no way to talk about this play without one spoiler.
PARKS: Yeah, sure.
MARTIN: So if you're listening, and you don't want to know, now's the time to get a cup of tea. Having said that, do you want to tell what the outrageous plan is?
PARKS: Yeah. So his outrageous plan, right - and it's - well, that's the whole thing about spoilers. But it's like ""Oedipus."" You know, we all know what happens. It's how it happens and why that hopefully will continue to be interesting even after we learn that - yeah, so Leo's outrageous plan, his far-out idea - he wants to feel safe, protected and respected, and he's really run out of options.
And so he lands on this idea that he will voluntarily enslave himself to his best friend Ralph for a period of 40 days. And he will just do basically what turns out to be a 40-day internal meditation on a theme. He says he will go to a, quote-unquote, ""low place."" And after that, hopefully, he will be truly free. And that's his plan.
MARTIN: And it's crazy (laughter). And...
PARKS: Yeah, it's...
MARTIN: So...
PARKS: ...Cray-cray (ph). It's - yeah.
MARTIN: Yes.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: So Leo is played wonderfully by Daveed Diggs.
PARKS: Yes.
MARTIN: And people probably know Diggs best for his dual role as Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson in ""Hamilton.""
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: Let me play - this is the one clip I'm going to play...
PARKS: Oh, cool.
MARTIN: ...Which Leo is trying to explain how he came up with this plan. And I'm going to warn people here that there's language that some might find offensive. And here it is.
(SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, ""WHITE NOISE"")
DAVEED DIGGS: (As Leo) Back in the day, a guy like me would be walking someplace, and he would get stopped by the law, some law enforcement individual. And there would be a whose nigger are you, nigger moment. And a guy like me would be, like, I belong to Mr. So-and-so. And the law would be, like, oh, if you are master so-and-so's property, then you cool with us, and go on ahead with your black self. And a guy like me would go on because he was owned - because the brother was the property of the man. He was safe because he was...
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Don't say it.
THOMAS SADOSKI: (As Ralph) A slave.
DIGGS: (As Leo) Bingo.
MARTIN: OK. How on earth...
PARKS: How on earth...
MARTIN: ...Did this come to you?
PARKS: Well, it was - it's very simple. You see, there was this play in 2014 called ""Father Comes Home From The Wars."" Yeah. And I wrote it. So I was sitting in the Anspacher, the very theater where we are world premiering ""White Noise."" And there is a moment in that play, the ""Father Comes Home From The Wars"" play, which takes place in the 1860's in America where the main character, Hero, is imagining the future. And he's trying to imagine what it's going to be like to be free.
And if he is free - if I'm free, I think he says - I'm paraphrasing - you know, and I'm walking down the street, say I'm coming home from work, and I got stopped by the patrollers, and they'll say, who do you belong to? And I'll say, well, I belong to myself. And he wonders if that will be enough for them to - the patrollers to let him, you know, go on home. And his friend that he's talking to, Smith, doesn't know if that's going to be enough to have him feel safe, protected and respected.
And so watching that moment in the play night after night after night in 2014, I said, oh, wow. I'm going to write a play about the future. And I started writing ""White Noise"" from there.
MARTIN: Wow. That - first of all, there's so many difficult ideas in this. I don't want to give it away because it's both fascinating and cringe-inducing. I mean, it's like this real-life, real-time experiment.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: And one of the things that's both fascinating and cringe-inducing - there's so many things - but how quickly Ralph takes to the role...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...Of being Leo's master.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: What are some of the things that fascinated you?
PARKS: Well, one of the things that I hold dear and that I told the actors and I tell them every day - but I told them on the first day of rehearsal, and I just wanted them to know how much I love deeply each of the characters and how the world that they live in, the world which is much like the world we live in today - the world has pushed each of these four characters into a corner - into an opposing corner, if you will. And I want them to work through their stuff. And for me, that's one of the most important things about the play.
And it surprises me, I guess, how during the rehearsal process, which was very deep and intense but without unnecessary drama. And we had some intense discussions about who we are and race and privilege and what does that mean. And a lot of times, it wasn't easy. But we had them. We had to.
MARTIN: You know, other things that fascinated me - I was looking back over some of the reviews and interviews that you've done over the years. One of the things that fascinated me was how many of the things that you wrote about in prior plays that people felt were just crazy or outrageous or over-the-top have now become...
PARKS: (Laughter).
MARTIN: ...True. Like, for example, in ""Topdog/Underdog""...
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...It was a - you know, one of - it's a two-character play, and one of the characters is a Lincoln impersonator, but he's performed...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...By an African-American actor who performs in whiteface.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: And, lo and behold...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: Here we are...
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...All these years later. We're having this huge political scandal in Virginia because white politicians were...
PARKS: Oh, yeah.
MARTIN: ...Understood to be wearing blackface.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: And I just wonder, how is this for you? I don't know if you read the reviews, but to have...
PARKS: Well...
MARTIN: ...Things that you've written about, people think, oh, that's crazy. That would never happen. And then...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...It is happening.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: I'm just wondering if you're having a moment. Or what do you...
PARKS: (Laughter) I'm having - at every moment, I have a moment. You know what I'm saying? (Laughter) I mean, it's like - I feel that if we listen deeply, we are going to see what's going on. What's going on is what has been going on for a long time. So it's not about, like, prophecy or anything. It's just watching and listening and paying attention - you know, things that we're encouraged to do. But there's also humor. I mean, I have to tell you...
MARTIN: It's true.
PARKS: The names of the four characters - it's Leo, Misha, Ralph and Dawn. So if you've heard of the ""Ninja Turtles"" - you know, the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""...
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: ...So Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael. So there I - That's where I got their names from. So my son loves the ""Ninja Turtles,"" right? So he has the ""Ninja Turtle"" figurines. And I'm, like, that's the name of the characters from my play.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: And I start laughing so hard, he's, like, mommy, why are you laughing? And my husband goes, because you're about to go down deep.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: And I'm, like, yeah. That's what I do. Before you take a dive down deep, I tell myself a joke. So Act 1 of the play is - of ""White Noise"" is filled with jokes, lots of jokes. And then act two, we go deeper. There's still a lot of jokes in Act 2, but we go deeper. We go deep, deep, deep, walking on the nerve endings of the audience - ow.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: It's - you're laughing. See? It feels good, doesn't it?
MARTIN: Yeah.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: Before I let you go, I want to ask about that James Baldwin quote that you have at the top of the script.
PARKS: Oh, yeah.
MARTIN: You actually had the opportunity to study with him in college.
PARKS: I did.
MARTIN: And...
PARKS: I did. Oh, bless his heart.
MARTIN: And the quote reads, ""not everything can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."" Yeah.
PARKS: Leo quotes that - half-quotes that in the play. He says, like the brother said, nothing can be changed until it's faced. All right. He doesn't quote the first part of the text. So he believes that by continuing to work toward a beautiful solution that that beautiful solution will come to have his own humanity recognized - that that is a possibility. He believes that. And yeah, so do I.
MARTIN: That's Suzan-Lori Parks. Her latest play, ""White Noise,"" is showing at the Public Theater in New York until May.
Suzan-Lori Parks, thank you so much for talking with us.
PARKS: This is awesome. Thank you so much for having me.

#NPRPoetry Month: Lauren Alleyne,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304688/-nprpoetry-month-lauren-alleyne,"It's National Poetry Month, and for our series #NPRPoetry, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with poet Lauren Alleyne. Alleyne combed Twitter for her favorite original poems.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Now it's time for one of our favorite things - poetry. Every year in April, Poetry Month, we ask listeners to share original tweet-length poems. And each week this month, we are reading through your submissions. We've been honored to have a number of award-winning poets combing through submissions with us. And joining us this week is Lauren Alleyne. She is the assistant director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center at James Madison University, where she also teaches English. And she's with us now from Raleigh, N.C. Lauren Alleyne, thank you so much for talking to us.
LAUREN ALLEYNE: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So you've picked some poems that caught your eye. Why don't you read us one?
ALLEYNE: I would love to. I would like to read a poem from Patricia Caspers (ph).
MARTIN: OK.
ALLEYNE: Each breath you wheezed became our rosary. As we carried you across the empty hospital parking lot and I thought about the small mystery inside of you, struggling to hold on to this life, this body machine, it's everything I know of God.
MARTIN: Oh, boy. That kind of packs a punch, doesn't it?
ALLEYNE: It really does.
MARTIN: What struck you about this one?
ALLEYNE: I think that there is some sort of alchemy that happens with, like, the perfect image that captures a perfect moment in the perfect language, right? And so that idea of the body machine that happens at the end and then the surprising turn - it's everything I know of God - I think sort of captures in a way that maybe any other kind of language couldn't that feeling of mystery that is part of what it means to be humans. I just thought it was captured so wonderfully in that poem.
MARTIN: Tell us another one.
ALLEYNE: Absolutely. Let's see. Winter, the woods, my brother running away in moonlight the color of marrow. His 200 and some-odd bones hiding warm beneath his skin, tucked tender in his ears, whole and fresh until those few short sharp last breaths.
MARTIN: And that was by Nancy Stone (ph).
ALLEYNE: Yes.
MARTIN: What struck you about this one?
ALLEYNE: Even in this conversation, I can tell I'm always drawn to the body. And the specificity of the poem and those 200 odd bones, right, the short, sharp breaths. I think, again, the way the language is able to capture that exhaustion, that movement, the dynamism in the language itself, to me, that's the miraculous nature of the poem. And that was captivating for me.
MARTIN: We kind of came up with the tweet-length as a conceit. I mean, you know, who are we kidding? We just, you know, we just made that up just because of the brevity of it. We also thought it would kind of make it fun for people to participate. But what do you think about it? I mean, do you like the brevity of it? Does this appeal to you?
ALLEYNE: I am a fan of form in poetry - fixed forms. I love the sonnet. I love the villanelle. I love the Sistine. I love the Rondel. I love the Bop. All of these, like, rules that help for me make a container that you can pour something that is often bigger than you have words to say, right? And I also just think it's fun. Like, I like games. I like puzzles. I like, you know, systems. And so to me, the character limit is a system. Like, what can you do within this space that makes meaning and that makes beauty? And I think that's just the challenge of any poem, really.
MARTIN: Want me to play one that - we were able to get one of the contributor to record this one for us. This one is by Jay Sturner, and here it is.
JAY STURNER: All the right words have gathered on my tongue to form a parade, but my teeth are the walls, and my fractured ego is the rain.
MARTIN: You picked this one, too, I just want to say.
ALLEYNE: I did.
MARTIN: You know, again, it's the body, but what else did you like about this?
ALLEYNE: One of the things I think that can really, for me, make a poem is when I see the poet in the poem, and the poet in a poem in a way that is vulnerable and human and complicit sometimes. And I think that's the thing I really enjoyed about that poem is that it was really sort of revealing the poet's awareness of his own failure to be better, right? Like, you know, here is a perfect thing to say, but I can't get out of my own way. So I think that idea of being vulnerable, to being wrong in the poem is brave. And I feel like I love to see that bravery show up in a poem.
MARTIN: So how did you start writing poems?
ALLEYNE: I'm from Trinidad. And there's a wonderful song form there, the Calypso. And I used to write Calypsos for my sister. Those were my earliest, earliest poems.
MARTIN: So finally, before we let you go - and thank you again for reading these poems with us this week and enjoying them along with us. Do you have some advice for people who maybe are still a little shy about getting started and putting some thoughts to paper?
ALLEYNE: Absolutely. I think the poem is one of the most democratic forms of art. It's a pencil and paper. And if we enter it as a mode of play and exploration, rather than the production of literature, I think we give ourselves permission to discover. And also, I think be fine with having fun and not producing a New Yorker-worthy NPR-worthy poem, right?
You know, I tell people all the time - it's my students - I'm like, listen, you have a pencil. You have a pen. And you think, I am perfectly equipped to make a perfectly good poem. But you have 10 fingers, and you might walk up to a piano and you don't think you can place Chopin. So, like, allow yourself to play the chopsticks of poetry, right? Just go and write a haiku. And you're just playing in language. And then maybe something comes from that.
MARTIN: That's Lauren Alleyne. She is the assistant director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center and the author of ""Difficult Fruit"" and ""Honeyfish."" And she was kind enough to join us from Raleigh, N.C. Lauren Alleyne, thank you so much for talking with us today.
ALLEYNE: My pleasure.
MARTIN: And if you'd like to hear your original poem on the air, tweet it to @npratc with the hashtag #nprpoetry. Every week, for the rest of the month, a professional poet like Lauren will join us on the air to talk about some submissions that caught his or her eye. Poems must be 140 characters or less.

Understanding Changes To The Tax Code,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304674/understanding-changes-to-the-tax-code,"Understanding Changes To The Tax Code Understanding Changes To The Tax Code Embed Embed
Kay Bell, a writer for the Don't Mess With Taxes blog, talks with NPR's Michel Martin about changes in the tax code this year.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
I sincerely hope this isn't the first time you're hearing this, but the deadline for filing your annual tax return is tomorrow. And this is the first tax season that will be affected by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
With the new changes to the tax code, it feels like we're all first-time filers this year. So to catch up with the changes and what they mean, we've reached out to Kay Bell. She is a financial journalist. And she writes the blog ""Don't Mess With Taxes,"" which she says translates taxes into money saving English. And she's with us now from - where else? - Austin, Texas. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
KAY BELL: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So let's jump in. What is different about taxes this year since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? What will people notice the most?
BELL: The first thing they will notice is there is a new form. Lawmakers promised us a postcard-sized tax return. It's not quite there. It's a little bigger than a regular postcard. But there's only one smaller form now instead of what used to be three forms. The bad thing about that is that in addition to this one smaller form, there are now six different schedules. So depending on what your tax situation is, you might have to file several different forms whereas in the past, maybe you only had one 1040 that you had to deal with.
MARTIN: Who benefits from the not quite a postcard, almost a postcard? And who is subjected to all those different schedules?
BELL: Well, you know, taxes are intensely personal. So you might have to fill out just the small form, whereas if in the past, you used the 1040ez, you'll use the new simple 1040 and be done with it. But if you had income other than W-2 income from an employer - say you had a side job, a gig job driving for one of the car services on the side - you're going to have to fill out one, two, maybe three forms. So it's a little more complicated. But they say it was a tradeoff to get us to a lower tax rate and broader tax - income tax brackets. So most of us end up paying less tax in the end.
MARTIN: Now, you talk with a lot of CPAs for your blog. What are they telling you about what their customers are telling them?
BELL: Well, they have some customers that are not happy that they're not getting as big of a refund as they used to. And there's a long story as to why that happened. Those who file early tend to be people who expect larger refunds. And when that didn't happen this year, we heard about it. You know, they complained loudly and on social media.
And the problem is that when the new tax law went into effect, it changed the withholding, which meant a lot of people - most people - got more money back in their paychecks. Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't notice it or they had other expenses that went up and absorbed this little bit of increase or they just didn't think about it because nobody thinks about taxes really until they get around to filing their return.
In addition to tax refunds being a little bit smaller, we're seeing that people aren't filing as quickly this year. And in fact, the IRS says they expect around almost 15 million people to file for an extension this year. And that's almost 5 million more than usually file for an extension every tax season.
MARTIN: So finally - so I'm guessing because, you know, your Twitter bio says that you are a tax geek, what's it been like for you this last couple of months of tax season? Are your friends and relatives, like, showing up at your house at odd hours with their forms...
BELL: It's been great. I mean...
MARTIN: ...Looking really upset? What's it like for you?
BELL: It's been great. I love it. I mean, taxes are nerve-racking anyway. Then you add change, which any kind of change, even if you want it, is frustrating. So you add those two together, and it can get really hectic. But I've been doing this for a long time. It's fun to see some changes made. And there are some good changes in this tax bill.
But it has been crazy. And people are a little worried. They just want to make sure they understand it, you know? Nobody wants to make the IRS mad. They want to make sure that they are getting all they can out of the new tax laws and that they are getting what they deserve.
MARTIN: That's Kay Bell. She is a journalist. She writes the blog ""Don't Mess With Taxes."" And she was kind of to join us from KUT in Austin, Texas. Kay Bell, thanks so much for talking to us.
BELL: Thank you.

Breaking Down The Hollywood Dispute Between Writers And Agents,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304681/breaking-down-the-hollywood-dispute-between-writers-and-agents,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Kim Masters, editor-at-large for The Hollywood Reporter , about the ongoing dispute between writers and agents.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
And now we turn to Hollywood to check in on the dispute between writers and talent agents. After groups representing both parties failed to reach an employment agreement, the Writers Guild instructed members to cut ties with their agents. That group represents thousands of writers, and the dispute could stall production of scripted TV shows and movies. Here to tell us what this means is Kim Masters. She's an editor at large at The Hollywood Reporter.
Kim Masters, welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again.
KIM MASTERS: My pleasure.
MARTIN: Can you just tell us as briefly as you can how we got to this point?
MASTERS: There has been a process called packaging that goes back more than 40 years. It's become an institution in this industry. And packaging means - this is primarily a thing now with television writers - when an agency puts together elements of a show and sells it to a studio, the studio pays the agency a fee directly. And this has various effects that the writers are now completely fed up with. They argue that the agents who are getting paid by the studios have a conflict because their job is to represent the writer and not make deals for themselves with the studios.
And they say that this causes writers to be underpaid. Oftentimes, writers don't even know that they're part of a package. They say that if you're developing a TV show, these fees that the studio is paying the agencies can cut the budget for your own TV show, diminishing your chances for success, because you can't necessarily hire the actor you want or get the location you want.
MARTIN: I think people could see their point. For example, if you were in a real estate transaction, and if you hired somebody to represent you, to then find out that that person was actually the person selling the house, for example - you would experience that as a conflict. So what do the agents say about that? What has their position been about that?
MASTERS: Well, what the agents give up in this scenario of packaging is you normally would pay a 10 percent commission to your agent for getting you a job, and you don't pay if the packaging fee is involved. So the agents are saying this helps lower-level writers because they can make more money. But the writers argue that this is more than offset by the potential conflicts that these agents have collecting fees from the studios.
And they point out and argue that their compensation has gone down in recent years overall. One of the writers said how he had walked through an art gallery at his agency. These agencies have all of this wealth and accoutrements and try to look very, very successful. But at this point, the writers are looking at all of those signs of success and saying, wasn't some of that money supposed to be mine?
MARTIN: So the Writers Guild leadership wrote to members saying that they are about to enter unchartered waters. What are some of the repercussions of this that we might see? Recognizing I'm asking you to speculate here since - as by definition, it's uncharted - what do you think might happen? What are people concerned about?
MASTERS: Well, guild members as of now are expected to fire their agents. It is pilot season, so the shows are staffing up right now. And what the writers are trying to do is figure out alternate means to communicate about what jobs are available and help people find jobs without involving agents.
MARTIN: Is there any entity or group working to resolve this?
MASTERS: Right now, we are looking at what seems like impasse. These are very divergent interests right now. The agents feel they must produce. They certainly don't want to give up these very, very lucrative packaging fees. Sometimes they make more than the writers from TV shows created by the writers. So this is really kind of an existential struggle, and I'm not sure how I see the way out.
MARTIN: That's Kim Masters, editor at large for The Hollywood Reporter.
Kim, thank you so much for joining us.
MASTERS: Oh, thank you for having me.

AG Barr Prepares To Release Redacted Mueller Report,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304667/ag-barr-prepares-to-release-redacted-mueller-report,"Attorney General William Barr is preparing to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It summarizes years of investigation into 2016 election interference.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Back now to one of the stories that has consumed the nation's capital - the Mueller report. It will soon be here, at least a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It's expected in the next couple of days - that according to Attorney General William Barr.
And while fights over the report probably will continue, the release is the culmination of investigations that go back nearly three years, reaching across continents and into President Trump's inner circle. NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas takes us back to the beginning.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: The investigation began in late July of 2016, when the FBI quietly opened its probe into possible links between the Trump campaign in Russia. That investigation, codenamed Operation Crossfire Hurricane, remained a closely held secret through the end of the 2016 campaign. It was not until March of 2017 - two months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States - that the American public would learn about the probe when then-FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JAMES COMEY: I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
LUCAS: That announcement triggered what would become a bare-knuckle political fight on Capitol Hill. Democrats pointed to a lengthy list of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, wondering whether they meant that Trump's aides had worked with the Kremlin as it interfered in the election. Republicans, in contrast, took aim at those investigating the president and his associates. But it was a decision by the president himself in early May that would truly turn official Washington on its head.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Breaking news tonight. President Trump has fired FBI Director James Comey. A stunning move...
LUCAS: Eight days later, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to oversee the rush investigation. The man picked to lead the probe was Robert Mueller, a decorated Vietnam veteran and former FBI director who had served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.
Mueller quickly pulled together a high-powered investigative team. It included some of the Justice Department's best lawyers, top-notch attorneys from private law firms and dozens of experienced FBI agents. Over the next 22 months, the special counsel's team quietly issued nearly 3,000 subpoenas and executed some 500 search warrants and interviewed around the same number of witnesses.
Most importantly, Mueller's team produced results. Thirty-four individuals, including 25 Russian nationals as well as three Russian entities, were indicted in the investigation. Mueller secured guilty pleas from seven people, including Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the president's first national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Each new indictment shook the nation's capital.
And as the months dragged on, the investigation loomed over the Trump White House. The president frequently lashed out at the FBI, the Justice Department, Mueller and his probe.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion.
It's a witch hunt. That's all it is. There was no collusion.
It's a total witch hunt. I've been saying it for a long time.
It's all a made-up fantasy. It's a witch hunt.
The witch hunt continues.
LUCAS: In January, Trump's longtime informal adviser Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks. That fueled speculation about Mueller's final move. Were more indictments in the pipeline? Would the president himself or his family be ensnared?
By this time, much of the political fight around the probe centered on what would happen to Mueller's final report on the investigation. Democrats and most Republicans agreed - the American public should be able to see for itself what Mueller had found.
The ultimate decision though would be in the hands of the new attorney general, William Barr. At his confirmation hearing, Barr told lawmakers he wanted to be as transparent as possible.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the special counsel's work. My goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.
LUCAS: Late last month, Mueller submitted his report to Barr. The attorney general took a weekend to review the materials, and then sent a four-page letter to Congress with the top-line conclusions. It was good news for an anxious White House. Barr's letter said Mueller's team did not find that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. It also said that on the question of obstruction of justice, the special counsel did not conclude that the president committed a crime. But it also did not exonerate him.
President Trump and his allies declared victory. Democrats demanded to see Mueller's full report and all of the underlying documents. Here's the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ADAM SCHIFF: This report is going to have to be made public. And of equal importance, the underlying evidence is going to have to be shared with Congress because that evidence not only goes to the issue of criminality, but it also goes to the issue of compromise.
LUCAS: House Democrats have raised questions about whether Russia holds financial or some other form of leverage over Trump. And they have threatened to subpoena the full report and underline investigative materials. Barr so far has promised only to provide Congress and the public with a redacted version.

In a surprise comeback, Tiger Woods wins his first major title in more than a decade.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Today in Augusta, Ga., what seemed impossible just a few years ago became a reality. Tiger Woods, who seemed a longshot to win another golf tournament - let alone another major championship - did just that, winning his fifth Masters by one stroke. It was his 15th major title and his first in almost 11 years.
Joining us now to tell us more about it is NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Tom, welcome.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Thank you. Hi, Michel.
MARTIN: So this story is all over social media. It's all over the world. People are tweeting about what they were doing the last time he won - my personal favorite, that Destiny's Child was beginning their final world tour. But Tiger has won a few times before - a few. So what makes this different?
GOLDMAN: Oh, boy. Well, you know, because a couple of years ago, Tiger Woods said he could barely walk. I think that's what makes this significant. He thought his career might be over. His back problems were debilitating. So the talk of winning - of winning a major seemed farfetched to say the least. But then he had fusion surgery - that was his fourth back surgery - and it worked.
And last year, he started his climb back. He built to a victory in the prestigious TOUR Championship in September of last year. And that proved he could win again. And today, he proved he could win a major again. It's the first major victory since 2008 - the 2008 U.S. Open - first Masters win since 2005. And the 14 intervening years are the longest gap between victories in Masters history.
And Michel, amazingly, this rekindles the question of, can he beat Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major championships? Eleven years ago, when he won No. 14 - that U.S. Open in 2008 - it seemed like a matter of when and not if that would happen. But to come back now and again start this talk about Tiger catching Jack, we just never saw it coming.
MARTIN: How did he do it today? Tell me - because it was a wild tournament overall. I mean, at one point, like, there were five guys in contention, like, five people tied. You know, the whole thing was wild. So how did he do it today? How did he pull it off?
GOLDMAN: It was amazing. At first, I should say he won coming from behind, which is a first. This is his first major that he's won without having at least a share of the lead going into the final round. And he started today's final round two shots behind the leader, Italy's Francesco Molinari.
Woods was kind of slow getting going, but he said afterwards that he just kept plodding - he used that word a bunch of times, plodding. And Molinari look great early on. He was sinking clutch putts. But then on hole 12, the par three in famed Amen Corner, Molinari put his tee shot in the creek in front of the green. And that changed the complexion of the tournament right there.
As Woods said later, it let a bunch of people back into the tournament. Really good players, some of the best in the world, like Brooks Koepka, who won two majors last year, world No. 2-ranked Dustin Johnson, they surged. But through it all, Woods played steady. And the last few holes, he did better than steady. He had three birdies - one under par - in his last six holes. And he won by a stroke.
MARTIN: We have about a minute left, Tom. So does this mean something for men's golf? I know that there's this whole question of, like, the Tiger effect and all of this. And, you know, he hasn't been on the scene except as a - sort of a sad sidebar in recent years. Does this mean something for men's golf overall for the sport?
GOLDMAN: I think it does. You know, Woods and his tremendous success years ago spawned a new generation of young athletic golfers with complete games. The golf out there is really good. And today, all those young golfers he spawned, he beat them in the biggest tournament when the pressure was greatest and when they were all playing really well. And so he again is on top, which I think is maybe disconcerting for the young guns who thought Woods was going to kind of fade off into the sunset. Not yet.
MARTIN: Exciting for the over-40 set overall, right? Now tell the truth, Tom. You're going to watch it again right now, aren't you?
GOLDMAN: I am.
MARTIN: All right. That's NPR's Tom Goldman. Tom, thank you.
GOLDMAN: You're welcome.

Can Julian Assange Legally Be Extradited To The U.S.? Embed Embed
NPR's Michel Martin speaks with John Bellinger, former State Department legal adviser, about the possibility of Julian Assange being extradited to the United States.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're returning now to the story of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who's been indicted on a single count of conspiracy. This weekend, we've been asking what Assange's arrest means in the debate over national security versus press freedom. Now we want to take a look at the question of extradition. We've asked John Bellinger to help us with that. He was the State Department's legal adviser under President George W. Bush, and he's with us now.
Mr. Bellinger, thank you so much for joining us.
JOHN BELLINGER: Nice to be with you, Michel.
MARTIN: I understand that there is a U.S.-U.K. extradition treaty which says that someone cannot be extradited from the U.K. for, quote, unquote, ""political offense."" How is that defined? And does that mean something for this case?
BELLINGER: That's right. There's a extradition treaty that entered into force during the Bush administration. It's been in effect for about 10 years. And it defines the crimes for which individuals can be extradited from the U.S. or from the U.K. And it says that an individual may not be extradited for a political offense, but that's not defined. But historically, under international law, a political offense is an offense against the state such as espionage or sedition or treason.
MARTIN: Would it be fair to assume that Julian Assange's defense will try to make the case that this is all political?
BELLINGER: Oh, absolutely. That's going to be one of their chief defenses, I'm sure. And that's one of the reasons I suspect that the charges by the Justice Department were very carefully tailored not to charge him under our espionage laws but instead to charge him with conspiracy to hack into a computer so that he's not being charged with a political offense. But, of course, his defense lawyers are going to say that this is really all political, it's politically motivated, and that he's really being charged with a crime against the United States.
MARTIN: I understand that there's a hearing. An extradition hearing will be held in the U.K. on May 2. You know, what will that entail? What will we see?
BELLINGER: His defense lawyers will, I'm sure, make a number of arguments, including not only that this really is a political offense. But I'm sure they will argue also that he was a journalist performing a journalistic function. It does appear - although we don't know - that the U.K. government is already working together with the U.S. government and supports the extradition.
MARTIN: So who is the ultimate decision-maker here? And what is that person likely to be guided by, if you have any sense of that? For example, is there any precedent that either side could point to that might give us a sense of how this might proceed?
BELLINGER: Well, there'll be several levels inside the U.K. judicial system. There'll be a hearing before a judge in the U.K. and then probably through an appellate level in the U.K. And then, if history is any indication, if Mr. Assange loses, he could then keep appealing all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights saying that his human rights have been violated. Historically, the British have extradited numerous individuals to the U.S. Although many of them and their defense counsel have argued that they would face unfair or improper trials in the U.S., most of those have been extradited.
But in a few cases in the past, there have been individuals whose extradition from the U.K. to the U.S. have been denied. In this case, this will really be, I think, a battle royal because Assange and his lawyers will argue very forcefully that I'm sure particularly the Trump administration is coming after him for political reasons.
MARTIN: So, as you mentioned earlier, Assange has only been charged with one count of conspiracy. If he's extradited to the U.S., could he face other charges here? And is that something that his lawyers might raise?
BELLINGER: Additional charges may be added before his extradition is sought. But after he is extradited, then the U.S. cannot change the charges later on. That would violate a treaty provision called the rule of specialty. So he could only be tried for the charges for which he is extradited.
MARTIN: That's John Bellinger. He was the State Department's legal adviser under President George W. Bush. He now heads the Global Law and Public Policy Practice Group at the law firm Arnold & Porter.
Mr. Bellinger, thanks so much for talking to us.
BELLINGER: Thanks, Michel. It's always a pleasure.

Jo-Marie Burt (@jomaburt) is a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America and an associate professor of political science at George Mason University.
Guatemala's ongoing political crisis is having a devastating impact on its people, fueling unrest in the streets and increasingly driving asylum-seekers to migrate to the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, with the country's Congress poised to pass a bill that would free war criminals, there's no clearer sign that rule of law in Guatemala is undergoing a slow, ugly collapse that could spur even more migration to the United States.
The proposed legislation, which Guatemala's Congress is expected to debate imminently, would free more than 30 military officials convicted of crimes against humanity and more than a dozen others awaiting trial on such charges. It would also prohibit all future investigations into other cases of grave human rights crimes committed during the country's brutal 36-year civil war that ended in 1996.
Should this amnesty bill pass, not only would it undo decades of work to provide justice to victims of wartime atrocities, it would represent an unequivocal return to the reign of impunity long sought by the powerful, military-backed networks of corruption that the United States has invested significant resources into dismantling.
Guatemala's civil war and resulting genocide was fueled by U.S. Cold War support for regimes that, no matter how brutal against their own populations, were seen as protecting U.S. interests. United Nations investigators found that 200,000 people died, the vast majority at the hands of the Guatemalan army. Four out of every five victims were indigenous. Four hundred indigenous villages were wiped off the face of the earth.
Impunity was the norm for many years, even after the conflict ended and peace accords were signed in 1996. But over the past 10 years, thanks to the persistent demands of victims and new generations of prosecutors and judges unencumbered by past fears, Guatemala has made impressive strides in bringing war criminals to justice.
To date, Guatemalan courts have convicted 33 military officials, military commissioners and paramilitaries for a series of human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, massacres, torture, sexual violence and sexual slavery. Courts have also convicted one guerrilla leader for a 1988 massacre. Killings Of Guatemala's Indigenous Activists Raise Specter Of Human Rights Crisis
Among those convicted are powerful men like Benedicto Lucas García, former chief of the army general staff, trained at the infamous U.S. Army School of the Americas and the architect of Guatemala's bloody counterinsurgency policy. In May of last year, he was sentenced to 58 years in prison for crimes against humanity and the aggravated sexual assault of political activist Emma Molina Theissen, as well as the enforced disappearance of her 14-year-old brother.
Guatemala's Congress is now poised to reverse all of this progress. Last month, lawmakers approved moving to vote on proposed legislation that would free all those convicted or awaiting trial for human rights violations within 24 hours of its promulgation. It would also ban all future prosecutions related to wartime atrocities.
Signing the amnesty bill into law would have a grievous and widespread impact. It would further decimate the little trust that surveys show Guatemalans place in their state institutions. It would re-traumatize victims. It could put the lawyers, judges and families who have made the fight for accountability their life's work at risk of retaliation, as recently expressed by United Nations human rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet.
What's especially concerning is that this push to let war criminals walk free is happening amidst a broader effort to make impunity the norm for elites, as corrupt officials seek to kick out an international anti-corruption body and restore their unfettered power and privilege over Guatemalan society. Food, Peace Building, Legal Aid: What Trump Would Cut From Central America
This all-out assault against the rule of law in Guatemala is being spearheaded by President Jimmy Morales, who came to power in 2015 after massive anti-corruption protests brought down the sitting president, vice president and dozens of other government officials. Morales' campaign slogan seemed primed for the moment: ""I am neither corrupt nor a thief.""
Yet when U.N.-backed anti-corruption body the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known by its Spanish initials CICIG, and the Attorney General's Office sought to investigate Morales and his party, the National Convergence Front, for illicit campaign contributions, Morales launched an offensive against the commission. Last August, surrounded by dozens of military officials, Morales announced that he was not renewing the CICIG's mandate, which was set to expire in September 2019, and barred its chief, Iván Velásquez, from returning to the country. In January, he announced he was shuttering the CICIG's doors entirely. He has repeatedly defied court orders to allow the commission to continue its work through the end of its mandate, pushing Guatemala to the brink of a constitutional crisis.
Morales has a personal dog in this fight. He has avoided impeachment charges over the alleged campaign finance crimes so far, but these violations have also brought election authorities close to dismantling the party that brought him to the presidency. Investigators have also brought charges against his brother and his son for corruption.
But the assault on the CICIG transcends President Morales. It involves the very corrupt structures, rooted in the military old guard, that the CICIG was created to eradicate in the first place, and that stand to benefit significantly should Congress pass the amnesty law. 'I'm A Survivor Of Violence': Portraits Of Women Waiting In Mexico For U.S. Asylum
In fact, Morales' victory in 2015 was the result of an alliance with powerful ex-military officials, business elites and evangelists. Investigations by the CICIG and the Attorney General's Office into representatives from these different special interest groups has spurred the campaign to rid the country of the CICIG and undercut the autonomy of key democratic institutions, including the Attorney General's Office and the courts.
Many of the former military officials close to President Morales have been implicated in or face trial for conflict-era human rights violations.
One example is Edgar Justino Ovalle Maldonado. One of several ex-military officials who founded the National Convergence Front in 2008, Ovalle recruited Morales to be its presidential candidate in 2015. As head of the party, Ovalle was elected to Congress in 2015 and wielded tremendous power as Morales' closest adviser. That shielded him from prosecution when investigators sought his arrest in January 2016 on charges of crimes against humanity , in relation to the enforced disappearance of at least 565 victims at the height of Guatemala's civil conflict. It is one of the largest cases of enforced disappearance in Latin America. However, after Ovalle's immunity was lifted in late 2017, he went into hiding and remains a fugitive.
Other former retired militaryofficials charged in that disappearances case have also either fled Guatemala or are still awaiting trial in the country. If the amnesty law passes, investigators would have to drop all their cases.
Approval of the amnesty bill would put Guatemala in violation of international law, which prohibits amnesties, statutes of limitations or other mechanisms designed to protect human rights violators from prosecution. It would also undermine a decade of progress in reckoning with a violent past and building Guatemalans' faith in democratic institutions like the Attorney General's Office and the courts, which are the foundation of the rule of law and democratic governance.
The U.S. government has strongly supported criminal prosecutions of war crimes in Guatemala. U.S. Congress members and the State Department should tell Guatemala in no uncertain terms that they must not grant amnesty for war criminals. Doing so paves the way for a new reign of impunity, one that will imperil the peace, hobble rule of law and exacerbate migration."

The world's largest plane by wingspan took its first flight on Saturday above the Mojave Desert in California.
With a wingspan wider than the length of an American football field, the plane features six turbofan engines, a dual fuselage design and was made using parts from two Boeing jets, according to The New York Times.
The Stratolaunch, as the plane is called, is designed to carry rockets to an altitude of 35,000 feet, at which time they would ignite and launch into orbit, according to The Verge . The rockets would carry commercial satellites into space.
The plane was built by Stratolaunch Systems, which was created in 2011 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. By launching rockets, satellites and other spacecraft from the sky, the company is betting it will be able to avoid the types of delays that ground launches are prone to, such as bad weather.

During the test flight that lasted more than two hours, the plane reached an altitude of 17,000 feet and a top speed of 189 mph, according to the company.
""I'm really excited today to share that we have successfully flown the Stratolaunch aircraft for its first test flight this morning,"" Stratolaunch CEO Jean Floyd said during a press briefing. ""It was an emotional moment for me to personally watch this majestic bird take flight and to see Paul Allen's dream come to life in front of my very eyes."" Allen died in October.

The company says it wants to begin launching rockets from the Stratolaunch by 2020 at the earliest, according to Reuters. But while it works toward that goal, it also faces competition from the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance.
With a wingspan greater than the length of an American football field, the Stratolaunch successfully completed its first test flight Saturday morning. Stratolaunch Systems hide caption toggle caption Stratolaunch Systems
Though the company isn't ready to launch anything just yet, Saturday's flight was considered a success by many, including test pilot Evan Thomas.
""The flight itself was smooth, which is exactly what you want the first flight to be,"" Thomas said at the briefing. ""And for the most part, the airplane flew as predicted, which is again exactly what we want.""
Said Thomas: ""I honestly could not have hoped for more on a first flight, especially of an airplane of this complexity and this uniqueness."" Facebook "
Trump Spokesman Calls Plan To Send Immigrants To 'Sanctuary Cities' An 'Olive Branch' : NPR,www.npr.org,Shannon Van Sant,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713303825/trump-spokesman-calls-plan-to-send-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities-an-olive-branc,"Enlarge this image A mother and her three daughters at the border crossing dividing Juárez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas, on April 9.

David Peinado/NurPhoto via Getty Images A plan under consideration by President Trump to transfer detained immigrants to ""sanctuary cities"" should be viewed as an overture to Democrats, not political retribution, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
""It's not political retribution,"" Hogan Gidley, the White House deputy press secretary, told NPR . ""If anything, you should consider it on the Democrat side to be an olive branch.""
But according to a report published by The Washington Post on Thursday, the plan to send detained immigrants who are in the country illegally to sanctuary cities was seen by some White House officials as a way ""to retaliate against President Trump's political adversaries.""
Initially, White House and Homeland Security officials said the plan had been scrapped, but on Friday, President Trump confirmed the report , telling reporters, ""We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it.""
On Sunday, White House officials sought to turn the focus on Democrats. Speaking on ABC News' This Week, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the preferred solution would be for Democratic leaders in Congress to work with the White House to ""stop this awful crisis that is taking place at our border.""
Cracking down on illegal immigration has been a central theme of the Trump presidency, and in his interview with NPR, Gidley said Trump is trying to make good on that promise through the sanctuary cities plan.
Gidley said the White House has put forward multiple proposals to stem the flow of illegal immigration, but Democrats have not ""come to the table.""
""So the logical answer is to give them something they want,"" said Gidley. ""Democrats say that if you even think about rejecting people into this country illegally, that you are somehow racist. So the question then becomes, do Democrats want to allow these people to be shipped into their communities?""
Gidley specifically singled out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco district as one potential destination.
""We looked at it and said, where are the logical places to kind of spread the wealth, if you will, and places like San Francisco, for example, or a sanctuary city, they are designed and set up specifically to have people there who aren't here legally,"" he said. ""That's what their stated goal is, so there is no reason we shouldn't be looking at a way to give them exactly what they want.""
Last week, Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for Pelosi, told The Washington Post , ""The extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated. Using human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.""
The proposal has already faced questions about its cost and legality. Responding to those questions, the president tweeted on Saturday that the U.S. government ""has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities.""
Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2019 On Sunday, Democrats denounced the proposal as a political tactic. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said the president was using the plan to energize his base.
""My understanding is that it is not legal. There is no budget for that purpose,"" Cardin said. ""This is clearly a political move for the president. He is using the immigrants as pawns in a political game of chess.""

Patrick Semansky/AP If you have ever wanted to get paid to lie in bed, then this job is for you: NASA, the European Space Agency and the German Aerospace Center are offering $18,500 for people to lie in bed for two months.
The job is based in Cologne, Germany, and it's part of a study designed to better understand how the body adapts to weightlessness. The agencies are currently looking for people who are female, between the ages of 24 and 55 and who speak German. The official name of the study is Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study.
But there's a catch.
Those chosen for the job will have to stay in bed 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 60 straight days. That means no getting up for bathroom breaks, bathing or meals. And the money, well, it comes out to just shy of $13 an hour.
Jennifer Ngo-Anh with the European Space Agency says she doesn't believe that will deter everyone from participating.
""A lot of people are intrigued about the idea of contributing to advance knowledge that helps us to really have humans live and work in space for extended periods of time,"" Ngo-Anh says.
Besides lying in bed for 60 days, there are other days for orientation, rest and rehabilitation at both ends of the study. The total time period someone has to be available for the study is 89 days, plus several follow up examinations in the years after the study.
People are already participating in phase one of the study and the researchers are now looking for candidates for phase two.
But before you apply, be warned: For the study, volunteers will have to lie in bed with their heads tilted slightly downward. Ngo-Anh says that's to help recreate conditions of spaceflight.
Joe's Big Idea Young Astronomer Uses Artificial Intelligence To Discover 2 Exoplanets Space Earth Sees First Image Of A Black Hole ""When volunteers lie in bed with their heads tilted roughly six degrees below the horizontal, then a lot of the effects that spaceflight has on the human body can be simulated or being reproduced,"" Ngo-Anh says. ""It is not to annoy volunteers, but it is actually to test countermeasures.""
Volunteers will also be exposed to artificial gravity to test if it can be a countermeasure to the effects of spaceflight. If the study finds that exposure has a positive effect, it may be used as an official countermeasure for future spaceflight missions.
If volunteers are hoping to get some exercise while on the job, fret not. Ngo-Anh says her organization has tested everything from jumping in bed to cycling in bed, plus other contraptions that can be mounted to the beds.
So, if you still think this job is for you, sign up while you still can .

Playwright Suzan-Lori Parks Handles Heavy Themes In Racial Drama 'White Noise',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304695/playwright-suzan-lori-parks-handles-heavy-themes-in-racial-drama-white-noise?station=KXJZ_FM,"Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks is back with a new controversial play that centers on a group of four interracial friends who get caught up in a contract that gets out of hand.
And finally today, playwright Suzan-Lori Parks. She's one of the most productive and acclaimed people working in theater today, and she's known for pulling off remarkable feats like writing 365 plays in 365 days or finding humor and tragedy in a play about a black Lincoln impersonator who works in whiteface - that's ""Topdog/Underdog"" - for which she won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize.
Now she's back with a new play, and it's another high-wire act. It's called ""White Noise,"" and it focuses on a group of four people who've been friends since college. Misha is a black rising YouTube star who's decided to make blaxplaining (ph) to white people her thing. Ralph, Misha's boyfriend, is a white university professor with a trust fund. Dawn is a white lawyer with social justice on her mind, and she's dating Leo, a black artist who's been suffering with insomnia since childhood.
And yes, race does matter because in the beginning of ""White Noise"" we learn that Leo's insomnia keeps him up at night, so sometimes he walks. And late one night while walking, he's attacked by police. And that incident causes him to come up with an outrageous plan. And Suzan-Lori Parks is with us now from New York.
Thank you so much for being with us.
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: Thanks for having me on the show - so exciting (laughter).
MARTIN: And I just have to say that, you know, one of the pleasures of seeing a play early on is that you don't know anything about it. You can just walk in without knowing anything, and then your mind is blown. And I just have to say that there's - I feel badly, but there's no way to talk about this play without one spoiler.
PARKS: Yeah, sure.
MARTIN: So if you're listening, and you don't want to know, now's the time to get a cup of tea. Having said that, do you want to tell what the outrageous plan is?
PARKS: Yeah. So his outrageous plan, right - and it's - well, that's the whole thing about spoilers. But it's like ""Oedipus."" You know, we all know what happens. It's how it happens and why that hopefully will continue to be interesting even after we learn that - yeah, so Leo's outrageous plan, his far-out idea - he wants to feel safe, protected and respected, and he's really run out of options.
And so he lands on this idea that he will voluntarily enslave himself to his best friend Ralph for a period of 40 days. And he will just do basically what turns out to be a 40-day internal meditation on a theme. He says he will go to a, quote-unquote, ""low place."" And after that, hopefully, he will be truly free. And that's his plan.
MARTIN: And it's crazy (laughter). And...
PARKS: Yeah, it's...
MARTIN: So...
PARKS: ...Cray-cray (ph). It's - yeah.
MARTIN: Yes.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: So Leo is played wonderfully by Daveed Diggs.
PARKS: Yes.
MARTIN: And people probably know Diggs best for his dual role as Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson in ""Hamilton.""
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: Let me play - this is the one clip I'm going to play...
PARKS: Oh, cool.
MARTIN: ...Which Leo is trying to explain how he came up with this plan. And I'm going to warn people here that there's language that some might find offensive. And here it is.
(SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, ""WHITE NOISE"")
DAVEED DIGGS: (As Leo) Back in the day, a guy like me would be walking someplace, and he would get stopped by the law, some law enforcement individual. And there would be a whose nigger are you, nigger moment. And a guy like me would be, like, I belong to Mr. So-and-so. And the law would be, like, oh, if you are master so-and-so's property, then you cool with us, and go on ahead with your black self. And a guy like me would go on because he was owned - because the brother was the property of the man. He was safe because he was...
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Don't say it.
THOMAS SADOSKI: (As Ralph) A slave.
DIGGS: (As Leo) Bingo.
MARTIN: OK. How on earth...
PARKS: How on earth...
MARTIN: ...Did this come to you?
PARKS: Well, it was - it's very simple. You see, there was this play in 2014 called ""Father Comes Home From The Wars."" Yeah. And I wrote it. So I was sitting in the Anspacher, the very theater where we are world premiering ""White Noise."" And there is a moment in that play, the ""Father Comes Home From The Wars"" play, which takes place in the 1860's in America where the main character, Hero, is imagining the future. And he's trying to imagine what it's going to be like to be free.
And if he is free - if I'm free, I think he says - I'm paraphrasing - you know, and I'm walking down the street, say I'm coming home from work, and I got stopped by the patrollers, and they'll say, who do you belong to? And I'll say, well, I belong to myself. And he wonders if that will be enough for them to - the patrollers to let him, you know, go on home. And his friend that he's talking to, Smith, doesn't know if that's going to be enough to have him feel safe, protected and respected.
And so watching that moment in the play night after night after night in 2014, I said, oh, wow. I'm going to write a play about the future. And I started writing ""White Noise"" from there.
MARTIN: Wow. That - first of all, there's so many difficult ideas in this. I don't want to give it away because it's both fascinating and cringe-inducing. I mean, it's like this real-life, real-time experiment.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: And one of the things that's both fascinating and cringe-inducing - there's so many things - but how quickly Ralph takes to the role...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...Of being Leo's master.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: What are some of the things that fascinated you?
PARKS: Well, one of the things that I hold dear and that I told the actors and I tell them every day - but I told them on the first day of rehearsal, and I just wanted them to know how much I love deeply each of the characters and how the world that they live in, the world which is much like the world we live in today - the world has pushed each of these four characters into a corner - into an opposing corner, if you will. And I want them to work through their stuff. And for me, that's one of the most important things about the play.
And it surprises me, I guess, how during the rehearsal process, which was very deep and intense but without unnecessary drama. And we had some intense discussions about who we are and race and privilege and what does that mean. And a lot of times, it wasn't easy. But we had them. We had to.
MARTIN: You know, other things that fascinated me - I was looking back over some of the reviews and interviews that you've done over the years. One of the things that fascinated me was how many of the things that you wrote about in prior plays that people felt were just crazy or outrageous or over-the-top have now become...
PARKS: (Laughter).
MARTIN: ...True. Like, for example, in ""Topdog/Underdog""...
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...It was a - you know, one of - it's a two-character play, and one of the characters is a Lincoln impersonator, but he's performed...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...By an African-American actor who performs in whiteface.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: And, lo and behold...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: Here we are...
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...All these years later. We're having this huge political scandal in Virginia because white politicians were...
PARKS: Oh, yeah.
MARTIN: ...Understood to be wearing blackface.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: And I just wonder, how is this for you? I don't know if you read the reviews, but to have...
PARKS: Well...
MARTIN: ...Things that you've written about, people think, oh, that's crazy. That would never happen. And then...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...It is happening.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: I'm just wondering if you're having a moment. Or what do you...
PARKS: (Laughter) I'm having - at every moment, I have a moment. You know what I'm saying? (Laughter) I mean, it's like - I feel that if we listen deeply, we are going to see what's going on. What's going on is what has been going on for a long time. So it's not about, like, prophecy or anything. It's just watching and listening and paying attention - you know, things that we're encouraged to do. But there's also humor. I mean, I have to tell you...
MARTIN: It's true.
PARKS: The names of the four characters - it's Leo, Misha, Ralph and Dawn. So if you've heard of the ""Ninja Turtles"" - you know, the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""...
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: ...So Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael. So there I - That's where I got their names from. So my son loves the ""Ninja Turtles,"" right? So he has the ""Ninja Turtle"" figurines. And I'm, like, that's the name of the characters from my play.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: And I start laughing so hard, he's, like, mommy, why are you laughing? And my husband goes, because you're about to go down deep.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: And I'm, like, yeah. That's what I do. Before you take a dive down deep, I tell myself a joke. So Act 1 of the play is - of ""White Noise"" is filled with jokes, lots of jokes. And then act two, we go deeper. There's still a lot of jokes in Act 2, but we go deeper. We go deep, deep, deep, walking on the nerve endings of the audience - ow.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: It's - you're laughing. See? It feels good, doesn't it?
MARTIN: Yeah.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: Before I let you go, I want to ask about that James Baldwin quote that you have at the top of the script.
PARKS: Oh, yeah.
MARTIN: You actually had the opportunity to study with him in college.
PARKS: I did.
MARTIN: And...
PARKS: I did. Oh, bless his heart.
MARTIN: And the quote reads, ""not everything can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."" Yeah.
PARKS: Leo quotes that - half-quotes that in the play. He says, like the brother said, nothing can be changed until it's faced. All right. He doesn't quote the first part of the text. So he believes that by continuing to work toward a beautiful solution that that beautiful solution will come to have his own humanity recognized - that that is a possibility. He believes that. And yeah, so do I.
MARTIN: That's Suzan-Lori Parks. Her latest play, ""White Noise,"" is showing at the Public Theater in New York until May.
Suzan-Lori Parks, thank you so much for talking with us.
PARKS: This is awesome. Thank you so much for having me.

#NPRPoetry Month: Lauren Alleyne,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304688/-nprpoetry-month-lauren-alleyne?station=KXJZ_FM,"It's National Poetry Month, and for our series #NPRPoetry, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with poet Lauren Alleyne. Alleyne combed Twitter for her favorite original poems.
Now it's time for one of our favorite things - poetry. Every year in April, Poetry Month, we ask listeners to share original tweet-length poems. And each week this month, we are reading through your submissions. We've been honored to have a number of award-winning poets combing through submissions with us. And joining us this week is Lauren Alleyne. She is the assistant director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center at James Madison University, where she also teaches English. And she's with us now from Raleigh, N.C. Lauren Alleyne, thank you so much for talking to us.
LAUREN ALLEYNE: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So you've picked some poems that caught your eye. Why don't you read us one?
ALLEYNE: I would love to. I would like to read a poem from Patricia Caspers (ph).
MARTIN: OK.
ALLEYNE: Each breath you wheezed became our rosary. As we carried you across the empty hospital parking lot and I thought about the small mystery inside of you, struggling to hold on to this life, this body machine, it's everything I know of God.
MARTIN: Oh, boy. That kind of packs a punch, doesn't it?
ALLEYNE: It really does.
MARTIN: What struck you about this one?
ALLEYNE: I think that there is some sort of alchemy that happens with, like, the perfect image that captures a perfect moment in the perfect language, right? And so that idea of the body machine that happens at the end and then the surprising turn - it's everything I know of God - I think sort of captures in a way that maybe any other kind of language couldn't that feeling of mystery that is part of what it means to be humans. I just thought it was captured so wonderfully in that poem.
MARTIN: Tell us another one.
ALLEYNE: Absolutely. Let's see. Winter, the woods, my brother running away in moonlight the color of marrow. His 200 and some-odd bones hiding warm beneath his skin, tucked tender in his ears, whole and fresh until those few short sharp last breaths.
MARTIN: And that was by Nancy Stone (ph).
ALLEYNE: Yes.
MARTIN: What struck you about this one?
ALLEYNE: Even in this conversation, I can tell I'm always drawn to the body. And the specificity of the poem and those 200 odd bones, right, the short, sharp breaths. I think, again, the way the language is able to capture that exhaustion, that movement, the dynamism in the language itself, to me, that's the miraculous nature of the poem. And that was captivating for me.
MARTIN: We kind of came up with the tweet-length as a conceit. I mean, you know, who are we kidding? We just, you know, we just made that up just because of the brevity of it. We also thought it would kind of make it fun for people to participate. But what do you think about it? I mean, do you like the brevity of it? Does this appeal to you?
ALLEYNE: I am a fan of form in poetry - fixed forms. I love the sonnet. I love the villanelle. I love the Sistine. I love the Rondel. I love the Bop. All of these, like, rules that help for me make a container that you can pour something that is often bigger than you have words to say, right? And I also just think it's fun. Like, I like games. I like puzzles. I like, you know, systems. And so to me, the character limit is a system. Like, what can you do within this space that makes meaning and that makes beauty? And I think that's just the challenge of any poem, really.
MARTIN: Want me to play one that - we were able to get one of the contributor to record this one for us. This one is by Jay Sterner (ph), and here it is.
JAY STERNER: All the right words have gathered on my tongue to form a parade, but my teeth are the walls, and my fractured ego is the rain.
MARTIN: You picked this one, too, I just want to say.
ALLEYNE: I did.
MARTIN: You know, again, it's the body, but what else did you like about this?
ALLEYNE: One of the things I think that can really, for me, make a poem is when I see the poet in the poem, and the poet in a poem in a way that is vulnerable and human and complicit sometimes. And I think that's the thing I really enjoyed about that poem is that it was really sort of revealing the poet's awareness of his own failure to be better, right? Like, you know, here is a perfect thing to say, but I can't get out of my own way. So I think that idea of being vulnerable, to being wrong in the poem is brave. And I feel like I love to see that bravery show up in a poem.
MARTIN: So how did you start writing poems?
ALLEYNE: I'm from Trinidad. And there's a wonderful song form there, the Calypso. And I used to write Calypsos for my sister. Those were my earliest, earliest poems.
MARTIN: So finally, before we let you go - and thank you again for reading these poems with us this week and enjoying them along with us. Do you have some advice for people who maybe are still a little shy about getting started and putting some thoughts to paper?
ALLEYNE: Absolutely. I think the poem is one of the most democratic forms of art. It's a pencil and paper. And if we enter it as a mode of play and exploration, rather than the production of literature, I think we give ourselves permission to discover. And also, I think be fine with having fun and not producing a New Yorker-worthy NPR-worthy poem, right?
You know, I tell people all the time - it's my students - I'm like, listen, you have a pencil. You have a pen. And you think, I am perfectly equipped to make a perfectly good poem. But you have 10 fingers, and you might walk up to a piano and you don't think you can place Chopin. So, like, allow yourself to play the chopsticks of poetry, right? Just go and write a haiku. And you're just playing in language. And then maybe something comes from that.
MARTIN: That's Lauren Alleyne. She is the assistant director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center and the author of ""Difficult Fruit"" and ""Honeyfish."" And she was kind enough to join us from Raleigh, N.C. Lauren Alleyne, thank you so much for talking with us today.
ALLEYNE: My pleasure.
MARTIN: And if you'd like to hear your original poem on the air, tweet it to @npratc with the hashtag #nprpoetry. Every week, for the rest of the month, a professional poet like Lauren will join us on the air to talk about some submissions that caught his or her eye. Poems must be 140 characters or less.

Breaking Down The Hollywood Dispute Between Writers And Agents,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304681/breaking-down-the-hollywood-dispute-between-writers-and-agents?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Kim Masters, editor-at-large for The Hollywood Reporter , about the ongoing dispute between writers and agents.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
And now we turn to Hollywood to check in on the dispute between writers and talent agents. After groups representing both parties failed to reach an employment agreement, the Writers Guild instructed members to cut ties with their agents. That group represents thousands of writers, and the dispute could stall production of scripted TV shows and movies. Here to tell us what this means is Kim Masters. She's an editor at large at The Hollywood Reporter.
Kim Masters, welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again.
KIM MASTERS: My pleasure.
MARTIN: Can you just tell us as briefly as you can how we got to this point?
MASTERS: There has been a process called packaging that goes back more than 40 years. It's become an institution in this industry. And packaging means - this is primarily a thing now with television writers - when an agency puts together elements of a show and sells it to a studio, the studio pays the agency a fee directly. And this has various effects that the writers are now completely fed up with. They argue that the agents who are getting paid by the studios have a conflict because their job is to represent the writer and not make deals for themselves with the studios.
And they say that this causes writers to be underpaid. Oftentimes, writers don't even know that they're part of a package. They say that if you're developing a TV show, these fees that the studio is paying the agencies can cut the budget for your own TV show, diminishing your chances for success, because you can't necessarily hire the actor you want or get the location you want.
MARTIN: I think people could see their point. For example, if you were in a real estate transaction, and if you hired somebody to represent you, to then find out that that person was actually the person selling the house, for example - you would experience that as a conflict. So what do the agents say about that? What has their position been about that?
MASTERS: Well, what the agents give up in this scenario of packaging is you normally would pay a 10 percent commission to your agent for getting you a job, and you don't pay if the packaging fee is involved. So the agents are saying this helps lower-level writers because they can make more money. But the writers argue that this is more than offset by the potential conflicts that these agents have collecting fees from the studios.
And they point out and argue that their compensation has gone down in recent years overall. One of the writers said how he had walked through an art gallery at his agency. These agencies have all of this wealth and accoutrements and try to look very, very successful. But at this point, the writers are looking at all of those signs of success and saying, wasn't some of that money supposed to be mine?
MARTIN: So the Writers Guild leadership wrote to members saying that they are about to enter unchartered waters. What are some of the repercussions of this that we might see? Recognizing I'm asking you to speculate here since - as by definition, it's uncharted - what do you think might happen? What are people concerned about?
MASTERS: Well, guild members as of now are expected to fire their agents. It is pilot season, so the shows are staffing up right now. And what the writers are trying to do is figure out alternate means to communicate about what jobs are available and help people find jobs without involving agents.
MARTIN: Is there any entity or group working to resolve this?
MASTERS: Right now, we are looking at what seems like impasse. These are very divergent interests right now. The agents feel they must produce. They certainly don't want to give up these very, very lucrative packaging fees. Sometimes they make more than the writers from TV shows created by the writers. So this is really kind of an existential struggle, and I'm not sure how I see the way out.
MARTIN: That's Kim Masters, editor at large for The Hollywood Reporter.
Kim, thank you so much for joining us.
MASTERS: Oh, thank you for having me.

Understanding Changes To The Tax Code,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304674/understanding-changes-to-the-tax-code?station=KXJZ_FM,"Kay Bell, a writer for the Don't Mess With Taxes blog, talks with NPR's Michel Martin about changes in the tax code this year.
I sincerely hope this isn't the first time you're hearing this, but the deadline for filing your annual tax return is tomorrow. And this is the first tax season that will be affected by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
With the new changes to the tax code, it feels like we're all first-time filers this year. So to catch up with the changes and what they mean, we've reached out to Kay Bell. She is a financial journalist. And she writes the blog ""Don't Mess With Taxes,"" which she says translates taxes into money saving English. And she's with us now from - where else? - Austin, Texas. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
KAY BELL: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So let's jump in. What is different about taxes this year since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? What will people notice the most?
BELL: The first thing they will notice is there is a new form. Lawmakers promised us a postcard-sized tax return. It's not quite there. It's a little bigger than a regular postcard. But there's only one smaller form now instead of what used to be three forms. The bad thing about that is that in addition to this one smaller form, there are now six different schedules. So depending on what your tax situation is, you might have to file several different forms whereas in the past, maybe you only had one 1040 that you had to deal with.
MARTIN: Who benefits from the not quite a postcard, almost a postcard? And who is subjected to all those different schedules?
BELL: Well, you know, taxes are intensely personal. So you might have to fill out just the small form, whereas if in the past, you used the 1040ez, you'll use the new simple 1040 and be done with it. But if you had income other than W-2 income from an employer - say you had a side job, a gig job driving for one of the car services on the side - you're going to have to fill out one, two, maybe three forms. So it's a little more complicated. But they say it was a tradeoff to get us to a lower tax rate and broader tax - income tax brackets. So most of us end up paying less tax in the end.
MARTIN: Now, you talk with a lot of CPAs for your blog. What are they telling you about what their customers are telling them?
BELL: Well, they have some customers that are not happy that they're not getting as big of a refund as they used to. And there's a long story as to why that happened. Those who file early tend to be people who expect larger refunds. And when that didn't happen this year, we heard about it. You know, they complained loudly and on social media.
And the problem is that when the new tax law went into effect, it changed the withholding, which meant a lot of people - most people - got more money back in their paychecks. Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't notice it or they had other expenses that went up and absorbed this little bit of increase or they just didn't think about it because nobody thinks about taxes really until they get around to filing their return.
In addition to tax refunds being a little bit smaller, we're seeing that people aren't filing as quickly this year. And in fact, the IRS says they expect around almost 15 million people to file for an extension this year. And that's almost 5 million more than usually file for an extension every tax season.
MARTIN: So finally - so I'm guessing because, you know, your Twitter bio says that you are a tax geek, what's it been like for you this last couple of months of tax season? Are your friends and relatives, like, showing up at your house at odd hours with their forms...
BELL: It's been great. I mean...
MARTIN: ...Looking really upset? What's it like for you?
BELL: It's been great. I love it. I mean, taxes are nerve-racking anyway. Then you add change, which any kind of change, even if you want it, is frustrating. So you add those two together, and it can get really hectic. But I've been doing this for a long time. It's fun to see some changes made. And there are some good changes in this tax bill.
But it has been crazy. And people are a little worried. They just want to make sure they understand it, you know? Nobody wants to make the IRS mad. They want to make sure that they are getting all they can out of the new tax laws and that they are getting what they deserve.
MARTIN: That's Kay Bell. She is a journalist. She writes the blog ""Don't Mess With Taxes."" And she was kind of to join us from KUT in Austin, Texas. Kay Bell, thanks so much for talking to us.
BELL: Thank you.

AG Barr Prepares To Release Redacted Mueller Report,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304667/ag-barr-prepares-to-release-redacted-mueller-report?station=KXJZ_FM,"Attorney General William Barr is preparing to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It summarizes years of investigation into 2016 election interference.
Back now to one of the stories that has consumed the nation's capital - the Mueller report. It will soon be here, at least a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It's expected in the next couple of days - that according to Attorney General William Barr.
And while fights over the report probably will continue, the release is the culmination of investigations that go back nearly three years, reaching across continents and into President Trump's inner circle. NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas takes us back to the beginning.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: The investigation began in late July of 2016, when the FBI quietly opened its probe into possible links between the Trump campaign in Russia. That investigation, codenamed Operation Crossfire Hurricane, remained a closely held secret through the end of the 2016 campaign. It was not until March of 2017 - two months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States - that the American public would learn about the probe when then-FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JAMES COMEY: I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
LUCAS: That announcement triggered what would become a bare-knuckle political fight on Capitol Hill. Democrats pointed to a lengthy list of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, wondering whether they meant that Trump's aides had worked with the Kremlin as it interfered in the election. Republicans, in contrast, took aim at those investigating the president and his associates. But it was a decision by the president himself in early May that would truly turn official Washington on its head.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Breaking news tonight. President Trump has fired FBI Director James Comey. A stunning move...
LUCAS: Eight days later, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to oversee the rush investigation. The man picked to lead the probe was Robert Mueller, a decorated Vietnam veteran and former FBI director who had served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.
Mueller quickly pulled together a high-powered investigative team. It included some of the Justice Department's best lawyers, top-notch attorneys from private law firms and dozens of experienced FBI agents. Over the next 22 months, the special counsel's team quietly issued nearly 3,000 subpoenas and executed some 500 search warrants and interviewed around the same number of witnesses.
Most importantly, Mueller's team produced results. Thirty-four individuals, including 25 Russian nationals as well as three Russian entities, were indicted in the investigation. Mueller secured guilty pleas from seven people, including Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the president's first national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Each new indictment shook the nation's capital.
And as the months dragged on, the investigation loomed over the Trump White House. The president frequently lashed out at the FBI, the Justice Department, Mueller and his probe.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion.
It's a witch hunt. That's all it is. There was no collusion.
It's a total witch hunt. I've been saying it for a long time.
It's all a made-up fantasy. It's a witch hunt.
The witch hunt continues.
LUCAS: In January, Trump's longtime informal adviser Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks. That fueled speculation about Mueller's final move. Were more indictments in the pipeline? Would the president himself or his family be ensnared?
By this time, much of the political fight around the probe centered on what would happen to Mueller's final report on the investigation. Democrats and most Republicans agreed - the American public should be able to see for itself what Mueller had found.
The ultimate decision though would be in the hands of the new attorney general, William Barr. At his confirmation hearing, Barr told lawmakers he wanted to be as transparent as possible.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the special counsel's work. My goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.
LUCAS: Late last month, Mueller submitted his report to Barr. The attorney general took a weekend to review the materials, and then sent a four-page letter to Congress with the top-line conclusions. It was good news for an anxious White House. Barr's letter said Mueller's team did not find that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. It also said that on the question of obstruction of justice, the special counsel did not conclude that the president committed a crime. But it also did not exonerate him.
President Trump and his allies declared victory. Democrats demanded to see Mueller's full report and all of the underlying documents. Here's the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ADAM SCHIFF: This report is going to have to be made public. And of equal importance, the underlying evidence is going to have to be shared with Congress because that evidence not only goes to the issue of criminality, but it also goes to the issue of compromise.
LUCAS: House Democrats have raised questions about whether Russia holds financial or some other form of leverage over Trump. And they have threatened to subpoena the full report and underline investigative materials. Barr so far has promised only to provide Congress and the public with a redacted version.

Tiger Woods Wins 2019 Masters,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304660/tiger-woods-wins-2019-masters?station=KXJZ_FM,"In a surprise comeback, Tiger Woods wins his first major title in more than a decade.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Today in Augusta, Ga., what seemed impossible just a few years ago became a reality. Tiger Woods, who seemed a longshot to win another golf tournament - let alone another major championship - did just that, winning his fifth Masters by one stroke. It was his 15th major title and his first in almost 11 years.
Joining us now to tell us more about it is NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Tom, welcome.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Thank you. Hi, Michel.
MARTIN: So this story is all over social media. It's all over the world. People are tweeting about what they were doing the last time he won - my personal favorite, that Destiny's Child was beginning their final world tour. But Tiger has won a few times before - a few. So what makes this different?
GOLDMAN: Oh, boy. Well, you know, because a couple of years ago, Tiger Woods said he could barely walk. I think that's what makes this significant. He thought his career might be over. His back problems were debilitating. So the talk of winning - of winning a major seemed farfetched to say the least. But then he had fusion surgery - that was his fourth back surgery - and it worked.
And last year, he started his climb back. He built to a victory in the prestigious TOUR Championship in September of last year. And that proved he could win again. And today, he proved he could win a major again. It's the first major victory since 2008 - the 2008 U.S. Open - first Masters win since 2005. And the 14 intervening years are the longest gap between victories in Masters history.
And Michel, amazingly, this rekindles the question of, can he beat Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major championships? Eleven years ago, when he won No. 14 - that U.S. Open in 2008 - it seemed like a matter of when and not if that would happen. But to come back now and again start this talk about Tiger catching Jack, we just never saw it coming.
MARTIN: How did he do it today? Tell me - because it was a wild tournament overall. I mean, at one point, like, there were five guys in contention, like, five people tied. You know, the whole thing was wild. So how did he do it today? How did he pull it off?
GOLDMAN: It was amazing. At first, I should say he won coming from behind, which is a first. This is his first major that he's won without having at least a share of the lead going into the final round. And he started today's final round two shots behind the leader, Italy's Francesco Molinari.
Woods was kind of slow getting going, but he said afterwards that he just kept plodding - he used that word a bunch of times, plodding. And Molinari look great early on. He was sinking clutch putts. But then on hole 12, the par three in famed Amen Corner, Molinari put his tee shot in the creek in front of the green. And that changed the complexion of the tournament right there.
As Woods said later, it let a bunch of people back into the tournament. Really good players, some of the best in the world, like Brooks Koepka, who won two majors last year, world No. 2-ranked Dustin Johnson, they surged. But through it all, Woods played steady. And the last few holes, he did better than steady. He had three birdies - one under par - in his last six holes. And he won by a stroke.
MARTIN: We have about a minute left, Tom. So does this mean something for men's golf? I know that there's this whole question of, like, the Tiger effect and all of this. And, you know, he hasn't been on the scene except as a - sort of a sad sidebar in recent years. Does this mean something for men's golf overall for the sport?
GOLDMAN: I think it does. You know, Woods and his tremendous success years ago spawned a new generation of young athletic golfers with complete games. The golf out there is really good. And today, all those young golfers he spawned, he beat them in the biggest tournament when the pressure was greatest and when they were all playing really well. And so he again is on top, which I think is maybe disconcerting for the young guns who thought Woods was going to kind of fade off into the sunset. Not yet.
MARTIN: Exciting for the over-40 set overall, right? Now tell the truth, Tom. You're going to watch it again right now, aren't you?
GOLDMAN: I am.
MARTIN: All right. That's NPR's Tom Goldman. Tom, thank you.
GOLDMAN: You're welcome.

Can Julian Assange Legally Be Extradited To The U.S.?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304653/can-julian-assange-legally-be-extradited-to-the-u-s?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with John Bellinger, former State Department legal adviser, about the possibility of Julian Assange being extradited to the United States.
We're returning now to the story of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who's been indicted on a single count of conspiracy. This weekend, we've been asking what Assange's arrest means in the debate over national security versus press freedom. Now we want to take a look at the question of extradition. We've asked John Bellinger to help us with that. He was the State Department's legal adviser under President George W. Bush, and he's with us now.
Mr. Bellinger, thank you so much for joining us.
JOHN BELLINGER: Nice to be with you, Michel.
MARTIN: I understand that there is a U.S.-U.K. extradition treaty which says that someone cannot be extradited from the U.K. for, quote, unquote, ""political offense."" How is that defined? And does that mean something for this case?
BELLINGER: That's right. There's a extradition treaty that entered into force during the Bush administration. It's been in effect for about 10 years. And it defines the crimes for which individuals can be extradited from the U.S. or from the U.K. And it says that an individual may not be extradited for a political offense, but that's not defined. But historically, under international law, a political offense is an offense against the state such as espionage or sedition or treason.
MARTIN: Would it be fair to assume that Julian Assange's defense will try to make the case that this is all political?
BELLINGER: Oh, absolutely. That's going to be one of their chief defenses, I'm sure. And that's one of the reasons I suspect that the charges by the Justice Department were very carefully tailored not to charge him under our espionage laws but instead to charge him with conspiracy to hack into a computer so that he's not being charged with a political offense. But, of course, his defense lawyers are going to say that this is really all political, it's politically motivated, and that he's really being charged with a crime against the United States.
MARTIN: I understand that there's a hearing. An extradition hearing will be held in the U.K. on May 2. You know, what will that entail? What will we see?
BELLINGER: His defense lawyers will, I'm sure, make a number of arguments, including not only that this really is a political offense. But I'm sure they will argue also that he was a journalist performing a journalistic function. It does appear - although we don't know - that the U.K. government is already working together with the U.S. government and supports the extradition.
MARTIN: So who is the ultimate decision-maker here? And what is that person likely to be guided by, if you have any sense of that? For example, is there any precedent that either side could point to that might give us a sense of how this might proceed?
BELLINGER: Well, there'll be several levels inside the U.K. judicial system. There'll be a hearing before a judge in the U.K. and then probably through an appellate level in the U.K. And then, if history is any indication, if Mr. Assange loses, he could then keep appealing all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights saying that his human rights have been violated. Historically, the British have extradited numerous individuals to the U.S. Although many of them and their defense counsel have argued that they would face unfair or improper trials in the U.S., most of those have been extradited.
But in a few cases in the past, there have been individuals whose extradition from the U.K. to the U.S. have been denied. In this case, this will really be, I think, a battle royal because Assange and his lawyers will argue very forcefully that I'm sure particularly the Trump administration is coming after him for political reasons.
MARTIN: So, as you mentioned earlier, Assange has only been charged with one count of conspiracy. If he's extradited to the U.S., could he face other charges here? And is that something that his lawyers might raise?
BELLINGER: Additional charges may be added before his extradition is sought. But after he is extradited, then the U.S. cannot change the charges later on. That would violate a treaty provision called the rule of specialty. So he could only be tried for the charges for which he is extradited.
MARTIN: That's John Bellinger. He was the State Department's legal adviser under President George W. Bush. He now heads the Global Law and Public Policy Practice Group at the law firm Arnold & Porter.
Mr. Bellinger, thanks so much for talking to us.
BELLINGER: Thanks, Michel. It's always a pleasure.

Trump Administration Considers Transferring Immigrants to 'Sanctuary Cities',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304646/trump-administration-considers-transferring-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities?station=KXJZ_FM,"Hogan Gidley, White House principal deputy press secretary, talks with NPR's Michel Martin about President Trump's proposal to relocate detained migrants to so-called sanctuary cities.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to start the program with the latest on an idea apparently being considered by the White House - to transfer detained asylum seekers and other would-be immigrants in so-called sanctuary cities. Several news organizations had reported last week that the idea had been floated within the Trump administration and then rejected. But on Friday, the president told reporters he is actually considering this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We might as well do what they always say they want. We'll bring the illegal - really, you call them the illegals. I call them the illegals. They came across the border illegally. We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it.
MARTIN: White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is here with us now to tell us more.
Mr. Gidley, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
HOGAN GIDLEY: Thank you so much. It's great to be with you.
MARTIN: As I indicated, the White House has had several conflicting statements about this when it was first reported. The White House in a statement knocked it down. Then the president on Friday said what we just heard him say. And then Sarah Sanders this morning said that this is a real proposal. What changed from Thursday night, when the White House said that this proposal was dead, to Friday, when the president said that it isn't? What happened?
GIDLEY: Well, we had looked at it before, and obviously, there were some challenges we faced that prevented us from moving forward on any real steps to make this happen. And then the president actually came to us and said, listen - I think this is a really good idea. We already have so many people pouring into this country in record-setting numbers - 100,000-plus just last month alone. And the problem is Democrats won't work with us to fix the current laws. And so they tell us, you cannot keep family units detained. You cannot keep family units - or they don't want us to keep family units on the Mexico side of the border while they await their day in court.
And you can't detain them here. So if you can't deport them, and you can't detain them, the only option is to release them. The problem is we consistently release these family units in the same communities - into San Diego, San Antonio, Yuma, Phoenix, El Paso, all along the southern border. And they should not be forced to bear the brunt of policies that they have no control over.
MARTIN: OK...
GIDLEY: So we looked at it and said, where are the logical places to spread the wealth, if you will? And places like San Francisco, for example, or a sanctuary city - they are designed and set up specifically to have people there who aren't here legally. That's what their stated goal is. So there's no reason we shouldn't be looking at a...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...Way to give them exactly what they want.
MARTIN: You mentioned impediments or obstacles. I'm not quite sure what the word you just used was. But it's been reported that the Cabinet-level agency which would be responsible for implementing this has had its own legal counsel reject this for legal reasons. He said it's illegal specifically to transfer people into specific areas for political retribution. On what legal grounds does the White House believe you can transfer people to specific areas of the country in order to retaliate against their political leadership?
GIDLEY: Well, wait a second. (Laughter) I just got through telling you that's completely a false premise. First of all, we already send them to specific places. The problem is we send them to the same specific places repeatedly. So you've got to spread it out a little bit. It's not political retribution. If anything, you should consider it on the Democrat side to be an olive branch. You've asked us to work with you on some things we've put forth, time after time, solution after solution. They will not come to the table.
So the logical answer is to give them something they want. Democrats say that if you even think about rejecting people into this country illegally that you are somehow racist. So the question then becomes, do Democrats want to allow these people to be shipped into their communities? That's what they said they wanted. It's not political retribution. It's a solution to a problem we face along the southern border.
MARTIN: Who are these entities who are specifically saying that we would like you to move these immigrant families or would-be immigrant families or would-be asylum seekers elsewhere? Who are these entities who are saying that to you?
GIDLEY: Sure...
MARTIN: Because we are getting different information from different political leaders. So who exactly is telling you that this is what they think the administration should do?
GIDLEY: Our contention is the conversations we have on the same towns along the southern border, as I just mentioned. NGOs, non-government organizations, are telling us they don't have enough resources to actually address the people that are being influxed (ph) into these communities. Democrats won't give us enough money to keep them along the border in detention facilities, won't give us enough ICE beds, won't give the resources we need to house them down along the southern border.
So the only thing remains is to send them into other locations across the country who are, again, specifically designed to handle it. It shouldn't be political retribution or considered such. What it should be is the Democrats beating down the gates at the White House trying to get in here to say, thank you, Mr. President. We have long said these people deserve the right to be here even though they're here illegally.
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: And anybody who disagrees is a racist. We want them in our communities. We've said so.
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: How do we work with the administration...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...To make sure they are transported safely into these sanctuary cities?
MARTIN: Two more questions for you. There is a bipartisan proposal, which was proposed by Xochitl Small Torres (ph), who represents New Mexico, and Dan Crenshaw, who's a freshman from Texas, and Will Hurd, who is a veteran from Texas. He's also the only Republican currently representing a border district. They have a bipartisan proposal which would offer a different option - which would offer additional support to border agents at the border, additional judges, additional immigration judges to process these asylum seekers and so forth. Is the White House considering this proposal - which is bipartisan, as we said?
GIDLEY: We are considering all proposals that would work to alleviate this problem, especially ones that are bipartisan, as you mentioned. I can't speak directly to that particular piece of legislation as I've not seen it, and I don't know exactly if we've taken a stand one way or the other. But until they pass something like that, these are all hypotheticals. Anybody who's willing to come forth and present a solution to the problem, we're happy to sit down and listen.
MARTIN: And before we let you go, I think many people might wonder why, when the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House for the first two years of this administration, if this is as significant a crisis as the White House says it is, why the issue wasn't addressed then legislatively.
GIDLEY: Yeah, that's a great question you'd have to ask Republicans. Don't think they're unscathed here for what they didn't accomplish. There's no doubt. Now, part of that is, as you know, the political realities exist that we didn't have a filibuster-proof Senate. So we could have gotten some of these things through had they gone nuclear. Obviously, that's something that Leader McConnell didn't want to do. But the fact is, they should have done a lot more.
But that's in the past. What we have now is a Democrat-controlled House, and they've got to work with us if they say they want to protect the American people. They voted for border walls and barriers in the past. They voted for measures along the southern border to give them resources...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...In the past. Even Barack Obama in 2014 called this a crisis from the Rose Garden. It's only gotten...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...Worse. So it's time to get some solutions out there so we can protect the American people.
MARTIN: That was Hogan Gidley, deputy White House press secretary.
Mr. Gidley, thank you so much for speaking to us.
GIDLEY: Thank you so much for the time.

Steve Bannon Documentary Lets Former Chief Trump Aide Make His Case,www.npr.org,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/702887015/i-m-gonna-get-crushed-trump-aide-steve-bannon-pleads-his-case-in-the-brink,"Klayman spent months of 2017 and 2018 tracking Bannon to a succession of lairs, many in luxurious European locales. (One such suite, walls aching with art, overlooks a Venetian waterway over which looms the St. Mark's Basilica.)
""I'm gonna get crushed in this film,"" Bannon wails at one point. ""She's gotten every five-star hotel...""
At times he speaks straight to the camera, making pronouncements about the righteous American working-class uprising that ushered Trump into the Oval Office. More often, he is seen gazing out windows into the middle distance, muttering soliloquies — wistful but always self-aware. Does he forget he's on camera? YouTube
""Steve Bannon is always performing for every person who is in the room,"" Klayman says. ""Even when he's alone.""
Why do people submit to such invasions of privacy? At a screening in Washington on Tuesday night, Klayman introduced her co-producer, Marie Therese Guirgis, who turns out to have produced, among other things, the cooperation of the film's subject.
Guirgis had worked for Bannon during his years as a film producer a decade ago. She liked him; he trusted her. Next thing you knew, Bannon was agreeing to have Klayman quietly present, shooting and recording as he went about his business.
Klayman says she made a conscious decision: ""I would let him underestimate me and never let myself underestimate him."" In China, A Persistent Thorn In The State's Side
The real art in such cinema verite is often in the editing, and Klayman (known for her film on Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei ) has cut this film with drive, perception and purpose. We are with her subject in his highs and lows, great moments, small, manic moods and dark ones.
Adding a certain sense of faded luster in the film are the friends and hangers on we see, from a nephew who brings Bannon his Coke or kombucha to Trump sycophant Sam Nunberg (""I got Trump onto Twitter"") to the former Goldman Sachs president, John Thornton, who hangs out and encourages Bannon to be the intellectual entrepreneur for the populist-nationalist uprisings of our time.
In one remarkably unguarded moment, Bannon rebukes Nunberg for calling Trump a friend. ""When you reach [Trump's] level you don't have grundoons for friends,"" Bannon says, sitting across from Nunberg on a private jet. ""Guys like you and Corey [Lewandowski] and [Roger] Stone think you're his friends."" In 'Everything Trump Touches Dies,' Few Are Spared
In the end the portrait of Bannon, the one-time publisher of Breitbart who ran the final months of Trump's 2016 campaign, is neither empathetic nor sympathetic. It is unsparing with its subject and his evident sadness.
We see the Bannon who segued from campaign chief to ""chief strategist"" in the White House, holding that title for most of 2017. But we also see the Bannon who took the fall for the political disaster following the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va.
Trump tried to straddle that crisis by saying there were ""good people on both sides."" It didn't work, and Bannon was soon a civilian again.
Since his banishment from the White House, Bannon has given interviews to journalists and memoirists and sought to find his own space in the world of politics that was redefined by his former boss.
He takes great pride in the Trump victory, and he takes his share of credit for it. In fact, he seems semi-obsessed with Trumpian energy and formula that worked in 2016. He shows real depression over the idea of losing the Republican majority in the House in the 2018 midterms.
He warns all who will listen in the fall of 2018 that a Democratic majority in the House will control the appropriations process (as they have) and block funding for the border wall (as they have) and potentially move to impeach (which they still might). He is especially fixated on the fate of the wall, which he calls ""the key to the whole Trump presidency.""
When the November 2018 election results come in, Bannon seems discouraged at the prospect that his timetable will now need some adjusting. But it is, he allows, a historical process with an open-ended time frame.
""This is a global revolution,"" he muses. ""And I'm just very lucky to be at the vanguard."" Steve Bannon Sets Sights On Europe With Planned New Political Project
Being the tip of that spear not only appeals to Bannon but gives him a mission for his post-Trump life. He is building a ""global movement"" against globalism , no irony intended. And his definition of globalism includes immigration, the European Union, trade deals, multinational peacekeeping missions and all those elitists he calls ""the Davos crowd.""

Much of the film depicts Bannon's networking with a ragtag assortment of European Trump wannabes. The more major figures of nationalism and right-wing populism, such as France's Marine Le Pen or Hungary's Viktor Orban, are seen only in stock film clips and stills. The participants in Bannon's various conclaves are more on the level of Nigel Farage (an impresario of Brexit in Great Britain) and various nativists and right-wing activists from Western Europe.
At one point, Bannon kvetches about prototypes for the website and literature of his organization, which he wants to call ""The Movement."" The designs look cheap, not ""classic"" enough. He denounces and browbeats his subordinates by cell phone.
In the film, Bannon is interviewed by Paul Lewis, a writer for The Guardian . Lewis appeared with Klayman and Guirgis on Tuesday night in Washington, and acknowledged Bannon's claim of intercontinental importance. Nonetheless, Lewis insists, Bannon is simply not a factor in European populism. What Bannon is, Lewis adds, is ""very effective at portraying himself as enormously important to that movement.""
In the end, that may well have been Bannon's intent in cooperating in the making of The Brink . But the story the film tells is ultimately quite different. The film is scheduled for general release on March 29. Facebook"

HBO We're recapping the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones ; look for these recaps first thing on Monday mornings. Spoilers, of course, abound.
Welcome back, everyone. It's been two years since last we gathered around the flickering electronic hearth to feast our eyes on this world, and these characters, many of whom – I'm thinking here of the dragons and the ice-zombies mostly – would happily feast on our eyes. Because Winter is Here, and it's shaping up to be a long, cruel one, and Sansa didn't pack away enough provisions for everyone.
This first episode back is stuffed to the gills with great big thick chunks of plot – reunions, recriminations, spilled secrets – because the show's sprinting toward the close and there's no time to waste. I mean, sure, the Euron scenes drag on forever, but that's because Euron is so one-note and dull that time slows as you approach him. He's an event horizon of boring, is our leather-panted sea slug.
But everything else? Zipping along at a pace that surprised me, though I knew we've been nearing the exit for the fireworks factory for some time. Again and again, we get set-ups for the kind of conflicts that, in seasons past, would simmer over the course of four or five episodes. Now, instead, they boil over in the very same scene they're introduced. It's not immersive, no – but it's efficient.
Let's begin.
Opening credits! With a considerable upgrade! First off, that spinning sun-mobile thingy that flies over the clockwork map of Westeros has traded its galloping Baratheon stag for a Targaryen dragon immolating the Wall. We zoom down over the map, through the gaping breach in the Wall (nice touch). There's a neat effect of encroaching ice as we approach a location we've never visited before – Last Hearth. Then it's off to Winterfell, which has gotten a serious makeover – and so has our point-of-view, which takes us through the castle and down into the crypts. We soar down to King's Landing, also looking freshly spiffy, and into the catacombs complete with a few facsimiles of Qyburn's ballista and some dragon skulls. We finish in the throne room, as the Iron Throne itself rises out of the floor and pokes out its pokey swords like it's a frilled lizard in courtship display.
Pop Culture Happy Hour Which Characters Will Lose The 'Game Of Thrones?': A Chronicle Of Many Deaths Foretold We're in a small town just outside of Winterfell's walls. A young kid is running frantically – we're meant to think he's in danger, running from White Walkers, perhaps – but it turns out he's not running away from something, he's running toward it. The something in question: He wants to get a glimpse of the endless line of Unsullied, marching through town on their way to Winterfell. Arya is among the townsfolk lining the street – she looks impassive, they look worried and resentful.
Also on the march: Daenerys and Jon Snow, The Hound (Arya's face falls at the sight of him), Gendry (slight smile), Tyrion and Varys, bickering contentedly, as is their wont, Grey Worm and Missandei. So, most of the call sheet, basically. Also? Not for nothing? Two great big honkin' dragons, which do a screeching flyby, buzzing the townsfolk, who scatter like startled antelope, if antelope wore ratty cloaks and looked like they smelled like feet.
Both Arya and Sansa, who stands atop the Winterfell battlements, get the chance to goggle at their first sight of a dragon. There's an emotional reunion between Jon Snow and Bran Stark, though Bran being Bran, the emotion in question is Jon's. At one point Sansa shoots Jon a look like, ""No, yeah, Bran's weird now, bro. And Arya's got her own trippy death-cult vibe going on now, too, just you wait.""
Sansa welcomes Daenerys to Winterfell, albeit coolly — nay, icily; she's still sore that Jon swore fealty to Daenerys, giving up his title of King in the North. Also peeved: young Lyanna Mormont, unless that hilariously intense scowl on her face means she needs to get more fiber. Daenerys opts for a butter-wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth opening salvo, but they are interrupted by Bran, who brings everyone up to speed: The Wall is down, the dragon that she lost fighting the Night King is now the kind of dead that's un-, and the White Walkers are on the move.
(See what I mean? Eleven minutes in, and the characters have learned all the information that we know. Efficient.)
In Winterfell's Great Hall, they decide to send word to the other Houses of the North to take refuge in Winterfell, and dispatch li'l Lord Umber off to his family's castle, Last Hearth (from the credits!) to retrieve them. Jon sends for the men of the Night's Watch as well. Lyanna Mormont seizes the moment to call Jon out on abandoning his crown in favor of Daenerys, because ""calling folk out"" is Lyanna Mormont's entire, magnificent deal.
Jon attempts to defend himself, but only succeeds in sending the scruffy assemblage to muttering ""peas-and-carrots, peas-and-carrots."" Tyrion tries to weigh in, but as soon as he mentions that the Lannister army is on its way to join the good fight, the muttering blossoms from ""peas and carrots"" into an entire Birds Eye frozen vegetable medley.
Gendry heads to the Winterfell forges with wagons loaded with dragonglass while Tyrion has an awkward, wry and respectful reunion with Sansa. Some air gets cleared between them — enough for him to see that she's been changed by everything she's been through. (""Many underestimated you,"" he says. ""Most of them are dead now."") Sansa correctly surmises that Cersei lied about sending the Lannister armies to help and mocks Tyrion for believing the lie in the first place.
The show has placed Sansa in a tough position here at the start of the final season. She resents Jon's partnering with Daenerys and is not afraid to get salty about it; this makes her an obstacle in the Dany-Jon-Tyrion story path. So to make sure we stay on Sansa's side, the producers do things like have Tyrion remind her (us) that people underestimate her, and make her able to see things that Tyrion can't. Good for Sansa, but it does seem like they could have found a way to build up Sansa as a savvy leader without making Tyrion look stupid.
In the Winterfell Godswood, another reunion: Arya sneaks up on Jon, acting all cool and distant and Faceless Mannish, before dropping her guard and offering a glimpse of an Arya we haven't seen in years. He asks if she's ever used Needle, the sword he gave her back in Season 1. She, um, has. (Has he not been debriefed by Sansa? Or did Sansa figure ""Our little sister is a skilled assassin who collects and wears dead people's faces"" is the kind of news Jon should get from the source?)
Jon starts to complain about Sansa, only to get slapped down: ""She's the smartest person I've ever met,"" says Arya, and g z okAY we GET it, show .
Down in King's Landing, Queen Cersei receives the news that the Wall has fallen with that same close-mouthed, lizardlike, humorless smile she greets most things with, and she welcomes Euron Greyjoy and his Iron Fleet, which has ferried 20,000 mercenaries (""The Golden Company,"" in point of fact), 2,000 horses and — to the Queen's disappointment — exactly zero elephants across the Narrow Sea. (The Golden Company is led by the symmetrically featured, swoopy haired bohunk Captain Strickland, whose name reads less ""George R.R. Martin fantasy character"" and more ""Delta co-pilot,"" but let that go.)
Euron Greyjoy is also here, because he's got to be somewhere, I suppose. First he gloats and smarms over his captive Yara Greyjoy, who seems as over him as I am. Next, he prattles on before the Iron Throne, where Cersei cuts him down to size before inviting him up to her room, mystifyingly enough. Knew she was evil, but I thought she had taste .
Bronn cavorts with a trio of sex workers who can't seem to stop talking about how weird it is that dragons are back, which seems like the kind of thing that would happen. He's then given new marching orders from Cersei, by way of Qyburn – he's to hunt down his former besties Jaime and Tyrion Lannister and kill them with a very familiar crossbow.
There's a post-coital scene between Euron and Cersei that, yes, has a lot of Euron in it, but this unpleasant fact is largely ameliorated because it also features Cersei guzzling red wine and smiling that smile, which will always be peak Cersei, and for which I will always be here.
Theon rescues his sister Yara; she decides to head back to the Iron Islands to wait there, in case Daenerys loses her battle in the North and needs to retreat to somewhere safe from the Army of the Dead, who, famously and conveniently, cannot swim. (No word on whether they can boat, though. I mean, they managed to work together to haul a full-size dead dragon out of an icy lake – they can definitely pilot a Sunfish.)
Pop Culture Happy Hour 'Game Of Thrones' Season 7 Finale: 'We've Been Here For Some Time' Theon heads up to Winterfell to join the fight, because his redemption arc needs a button.
At Winterfell, several of the other Houses are showing up for the fight. Davos Seaworth raises the possibility of a marriage between Jon and Daenerys. ""They do make a handsome couple,"" says Tyrion. ""Nothing lasts,"" says Varys.
(Team Varys, always, again, some more.)
This is followed — again, astonishingly quickly — by the sight of Jon Snow hauling his mopey yet no less exquisite butt onto Rhaegal the dragon's back and taking the beast for a spin. Or getting taken for a spin, technically.
Look, we knew it was gonna happen, but how many of us had ""minute 34 of Episode 1"" in the pool? It feels like the show's burning through the stuff it knows we're expecting so it can start doing the stuff we aren't.
We get a three-minute ""Whole New World"" sequence as Daenerys and Jon swoop and sway through the air, alighting beside a picturesque waterfall to make out – while the dragons look on ... warily? Approvingly? Distrustfully? Hornily? It's tough to tell with dragons.
Back at the forge, Gendry supplies the Hound with a dragonglass ax, and there's a tense reunion between the Hound and Arya, who suddenly appears behind him like some kind of tiny, fantastically eyebrowed Batman. She does that a lot. Arya commissions Gendry to build her a weapon. Watch this space.
Not all of the Houses are agreeing to retreat to Winterfell. Sansa is still seething about Jon and Daenerys, and you'd be forgiven if you found your eyes starting to roll at any point during her dressing down of Jon. But look at it this way – coming as it does here, now, we're only gonna get one episode's worth of it. If this was back in Season 5, this whole Resentful Sansa thing would fuel a six-episode arc. You know it would. The scene ends with Sansa asking Jon if he bent the knee (ugh) to save the North, or because he loves her.
And here I'd so hoped we'd left ""bend the knee,"" as a phrase, back in Season 7. Lord knows they beat it to death back then. But then, dead things don't tend to stay dead in Westeros nowadays.
Daenerys and Jorah visit Sam in the Winterfell library, to thank him for curing Jorah last season. Their talk comes around to the subject of Sam's father and brother, the late Randyll and Dickon Tarly, whom you'll recall Daenerys, not for nothing, flash-fried in dragon breath last season. She comes out and tells Sam what she did without wasting any time (because six episodes and counting, guys let's go let's go let's go ), and Sam reacts. And reacts and reacts and reacts. John Bradley, stealth MVP of Game of Thrones , strikes again: He's got a lot to play in this scene; you can watch his baseline comic mien giving way to waves of successive emotions, as shock and anger and sorrow play across his features.
Sam runs into Bran in the Winterfell courtyard; Bran urges Sam to tell Jon about his true lineage right away. It's clear that Bran has acquired the Three-Eyed Raven's bossiness as well as his impassivity.
Sam finds Jon in the Winterfell crypts and tells him the truth: He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, and the true heir to the Iron Throne. And following Sam's conversation with Daenerys, he's become convinced that Jon deserves to rule the Seven Kingdoms more than she does, as Jon has demonstrated restraint and mercy countless times, while Daenerys ... fricasseed Sam's father and brother, for example. (To be fair, Tyrion did warn her not to.)
Tormund and Beric, looking astonishingly hale and hearty after the Wall crumbled around them last season, enter the ruins of Last Hearth, home to li'l Lord Umber. Clearly something very bad has gone down here, but there are no bodies to be found (hint). They run into Dolorous Edd and a few men from Castle Black; together, they find the dismembered body of li'l Lord Umber, stuck to the wall and arranged in the spiral formation we've come to associate with White Walkers.

Back at Winterfell, which should really be the name of the episode, Bran is still waiting in the courtyard.

HBO We're recapping the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones ; look for these recaps first thing on Monday mornings. Spoilers, of course, abound.
Welcome back, everyone – it's been two years since last we gathered around the flickering electronic hearth to feast our eyes on this world, and these characters, many of whom – I'm thinking here of the dragons and the ice-zombies mostly – would happily feast on our eyes. Because Winter is Here, and it's shaping up to be a long, cruel one, and Sansa didn't pack away enough provisions for everyone.
This first episode back is stuffed to the gills with great big thick chunks of plot – reunions, recriminations, spilled secrets – because the show's sprinting toward the close and there's no time to waste. I mean, sure, the Euron scenes drag on forever, but that's because Euron is so one-note and dull that time slows as you approach him. He's an event horizon of boring, is our leather-panted sea slug.
But everything else? Zipping along at a pace that surprised me, though I knew we've been nearing the exit for the fireworks factory for some time. Again and again, we get set-ups for the kind of conflicts that, in seasons past, would simmer over the course of four or five episodes – instead, they boil over in the very same scene they're introduced. It's not immersive, no – but it's efficient.
Let's begin.
Opening credits! With a considerable upgrade! First off, that spinning sun-mobile thingy that flies over the clockwork map of Westeros has traded its galloping Baratheon stag for a Targaryen dragon immolating the Wall. We zoom down over the map, through the gaping breach in the Wall (nice touch). There's a neat effect of encroaching ice as we approach a location we've never visited before – Last Hearth. Then it's off to Winterfell, which has gotten a serious makeover – and so has our point-of-view, which takes us through the castle and down into the crypts. We soar down to King's Landing, also looking freshly spiffy, and into the catacombs complete with a few facsimiles of Qyburn's ballista and some dragon skulls. We finish in the throne room, as the Iron Throne itself rises out of the floor and pokes out its pokey swords like it's a frilled lizard in courtship display.
Pop Culture Happy Hour Which Characters Will Lose The 'Game Of Thrones?': A Chronicle Of Many Deaths Foretold We're in a small town just outside of Winterfell's walls. A young kid is running frantically – we're meant to think he's in danger, running from White Walkers, perhaps – but it turns out he's not running away from something, he's running toward it. The something in question: He wants to get a glimpse of the endless line of Unsullied, marching through town on their way to Winterfell. Arya is among the townsfolk lining the street – she looks impassive, they look worried and resentful.
Also on the march: Daenerys and Jon Snow, The Hound (Arya's face falls at the sight of him), Gendry (slight smile), Tyrion and Varys, bickering contentedly, as is their wont, Grey Worm and Missandei. So, most of the call sheet, basically. Also? Not for nothing? Two great big honkin' dragons, which do a screeching flyby, buzzing the townsfolk, who scatter like startled antelope, if antelope wore ratty cloaks and looked like they smelled like feet.
Both Arya and Sansa, who stands atop the Winterfell battlements, get the chance to goggle at their first sight of a dragon. There's an emotional reunion between Jon Snow and Bran Stark, though Bran being Bran, the emotion in question is Jon's. At one point Sansa shoots Jon a look like, ""No, yeah, Bran's weird now, bro. And Arya's got her own trippy death-cult vibe going on now, too, just you wait.""
Sansa welcomes Daenerys to Winterfell, albeit coolly — nay, icily ; she's still sore that Jon swore fealty to Daenerys, giving up his title of King in the North. Also peeved: young Lyanna Mormont, unless that hilariously intense scowl on her face means she needs to get more fiber. Daenerys opts for a butter-wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth opening salvo, but they are interrupted by Bran, who brings everyone up to speed: The Wall is down, the dragon that she lost fighting the Night King is now the kind of dead that's un-, and the White Walkers are on the move.
(See what I mean? Eleven minutes in, and the characters have learned all the information that we know. Efficient .)
In Winterfell's Great Hall, they decide to send word to the other Houses of the North to take refuge in Winterfell, and dispatch li'l Lord Umber off to his family's castle, Last Hearth (from the credits!) to retrieve them. Jon sends for the men of the Night's Watch as well. Lyanna Mormon seizes the moment to call Jon out on abandoning his crown in favor of Daenerys, because ""calling folk out"" is Lyanna Mormont's entire, magnificent deal.
Jon attempts to defend himself, but only succeeds in sending the scruffy assemblage to muttering ""peas-and-carrots, peas-and-carrots."" Tyrion tries to weigh in, but as soon as he mentions that the Lannister army is on its way to join the good fight, the muttering blossoms from ""peas and carrots"" into an entire Birds Eye frozen vegetable medley.
Gendry heads to the Winterfell forges with wagons loaded with dragonglass while Tyrion has an awkward, wry and respectful reunion with Sansa. Some air gets cleared between them — enough for him to see that she's been changed by everything she's been through. (""Many underestimated you,"" he says. ""Most of them are dead now."") Sansa correctly surmises that Cersei lied about sending the Lannister armies to help, and mocks Tyrion for believing the lie in the first place.
(The show's placed Sansa in a tough position, here at the start of the final season. She resents Jon's partnering with Daenerys, and is not afraid to get salty about it; this makes her an obstacle in the Dany-Jon-Tyrion story path. So to make sure we stay on Sansa's side, the producers do things like have Tyrion remind her (us) that people underestimate her, and make her able to see things that Tyrion can't. Good for Sansa, but it does seem like they could have found a way to build up Sansa as a savvy leader without making Tyrion look stupid.)
In the Winterfell Godswood, another reunion: Arya sneaks up on Jon, acting all cool and distant and Faceless Mannish, before dropping her guard and offering a glimpse of an Arya we haven't seen in years. He asks if she's ever used Needle, the sword he gave her back in season one. She, um, has. (Has he not been debriefed by Sansa? Or did Sansa figure ""Our little sister is a skilled assassin who collects and wears dead people's faces"" is the kind of news Jon should get from the source?)
Jon starts to complain about Sansa, only to get slapped down: ""She's the smartest person I've ever met,"" says Arya, and g z okAY we GET it, show .
Down in King's Landing, Queen Cersei receives the news that the Wall has fallen with that same close-mouthed, lizard-like, humorless smile she greets most things with, and welcomes Euron Greyjoy and his Iron Fleet, which has ferried 20,000 mercenaries (""The Golden Company,"" in point of fact), 2,000 horses and – to the Queen's disappointment – exactly zero elephants across the Narrow Sea. (The Golden Company is led by the symmetrically featured, swoopy haired bohunk Captain Strickland, whose name reads less ""George R. R. Martin fantasy character"" and more ""Delta co-pilot,"" but let that go.)
Euron Greyjoy is also here, because he's got to be somewhere, I suppose. First he gloats and smarms over his captive Yara Greyjoy, who seems as over him as I am. Next the prattles on before the Iron Throne, where Cersei cuts him down to size before inviting him up to her room, mystifyingly enough. Knew she was evil, but I thought she had taste .
Bronn cavorts with a trio of sex workers who can't seem to stop talking about how weird it is that dragons are back – which seems like the kind of thing that would happen. He's then given new marching orders from Cersei, by way of Qyburn – he's to hunt down his former besties Jaime and Tyrion Lannister, and kill them with a very familiar crossbow.
There's a post-coital scene between Euron and Cersei that, yes, has a lot of Euron in it, but this unpleasant fact is largely ameliorated because it also features Cersei guzzling red wine and smiling that smile, which will always be Peak Cersei, and for which I will always be here.
Theon rescues his sister Yara; she decides to head back to the Iron Islands to wait there, in case Daenerys loses her battle in the North and needs to retreat to somewhere safe from the Army of the Dead, who, famously and conveniently, cannot swim. (No word on whether they can boat, though. I mean, they managed to work together to haul a full-size dead dragon out of an icy lake – they can definitely pilot a Sunfish.)
Pop Culture Happy Hour 'Game Of Thrones' Season 7 Finale: 'We've Been Here For Some Time' Theon heads up to Winterfell to join the fight, because his redemption arc needs a button.
At Winterfell, several of the other Houses are showing up for the fight. Davos Seaworth raises the possibility of a marriage between Jon and Daenerys. ""They do make a handsome couple,"" says Tyrion. ""Nothing lasts,"" says Varys.
(Team Varys, always, again, some more.)
This is followed – again, astonishingly quickly – by the sight of Jon Snow hauling his mopey yet no less exquisite butt onto Rhaegal the dragon's back, and taking the beast for a spin. Or getting taken for a spin, technically.
Look: We knew it was gonna happen, but how many of us had ""minute 34 of episode one"" in the pool? It feels like the show's burning through the stuff it knows we're expecting so it can start doing the stuff we aren't.
We get a three-minute ""Whole New World"" sequence as Daenerys and Jon swoop and sway through the air, alighting beside a picturesque waterfall to make out – while the dragons look on ... warily? Approvingly? Distrustfully? Hornily? It's tough to tell with dragons.
Back at the forge, Gendry supplies the Hound with a dragonglass axe, and there's a tense reunion between the Hound and Arya, who suddenly appears behind him like some kind of tiny, fantastically eyebrowed Batman. She does that a lot. Arya commissions Gendry to build her a weapon. Watch this space.
Not all of the Houses are agreeing to retreat to Winterfell. Sansa is still seething about Jon and Daenerys, and you'd be forgiven if you found your eyes starting to roll at any point during her dressing down of Jon. But look at it this way – coming as it does here, now, we're only gonna get one episode's worth of it. If this was back in season five, this whole Resentful Sansa thing would fuel a six-episode arc, you know it would. The scene ends with Sansa asking Jon if he bent the knee (ugh) to save the North, or because he loves her.
And here I'd so hoped we'd left ""bend the knee,"" as a phrase, back in season seven. Lord knows they beat it to death back then. But then, dead things don't tend to stay dead in Westeros nowadays.
Daenerys and Jorah visit Sam in the Winterfell library, to thank him for curing Jorah last season. Their talk comes around to the subject of Sam's father and the brother, the late Randyll and Dickon Tarly, whom you'll recall Daenerys, not for nothing, flash-fried in dragon breath last season. She comes out and tells Sam what she did without wasting any time (because six episodes and counting, guys let's go let's go let's go ), and Sam reacts. And reacts and reacts and reacts. John Bradley, stealth MVP of Game of Thrones , strikes again: He's got a lot to play in this scene; you can watch his baseline comic mien giving way to waves of successive emotions, as shock and anger and sorrow play across his features.
Sam runs into Bran in the Winterfell courtyard; Bran urges Sam to tell Jon about his true lineage right away. It's clear that Bran's acquired the Three-Eyed Raven's bossiness as well as his impassivity.
Sam finds Jon in the Winterfell crypts, and proceeds to tell him the truth: He's the son of Rheagar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, and the true heir to the Iron Throne. And following Sam's conversation with Daenerys, he's become convinced that Jon deserves to rule the Seven Kingdoms more than she does, as Jon has demonstrated restraint and mercy countless times, while Daenerys ... fricasseed Sam's father and brother, for example. (To be fair, Tyrion did warn her not to.)
Tormund and Beric, looking astonishingly hale and hearty after the Wall crumbled around them last season, enter the ruins of Last Hearth, home to li'l Lord Umber. Clearly something very bad has gone down here, but there are no bodies to be found (hint). They run into Dolorous Edd and a few men from Castle Black; together, they find the dismembered body of li'l Lord Umber, stuck to the wall and arranged in the spiral formation we've come to associate with White Walkers. Suddenly it screams, they scream, they light it on fire, and this whole piece of business is disturbing.
Back at Winterfell (which should really be the name of the episode) Bran is still waiting in the courtyard. Waiting, we learn, for the rider on horseback who arrives, and wearily removes his hood: a newly beardy Jaime Lannister looks around, and catches the eye of the boy he tossed from a tall tower, years ago.

The Mueller Report Is Coming Soon. Here's What You Need To Know : NPR,www.npr.org,Philip Ewing,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712720679/robert-muellers-russia-report-is-coming-soon-here-s-what-you-need-to-know,"Enlarge this image Special counsel Robert Mueller leaves following a meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on June 21, 2017.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 12:33 p.m. EST
The Justice Department says it plans to release special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Thursday morning. Here's what you need to know.
What is it?
Mueller was appointed in the spring of 2017 to investigate whether President Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian interference in the 2016 election .
The fact of the interference itself had been long established, and last month Attorney General William Barr told Congress that Mueller did not find that Trump's campaign was involved with it .
Barr also told Congress that Mueller didn't establish that Trump broke the law in trying to frustrate the investigation — but neither did Mueller's office ""exonerate"" the president.
National Security Mueller Report Doesn't Find Russian Collusion, But Can't 'Exonerate' On Obstruction Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded for themselves, based on the special counsel's findings, that Trump would not face obstruction-of-justice charges.
With that established, what's the point of the report?
What the document is expected to reveal are the factual findings and legal analysis that underpinned the conclusions already shared by Barr.
Politics READ: The Justice Department's Summary Of The Mueller Report Trump and Republicans have welcomed Barr's summary , which they say vindicates the president and gave them a surge of momentum into the burgeoning 2020 election season.
Democrats say they can't be sure Barr isn't providing political cover for Trump, pointing to skepticism he voiced about Mueller's inquiry before he was nominated to be attorney general. Trump's opponents say they can't be sure what to make of Mueller's findings until they see the findings firsthand.
National Security Barr: Mueller Report Out Within 1 Week; IG Report On Russia Inquiry This Summer How long is it?
Nearly 400 pages, ""exclusive of tables and appendices,"" Barr told Congress.
Will it be Mueller's complete report?
No. Barr told members of Congress that he has been working with the special counsel's office to redact four kinds of information.
First, grand jury material, which is secret under the law . Second, foreign intelligence that could compromise the sources and methods from which it originated, which American spies want to protect.
National Security All The Criminal Charges To Emerge From Robert Mueller's Investigation Third, Barr said he would redact information about ongoing cases or investigations — those taking place elsewhere in the Justice Department now that the special counsel's work is complete.
National Security Greg Craig, Onetime White House Counsel, Charged In Ukraine Case Charges unsealed last week against Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks, and Greg Craig , a former White House counsel, made clear that legal aftershocks will continue even though the big political quake in Washington apparently has passed.
And fourth, Barr told Congress, is ""information that implicates the privacy or reputational interests of peripheral third parties who were not charged."" The Justice Department should not reveal derogatory information about people whom it isn't accusing of breaking the law, he said.
Who is covered under that exception?
""People in private life,"" the attorney general told senators. ""Not public officeholders.""

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Could Barr try to protect political allies of the president?
Democrats say they're worried he might.
""It seems to me that's an exception you can just drive a truck through,"" Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii, told Barr last week.
National Security Citing 'Spying' On Trump, Barr Says He Is Looking Into Origins Of Russia Inquiry Trump's opponents accuse Barr of working not as an independent arbiter but as a servant of the president. Democrats were furious, for example, when Barr called the surveillance conducted of Trump's campaign in 2016 ""spying"" — after the Russian government had launched its disinformation war on the presidential campaign.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., complained that Barr was ""going off the rails"" and that she didn't trust him. She'll trust only what she reads from Mueller.
Didn't the government conduct ""spying""?
Yes and no. The dispute is over that term.
National Security Get Caught Up On The Russia Investigation: The 'Collusion' Question The FBI and Justice Department conducted surveillance of Trump's campaign in 2016 as they investigated the election interference. What Republicans have charged since is that some officials may have abused their powers and violated the rights of at least one American.
Law enforcement officials have denied that and defended their practices.
Barr and key Republicans in the Senate, including the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., say they want answers to questions about how and why decisions were made in 2016.
Barr told members of Congress that another report is coming out this summer, after the Mueller report, that could provide some answers about that question.
National Security The Mueller Report Is Getting A Lot Of Attention. Here's How We Got Here And Barr has launched his own informal review about the origins of the Russia investigation, meaning that this saga may continue to be not only about what Trump and his camp did but about what investigators and Justice Department officials did too.
Could Mueller's report answer some of these questions?
Maybe, although Barr's implication is that it doesn't.
Why, for example, didn't officials brief Trump's campaign in 2016 about the contacts they were discovering between people in his camp and Russians ? How did the FBI use confidential informants in trying to discover what Trump's campaign was doing?

Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Other questions the report might address:
What Trump knew
One topic it might explore is what Trump and his top lieutenants in 2016 knew and when.
National Security What Else Could Robert Mueller's Report Reveal About Trump And Russia? Barr said that Mueller didn't establish that Trump's campaign conspired with the Russians. But did Trump himself ever get word about the offers of help that were coming in from Russians or their agents, including those to his son Donald Trump Jr.?
If so, did Trump believe them and actively decide not to accept what was being offered — or did Trump just ignore them altogether?
How else did Russia interfere?
National Security The Russia Investigations: What You Need To Know About Russian 'Active Measures' Americans have learned a lot from Mueller's office about the methods by which Russia interfered in the election. The best-known schemes include agitation on social media aimed at amplifying disagreements among Americans and the cyberattacks that stole data that was then released to embarrass political targets.
National Security 6 States Hit Harder By Cyberattacks Than Previously Known, New Report Reveals Others schemes that haven't received as much attention have been established too.
Will Mueller's report uncover any other types of interference that haven't yet been made public?
The obstruction question
National Security What You Need To Know About The Russia Investigations: Alleged Obstruction Barr and Rosenstein said they've concluded that Trump won't face obstruction-of-justice charges. What did investigators uncover about what actions he took? How close was the call for the leaders of the Justice Department?
What does Mueller think?
Where did Mueller come down on all this? What recommendations did he make — if any — about charges for Trump? Did he defer that to the leaders of the Justice Department, or did he intend for conclusions about his findings and analysis to be reached by members of Congress?
Barr says to expect some insights about all this: The report ""sets forth the special counsel's findings, his analysis and the reasons for his conclusions,"" the attorney general wrote to Congress.
Barr's letters about the work of the special counsel investigation have taken the wind from the sails of Democrats who had been pushing for impeachment proceedings against Trump.
Politics Democrats Demand Full Mueller Report, Lay Out Argument For Continued Investigations Members of Congress could resume that battle, however, if Mueller's raw findings lead Trump's opponents to conclude he acted wrongly or abused his office, separate from Mueller's or Barr's reading of relevant criminal law.
All these questions, legal wrangling, redactions — will this report make sense?
Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, asked Barr that very question.
""Are we going to get the gist of this, or is it going to be, you know, [reading a section] on January 2015 and then you have to flip 15 pages to find the next text?"" Schatz asked.
Barr said the Justice Department would do better than that.
""You will get more than the gist.""

William Barr To Play Key Role in Mueller Report Aftermath : NPR,www.npr.org,Ron Elving,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712299463/mueller-report-release-will-likely-escalate-tensions-between-trump-and-congress,"Enlarge this image Attorney General William Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Attorney General William Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers.
Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The news world is ravenously awaiting the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference.
But Attorney General William Barr's two trips to the Capitol last week strongly suggest that the version of the report he releases will only whet the appetites of many in Congress and beyond for more information.
That means the tension between President Trump and Congress is likely to escalate into a constitutional confrontation involving the competing authorities of at least two branches of government.
As these storm clouds gather, Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers in this lawyerly version of Game of Thrones .
National Security Barr: Mueller Report Out Within 1 Week; IG Report On Russia Inquiry This Summer Barr clearly intends to be at the center of the storm. And perhaps he has meant to be so ever since he sent a 19-page critique of the Mueller investigation to the Justice Department nearly a year ago, calling its approach to obstruction-of-justice charges "" fatally misconceived .""
That memo was a precursor to the four-page letter that Barr sent to Congress last month after reviewing the Mueller report. In that letter, Barr looked at the Mueller report's inconclusive statement on obstruction and determined that there was no case for obstruction.
Mueller explicitly said his report was not exonerating the president on obstruction, but Barr decided it was. And last week, Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not want to discuss that element of the conflict at hand.
That prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to say Barr was acting more like an attorney for the president than as the attorney for the United States.
Not every observer will go that far, but Barr must have known he was opening himself up for exactly that kind of attack. In past crises of this kind, his predecessors as attorney general have often tried to either find a middle ground or distance themselves from the mortal combat between occupants of the White House and the Capitol.
Typically, they have had close ties to the president who appointed them, yet most have looked to position themselves on higher ground — or what at least appeared to be safer ground.
Take Barr's luckless immediate predecessor, Jeff Sessions. As a multiterm Republican senator from Alabama, Sessions was the first in his chamber to endorse Donald Trump for president. That got him a formal role in the Trump campaign and, after the election, the Cabinet job he had always wanted most — attorney general.
National Security Citing 'Spying' On Trump, Barr Says He Is Looking Into Origins Of Russia Inquiry But Sessions' time in his dream job was cut short. It turned out that he and his boss had failed to communicate on the matter of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the probe the FBI had already begun. To the president's surprise, Sessions felt he had to respect Justice Department rules and recuse himself from the Russia probe because he had been part of the Trump campaign.
This left his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, to appoint a special counsel to run the probe after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey .
That's how Mueller came on the scene, deepening and widening the investigation into the Russian efforts and many tangential issues as well. Unable to stop Mueller, Trump turned his rage on Sessions for his decision to recuse himself. The Alabamian endured months of public criticism, personal insults and Twitter rants, only to be unceremoniously forced out right after the 2018 midterm elections.
Sessions' predecessor was President Barack Obama's second attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who was in office when the Russia probe began and when the FBI was also looking into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.
In the more normal course of things, that FBI report would have gone to Lynch, who would have determined whether to prosecute. But Lynch turned the matter over to FBI Director Comey, at least in part to avoid the blowback from her own ties to the Clintons. (Former President Bill Clinton had briefly met with her privately on an airport tarmac in the spring of 2016.) Comey declined to recommend prosecution in that case, but he also leveled a broadside at Clinton for ""extremely careless"" handling of the matter. Later, just weeks before the election, he briefly indicated that his investigation might be reopened (he subsequently said no new evidence had been found to necessitate reopening the case).
Law Greg Craig, Ex-White House Counsel, Expects Charges In Ukraine Case, Lawyers Say President George W. Bush had problems with his attorney general picks too. The first, former Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, set off on a number of crusades of his own, then balked at his boss' efforts to use U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on potential terrorists inside the country. (He was bolstered in that reluctance by his deputy, who was Comey.)
In 2005, Bush named his second attorney general, longtime Texas crony Alberto Gonzales. But Gonzales ran into trouble carrying out what appeared to be White House orders to purge U.S. attorneys around the country who failed to find voter fraud cases to prosecute after being told it was a priority. Gonzales resigned in September 2007, after Democrats had taken over both chambers of Congress and launched a series of hearings.
As president, Bill Clinton had one attorney general, Janet Reno, for all eight of his years in office. But Reno was often remarkably independent, not least in appointing a special counsel in 1994 to investigate Clinton's real estate deals in Arkansas. Her first appointee found little to prosecute, but Congress reauthorized the probe and a panel of federal judges appointed a new special counsel named Ken Starr, who took the probe in new directions.
One of those directions turned up former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, who said she had a sexual affair with the president. Clinton's denials and testimony to a grand jury led to his impeachment by the House in 1998. While Reno had not appointed Starr or otherwise directly contributed to Clinton's impeachment, she could scarcely be seen as his fiercest defender.
The classic case of a president's fraught relationship with his attorneys general had to be Richard Nixon and the five men who served him in that capacity. The first was his old law partner, John Mitchell , who had the job for three years before resigning to run Nixon's re-election campaign.
That campaign turned out to include burglaries and other forms of ""dirty tricks"" that begot the upheaval known as the Watergate scandal. Mitchell would eventually serve 19 months in federal incarceration for his role in the original Watergate burglary and cover-up.
Nixon's second attorney general, Richard Kleindienst , inherited the burgeoning scandal and was considered a team player. But he also let the Watergate investigation go forward. He resigned in the spring of 1973 as the evidence began to point back at the president himself.
Nixon then appointed Boston Brahmin Elliot Richardson as attorney general in hopes of easing the pressure on Watergate. But Richardson brought in Archibald Cox as special prosecutor. Cox was a dogged investigator who would soon subpoena the tape recordings from Nixon's Oval Office. Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Cox, and Richardson resigned instead, as did his deputy, William Ruckelshaus (these events on one October weekend in 1973 were known as the Saturday Night Massacre).

Tiger Woods won his fifth Masters title on Sunday, marking an incredible comeback from injury and personal hardship that ended a nearly 11-year championship drought.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Sunday was the final round of the 2019 Masters golf tournament. But watching what happened, you could not help feeling like some sort of time traveler - right? - maybe going back 15 or so years when Tiger Woods ruled the game. Well, turns out he's the ruler again. Woods won the Masters yesterday for the fifth time. It's the first major championship in nearly 11 years, his first Masters victory in 14, and it completes really one of the most dramatic comebacks in sports history. And joining me now is NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Hi, Tom.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Hi, David.
GREENE: Let's start right at the end of Sunday right after Tiger won. I mean, he was about as emotional as we've ever seen him really, right?
GOLDMAN: Yeah. You know, he was screaming, raising his arms - and not just on the green where he sank the last putt but walking this gauntlet of adoring fans and even fellow players on his way to the scoring room. We've rarely seen this. He's often guarded with a shield up, but he was particularly emotional with his two young kids, who were waiting for him next to the final green. He said after the round, this was a chance for them to see their dad win a major and get a sense of what golf means to him and what he means to golf. Here he is.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TIGER WOODS: Prior to this comeback, they only knew that golf caused me a lot of pain. If I tried to swing a club, I'd be - end up on the ground. And I struggled for years, and that's basically all they remember.
GREENE: I mean, remind us about the path he's been on. There's been a lot of injury. There's been a lot of pain.
GOLDMAN: How long do we have, David? Yeah. Of course, the injuries, the surgeries, including four back surgeries - the last one a fusion operation, which really saved his career. And on his way back to health, there was the 2017 DUI arrest, which he blamed on mismanaging his pain medications. And then, of course, before that when news flashed that he had a car accident outside his home - and that, of course, was the first event in what became a tawdry sex scandal. It blew up his marriage, seriously damaged his carefully crafted public image. So, yes, after this long, long road, you can understand yesterday's reaction.
GREENE: Let's talk about the day of golf at Augusta yesterday. I mean, there were other players who had a shot to win this. It wasn't just him.
GOLDMAN: No. It was amazing. I mean, it just - yeah, it was. And the back and forth and, you know, six or seven players with a chance to win. It was the first major where he didn't lead or have a share of a lead going into the final round, so he had to come from behind. And he didn't exactly explode out of the gate. He struggled early before finding a rhythm. And then ultimately, he withstood all those players around him, surging up the leaderboard. And he told reporters that last year's British Open, where he led in the final round - that actually helped him yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WOODS: I just kept saying, I've been here and not that long ago. Just go ahead and just keep playing your game. Keep plodding along. And keep doing all the little things correctly, keep missing the ball in the correct spots. You know, be committed to it when, you know, the wind's puffing up and down. Be committed to the shot and the shot shape. And I was.
GREENE: Tom, we used to talk about Tiger Woods maybe breaking Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major wins. I mean, that conversation just went away for a long time.
GOLDMAN: Yeah.
GREENE: Is it back on the table?
WOODS: It is. As long as he stays healthy and the back stays healthy, I think it is. He reminded us yesterday he's been a contender late in the last three major tournaments. He's 43. He's still in fantastic shape. You know, with the science now behind training and diet, this could go on and maybe even soon. The next two majors - next month's PGA Championship, June's U.S. Open - are on courses where Woods already has won. He's got the muscle and mental memory, so look out.
GREENE: NPR's sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Thanks, Tom.
GOLDMAN: You're welcome.

After some stinging losses in local elections, Turkey's ruling party is trying to revive the economy. But that'll be difficult as long as President Erdogan doesn't want to share power.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
It's about the economy for Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His government is turning its focus to boosting the economy after faring poorly in recent local elections in Turkey's biggest cities. But fixing Turkey's economy could require Erdogan to do something he is not exactly known for, loosening control. Here's NPR's Peter Kenyon.
PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Steady economic growth has been one of the keys to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's continued political success. But these days, the picture is less rosy. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth - a sign of a possible recession - forced the government to downgrade its economic outlook and promise to tackle the economy as a top priority. But when Erdogan's treasury and finance minister, his son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, recently announced a series of economic reforms starting with the banking sector, the public reaction was lukewarm. Murat (ph), a 35-year-old Istanbul customs broker, says he's willing to speak if his last name isn't used. He thinks the government is overselling its ability to bring about economic improvement. He says the government needs revenue, and he's afraid he knows where they'll go looking for it.
MURAT: (Through interpreter) The first phase, as usual, would be to target the working class. The taxes will go even higher. We're really not expecting serious structural reforms.
KENYON: He says the government has been too reactive and short-term in its thinking. For instance, when people started complaining about rising food prices, the government set up tents where it sold produce at a loss, further damaging retailers. Instead, Murat says, they should be looking for more long-term solutions.
MURAT: (Through interpreter) It is unheard of, these prices. So they have to start with agriculture. We were a food export country. Now we've become an importer. So agriculture, and also the industrial and tourism sectors, they need attention.
KENYON: Candidates from Erdogan's ruling party suffered some stinging defeats in last month's municipal elections. But it's not clear how quickly the government can turn things around. Economist Atilla Yesilada says promises of economic reform may sound good, but Turkey already has a largely business-friendly system in place. He says reforms are unlikely to amount to much, as long as Erdogan and his government remain free to exert political pressure on Turkish institutions such as the judiciary and central bank.
ATILLA YESILADA: It is not that we need reform. We need a change in mentality. We need to understand that this is a country based on institutions and rules.
KENYON: That's a fundamental problem, says Yesilada. Real reforms, like making the independence of Turkey's central bank part of the constitution, would mean limiting Erdogan's power, something that doesn't seem to be on the agenda.
YESILADA: He needs to understand that for him and Turkey to have a bigger pie, he needs to share some of his powers. You can't really change Turkey's fate by pouring money over favored industries.
KENYON: Yesilada also thinks Erdogan is courting trouble by allowing tensions with Washington and NATO to increase, primarily by trying to buy Russian anti-aircraft missiles at the same time they're seeking American F-35 fighter jets. Losing the American warplanes is only one potential downside, he says. Turkey risks provoking a concerted campaign of international pressure that could trigger another currency crisis, at which point, he says, the country could find itself in economic trouble.

"After Death Threats, Pelosi Wants Rep. Omar's Security Stepped Up",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387987/after-death-threats-pelosi-wants-rep-omars-security-stepped-up,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Capitol Police will examine threats to Rep. Ilhan Omar's security, following a tweet from President Trump blasting her for comments she made about the Sept. 11 attacks.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Minnesota member of Congress Ilhan Omar says she's received more death threats that came after President Trump shared a video on his Twitter feed. This video included comments that Omar made during a speech on civil liberties, comments that were mixed in with graphic 9/11 footage of the World Trade Center.
NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis is following this story. She's in our studios. Sue, good morning.
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: What did Ilhan Omar actually say about 9/11? What were her actual words?
DAVIS: So the original context of this was a March 23 speech in which she was speaking to a Muslim civil rights group. And she was speaking in the broader context of Muslim bigotry in the country, particularly after 9/11.
INSKEEP: Anti-Muslim bigotry.
DAVIS: Anti-Muslim bigotry after 9/11. And she said that the group was founded in part because they had recognized that - and this is the phrase that is the center here, is - some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. The some people did something, of course, is in reference to the 9/11 attackers. And her critics, particularly on the right, have said that that's just a rather cavalier and disrespectful way to talk about what happened that day.
INSKEEP: I guess her defense is that she says she was trying to highlight that 9/11 was being used for this purpose to discriminate against people. But the criticism is that she was not speaking strongly enough about what a horrible attack it truly was.
DAVIS: Correct. And then this was elevated, of course, because the president takes this context of this and uses the platform of the presidency to tweet out in images that equate her with the 9/11 attacks. She has also been - separate from the president - the subject of other anti-Muslim bigotry attacks in which her image has been used against the Twin Towers.
INSKEEP: I guess we should be clear here. These are words being spoken about someone else's words being spoken. There's no actual policy here. There's no policy consequence. There's no discussion about the future of the country. But by choosing this topic, this remark from some days ago, the president is able to direct coverage at a particular person in a particular way. Why would Republicans want to do that - 'cause other Republicans have taken part - and why would Democrats respond as they have?
DAVIS: I think in her specific case, the reason why there's so much focus now is she's already been the subject of quite a bit of focus. She's a name and someone people recognize because she has prompted other earlier controversies this year for other comments she's made about the U.S.-Israel relationship. She has once apologized for making comments that were seen as anti-Semitic by many, including her Democratic colleagues.
So there is a pattern here that I think Republicans are trying to establish, as she is someone who holds views that is emblematic of the Democratic Party. Other progressive freshmen lawmakers, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have come to her defense and have said that they see a broader strategy here.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: We are getting to a level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color.
DAVIS: An incitement of violence. And their argument is that Republicans are raising up people like AOC, like Ilhan Omar, like Rashida Tlaib, who's another Muslim woman serving in Congress, and trying to use them to sort of fearmonger or play off of racial or religious bigotry to gin up the base.
INSKEEP: Is there some dilemma here for Democrats? Because as we've just heard, many are defending Ilhan Omar. But as you also noted, she is a person who's made remarks that she's had to apologize for, that she's been criticized for on other issues. Is it awkward at all for Democrats to come to her defense?
DAVIS: I think it is. But in this case, it was less difficult. There was a quicker and more robust defense of what she said. Because in the broader context of the point she was making, she was - they believe her. They agree with what she was saying, that anti-Muslim bigotry has been a problem in this country. I don't think any party likes when they are constantly having to defend or explain or apologize for the words of another member. I don't think that they like that pattern of being on the defensive about her. But in this instance, it was easier for them.
I will say all of the 2020 candidates, to varying degrees, have come out in her defense. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who initially kind of took a way to just weigh in in, has, of course, now called for the security review to protect not only the congresswoman but her family, as well as her congressional staff.
INSKEEP: Sue, thanks for the update.
DAVIS: You're welcome.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Susan Davis.

Supporters of Britain leaving the European Union say they are often vilified as racists or xenophobes. Some of them have formed a support group to share their opinions and provide a safe space.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Brexit voters are pretty mad these days. The United Kingdom was supposed to leave the European Union last month. Now the country might not leave until Halloween. And some Brexiteers say even though their side won the referendum nearly three years ago, they still feel stigmatized for their views. NPR's Frank Langfitt attended a Brexit support group in the English village of Horncastle.
WILL GROVER: What do we want?
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Brexit.
GROVER: When do we want it?
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Now.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Dozens of Brexiteers turned out one evening last week for a meeting of Leavers of Lincolnshire, a local chapter of ""leave"" voters here in the English midlands. They came to vent their anger at Britain's parliamentarians 140 miles to the south in London. Will Grover, a local councilor with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party, organized the event.
GROVER: Are you angry?
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Yes.
GROVER: Good. You should be. Your vote is being betrayed.
LANGFITT: Seventy percent of people in this part of Lincolnshire voted for Brexit, but British politicians can't agree on a deal to get out of the European Union. Grover says many members of Parliament refuse to honor the 2016 referendum and are trying to weasel out of Brexit.
GROVER: They have broken that contract. They do not respect you. Why should you respect them?
LANGFITT: Some people in Lincolnshire say they voted to leave to halt the influx of farm workers from Eastern Europe. Others say they want to take back control of lawmaking from Brussels. But Grover says Brexiteers are often derided as gullible xenophobes and hopes tonight's event provides a safe space.
GROVER: So you could come together and be proud to be a Brexiteer, to not be called an idiot, to not be called a racist, to not be told you didn't know what you were voting for. This is for you. This is for you to feel proud and unashamed of your views.
LANGFITT: Alfie Tomlinson, who's 19, took the stage and talked about the difficulties of being a vocal Brexiteer at the local university. Tomlinson runs a ""leave"" chapter at his school.
ALFIE TOMLINSON: A lecturer came up to us and said what we are doing is disgusting, racist and bigoted, and we should be ashamed. That, to me, just says everything - that you cannot have an alternative view, an alternative view which is the majority of this country.
LANGFITT: Peggy Reading, an associate lecturer at the university, blames Prime Minister Theresa May for the failure to deliver Brexit. And it's left her disillusioned with British democracy.
PEGGY READING: Nobody takes any notice of us. So why should we vote? That's very, very sad for this country.
LANGFITT: Do you feel like the vote's just being ignored?
READING: Yes. It's been shoved under the carpet. They know better than us. We're all thick, stupid. And that is not true.
LANGFITT: While working on campus, Reading says she keeps her Brexit views mostly to herself.
READING: I don't discuss it.
LANGFITT: And if you did, what would happen?
READING: I'd be ostracized.
LANGFITT: Reading found this evening's meeting relaxing and comforting.
READING: We sat down at the table. We didn't know anybody on that table. And we started to talk. And we all felt the same. That was absolutely great. Yeah, we can breathe.
LANGFITT: Brussels has given Britain until the end of October to agree on a way to leave the EU. When I asked Reading if she could remember a time when her country was this divided, she said, no, never, never ever. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Horncastle, England.

Bill Would Ban IRS From Creating Free Electronic Tax Filing System,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387973/bill-would-ban-irs-from-creating-free-electronic-tax-filing-system,"NPR's Rachel Martin talks to ProPublica reporter Justin Elliott about a bipartisan congressional measure which could ban the Internal Revenue Service from offering free online tax filing,
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
It's April 15, which means you have to file your taxes before midnight if you've not already done so. If you want to file online, you typically have to go through a private company like H&R Block or Intuit, the makers of TurboTax.
Why do you have to use them? Well, an agreement with the IRS and private tax prep companies prevents Americans from filing directly online with the IRS. And that rule could become permanent. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are trying to pass the so-called Taxpayer First Act, which would permanently bar the IRS from creating a free electronic tax filing system.
Rachel Martin talked with ProPublica reporter Justin Elliott about why this bill is needed.
JUSTIN ELLIOTT: One of the things this bill does is it codifies an existing agreement between the IRS and the private tax prep industry - so companies like the maker of TurboTax. And one of the things that agreement says is that the IRS will never create essentially its own version of TurboTax. So the IRS won't essentially compete with the industry. So what that means is that many Americans will have to continue paying, you know, $50 or $60 to use TurboTax or H&R Block instead of having essentially, like, a government option to file their taxes.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: So this has gotten bipartisan agreement, huh?
ELLIOTT: Yeah. I mean, it's a longstanding program, and it's also something that the industry has been lobbying for for a long time. And so H&R Block and Intuit had been pushing for this for years. And you know, they do offer a free option if you make below a certain income threshold. But very few people end up actually finding that, and a lot of people end up using the paid version.
So essentially, this bill would continue this deal between the IRS and the industry, under which the industry offers this free option but the IRS agrees to never create its own version of these, you know, tax prep services.
MARTIN: So essentially, that means Americans have fewer choices.
ELLIOTT: Yeah, exactly. And you know, one of the remarkable things that happened is after we wrote about this, people from other countries were sending tweets to me on Twitter saying that in Germany and Finland and other places, doing their taxes took, like, five minutes because the government actually provides their forms pre-filled out because the tax agency already has their salary data.
MARTIN: So is it safe to assume that there was just a lot of lobbying on the part of companies that get paid when consumers come in and say - these are too complicated for me to do. Can you do them?
ELLIOTT: Yeah. I mean, just H&R Block and Intuit - those are the two biggest - together, they spent over $6 million dollars lobbying on issues, including this one, last year - had been pushing for this to make it into law for many years now. And the current bill contains a lot of other provisions, including some that are supported by consumer advocates. And I think that's one of the reasons it's now getting bipartisan support and might make it into law.
MARTIN: But consumer advocates do support this?
ELLIOTT: Consumer advocates oppose this provision. But there's other totally unrelated provisions in the bill that, you know, speak to the IRS' debt collection practices, for example, that consumer advocates have supported. So, you know, that's one of the reasons, I'm told, that this bill is getting bipartisan support in Congress.
MARTIN: Justin Elliott with ProPublica, we appreciate it. Thanks, Justin.
ELLIOTT: Thanks a lot.
