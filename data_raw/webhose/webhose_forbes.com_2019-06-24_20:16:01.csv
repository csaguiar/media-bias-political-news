Why I Don't Like Being Labeled A Female Entrepreneur,www.forbes.com,Susan Guillory,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2019/05/26/female-entrepreneur-label/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin No, this post isn't about gender identity—it's about how arbitrary I find the labels ""female entrepreneur"" and ""woman entrepreneur.""
People like to create two categories for business owners: entrepreneurs and female entrepreneurs. I have never understood why the two have to be separated. Haven't we reached the point in our society where we've stopped delineating between the capabilities of each gender? (Watch the videos in the Always' #LikeAGirl campaign for tear-jerking examples.) Can't we just focus on the subject of entrepreneurship without breaking it down further? Calling women who run businesses ""female entrepreneurs"" insinuates there's a difference between genders that impacts a woman's ability to succeed. © AYAimages- Adobe Stock I need no home court advantage
While there's nothing inherently wrong with resources directed specifically at women who own businesses , I fail to see the point. Don't we all need help writing a business plan, networking with other business owners, and finding funding? Why is it specific to women? You don't see ""male entrepreneur"" resources.
I certainly don't speak for all womankind, but I don't want special treatment because I'm a woman. I want to succeed—and have, over the 13 years I've owned my marketing firm—based on merit and my ability to kick a$$ at what I do. Being a mother and business owner isn't notable
I absolutely detest the term ""mompreneur."" Recognizing a woman who both raises human beings and runs a business is like congratulating a man for walking and breathing at the same time. It's not commendable; it's life. And where are the men who are doing the same? ""Dadpreneur"" is much less of a popularized term because it just comes with the territory.
Mothers who work as employees aren't ""momployees."" So why do we point out the combination of the roles if they run a business?
Years ago, I knew a divorced woman who would complain every chance she got about how hard it was to be a single mom. It made me crazy that she wore that label like an albatross. Now that I find myself a single mom, I refuse to embrace the label as an excuse for things being hard sometimes—they're hard for everyone.
I rarely think to call myself a single mother. I'm just a mother (and business owner) who happens to not have a partner. That doesn't make my life tremendously difficult because I refuse to let it. I'm still 100% capable of doing what needs doing. It's the same for running a business.

"The Brain Can Give Birth To New Cells Throughout Life, Study Finds",www.forbes.com,Alice G. Walton,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2019/05/26/the-brain-can-give-birth-to-new-cells-throughout-life-study-finds/?ss=healthcare,"Researchers used to think that after adolescence, people were pretty well stuck with the brain cells they’d already formed. No so anymore. Discoveries in recent years have shown that neurogenesis—the formation of new neurons—can occur much later than this, well into adulthood. And now, a new study from the University of Illinois at Chicago finds that brain cells can form into one’s nineties, even if one has cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (though at a much decelerated rate). The question is how the late-in-life growth of new neurons fits into what’s already known about degenerative diseases. The study was published last week in the journal Cell Stem Cell.
The researchers looked at the postmortem brains of people aged 79-99, some of whom had had cognitive decline or Alzheimer’s disease. They targeted markers for two kinds of burgeoning cells—neuroblasts (stem cells that would one day give rise to neurons), and immature neurons—in the hippocampus, the brain area that's most affected in Alzheimer’s disease.
People who had died without cognitive problems had proliferation of both kinds of cells in their brains. People with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s also had evidence of the cells, but in much lower numbers.
Lazarov, neurogenesis study
Courtesy, Orly Lazarov, et al. ""We found that there was active neurogenesis in the hippocampus of older adults well into their 90s,"" said study author Orly Lazarov in a statement. ""The interesting thing is that we also saw some new neurons in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment.""
What was interesting was the finding that people who had scored higher on tests of cognition during their later lives had more neuroblasts in their hippocampi, compared to those who’d scored lower—and this was independent of the level of degeneration that was visible in the brain.
""In brains from people with no cognitive decline who scored well on tests of cognitive function, these people tended to have higher levels of new neural development at the time of their death, regardless of their level of pathology,"" Lazarov said. ""The mix of the effects of pathology and neurogenesis is complex and we don't understand exactly how the two interconnect, but there is clearly a lot of variation from individual to individual.""
The finding is intriguing since it’s long been known that a person’s level of brain ""gunk"" (the plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease) doesn’t always correlate with their cognitive and behavioral symptoms. So it’s possible that these new findings helps explain why this disconnect exists—perhaps the level of neurogenesis matters as much or more than the amount of plaques and tangles that develop. If that’s true, then the big question would be how to harness this for therapeutic purposes.
""The fact that we found that neural stem cells and new neurons are present in the hippocampus of older adults means that if we can find a way to enhance neurogenesis, through a small molecule, for example, we may be able to slow or prevent cognitive decline in older adults, especially when it starts, which is when interventions can be most effective,"" said Lazarov.
More research will obviously be needed to understand all of this, but preventing cognitive decline and dementia is probably the way to go, especially since medications to treat Alzheimer's after the fact have fallen flat in recent years. In the meantime, the study is encouraging on another level: Certain lifestyle habits—most notably exercise—have consistently been shown to boost neurogenesis. The findings suggest we’d do well to pick up exercise, and other brain-healthy habits, and engage in them for as much of our lives as we can, as regularly as we’re able."
ESPN's 'Qualified' Highlights Boundary-Breaking Race Car Driver Janet Guthrie,www.forbes.com,Anne Easton,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anneeaston/2019/05/26/espns-qualified-highlights-boundary-breaking-race-car-driver-janet-guthrie/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Hollywood & Entertainment I write about original content on all platforms Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin New York, N.Y.: Race car driver Janet Guthrie stands in front of a photo of herself and her racing car on January 11, 1977 at 343 E. 30th Street in Manhattan. (Photo by Stan Wolfson/Newsday via Getty Images) Newsday via Getty Images The goal is to go full throttle, to push and push and push, until you can push no more.
Those who take part in auto racing know this all too well. One driver in particularly understands the concept in a way that no other can.
As the first woman to drive in the both the Indianapolis 500 and the Daytona 500, Janet Guthrie knew she would not only have to prove her driving ability, but overcome stereotypes as well.
Over 40 years since Guthrie’s barrier-breaking accomplishments, her efforts are now the subject of an installment of ESPN’S 30 for 30 documentary series.
Entitled Qualified , the film follows Guthrie’s quest to not only participate in the biggest races of the year, but to be respected as a driver and equal the playing field in racing for women.
After graduating from the University of Michigan, Guthrie worked as an aerospace engineer. She began driving in 1963 and by 1972 was racing full-time. She qualified for and competed in the 1977 Indianapolis 500, finishing 29 th . She competed in two more Indy 500s, finishing ninth in the 1978 race.
Filmmaker Jenna Ricker developed and directed the documentary.
Ricker says that after a trip to the Indianapolis 500 she became curious about the first woman to drive in the race. It was then she first heard the name Janet Guthrie. She immediately picked up Guthrie’s autobiography, Janet Guthrie: A Life at Full Throttle , and just knew she had to get this story out to a new audience.
But, when she reached out to Guthrie about making the film, the reserved Guthrie was apprehensive about participating. “I can’t say I was tremendously enthusiastic at first,” admits Guthrie.
An interesting thought turned the tide for Guthrie. “Then, I got it into my head that this might help my book get back out there. The publisher went out of business so it’s been out of print for a while.”
To put Guthrie’s efforts in perspective, only nine women have ever driven in the 103 runnings of Indianapolis 500.
The film highlights Guthrie’s struggles to be taken seriously as a driver, both on the track and off.
After Guthrie failed to qualify for the 1976 Indy 500, some suggested it was because she was a female driver. But, working with Guthrie to prove those people wrong, three-time champion A.J. Foyt loaned Guthrie one of his back-up cars. Her lap time in that car would have qualified her to be in the race field. She ultimately qualified for the race the next year.
Away from the pits, Guthrie struggled to get corporate sponsorship. This lack of funding ultimately forced her into retirement.
Ricker says that she had no trouble structuring the film with a steady stream of rising and falling action, but also wanted to be sure to include more about Guthrie’s personal life. “I really wanted to show her family dynamic, her views about what was happening, and what the media was saying about her.”
To do this, Ricker was determined to include as much archival footage as she could. “I think a lot of people now don’t realize that Janet was really all over the news at that time – on the evening news, in the morning paper, everywhere. I thought to reintroduced her to a wider audience we really needed to see her in action as much as possible.”
Adding to this, Ricker discovered that Guthrie’s brother Stewart had super 8 films of Janet’s early racing days and of much of her career. This is footage is included in the documentary, as is Stewart talking about his sister’s efforts.
What might surprise viewers is that Guthrie doesn’t come off as a hard charging personality, but rather as a bit reserved given the challenges she faced. She says that this was because she was focused solely on driving. “My goal was just to get the most out of any car I had my hands on.”
She adds, “I knew that in actuality the fuss wasn’t really about me personally, it was more about what women were capable of and what they should or should not be doing. It was a great surprise to me that there was such a hullabaloo. When I didn’t make the field at [the 1976 Indianapolis 500] I was surprised to see that my photograph was not in the sports section, but on the front page of all of the big newspapers across the country.”
Her calm demeanor at the time was consistent with her personality, says Guthrie, but moments of frustration did bubble over in private, she admits. “There was one incident at Indy where I just kept walking calmly when people were around, but once I got inside, in private, I kicked a few tires.”
She reiterates that it for her, it was truly all about the racing. “The only essential thing for me was what happened on the track. After 13 years of racing, I knew that once I was behind the wheel and out on the track I could make all the rest of it go away.”
Watching the story of her life on film all these years later, Guthrie says she experienced a range of emotions. “The first time I looked at it, an hour after it was over my pulse was still over 100. Then I recently watched it again and I just really thought they did a good job telling the story.”
While Guthrie’s run was a breakthrough for women, sadly the needle hasn’t moved very much for women drivers. Ricker points to the critics who say that it doesn’t help that women aren’t winning. Her response is to this is, “Well, women don’t have the sponsorship to run races all year long and when you’re only running one race a year, the odds aren’t in your favor.”
Guthrie agrees, adding, “It will take someone who has the desire and access to a top team that will work with them year-round to win. There’s someone out there now, but she’s trying to do it once a year and that just isn’t enough time.”Thinking broader, Guthrie says, “I believe it will also help to have more women in executive positions at top companies. Those women may not see sponsoring a female team or driver as such an exotic thing to do.”
On a personal level, Guthrie is happy that her story will reach a broader audience with Qualified , but, as she mentioned, the author really hopes that the attention will spur interest in re-issuing her book. “I really want to see it in paperback and available [as an e-book]. Sports Illustrated called it, ‘an uplifting work that is one of the best books ever written about racing,’ and I’m really proud of that. It was not ghostwritten, I wrote it and it took me a long time. I think of it as my legacy.”
Ricker hopes the documentary makes a statement that viewers will take to heart. “I think one of the things that you see in the film is that we’re still having this conversation about what women can and can’t do. So, if this shifts people’s perspectives so that we don’t look at a female race car driver, or other things like this, as a novelty anymore, that would be great. Anything that chips away at stereotypes is a good thing.”
Janet Guthrie knew how to push then, and, obviously, she still does.

"After Working As An Actor For 35 Years, Patrick Page Gets His First Tony Nomination",www.forbes.com,Jeryl Brunner,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerylbrunner/2019/05/26/after-working-as-an-actor-for-35-years-patrick-page-gets-his-first-tony-nomination/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin When he was around six-years-old Patrick Page wrote a play called Dr Jekyll Meets Frankenstein . “I loved monsters,” shares Page. “It starred me and featured my brother in a wordless role.” His father, who taught theater at what is now Western Oregon University, contributed actual lights and scenic pieces from the college and made a poster with Gothic-style print. The brothers performed for all the kids in the neighborhood. Patrick Page plays King Hades in Hadestown, now playing at the Walter Kerr Theatre Nathan Johnson
As he began to transform from Dr. Jekyll into Frankenstein, Page remembers knocking over one of the big scenic trees which then hit one of the lights above. “I made quite a fuss,” he recalls. Even as a young child, Page was completely committed to his on-stage world. It was the ultimate refuge for him, especially since he was uncomfortable around people. “I have always been very introverted. There is something about being on stage that feels very safe, comforting and liberating,” says Page. “I can show parts of myself that I wasn't able to access at other times.
For Page it wasn't so much about hiding behind the character, but revealing aspects of himself through his characters that he otherwise could not reveal or access any other way. “When I shut my dressing room door and begin to prepare, something chemically changes inside of me,” he says. “I begin to feel a kind of comfort and ease with myself.”
That kind of transformation has served him well. Page has been an actor for over 35 years playing a variety of eclectic roles. On Broadway he has starred in Saint Joan, Casa Valentina, Spring Awakening, Cyrano de Bergerac, Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark, The Lion King and countless other musicals and plays. For years he was a fixture with both the Oregon Shakespeare and Utah Shakespeare festivals. He also had recurring roles on Elementary, Madam Secretary and Flesh and Bone . Page is known to step inside the skin of whoever he plays, making them so human.
Currently Page plays King Hades in the musical Hadestown . Intertwining the myths of Orpheus and Eurydice and King Hades and Persephone, the production has been nominated for 14 Tony awards including Best Musical. Anaïs Mitchell wrote Hadestown’s uplifting and soul-nourishing music, lyrics, and book, which was developed with director Rachel Chavkin.
Using folk music and New Orleans jazz, Hadestown tells an ancient story and yet it is so relevant to our culture right now. The piece is a standout in an already standout season. “It’s hugely entertaining, has fantastic music and is a heartbreaking and beautiful love story,” says Page who skillfully manages to be both tender and terrifying. The rest of the first rate cast includes Reeve Carney, André De Shields, Amber Gray, Eva Noblezada, Jewelle Blackman, Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer, Kay Trinidad, Afra Hines, Timothy Hughes, John Krause, Kimberly Marable, and Ahmad Simmons.
In the piece Hades is the ruler of the underworld. He is also married to his beloved Persephone. Yet, each year, for six months, Persephone leaves Hades to be “livin’ it up on top” as she sings. For Hades, that deeply impacts everything. “He is so frightened of losing Persephone. But she is not going anywhere. She just needs to be free and have her own life,” says Page. As Page observes, in order to deal with his terror and insecurity Hades builds a factory and walls. “He creates this underworld to compensate for his own insecurity about not being enough for her.”
Part of why Hadestown is so universal is because the piece delves into the pain of being human. It offers insight about trusting the struggle to believe in ourselves. Throughout the show there is a motif where Orpheus keeps asking “Who am I?” When talking about his relationship with Eurydice he says, “Who am I to think that I should get to hold you?” The Fates say to him “Who are you to think you can walk where nobody has ever walked before?” And Hades asks him. “Who the hell do you think you are? Who do you think you're talking to?” As Page explains, “None of us think we are worthy to be the change. But you have to be willing to say, ‘I am worthy to walk this path. And I trust that others will walk with me.'”
Jeryl Brunner: You make Hades, the ruler of the underworld, very relatable. What qualities does Hades have that you like?
Patrick Page: I like how broken and in love he is. Those two things are connected. Anaïs created this metaphor of a wall that surrounds him. To me it seems like he is walling himself in. He is walling himself from emotion. He is a kind of a physical wall. The trajectory is the play is that this wall has a crack in it. Eventually Orpheus will find his way through and open up Hades.
Brunner: How has playing Hades changed you?
Page: Virtually every great role you play enlarges you somehow. Hopefully this has made me more aware of my own insecurities, more willing to live with them and to act in spite of them. It's not that you are going to get rid of insecurity. But can you act as if you didn't have doubt? For me this has been an exercise in trust.
When we were putting the piece together many times I thought, the work is good. We're finished. That is the version. And yet Rachel and Anaïs still wanted to make changes. For example, when Persephone and Hades have reconciled, Amber and I do a dance. In our first production [at New York Theater Workshop] and when we did the production in Canada and London, I thought we had a beautiful version. It made the audience cry and deeply moved Amber and I. And in this version the song changed which entirely changed the dance. It used to be to a piece of music called “Lover’s Desire.” I didn't say much, but inwardly I thought this is a terrible mistake. Well, of course it's much better now. It's learning to be uncomfortable, to work through the discomfort, to be patient and to trust the other artists. For me, that has been a big part of this journey. (From left) Amber Gray (Persephone), Patrick Page (Hades) and Reeve Carney (Orpheus) in a scene from Hadestown Matthew Murphy
Brunner: You have been very open about your struggle with depression.
Page: About one in nine people have depression. Among artists and creative people, it's about 50%. For many years I lived with the misunderstanding that if I took medication, I would no longer be able to act. It’s a very common misunderstanding and hard to get rid of because many people who have depression don't want to talk about it. So I decided to start talking about it.
I had lived with depression and went without medication until I was 40 years old. Once I found the right medications, I have not had another episode of depression for the last ten years. Incidentally, I don't think it should be called depression. Depression sounds like a mood disorder, which is not this particular illness. People think something is wrong with them and they should be able to handle it. People will say, “I’m depressed. I had a bad audition.” No. You're rightly disappointed or sad. Depression is an illness. If it was called serotonis, people would feel more comfortable medicating it.
If I had not found the right doctors and medication, I wouldn't be alive now. I used to have recurring depressions every year. I had a breakdown during rehearsal when I was in a production of Hamlet playing Claudius which was very public. I couldn’t speak or function and had to be taken to the doctor. I wasn't able to do that every year anymore. That is the case with a lot of people. Patrick Page and Amber Gray Matthew Murphy
Brunner: What would you like people to know about depression?
Page: I try to tell people, particularly artists, that help is available with talk therapy and medication. And certainly medications should not be undertaken without talk therapy. It's still an imperfect science. You may not get the right prescription immediately. In my case, it took over a year to find the right combination of medications. One of the myths I also try to dispel is that depression is conditional based on circumstances in your life. My depressions almost always coincided with the greatest successes in my life. They were not triggered by any kind of downturn. Nor were they alleviated by any kind of upturn. For the first time in history you don’t have to die from this illness. It has taken many, but it does not have to take you. Patrick Page and Reeve Carney Matthew Murphy
Brunner: In addition to being in Hadestown , you also teach acting. What does teaching give you?
Page: Without question, teaching makes me a better actor. I teach twice a week and on those days I am always better in the show. I hold myself to the standard that I hold my students. Every actor has tricks. And tricks are a way of putting something over on the audience, fooling them. In class, I can spot an actor's tricks, the places where they haven't done the work and tried to cover their tracks. Sometimes I think maybe my own tricks are undetectable. They are as obvious as anyone else's.
I also get a lot of joy out of watching my students make a breakthrough and open up a new part of themselves. Everything that it takes to be a good actor precisely coincides with what it takes to live a meaningful and happy life. There’s the ability to be present, listen, make real contact with another, focus, not let the mind wander, accept one's self with all of the imperfections and allow those imperfections to be visible to others. I love watching students open up to all that.

5 Major Stars WWE Is Giving Up On,www.forbes.com,Blake Oestriecher,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2019/05/26/5-major-stars-wwe-is-giving-up-on/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. SportsMoney I examine the effect that sports have on business...and vice versa. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin WWE has made it clear that it has no plans to push these stars to their talent level. Credit: WWE.com WWE can't push everyone at once, and some stars are finding that out the hard way.
With WWE's TV ratings plummeting over the course of the past year , the company is bringing back a trio of stars in The Undertaker, Goldberg and Brock Lesnar, who will only prove to make it even more difficult for anyone who isn't solidified as a top act to get anything remotely resembling a decent push. WWE knows that something must be done to turn around its recently historic low viewership for both Raw and SmackDown , which unfortunately doesn't bode well for many of the company's full-time stars or overlooked midcarders.
Because WWE boasts arguably the most talented and deepest roster in its storied history, it's quite simply inevitable that many of the company's most beloved and talented stars will fall through the cracks, whether by default or by design. In fact, that is already happening to some stars who have previously been utilized as main eventers or key pieces in major storylines.
Here are five major stars WWE is clearly giving up on.
Harper Credit: WWE.com Credit: WWE.com
If it wasn't obvious that WWE was waving the white flag on Harper a while ago, it certainly is now.
Earlier this year, the former Wyatt Family member asked for his release from WWE after spending much of the past year being unused, and WWE apparently will not grant it, instead using an injury provision to add roughly six months to hiss contract (which was originally set to expire in November) and prevent him from leaving the company for close to a year. The downfall of Harper can largely be attributed to Vince McMahon, who apparently isn't at all a fan of Harper and recently soured on him even more when he saw Harper work a dark match that he felt was a colossal failure.
Just two years ago, Harper was involved in a WWE title feud in route to WrestleMania 33 (and he really should have been included in the Mania bout between Bray Wyatt and Randy Orton), and he was once part of a wildly popular stable that was selling more merchandise than names like Hulk Hogan and The Shield. At least on the surface, Harper seemingly has all the tools to be a main event caliber performer, but the one thing he doesn't have is what he needs the most: The support of McMahon.
With WWE's head honcho reportedly not ""getting"" Harper, the former Intercontinental Champion may very well spend the next year sitting on the sidelines, unused and unable to get out of his contract.
Shinsuke Nakamura Credit: WWE.com Credit: WWE.com
Shinsuke Nakamura's WWE contract expires at some point this year, and with his former home of New Japan Pro-Wrestling reportedly interested in bringing him back , one would think that WWE officials would be intent on pushing ""The Artist,"" who ranks among the most talented and charismatic stars in the company.
Instead, WWE has completely cooled off on the push of Nakamura, who at this time a year ago was in the midst of a lengthy WWE Championship feud with AJ Styles. Although the latest word is that Nakamura will probably remain with WWE , there has been little to no indication that WWE has any intention of utilizing him in a featured role moving forward. Instead of being portrayed as the babyface singles star he should be, Nakamura is a seldom seen heel tag team wrestler with absolutely zero momentum, stuck in a SmackDown tag team division that is in shambles and buried behind a slew of heels on the blue brand.
When Nakamura debuted on WWE's main roster in April 2017 to much fanfare, it was difficult to envision his downfall playing out the way it did, and while he could certainly be in a worse spot on the main roster, he could be in a much better one, too. Nowadays, you don't even hear much about Nakamura as fans seemed to have accepted the fact that WWE doesn't view him as a consistent main eventer, which represents a stark contrast from a year ago when he appeared to be on the verge of becoming the first Japanese WWE Champion in company history.
EC3 Credit: WWE.com Credit: WWE.com
From 2013 to 2018, EC3 was one of the biggest stars in Impact Wrestling, so when he re-signed with WWE in early 2018, there was optimism about his chances of following in the footsteps of AJ Styles and Samoa Joe to become the next former Impact star to make a splash in WWE.
While EC3 had a decent run in NXT, the thought was that he'd be a big hit on the main roster due to his elite level mic skills and his chiseled physique. Boy, was that wrong.
WWE began promoting EC3's main roster debut late last year along with a slew of other NXT call-ups, and when he finally showed up on TV, you could instantly tell that WWE had absolutely no idea what to do with him. Aside from a random win over Dean Ambrose that was instantly forgotten about, WWE never even gave EC3 a chance, instead taking away his biggest strength, his promo ability, and relegating him mostly to forgettable backstage segments.
Fans would soon find out why, as, much like Harper, reports emerged that McMahon was not a fan of EC3 and had no plans to push him. There was recently a glimmer of hope for EC3 when he was repaired with Drave Maverick for a dark match, but that went nowhere, just like EC3's main roster run.
Asuka Credit: WWE.com Credit: WWE.com
After initially being booked as the most dominant woman in WWE history with an NXT/main roster winning streak that lasted more than 900 days, Asuka's career has been in a downward spiral ever since she lost to Charlotte Flair at WrestleMania 34 in April 2018.
With Asuka's winning streak over and done with, WWE suddenly forgot how to book her and instantly stopped push her following the shocking loss to Flair. She spent much of 2018 doing next to nothing on SmackDown, and speculative reports indicated that she wasn't being pushed because she is unable to speak English fluently . Regardless if that's the reason why, WWE is clearly missing the boat on Asuka, one of the best pure in-ring performers in all of WWE and a star who, despite all the bad booking, continues to generate some of the best crowd reactions in the entire company.
It looked like Asuka was getting back on track in late 2018 and early 2019 when she surprisingly won the SmackDown Women's Championship at WWE TLC 2018 (reportedly because McMahon was shocked how over she was ) and then tapped out Becky Lynch at Royal Rumble 2019. But just as quickly as WWE reignited Asuka's push, it immediately pulled the rug out from underneath her, having her drop the SmackDown women's title immediately before WrestleMania 35 and then being relegated to the women's battle royal, a match she was eliminated from in completely forgettable fashion.
For now, Asuka isn't in a terrible spot as a top contender for the women's tag team titles, but WWE clearly doesn't view her as a star on the same level as the likes of Flair and Lynch, even though you could argue she is.
Braun Strowman Credit: WWE.com Credit: WWE.com
It's time to accept the reality that WWE doesn't view Braun Strowman as highly as its fans do.
Due at least in part to reports that Strowman is his ""own worst enemy"" and earned himself some backstage heat last year due to a lack of locker room etiquette, WWE has completely pulled back on a push for a man who once appeared to be the company's next big thing. That was never more evident than it was during all of his failed quests (and there were many) to beat Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship, but now a new report indicates that WWE sees Strowman as nothing more than a ""walking mascot"" for the company as opposed to a consistent main eventer.
Throw in recent reports that WWE has once again soured on Strowman after he botched multiple spots at WrestleMania 35, and the writing is clearly on the wall. Although Strowman continues to generate some of the loudest crowd reactions in WWE and is obviously one of its biggest fan favorites, reports indicate that he can't get out of his own way, which is precisely why every time he appeared to be close to winning a world title or being solidified as a main eventer, it didn't happen.
Given that Strowman has never had a substantial WrestleMania match or won even a midcard title, maybe fans should have realized sooner that Strowman is going to be used more like Big Show as a special attraction as opposed to being used like Roman Reigns in the main event.

Most recently he was working for Edelman, one of the largest privately owned public relations agencies in the world, with 6,000 employees in 60 offices, when he decided to leave and start his own consulting practice in Brooklyn.
James Reeves, founder of Diefendorff watch company.
Courtesy Diefendorff That’s when he decided to make high-end watches for a living instead.
“I felt like I had something more to share with the world,” Reeves explains.
Why watches? And why in particular, automatic watches, which use the power of motion while strapped to your wrist to keep a precise mechanism of gears and spindles moving to tell time?
“There’s something magical about tiny parts you can barely see with the naked eye that work so well together,” Reeves said. “There’s magic in that and I wanted to show that off. It’s one of the reasons people love watches and one of the reasons they’re different than the clock on your cell phone.”
The Swiss have been making the best watches in the world for generations, building up centuries of “entrenched practice and apprenticeship,” Reeves said.
“That’s one of the reasons I deliberately chose to have our watches powered by a Swiss-made movement. I wanted to leave no doubt this is a quality watch that stands the test of time,” he said.
Diefendorff watches utilize a Swiss automatic movement.
Courtesy Diefendorff Reeves has a manufacturing partner in Ohio that procures the Swiss movements for him and helped him with design.
“When we looked at the back of the movement I felt like it needed something else to push it over the edge in terms of design,” Reeves said. “That’s where we created the custom rotor label. That’s the red you see. I could have closed the back of the watch off, but the movement itself is so beautiful I wanted to show it off.”
Reeves, 41, is certainly not the first one to have the idea of exposing a Swiss movement. Any number of Swiss watchmakers do the same, from Tissot to Oris. He needed something to set his three-year-old startup watch company apart. He thinks he found it in his sixth great grandfather, Henry Diefendorff, who fought in the American Revolution, and now lends his last name to Reeves’ watch.
During his research, Reeves learned that Diefendorff had died 200 years to the day from Reeves’ birthday. Reeves was born Aug. 6, 1977. Diefendorff died in combat on Aug. 6, 1777.
“When I came across his record I had to rub my eyes,” Reeves says.
The Diefendorff watch has a patented case design featuring 17 big lines and 76 small lines to honor the American Revolution.
Courtesy Diefendorff Reeves’ own family was unaware of its illustrious ancestor, whose parents had come to Philadelphia from Switzerland in 1735. There it was. The Swiss connection.
“A lot of symbolism goes into the watch,” Reeves said. “One was to have a Swiss-made movement to reflect his heritage. Because he fought for the American cause, I wanted to prioritize American suppliers.”
Although the movements are Swiss, Reeves found an American supplier for the leather bands on Diefendorff watches.
Reeves began selling his watches last October. He’s selling direct to consumer on his website. And it’s not just to friends and family.
“It’s an amazing experience when you get that first order in from somebody you don’t know,” Reeves said. “To me that was the ultimate passing grade on the ultimate test, to see that order come in and not recognize the name.”
Reeves, who has yet to hire any employees, said he’s seeing 20 to 30 percent growth in website traffic every month and more and more attention on social media.
Diefendorff makes watches for men and women although the focus is on men's watches.
Courtesy Diefendorff “The response right now is very good,” he said. “We’re getting a lot of traction.”
Reeves patented his case design, which features 17 big lines and 76 small lines to honor the American Revolution his 6 th great grandfather fought in. Reeves said Henry Diefendorff died in the Battle of Orisky in upstate New York, one of the bloodiest battles of the Revolution.
“There’s a lot of details about his death, I haven’t found out a ton about his life,” Reeves said. “He was shot in the lungs. He collapsed to the ground and asked for water, took one last sip and died. It sounds like it’s out of a movie.”
Reeves hopes to bring Diefendorff’s story and sacrifice into the modern day with his namesake watch.
“It was forgotton in my family,” Reeves said. “So many benefitted from his sacrifice. I wanted to recognize that.”"
Trump’s Handouts Won’t Be Enough To Save American Soybean Farmers As Prices Hit New Lows,www.forbes.com,Chuck Jones,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/05/26/trumps-handouts-wont-be-enough-to-save-american-soybean-farmers-as-prices-hit-new-lows/,"The price of soybeans has plummeted over the past year since Trump started putting tariffs on Chinese products and China retaliated. The USDA estimates that the average price per bushel fell from $9.33 in 2017 to $8.60 last year. At 4.54 billion bushels that was a $3.3 billion impact to soybean farmers. However, the shortfall should be worse this year since last year farmers were able to forward sell a portion of their crops at $10 per bushel . ADVERTISEMENT As the chart shows below shows with a per bushel price in the low $8 area, unless prices turn up soon 2019 will be a disastrous year for soybean farmers. For a business that runs on low margins losing over 20% of revenue with high fixed costs is a recipe for bankruptcies.
Soybean price chart: 3 years
StockCharts There are multiple other factors that are effecting soybean farmers including heavy rains and floods keeping them from planting on a timely basis (helps per bushel price but could hurt total income) or a swine flu outbreak in China, which has led to the killing of millions of pigs that would consume soybeans (hurts soybean prices). However, the main contributor seems to be the dramatically decreased demand from China.
Megan Nelson from the Farm Bureau estimates that the soybean crop is only 9% planted as of mid-May , down 20 percentage points from the five-year average of 29% and 23 percentage points lower than last year. When this news broke about two weeks it helped drive soybean prices under $8 per bushel, but for only one day.
Soybean plantings
NASS, Farm Bureau Soybeans are America’s second largest cash crop
U.S. soybean farmers grew over 4 billion bushels the past three years with 2018 the largest production at 4.54 billion. To provide some perspective on how important soybeans are to U.S. farmers it is the second largest cash crop in the country and accounted for 27% of total crop value grown in the U.S. per the USDA. The four largest crops in 2018 out of $143.6 billion were:
ADVERTISEMENT Corn $51.5 billion
Soybeans $39.1 billion
Hay $17.0 billion
Wheat $9.7 billion
Farmers are able to rotate and change how many acres of soybeans they plant. However, there is an overall constraint that besides corn, there aren’t enough large markets of other crops to make up a large monetary shortfall. And even if they did it could depress the pricing for the alternative crop.
Soybean production
USDA ADVERTISEMENT Subsidies help farmers but tariffs hurt U.S. consumers and corporations
President Trump mistakenly insists that the tariffs on Chinese goods are being paid for the Chinese. While a portion, and probably a small portion, is “paid” by Chinese companies if they lower prices to U.S. buyers to help mitigate the impact from tariffs, they are actually paid by the companies that are importing the goods. The companies then have lower margins or pass along some or all of the tariff costs via higher prices to their buyers, many of which are consumers. Overall this is a tax on the U.S. economy.
Just last week there was a $16 billion relief package for farmers passed and signed by Trump. However, this may not make up for all the lost revenue and costs created by the tariffs. It is also a stopgap measure. It does not help the long-term issues of lower prices, which peaked at $17 per bushel in 2013, or the unintended consequence of the Chinese increasing their soybean production.
Soybean price chart: 20 years
StockCharts Chinese market may never return
Probably the biggest long-term issue that Trump may have created by using tariffs to negotiate is that it has gotten the Chinese government to focus on how dependent the country has become on U.S. farm products. Even when a trade deal is reached the market for U.S. soybeans will never be the same.
ADVERTISEMENT Hu Xijin is the Editor-in-chief of Chinese and English editions of the Global Times. He is a proficient tweeter with many of them responding to Trump and his policies. If you want to get a perspective (and posturing) of the Chinese government, he is someone you should follow.
Hu published this tweet on May 15 that talks about a Chinese farmer who planted all of his 100 hectares or 247 acres with soybeans. One Chinese farmer won’t impact overall trade but this is the type of shift, which will probably be incentivized by the government that could have serious long-term implications for U.S. farmers.

What's Next For Addressable TV,www.forbes.com,Paul Talbot,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultalbot/2019/05/26/whats-next-for-addressable-tv/,"The measurement, planning and targeting chops of digital marketing are spilling over the banks into the territory of traditional TV advertising. With limitations, the altered landscape is sprouting new capabilities for TV marketers. I asked Nicolle Pangis, CEO of NCC Media, a TV advertising sales, marketing and technology company owned by Comcast, Charter, and Cox, to share her perspectives on changes underway as addressable TV evolves.
Paul Talbot: When media strategists evaluate the opportunities of addressable TV, what do you want to make sure they grasp as the core value proposition?
Nicolle Pangis: You get the high-quality content and brand safety of TV but with the ability to show different ads to different households during the same programming to create a more relevant experience between brands and consumers.
It’s important for media strategists to understand addressable TV as a complement to traditional TV advertising rather than a replacement.
Talbot: What measurable benefits do media strategists get from coordinating digital campaigns with addressable TV campaigns?
Pangis: The first thing to consider is that under the typical model, TV and digital campaigns are planned, bought and measured separately by different teams using different sets of data.
There hasn’t been a particularly effective way to understand the full consumer media journey. Marketers see what’s happening on the TV side in one silo and the digital side in another.
What we’ve recently done in adding digital buying capability to our TV platform is to introduce a way for marketers to connect the dots between these two channels.
Talbot: What impact do you expect this coordination to create? How will media strategy shift? Does this upend traditional reach and frequency models? What might happen?
Pangis: Brands and their agencies are under enormous pressure to execute as efficiently as possible. Enabling them to plan, buy and measure both TV and digital within a single environment not only takes some of the pressure off, but it allows them to drive better results.
Instead of doing everything twice (once for TV, once for digital), you’ll have planning teams who are able to handle everything in a holistic and coordinated manner.
By understanding the relationships between TV and digital we can get better results from fewer ads. For example, knowing which audiences have been responsive to a brand’s online ads would then allow them to target their addressable TV ads more intelligently – focusing on the people who have shown interest in the online sphere rather than anyone who fits a particular segment.
Talbot: In what ways does live sports content fit in to the linear TV landscape that might not be understood?
Pangis: With all the buzz around addressable and other forms of advanced TV you could be forgiven for thinking that live linear no longer matters. In reality, the scale and impact you get with live TV is something that really can’t be replicated.
Live sports in particular is an incredibly effective example of this. You have a hyper-engaged audience of active viewers who are willing to stop what they’re doing in order to see the game live. And you know you’ll reach a lot of people.
Talbot: Any other insights you’d like to share?
Pangis: Having worked for nearly two decades on the digital side of the ad world, I have a strong opinion on what we got right and what we didn’t. I think it’s really important that as we introduce more digital technologies to the TV world, we don’t recreate the mistakes of digital, but now in TV.
Think of the shoe ad that follows you around for three weeks, even after you’ve bought them."
"Roger Federer Wins In French Open Return: 'It's a Big Deal for Paris & It's A Big Deal For Me, Too'",www.forbes.com,Adam Zagoria,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2019/05/26/roger-federer-wins-in-french-open-return-its-a-big-deal-for-paris-its-a-big-deal-for-me-too/,"In his return to Roland Garros after a three-year hiatus, Roger Federer felt the support of the fans before he even took the court on Sunday. As he made his way to Court Philippe-Chatrier for his first-round match against Italy's Lorenzo Sonego, Federer could hear the groundswell of support.
""Every seat was taken in the house as I walked out,"" Federer, the No. 3 seed, said on Tennis Channel after dispatching Sonego, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 in 1 hour, 41 minutes to set up a second-round match with Germany's Oscar Otte on Wednesday.
""The crowds were really full and they were already chanting the name. There was definitely a bit of a buzz here. Twenty years since my first time and 10 years since my first and only win here, and having missed four editions, it's a big deal for Paris, and for me, too. Of course, it's great.""
Federer was slated to play the French in 2016, but withdrew with an injury. He then skipped 2017 and '18 to prepare for the grass and hardcourt seasons and conserve his body.
Ahead of his first French Open since 2015, Federer played two warm-up events on clay. He reached the quarterfinals in Madrid , losing to Dominic Thiem and then withdrew before a quarterfinal with Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Italian Open.
""I woke up stiff with some back stuff, some leg stuff and I just didn't want to take a chance,"" Federer said.
""I was like, I could play one match, but I really don't want to have a major setback and I want to be 100 percent. And I knew if I pulled the plug in Rome which I really never do, I just thought OK, we'll do that this one time hopefully in my career, take a precautionary move, and that's why I'm 100 percent now. I'm totally fine.
""But I was a bit worried if I played a brutal match against Tsitsipas that I would just lose days, weeks, it would all drag into one another. And I know when you get older, problems stay around for much longer, so I had to be very careful. It was a tough decision for me.""
In his return to Paris, he handled Sonego by carving him up from the baseline while mixing in the occasional serve-and-volley point. Federer fired 30 winners and 13 unforced errors.
""I think it was good,"" Federer said. ""I had a good start. Going up double-break is wonderful. The same thing in the second set. It just sets the tone. I thought Sonego started playing a little better as the match went on, his nerves went away a little bit.
""I felt great. I'm serving well, moving well, especially against a guy I never played against. I think it was a really good first match.""
As Christopher Clarey pointed out in Sunday's New York Times , Federer played his first French Open in 1999. He is the only man from that draw still playing singles at this year's event. He lost in the first round that year to two-time US Open champion Patrick Rafter.
""It makes me happy,"" he said. ""I know I got a bit a lucky to get a wild card [in 1999]. It was a big deal for a Swiss guy to get a wild card for the French Open....That was a big deal. The bigger deal was to play Pat Rafter on Suzanne Lenglen because Pat was one of the great guys on the tour.
""For me looking back now being the only male player still in the draw today, it makes me really happy...It's fun to be maybe the bridge between maybe that really old generation and the young guys today.""
Federer has won a men's record 20 career majors but his only title in Paris came in 2009.
He is the fifth favorite in Paris behind 11-time champion Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Dominic Thiem and Tsitsipas, who won on Chatrier before Federer.
Federer and No. 2 seed and longtime rival Nadal are in the bottom half of the draw and could meet in the semifinals.
But first things first. He has to win his second match back on Wednesday."

An Interview With The CEO Of Beyond Meat,www.forbes.com,Gregory Ferenstein,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregoryferenstein/2019/05/26/an-interview-with-the-ceo-of-beyond-meat/,"In a season of a roller coaster technology IPOs, one of the standout success stories has been pioneering alternative meat startup, Beyond Meat. CEO Ethan Brown has been (relatively) quiet with the media, but he recently did a presentation at the Near Future conference in San Diego, where I caught up with him to talk about what he considers the reason for his IPO’s success and also the post-game analysis of what this new growth means for the vegan meat movement. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
On hyper focusing product
Brown says that while people ask him to think about a variety of goals or products, his company is relentlessly focused on a single goal:
We're so focused on one thing, we've been focusing on for 10 years, which is to get that perfect build of meat from plants...We're trying to underprice animal protein in at least one category of one product and you can do it on price, on nutrition, and taste.""
On the benefits of doing world-class basic research with universities for solving social problems through the private sector
Brown emphatically endorsed the benefits of government investment in research universities, which he believes allowed a start up like his to do best-in-class innovation without a big research division. In the early 2010's, Brown got rejected from Whole Foods and admits it's because the product wasn't good enough. So, his strategy was to work with expert scientists and academics to get the quality up to par:
[After getting rejected from Whole Foods] we went back to the lab for four years and worked our asses off, [we] brought in scientists from every angle we could think of--biochemists, protein chemists--to understand meat better than anybody else...we took a model from clean energy, which was get the best scientists, best engineers, fund them well, get them together, give him a clear goal and go for it. And, I knew that was not being done in the food industry.""
On those who took chances:
Brown gives credits a few investors from Kleiner Perkins and Obvious Ventures who were willing to take a chance on what he considers a ""weird"" business:
One of the reasons I'm so indebted to guys like Ray [Lane] and Biz [Stone] and Ev [Williams] and James [Joaquin] is like, this wasn't an easy investment in the beginning. It was weird. It was sort of a strange thing. “You're going to build meat right from plants?” No, you have to explain that you're actually going to try to rebuild meat.”
On how for-profit meat alternatives can make the world better
Brown believes the IPO shows that it proves it is possible for one product to solve many social issues:
[The IPO’s success] shows that you can pursue a social end through business in a way that that can create huge value...you can solve for human health epidemics, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, you can solve for climate, you can solve for natural resource use and conservation with land, water, energy, and you can solve for animal welfare all by just focusing on one thing. And that's a protein at the center of the plate.”"
Would The Rockets Look To Trade Chris Paul? Part 1,www.forbes.com,Rahat Huq,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahathuq/2019/05/26/would-the-rockets-look-to-trade-chris-paul-part-1/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. SportsMoney I write generally about the Houston Rockets and their finances Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul sits on the court following a play during the second half in Game 6 of the team's second-round NBA basketball playoff series against the Golden State Warriors, Friday, May 10, 2019, in Houston. Golden State won 118-113, winning the series. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) ASSOCIATED PRESS The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported recently that Houston Rockets star guards James Harden and Chris Paul were involved in a verbal altercation following Game 6 of their series against the Golden State Warriors. This report of course has caused widespread speculation regarding the team’s future, particularly in light of the turnover amongst the team’s coaching staff last week.
But the fact that Paul and Harden had a disagreement in a moment as tense as the one which saw their season end is not the least bit surprising. And further, in and of itself, it isn’t sufficient reason for the team to trade Paul, as some have suggested.
The greater concern, however, is that The Point God isn’t just slipping - he’s almost certainly left the remainder of his prime in the rear view mirror. Despite looking spry after his return from injury this season, Paul came up small in what I considered the two biggest spots of the season: the March showdown at Milwaukee and in the semifinals against Golden State.
In a March 26 blowout loss vs. the Bucks, Paul shot 7-18 from the floor for 19 points and 4 assists. After the Bucks corralled Harden with an unorthodox defensive scheme, taking away his left hand, it was up to the rest of the Rockets to capitalize on the opportunities, mainly Paul who was brought in for such a role. He was not able to.
In the first five games of the semifinals against Golden State, before his 27-point explosion in Game 6, Paul averaged 14.6 points and 5.6 assists on 39% from the field, and 28% on 3's. In the pivotal Game 5, Paul turned in maybe the worst playoff performance of his career, scoring 11 points on 3/14 from the field, with three turnovers.
What was most striking was not the poor shooting but rather the total inability to get separation off the dribble against even the Warriors' big men. Several times, after being beat to his spot by his defender, Paul would get called for an offensive foul upon pushing off. For the Rockets' offense to work at its highest level, it needs Paul to be able to punish big men on switches in the pick and roll the way Harden routinely does and the way Paul routinely did just twelve months ago.
But it is not true to say Paul is finished as an impact player, as many have asserted. In the 582 minutes the Rockets played during the regular season with Paul on the court and Harden off, Houston had a +12.34 net rating. (With Harden on and Paul off, in 792 minutes, that was a +6.29. With both on, in 1130 minutes, it was a +6.05. And with neither on, it was a -17.06.)
This is all to say that Paul can still be extremely effective. He is still elite or near elite in making decisions out of the pick and roll and running the fast break. He can still age gracefully the way John Stockton and Steve Nash did, the two closest comparisons to Paul in modern history in both body type and playing style. But for the Rockets' offense to run at peak capacity, against Golden State, with the team's current roster composition, the Rockets are relying upon Paul to do something he can no longer can.
In the next installment, I will explore the Rockets' options moving forward with Paul. Rahat Huq Contributor I am an attorney specialized in Public Finance, Municipal Tax, and Open Government, living in Houston, Texas. I have been covering the Houston Rockets since 2009 at Red9... Read More "

Fintech Is Putting The Bank Of Mom And Dad Out Of Business,www.forbes.com,Madhvi Mavadiya,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/madhvimavadiya/2019/05/26/fintech-is-putting-the-bank-of-mom-and-dad-out-of-business/,"Photo Credit: Getty Getty According to recent research from peer-to-peer lender Zopa, those aged between 18 and 22 - also known as Gen Z - are no longer compelled to rely on their parents to support them financially as 35 percent of the age group and 52 percent of millennials have more than £1,000 in savings. These findings suggest that Generation Z are in control of their financial future and contradict the abundance of headlines that suggest that this generation, in addition to 23 to 28 year olds known as millennials, spend frivolously on Pret A Manger and cannot save.
However in addition to numerous articles on the subject, the Financial Conduct Authority also reported that one in 10 U.K. adults have no savings at all. The FCA also found that in comparison to baby boomers, for Gen Z and millennials, mortgages, student debt and the cost of having a family, will have a stronger impact on being able to put money aside for future generations.
USA Today reported that even if millennials depend on Mom and Dad for financial help, financial independence is what they want - as this is a measure of adulthood, but it is unattainable. Almost three in five said they could not afford their lifestyles without support. Young adults require financial help with phone contracts, food, rent and for those with mortgage payments, two in five got down payments from their parents, according to a Merrill Lynch/Age Wave survey.
The biggest problem is debt. The average loan balance for a graduate is just under $37,000, which would mean a monthly repayment of $371 over 10 years. What the Zopa survey revealed is that these younger generations are also making saving cash a priority. Andrew Lawson, Chief Product Officer at Zopa, highlighted that the research shows that a new agenda is being set.
“With Gen Z showing they are the savviest when it comes to financial control, it may be time to wave farewell to the idea of the Bank of Mum & Dad,” Lawson said. Furthermore, it could be argued that the rise of the fintech industry and alternative ways of managing money has led to younger generations keeping a closer eye on funds and planning for the future using the various apps that are available. What Vytas Taujanskas wrote in a Medium post last year was particularly poignant.
“Contrary to the previous generations, Millennials have a different basis for decision making. They spend less for the luxury things, responsibly estimate when to marry, or to own a house, highlight healthcare much more than Gen X. Therefore, the challenge is to find a key how to meet the different generation Y mind-set expectations in providing solutions to their wealth management.”
Taujanskas continued: “Millennials’ affinity for technology is reshaping the service industry immensely. They are able to access all the information on the web and are prone to compare products using digital tools and find the best value for the best price. Additionally, Gen Y have high standards for the brands they identify with. That is all why a high degree of transparency is necessary. It isn’t hard to do that in the digital world. Showing full details about their spending, disclosing the full cost of the service, showing the alternatives how to save or how to get more value for the money are ways to bring more transparency for the service.”
Zopa found that 70 percent of Gen Z check their finances every day and 61 of millennials are doing the same. 63 percent of Gen Z check their bank accounts on their phones, while 60 percent of millennials use traditional online banking hubs. In addition to this, twice as many millennials would go to a branch to check their balance in comparison to Gen Z. What this is proving is that as new generations grow up using financial technology, the more so financial technology is embraced.
Research also looked into openness to discussing money with family and friends and results found that 73 percent of millennials and 70 percent of Gen Z were happy to talk about managing money. Lawson said that being in control of money is crucial to feeling positive in general and about finances. “As more and more tools come to market to help people stay in control of their money, the generations that are more open to trying new apps and features are getting better and more adept at managing their finances. These tools aren’t just for the younger generation though, you can become financially savvy at any age!”

Piled-Up Inventory Prompts The U.S. Auto Industry To Cautiously Amp Up Discounts,www.forbes.com,Jim Henry,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2019/05/26/piled-up-inventory-prompts-the-u-s-auto-industry-to-cautiously-amp-up-discounts/,"The pressure is on automakers to revert to form and raise discounts to clear out a growing backlog of unsold new cars and trucks, according to research, forecasting and consulting firms J.D. Power and LMC Automotive . U.S. auto sales in May will help with the backlog, including the Memorial Day long weekend, which normally boosts spring sales. Nevertheless, sales for the entire month of May are expected to be down about 2 percent to around 1.6 million, the firms said in a report to be released on May 28.
Based on results in the first part of May, the month could be the first time in almost a year that incentive spending increased compared with the same month a year ago, according to Thomas King, senior vice president of the Data and Analytics Division at J.D. Power. Incentive spending was down for 10 months in a row through April 2019, he said. Incentive spending per unit so far in May was $3,722, up just $25 from last year, the company said.
Getty
The U.S. auto industry had a 78-day supply of unsold cars and trucks combined as of May 1, up from 70 days as of April 1, according to the Automotive News Data Center . The days-supply is an estimate of how long it would take to sell the current inventory, at the current sales rate. A 60-day supply is the traditional benchmark for not too many, not too few.
Those inventory figures represent about 1 million unsold cars and 3 million unsold pickups, SUVs, crossovers and minivans combined, Automotive News said.
According to J.D. Power, new vehicles sold in May spent 74 days on dealer lots, the highest level for the month of May since 2009, during the last recession.
Automakers have preached “discipline” in offering incentives, ever since General Motors and the former Chrysler Group went through bankruptcy restructuring and downsizing in 2009, and Ford Motor Co. had a near brush with bankruptcy.
The leaner, post-recession car companies can be profitable at much lower production levels. That makes pricing discipline, coupled with lower production when necessary, easier to practice as well as preach. True, incentives are still high – but not as high as average transaction prices net of incentives, which have also grown.
That’s a tradeoff which works in the auto industry’s favor, but it could be a bad sign if incentives were to rise and sales didn’t follow suit."

We Keep Forgetting That We Didn't Want Democratic Social Media,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/26/we-keep-forgetting-that-we-didnt-want-democratic-social-media/,"Perhaps the most remarkable but little-remembered story of Facebook’s rise to social behemoth is that from 2009 to 2012 it was actually a democracy . Facebook’s users could vocalize the issues affecting them the most and issues that attracted sufficient number of users could actually be placed to a formal vote , with the results legally binding on Facebook itself. While the reality was slightly less utopian, with limits on the kinds of issues that could be brought to a vote, the process was overall a genuine form of democratic representation by Facebook’s users in the site’s governance. Unfortunately, we failed to vote and so the site took away our democratic rights and morphed into the digital dictatorship it is today. As rumblings grow for Facebook to turn back into a democracy, we would do well to reflect on this chapter in the site’s history and what it means for the future of representation in our digital walled gardens that increasingly control the global flow of information. As Facebook’s influence over the digital landscape has grown to encompass nearly a quarter of the earth’s entire population, there has been growing scrutiny over the representativeness of its policies, especially those governing acceptable speech and how it uses the private data of its two billion users.
A growing number of policymakers and pundits have called for Facebook’s two billion users to have more say in its policies, creating the same kind of democratic governance structures that have become the most effective structures of modern states.
Yet the problem with these calls are that they ignore the fact that Facebook actually was a democracy for three years. While the company exercised considerable control over what could come up for a vote and many of the issues it is grappling with today were not among those it surfaced to its users to vote upon, the fact remains that Facebook was still a limited democracy .
Most importantly, unlike many of the “democratic” experiments of its peers, these votes were not “advisory” votes that merely provided “feedback” that could be readily dismissed. The votes were actually legally binding upon Facebook, giving its users a very real voice in its governance.
Unfortunately, Facebook’s users did not exercise their right to vote and thus the company eventually stripped these rights and transformed into today’s digital dictatorship.
The story of Facebook’s transition from democracy to dictatorship is actually a fascinating look at the scaling issues inherent in direct representation. As Facebook grew, it became harder for any meaningful percentage of users to be mobilized. Indeed, this is one of the reasons today that most “democracies” involve fulltime legislators representing their constituents rather than requiring a popular vote for every policy change.
However instead of transitioning from a popular democracy towards one with representatives reflecting the views of their constituents, Facebook simply removed all mechanisms through which its users could instill their will on its governance.
Most importantly, Facebook’s story reminds us that despite how important we claim our democratic ideals are to us and how much we are willing to fight for a representative form of governance, we cannot actually be bothered to exercise those rights when it matters.
Facebook offered all of us the right to a democratic form of governance in which every Facebook user could choose what future they wanted for the company. We couldn’t be bothered to exercise those rights, so they were taken away.
For all the calls to restore some semblance of representative governance within Facebook, the unfortunate truth is that we simply don’t care about our digital rights anymore.
If Facebook announced tomorrow that every one of its policies was being put up for a vote and that we could decide to put an end to its use of our data, halt its targeted ads, force new concessions regarding security and so on, the reality is that few of us would actually take the time to vote.
It is not an issue of getting Facebook to give us a vote. The real issue is getting the public to care anymore.
Putting this all together, Facebook was once a democracy but we didn’t exercise our rights so they were stripped away. Simply giving us back those voting rights is unlikely to have any meaningful change on Facebook’s governance structures, since the deeper issue is not our lack of voting power but rather the fact that we simply aren’t willing to exercise it.
In the end, society seems entirely comfortable rushing towards 1984 ."
Rocket League's 'Clubs' Feature Needs A Major Upgrade,www.forbes.com,Max Thielmeyer,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maxthielmeyer/2019/05/26/rocket-leagues-clubs-feature-needs-a-major-upgrade/,"The Rocket League community was ecstatic with the initial release of Rocket League Clubs in August of 2018, but that excitement has since dwindled into indifference as the promising feature has turned out to be rather shallow.
Rocket League Clubs allow players to set a club name and color.
Psyonix Rocket League Clubs allow for friends and teammates to play under a common banner, setting a Club name and color combo that appear in-game when playing against another club. Unfortunately, that's all the Clubs feature has to offer in its current state besides the ability to set ""Club news"" that has no practical function.
While it is pretty cool to see your team name and colors in-game, the lack of depth has made Clubs somewhat of a non-feature. What could be an exciting feature that would provide a real tool in managing a team of players has apparently dissolved into a competition to see who can sneak the most offensive club names through Rocket League 's profanity filter.
In order for Clubs to be a useful feature, it should offer functionality that actual soccer club managers would want: statistics tracking, club leader boards, and more. Clubs should keep track of players' stats as they play club matches with their teammates to display leading scorers and goalies, and members should be able to contribute to the club's all-time win/loss record as they play.
A screenshot of the Clubs feature shows how little it offers players.
Psyonix/Rocket League The clubs with the highest MMR could even be displayed in the season leader boards, which would add another layer of competition and challenge to high-level players.
Ultimately, Clubs is a social feature. Adding these statistics-tracking features would let clubs compete with other clubs, battle with their teammates to become the best in the club and, most importantly, it would make matches between Clubs actually mean something.
Playing with your club would be more than just playing under whatever goofy club name you and your friends have cooked up. The matches would contribute to a longer story that players write for themselves, fighting to increase their club's ranking or to become the club's leading scorer.
With Psyonix's recent move to Epic Games, I'm hoping that a revamped Clubs feature is on the way. Hopefully Epic is able to assign more developers to working on Rocket League to add more features to the game that weren't necessarily a priority by the smaller Psyonix team."
Emotions Overruling Logic: How Belief Bias Alters Your Decisions,www.forbes.com,Stephanie Sarkis,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniesarkis/2019/05/26/emotions-overruling-logic-how-belief-bias-alters-your-decisions/,"Belief bias is one of the most common forms of cognitive bias. It has probably altered your acceptance of arguments more than you would like to admit. Belief bias is a type of cognitive bias wherein we are more likely to accept the outcome of something if it matches our belief system. You may be thinking, well, that's self-explanatory . Not so fast. Belief bias also states that if a person produces an argument that we cannot follow, or that makes no logical sense to us, we are still more likely to accept it because the final premise matches what we also believe — it ""makes sense."" In other words, you are likely to accept a conclusion as true because it is believable to you, rather than examining whether the conclusion is logically valid. Here are two syllogisms, or logical arguments that require deductive reasoning. The conclusion (final statement) is inferred from a major premise (the first part of the argument), and a minor premise (the second part of the argument). First, all trees have leaves; crepe myrtles have leaves; therefore, crepe myrtles are trees. Second, all birds can fly; a pelican is a bird; therefore, a pelican can fly. You are more likely to rely on your prior knowledge base and personal beliefs to accept both conclusions when only the second syllogism is logically valid. When belief bias comes into play, you are basing your reasoning not on the strength of someone's argument, but on the believability of his or her conclusion .
Let's look at how belief bias alters our perceptions of arguments. We have a set of core beliefs that we obtain from how we were raised, our life experiences, culture, religion, profession, our peer group, our families...the list of influences over our beliefs goes on and on. Let's say one of your core beliefs is that ingesting chocolate chip cookies is the way to world peace. You just know this — it is deep in your being. You go to a rally that is pro-cookie. Mr. C. Monster (who you know as an expert in cookie-related matters, which can lead to another form of cognitive bias) says that cookies contain magical healing properties. He says we should force-feed cookies even if people don't want them because cookies lead to world peace. You are all for cookies leading to world peace, so you are on board. But wait, how do you feel about force-feeding cookies? In an extreme form of belief bias, you ignore the concept of free will, and you focus on the conclusion.
Let's look at a real-life example. Politically, you feel that illegal immigration should be stopped. You are told that illegal immigrants cause a large number of crimes, and therefore they will be separated from their children at the border, thus leading to the decrease of illegal immigration. You hear the conclusion of ""decrease of illegal immigration,"" and accept the premise leading up to that conclusion. Another example is that you feel all drugs should be legalized. You are told that you can't overdose from drugs, addicts will get a hold of drugs anyway, so all drugs should be legalized. You hear ""all drugs should be legalized,"" so you are on board.
When people tell us the reason we don't understand their argument is that we are not ""smart enough"" or ""educated enough"" is very effective, especially when we are told this from people in positions of power. We do agree with their conclusion, so we assume maybe he or she is right — we just aren't as educated or smart to understand how the person got to that conclusion. And they are in a position of power, so they are trustworthy, right? And we like the conclusion, so that works for us. We don't question the person's motives or flawed logic.
How is this used in advertising and marketing? As long as the conclusion is what someone wants to hear, they will usually write off the details of how someone got there. That conclusion matches what the buyer wants. A seller will avoid using logic in a sales pitch and instead focus solely on the outcome he or she can provide. The seller will also focus on how well that outcome matches what a buyer wants, and their inherent belief system.
One way in which belief bias overrides logic is when you require people to answer a question in a limited amount of time . Slower processing time is more likely to yield logical, rather than belief-based outcomes. So when a salesperson asks you rapid-fire questions, look out for belief bias. You are more likely to have a good defense to the influence of belief bias when you are able to create alternative premises to a conclusion . And that takes time.
How does one counter belief bias? Put your logic ""cap"" on when presented with an argument, and take emotion out of it as much as possible. Think beyond your gut reaction that what someone says ""makes sense"" — consider, using logic, whether what he or she said leading up to that conclusion is true or possible. If you are given a high-pressure sales tactic, walk away. Think about if what you are being told about the item really meets the criteria of what you want. This is why it is always helpful to write down the top five or ten features you want in an appliance/house/car before you buy it. Turn off your emotions and zoom in on logic. Do the premises leading to the conclusion also match your belief system?"

"Aon's Lyle Sandler On Layering Today's Experiences With Ceremony, Synchronization + Choreography",www.forbes.com,Billee Howard,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billeehoward/2019/05/26/aons-lyle-sandler/,"In today’s emotion driven economy, experiences, not just content, are king. Consumers are impacted more by the interactions they have with a brand than mere product or service focused transactions alone. No longer can brands just stand for the things they sell, but rather must connect with consumers on a more deeply personal level based on who they are and what they stand for. Additionally, in an environment where trust has been significantly fractured due to the myriad data privacy quagmires of late, there has never been a more important time for brands to lean into experiences built on a foundation of authentically displayed humanity.
Ask The CMO: Aon's Lyle Sandler on Layering Today's Experiences with Ceremony, Synchronization + Choreography
Billee Howard For my latest column, a series dedicated to speaking with the top marketers and brand leaders in the world about latest issues and trends driving the landscape, I had the pleasure of speaking with Lyle Sandler, Chief Experience Officer of Aon. Lyle is a brand design and experience veteran who has been a life-long advocate for consumers at leading brands such as Goldman Sachs, Jack Morton and NCR. We spoke about everything from the latest trends driving the experience economy, why a consumer’s response to brand understanding is ‘guttural,’ to how he is putting his best-in-class industry acumen to work at Aon. Following is a recap of our conversation:
Billee Howard: People keep talking about the experience economy. What does it all really mean?
Lyle Sandler: If we break it down to the fundamentals, an experience is a response to stimuli. We engage in experiences everyday, actually every second, and the economy is full of stimuli. So the notion of an experience economy has been around since humans first traded. The seller, or barterer did everything they could to create an approach behavior in order to stimulate trade and the economy.
The difference is that today’s consumer is an activist. In prior generations that same consumer was passive, easily persuaded, and willing to be guided by the commercial entities that influenced their lives. Consumerism and technology have emboldened today’s consumer. Individuals have greater control of their personal economies and companies are forced to respond by creating higher fidelity, relevant and customized experiences. This is all in response to consumers who seek experiential value above and beyond the functions and features of products and services.
Based on this, it is only natural for purveyors of “human experiences” to explore every opportunity to provoke an action or influence a behavior, especially in a world where access to commodities, goods and services are boundless and parity is the norm. One of the last bastions of differentiation is the authentic nature and fidelity of an experience. There is a hurdle - human beings are unforgiving when their most basic expectations are not met. Break a promise and your best customer becomes your competitor’s advocate. Same job, same pay, but better colleague experience, guess where the quality prospect goes? The expression “experience economy” is a reminder to organizations that the way a consumer experiences (touches) a company is as important (if not more) as the products and services they offer.
Howard: Can you define and deconstruct the modern day meaning of brand experience? How are you approaching this at Aon?
Sandler: Brand Experience is the dimensional construct of a brand. That means every expressed, latent, real and virtual way a brand connects with people and produces an emotional response. Organizations that have strong brand experiences are very tightly curated. Each nuance is considered part of the connective tissue that epitomizes the unmitigated way in which a brand connects with the consuming public.
The deconstruction of a brand experience requires the identification of each element of the connective tissue as well as its intended affect on the public. If that intention cannot be identified, the experience must be edited or removed. Given the power of social media, there are new and extraordinary ways in which connective tissue reaches beyond the control of a brand manager. The key words I use are ceremony, synchronization and choreography. Ceremony is the unique and consistent way in which your brand presents itself to the public; do you have a recognizable ceremony? Synchronization is the way in which every physical and virtual element of your total brand experience is related in some way, or instigates a chain of causation. And choreography relates to colleagues. Everyone has a role to play and they have to play it flawlessly.
My approach at Aon is to scrutinize the landscape and adjust the smallest nuance to the most prevalent offering. Our approach is quite agile and we realize that customer requirements change, often quickly; it is essential to respond and often act preemptively.
Howard: What are the key things brands need to be aware of when building the experiences of the future?
Sandler: There are a host of things that demand the attention of a brand, however the singular and unfailing attention needs to be paid to the humans who consume a brand. Brand needs to be easy to use, they must be learnable/understandable and never betray the public’s trust and confidence.
Howard: How should corporate narrative be folded into brand experience and why is that so important?
Sandler: Storytelling is fundamental to the human condition. We would not be who we are without storytelling . When effective, a story or narrative describes the human experience in a casual, memorable and believable way. Jonathan Gottschalk, in his book “The Storytelling Animal”, says, “the storytelling mind is allergic to uncertainty.” Essentially the efficient storyteller removes ambiguity that complicates a message, eliminates complexity and clarifies conflicts that sully a brand’s integrity. The corporate narrative is the brand experience and in order to gain trust and confidence, it is vital that all uncertainty be removed.
Howard: How does brand experience relate to trust? How can trust be built with consumers through the emotional engagement of brand experiences?
Sandler: Trust is based on beliefs. A person who believes in a brand (or in another person) trusts that brand or person. However, there is a level of vulnerability associated to trust. A consumer trusts a product or service because it is assumed they will get what they expect. I might trust a brand without ever having interacted with that brand. The way I observe a brand from a distance will, if done with a great deal of clarity, authenticity and value, instill a level of trust (somewhat referential).
That, in turn, creates an approach modality for a consumer. As long as I trust, I will likely approach. On the other hand confidence comes with experience. I am confident in a company once I have engaged. I trust the clerk at a high-end department store will act appropriately, but only have confidence after I have engaged with them. This all comes down to the difference between knowing and understanding. Knowing, or knowledge, is based on the discovery or recall of data. It implies a level of expertise, experience and education. It provides a level of certainty. Understanding, on the other hand, entails an in-depth consideration of the connections between humans, information, and moments of time, resulting in a deeper level of meaning. Understanding is “guttural.” It’s an essential step that allows us to put knowledge to better use.
Engaging emotionally with a brand will gain trust. That trust occurs when a clear referential narrative is provided, creating an approach mechanism.

Great Ideas To Make Your Meetings Matter,www.forbes.com,Rodger Dean Duncan,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2019/05/26/great-ideas-to-make-your-meetings-matter/,"In the first part of this conversation (see “Poor Meetings? You Don't Have To Take It Sitting Down” ), consultant and researcher Steven G. Rogelberg suggested remedies for the blind spots that turn meeting participants into meeting victims. He suggested remedies. Here he discusses agendas, seating arrangements and other factors that can help transform a time-sucking gathering into a productive venue for creativity.
Rogelberg is author of The Surprising Science of Meetings: How You Can Lead Your Team to Peak Performance .
Rodger Dean Duncan: You refer to agendas as “a hollow crutch.” What are some best practices in the use of a meeting agenda?
Steven G. Rogelberg
UNC Steven G. Rogelberg: The meeting agenda is not the panacea that almost all self-help books on improving workplace meetings will offer.
Specifically, research shows that just having a meeting agenda does not result in a more satisfying or effective meeting. In order for agendas to be effective, meeting leaders have to be intentional about them—they need to be thought-out carefully and approached with care, like planning an event. Also, keep your agendas fresh! Do not open your go-to agenda Word document, change the date in the upper left-hand corner, and print it out to bring to the meeting.
A good tip for making an agenda that is meeting specific—and will also increase accountability—is to ask attendees for agenda items to include. Beyond this recommendation, I suggest that meeting leaders place items that have to be covered near the top of the agenda. If you have employees who rarely participate, consider assigning them an agenda item to “own” as a way of engaging them and helping to develop their leadership skills. And, consider framing your agenda as questions to be answered, rather than topics to be addressed.
Duncan: You recommend rotating the seating arrangement in meetings. Why?
Rogelberg: Table seating matters in meetings. Research demonstrates that emergence into leadership positions is influenced by seating location (e.g., it is culturally constructed that the head of the table is a leadership position), and where we are sitting influences communication flow and who we are more prone to disagree with.
I would argue that even without knowing anything about the individuals in the meeting, a meetings researcher could predict meeting dynamics with decent accuracy by just looking at a photo of the attendees around the table. And, at the same time, we do know that people tend to gravitate to where they sat last. The dynamics created by seating location do not necessarily derail a meeting. But, it can be an issue affecting meeting effectiveness, critical decision making, creativity, enjoyment, and energy.
The takeaway from the above is not that the meeting leader needs to have a heavy hand in social engineering the meeting experience, but having some fluidity in seating is useful so that, over time, a full range of dynamics and patterns are experienced in the meeting. This, in turn, serves to prevent pigeonholing folks, helps to keep things fresh and stimulating, promotes different types of communication patterns, and overall prevents the meeting experience from becoming stale.
Meetings are where productivity and creativity can die. It doesn't have to be that way.
Oxford Duncan: “Walking meetings” seem to be popular in some organizations. What are the advantages and possible disadvantages of that approach?
Rogelberg: Walking meetings are really terrific when it’s just you and one other person, or you and a couple of folks. They can create focus. Obviously, it gets people out of their office. People can get outside. People get steps on their Fitbits. There are lots of positives that can emerge from it, but they still need to be planned and you need to be sure the agenda and topics fit this type of approach (e.g., not heavy note-taking).
There are a few important caveats. First of all, you have to keep that (walking) meeting size really small (fewer than 3). Two, people need to know in advance that you’re having a walking meeting. That way, we make sure that everyone has the right shoes, which is relevant. Three, you want to think about where you’re walking. As funny as it sounds, you want to make sure you’re walking in a circle, so you wind up back where you started, and it didn’t take you long. Four, this should be a slow saunter and not a power walk. Being in good shape should not be a necessity for doing a walking meeting.
Duncan: Many people claim they are good at multi-tasking, although decades of research shows that effective multi-tasking is no more than an addictive oxymoron (the human brain can’t do it). Given that reality, what are some good ways to manage the digital addiction of meeting participants?
Rogelberg: Many companies are banning technology at meetings and asking attendees to check their phones at the door or deposit their phones in a basket (granted, they offer exceptions for employees “on call” or the equivalent). The highest profile example of this practice was President Obama’s Cabinet meetings, where the use of cell phones was banned so that staff could be entirely present during the meeting.
There are a couple of important caveats to this advice. First, banning technology works best if the meetings are short and focused. If the meeting is on the longer side (e.g., an hour) or maybe even less, you may want to build into the agenda a technology break so folks are able to check in and quickly resolve issues using their devices. And let’s be realistic: given the various levels of technology addiction in our society, this will also likely provide meeting attendees with some peace of mind.
Duncan: You write about research that shows a “silent meeting” can be more productive in a brainstorming session than one in which people talk to each other. That seems very counterintuitive. Please give an example of how, and why, silence can be beneficial.
Rogelberg: There are lots of ways that silence in meetings can be leveraged. I’ll share one example. A very common activity in meetings is for folks to brainstorm. If you actually have people brainstorm ideas on paper, as opposed to verbally, and then collect those ideas, you will get nearly twice as many ideas. They will be higher quality, and they’ll be more creative. Brainstorming in silence allows people to be more honest. They don’t filter based on what the boss just said. And it allows for everyone to speak at once because you’re not waiting for that one person to finish their idea.
It’s a simple technique, and there are plenty of other ones around silence that can very much energize a good meeting. What’s pretty exciting is that there is a host of software apps now that can facilitate this process—that allow for brainstorming on your phone, and then the outcomes are just shot right to the front of the screen."
IRS Grants Tax-Exempt Status To Planned Supervised Injection Site,www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/05/26/irs-grants-tax-exempt-status-to-planned-supervised-injection-site/,"From the Church of Satan to Key Worldwide Foundation (a target in the recent college admissions scandal ), what constitutes tax-exempt status has continued to be a hot button issue in tax and nonprofit circles. Now, there's another organization raising eyebrows: Safehouse, a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation which hopes to open a supervised injection site, has been granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). ADVERTISEMENT Safehouse describes itself as ""motivated by the Judeo-Christian beliefs,"" noting that ""At the core of our faith is the principle that preservation of human life overrides any other considerations."" The organization was founded to address the drug crisis, which it refers to as a ""public health crisis."" As part of a range of overdose preventions services, the organization wants to offer ""safe consumption and observation rooms staffed by a medical staff prepared to administer overdose reversal if needed."" Additional services would, the website goes on to state, include on-site initiation of Medically Assisted Treatment (MAT), recovery counseling, education about substance use treatment, basic medical services, and referrals to support services such as housing, public benefits, and legal services.
Safehouse hasn't yet decided on a specific site for the facility, but the organization says it considers it a ""priority to be a good neighbor."" Safehouse is targeting Philadelphia, declaring that the City of Brotherly Love is ""experiencing an overdose crisis of unprecedented proportion."" According to data taken from the Office of the Medical Examiner, Philadelphia Department of Public Health, since 2009, overdose deaths in the city have risen by nearly 200%. The Mayor's Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic in Philadelphia (downloads as a PDF) found that in 2015, drug overdose deaths in Philadelphia outpaced those of other major cities, including Chicago and New York.
Their mission would appear to be a noble one. There's just one big problem: the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has filed a civil lawsuit against Safehouse, claiming that its planned operations are illegal. The lawsuit, United States of America v. Safehouse (Case 2:19-cv-000519-GAM) was filed on February 5, 2019.
Getty While Safehouse will not make narcotics or opioids available (other than those that are FDA-approved for treating opioid addiction), staff will not monitor the type of consumption by participants. And while Safehouse personnel will not place needles or administer any narcotics or opioids, staff will advise on sterile injection techniques. Those services - while available elsewhere in the world - are not offered in any program like this in the United States.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that since heroin and fentanyl are Schedule 1 and 2 (respectively) controlled substances, possession is against the law (21 USC section 844(a)). Further, under 21 USC section 856(a), it is unlawful to manage or control a place for ""unlawfully manufacturing, storing, distributing or using a controlled substance.""
ADVERTISEMENT (You can read the complaint, which downloads as a PDF, here .)
Safehouse filed its answer on April 3, 2019. In their response, Safehouse outlined its belief that section 856 doesn't apply - and was never intended to apply - to them. Their operations are not illegal, they argue, but instead, are ""entirely consistent with the federal government’s response to the opioid crisis."" The organization goes on to claim that the services they will offer (clean injection equipment, Naloxone access, comprehensive medical services (primary care, wound care, HIV and Hepatitis C treatment) are not only permitted by federal law but ""they are expressly endorsed by Congress and federal agencies."" For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS"") and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (""CDC"") have expressly approved of comprehensive syringe exchange programs, and, according to Safehouse, Congress has recently clarified that federal law permits syringe exchange programs and allows those programs to receive federal funding. That Safehouse argues, ""will advance — not violate — federal law and policy.""
(You can read Safehouse's answer, which downloads as a PDF, here .)
The matter has not proceeded beyond the initial filings. So why would Safehouse apply for tax-exempt status now when its legal status may still be in limbo? For one, having tax-exempt status means donors may now safely donate money to the organization. Those who itemize can deduct contributions on their Schedule A and those who do not itemize can donate without worry: a stamp of approval from the IRS may add legitimacy. The organization is hopeful that will also translate into a favorable verdict in court."

"VRTO is Still the Industry's Weirdest, Most Relevant Conference -- and 2019 is About Recalibration",www.forbes.com,Jesse Damiani,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2019/05/26/vrto-is-still-the-industrys-weirdest-most-relevant-conference-and-2019-is-about-recalibration/,"VRTO 2019 runs June 1-3 at the Toronto Media Arts Centre. The first time I covered VRTO in 2016 , the XR industry was a different world. Pokemon Go was just about to happen. There was still a novelty in trying roomscale experiences with tracked controllers on the (then newly released) HTC Vive. You used an Xbox controller with your Oculus Rift. Magic Leap was a whisper. A wave of 360-video studios had sprung up, each with grand aspirations of being the next big Hollywood success story.
When you frame it like that, the growth of this industry over the past three years has been staggering. But that belies the fact that these three years have been tough . A mainstream market never managed to materialize, VC funding shriveled, startups—beloved and otherwise—went under.
But during that winter, we learned a whole lot. Notably, we learned to stop assuming people would want VR and AR at any cost and start considering what might invite them to the table . It was also during that time that the XR conference-that-could, Virtual Reality Toronto (VRTO), asserted itself as the go-to destination for the weirdos and visionaries to have necessary conversations.
In addition to highlighting pressing industry topics, VRTO carved out a niche in showcasing the philosophical, esoteric, and ethical discussions that will resonate as much in 2030 as they might have in 1980.
With last year’s breakout success in Beat Saber and last week’s official launch of Oculus Quest—the first headset positioned for true mainstream adoption—Keram Malicki-Sánchez , Executive Director of VRTO, wants to use the platform of his 4th annual conference to take stock of the lessons we’ve learned over the past half-decade of experimentation and focus on the next wave of adoption that’s coming. In particular, to think about what insights we can share with newcomers—as well as what obstacles, pitfalls, and concerns should remain top-of-mind.
“Since the Oculus DK1 Kickstarter, a community of makers, hackers, developers, artists, designers and entrepreneurs have been making experiments that helped us understand what VR could be,” Malicki-Sánchez said in an interview with the author. “And now after some five years, we have some answers—some mutations, some hybrids, some mashups and some unicorns. Just in time come the new wave of headsets that are already filtering themselves into the ‘successful’ pile.""
Whether the Quest brings a surge of newcomers from the jump or it takes a few years of compound growth, he views the advent of accessible, standalone VR as the beginning of a new wave for the industry—one that will require the same caliber of conversations that have been taking place at VRTO during its winter.
“VR has had its time talking among itself,” Malicki-Sánchez said. “Rather than talk about how VR is living or dying—we can assume it’s here to stay—now it is time to stop, take a breath, recalibrate, and become part of the world.”
He refers to the concept of 'MAYA' (Most Advanced Yet Accessible, Most Advanced Yet Achievable) from Derek Thompson’s, The Hit Makers: The Science of Popularity in an Age of Distraction as a framework for understanding this next phase for the industry.
“VR needs to meet people where they are, doing what they already love, a concept I picked up from Amanda Shelby,” Malicki-Sánchez said. “VR needs to extend rather than upend people's activity and lifestyle.”
Every year, Malicki-Sánchez personally curates and programs the festival to move as its own creative setpiece, where conversations flow based on ideas rather than being merely boxed-in by type.
“Unlike some conferences that may be more modular, the talks are curated to play out like a melody, moving naturally from one concept to the next, extending ideas and then occasionally introducing an exciting and unexpected interval,” Malicki-Sánchez said. “It is not a conference about VR and AR; it is a conference about the people who will use and make VR and AR.”
A brief glimpse at the schedule reveals this commitment to the human element, even across subjects as wide-ranging subjects as Location-Based Entertainment (LBE), eSports, Neural Interface Technology, Spatialized and Generative Audio, and more.
Douglas Rushkoff, Amelia Winger-Bearskin, Kent Bye, Sarah Vick, Tipatat Chennavasin, Blake Harris, and many other pioneers in emerging technology will deliver keynotes, presentations, fireside chats, and panels -- including a live recording of the Team Human Podcast with Douglas Rushkoff.
Disclosure: I will be conducting a fireside with Syrmor Shiraz at VRTO 2019, but received no financial or in-kind support from the conference or its organizers. As a journalist, I've been struck by Syrmor's use of SocialVR to explore human intimacy, as well as his ascent to a major media presence, so I jumped at the chance to speak with him about his work in Toronto, which happens to be his hometown.
VRTO is the conference where the Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation was ratified . It's the conference where a panel of psychonauts discussed the interrelationship between extended reality technologies and psychedelics . Now that XR is (finally) poised to enter the mainstream after years of experimentation, a forum like this has never been quite so essential.
VRTO 2019 takes place June 1-3 at the Toronto Media Arts Centre. Visit the official website for more information.

New Surface Pro Leak Reveals Impressive Upgrade,www.forbes.com,Ewan Spence,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/05/26/microsoft-new-surface-pro-7-specs-type-cover-leak-rumor/,"With the expectation that Microsoft will be releasing the Surface Pro 7 later this year, what changes will be made to the hardware? The expectation is already high that the bezels will be smaller and the Surface Pro family will finally make the jump to USB-C, but that’s not all .
Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (image: Ewan Spence)
Ewan Spence In a patent called ‘ Multi-Panel Comuting Device Having Integrated Magnetic Coupling Structres ’, Microsoft details a way to use magnets to hold a detachable cover in place when it is closed up against a tablet.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise when this appears on a future Type Cover for the Surface Pro. The Type Cover design already uses magnets to attach the Type Cover to the spine of a Pro, as well as lifting the keyboard tray against the screen to create a small rake for easier typing.
The one area that is missing is a way to secure the Type Cover when it is closed against the Pro’s screen or tucked away round the back of the ultraportable. Right now a user just needs to keep a good grip while carrying a Pro, but the upcoming answer, according to the patents, will be magnetic.
It’s going to be a small touch, and I doubt anyone is going to make a purchasing decision based on ‘the cover has another magnet’, but it does show Microsoft is sweating the small details. That’s an area where Apple was once untouchable, but as the MacBook design team continues to fight to prove that it has the basic laptop interface working , Microsoft’s focus on making magical moments will not go un-noticed.

Ewan Spence Neither is this the first patent to show Microsoft’s magnetic fascination - earlier this month a patent was published that showed the internal construction of Microsoft’s hardware could switch to using magnets instead of screws . It sounds like the department has been busy brainstorming what on a few topics. I wonder what else will come out of the Surface Skunk Works ?

Congress Is Making Big Changes In Retirement Planning,www.forbes.com,Bob Carlson,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcarlson/2019/05/26/congress-is-making-big-changes-in-retirement-planning/?ss=taxes,"Tweet This A determined, bipartisan group of leaders in both houses of Congress wants to make significant changes in retirement plans, and they’re pushing forward despite all the other distractions.

Getty Divided government in Washington isn’t stopping all action Even the President’s declaration that he won’t work with Congress as long as it is investigating him hasn’t put a hold on all work. A determined, bipartisan group of leaders in both houses of Congress wants to make significant changes in retirement plans, and they’re pushing forward despite all the other distractions.
The House of Representatives Thursday voted 417-3 in favor of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019. A similar bill, titled the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act (RESA) is in the Senate Finance Committee.
Most of the provisions in SECURE are designed to make it easier for more people to save for retirement and for employers to offer retirement plans to employees.
A sleeper provision in the bill essentially would end the Stretch IRA. Under current law, when a beneficiary inherits an IRA, the beneficiary generally can choose to have the IRA balance distributed in required minimum distributions based on his or her life expectancy. Making maximum use of the IRA’s tax-deferred compounding like this is known as a Stretch IRA.
Under SECURE, in most instances an inherited IRA would have to be fully distributed within 10 years of the original owner’s death. There are exceptions, such has for minor children and disabled beneficiaries. The Senate version has a different provision that still would terminate most Stretch IRAs. I’ll have more details about how to respond to the likely end of the Stretch IRA in a future post.
SECURE aims to increase retirement savings in a number of ways. Employers would be allowed to increase the automatic 401(k) plan contribution amount to 15% of employee pay from 10%. Part-time workers with at least 500 hours of employment in each of three consecutive years would have to be allowed to participate in 401(k) plans.
Getty Also, the age limit for contributions to traditional IRAs would be eliminated. Current, contributions aren’t allowed after age 70½. Likewise, required minimum distributions from traditional IRAs would be deferred to age 72. (The Senate RESA would raise the age to 75.)
SECURE makes it easier for employers to band together to form multi-employer retirement plans. Currently, employers generally have to be in a similar industry to form a multi-employer plan. Under SECURE, unrelated employers can potentially reduce costs and offer better retirement plans by joining multi-employer plans.
Small businesses would be allowed a tax credit of up to $500 to help pay for the cost of establishing and maintaining retirement plans for employees.
It also would be easier for retirement plans to offer annuities to retiring employees under SECURE. Plans also would be allowed to give employees an annual estimate of the income that would be generated by the current balance in their 401(k) accounts.
Many other provisions in SECURE are technical but are designed to reduce the paperwork and cost of establishing and maintaining a retirement plan for employees. Congress hopes this will encourage more employers to offer or improve their retirement plans.
The Senate’s RESA isn’t identical to SECURE, but key senators hope to speed the legislative process by having the Senate pass SECURE by unanimous consent.

Denial Of $33M Deduction That Yielded $2M To University of Michigan Upheld On Appeal,www.forbes.com,Peter J Reilly,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2019/05/26/denial-of-33m-deduction-that-yielded-2m-to-university-of-michigan-upheld-on-appeal/?ss=taxes,"Bad news for billionaire Stephen Ross. The DC Circuit has upheld the Tax Court in denying the $33 million charitable deduction for a $3 million contribution he made through a partnership to the University of Michigan in 2003. And we have here another vindication of Reilly's Seventh Law of Tax Planning - Read the instructions .

Getty Fancy Math To Turn $3 Million Into $33Million
I gave my readers a pretty in-depth discussion of the underlying transaction when I covered the Tax Court decision in 2017. RERI Holdings I bought something for about $3 million in 2002. It was given to the University of Michigan in 2003 with an understanding that UM would sell it in two years. Despite a $6 million appraisal the University sold the item for $1,950,000 in December 2005.
The charitable contribution claimed was $33 million. Explaining the rationale behind that is a little challenging because it doesn't even make good nonsense . The thing that was bought, given and sold was a future interest in a piece of real estate. The real estate was a data center leased to AT&T and the future interest became a present interest in 2021. (Remember this is all happening in 2003.)
The whole thing was a kind of tax arbitrage. When buying and selling the property the future interest was discounted heavily, because of the possibility that there might not be anything there come 2021. In valuing the interest for charitable deduction purposes the Section 7520 rate which was around 4% was used. That is something of an oversimplification, but it captures the essence of what is going on. At 4%, you about double in 17 years, whereas at 19% you are multiplying by a factor of about 19( That's a coincidence).
Fill In All The Boxes On The Form
There are a number of reasons why this transaction failed, but the initial one is the most amusing. Form 8283 Noncash Charitable Contributions in addition to fair market value asks for date acquired and basis. That would have given the IRS a heads up that the item for which a $33 million contribution was being claimed was acquired seventeen months earlier for $3 million. That's one heck of a markup. On the return that was filed by the partnership, the basis amount was not filled in.
In 2008 IRS disallowed $29 million based on a valuation of $3.9 million. RERI filed a Tax Court petition and IRS revised its claim calling for no deduction because the transaction was a sham for tax purposes. In the alternative, it argued the deduction might be $2 million the amount that the University of Michigan actually received.
The Tax Court went with zero deduction, but not based on the sham theory. On its own, the Tax Court came up with failure to substantiate based on that missing number on Form 8283. There is something really satisfying with that result. All these smart people with complicated math stuff planning the deal and attacking it and the Tax Court blows it up with what would be a review comment that a senior accountant with three years experience would have given an associate. RTI. (Read the instructions).
Even if the return had been prepared correctly the deal still fails, because the 7520 rates were inapplicable and that is what the crazy valuations depended on.
The Tax Court therefore concluded “the inability of the SMI holder to recover damages for waste or other acts that prejudice its interests exposes the SMI holder to a sufficient risk of impairment in value that the SMI holder does not enjoy a level of protection consistent with that provided by the law of trusts.”

There is a very long discussion about the 40% overvaluation penalty, RERI had a number of defenses, none of which worked. The funniest was the supervisory approval one. RERI had not raised that defense to the Tax Court, because they had not thought of it. Here is how Judge Donald Ginsburg responded to that one.
RERI asks us to excuse its failure to raise this argument before the Tax Court on the ground that prior to Chai it did not clearly have a claim the IRS violated § 6751(b)(1). Fiddlesticks . The fact is that when RERI was before the Tax Court, it “was free to raise the same, straightforward statutory interpretation argument the taxpayer in Chai made” there. ("" Emphasis added "")
When was the last time you heard somebody say ""Fiddlesticks""? Judge Ginsburg just turned 73 yesterday, which really does not seem old enough to have ""Fiddlesticks"" in your active vocabulary.
What About The University?
You really have to wonder what University of Michigan's role in all this was? Did they know that somebody was taking a deduction sixteen times more than the amount that the University received? Based on this story by Alex Harring in The Michigan Daily, it looks like we will never find out.
The University has contended its innocence in this situation. In 2017, University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said the University was not found at fault, and he said Friday afternoon the University has no change in comment.
“During the course of this case, which dates back more than a decade, neither the Internal Revenue Service nor the U.S. Tax Court found any fault with the university’s receipt or handling of this donation from Stephen Ross,” Fitzgerald wrote. “University officials were called as potential witnesses, but in June 2015 were released prior to testifying, as the parties determined that university officials had nothing to add to the case.”
Other Coverage
As noted the UM school paper jumped right on this story . There is something behind the Law 360 paywall . I have Justin Miller to thank for alerting me to this with a tweet."
How Small Biz Owners Can Super-Size Their Retirement Incomes,www.forbes.com,Larry Light,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencelight/2019/05/25/how-small-biz-owners-can-super-size-their-retirement-incomes/?ss=taxes,"If you own a small business with just a handful of employees, and are worried about saving enough for retirement, here’s an idea: start an old-fashioned defined benefit plan for your company. Sure, sure, everyone knows the defined benefit plans (a.k.a., DB plans) are passé, the creatures of large corporations, now being phased out. In the past, the DB concept seldom filtered down to small businesses. That's not the case anymore, for good reason.
Under a DB plan, you get a set pension payout for life, based on your contributions and years of service. The beauty of this, for an entrepreneur, particularly one with good cash flow, is you can boost your personal retirement income enormously.
Another good thing about DB plans is they make employees happy, helping productivity and retention. Large corporations started offering them in World War II, as substitutes for wage hikes, which were mostly non-existent due to wartime wage-and-price controls. In the post-war boom years, the late 1940s through the 1960s, they were an additional perk. But then, as managers looked to cut costs, they have been on the way out.
For that reason, DB plans are increasingly used for businesses that have just a few employees. That’s a counter-trend to what’s happening in many large corporations, where DB plans are being frozen (no new employees allowed in) or phased out with participants getting lump sums or annuities.
Contributing to a DB plan has the added benefit of lowering your company’s taxable income. And, perish the thought, should your business fall into Chapter 11, the DB trove is off-limits to creditors.
As a business owner, you can invest more in a DB plan for retirement than a typical IRA or 401(k) permits—well north of $100,000. This year, a 401(k) has a contribution ceiling of $19,000 (and for the age 50 and up crowd, an extra $6,000 in catch-up payments).
Even better, as a DB plan participant, no law stops you from taking out other kinds of retirement plans, as well. You can still start an IRA, a 401(k) or both. With the DB plan, as with an IRA and a 401(k), the invested money enjoys tax-deferred growth. When it comes time to tap the accounts in retirement, of course, all withdrawals are taxable at ordinary income rates.
One important thing to note: Doing a DB plan for your company is not cheap or easy. DBs don’t require that employees contribute to the DB plan. That means the money comes from you, as the business owner. Annual contributions are based on actuarial assumptions, chiefly the participants’ ages.
And the amount that the company pays into the plan can’t vary with the state of your business’ revenues. If a recession harms your finances, tough luck. Paring your contribution is a no-go. You owe that given amount to the plan, no matter what.
What’s more, the paperwork and the administration fees can be up there where the air is rare. All beneficiaries, for instance, must be provided with an annual summary of the plan’s financials. In general, if a plan’s assets fall below 70% of what’s necessary to fund all the pension payouts, the U.S. Department of Labor will be asking some tough questions. Then, you’ll need to up your company’s contributions to the fund to make it more financially stable.
When your employees get their gold watches, you have a legal responsibility to see that they are paid the pensions that they have earned.
On the other hand, when it’s your time to hang it up, the nice income stream from the DB plan may well make all the hassle worthwhile."
"Five Reasons Why Valencia, Spain Should Be Your Next Holiday Destination",www.forbes.com,Joanne Shurvell,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanneshurvell/2019/05/26/five-reasons-why-valencia-spain-should-be-your-next-holiday-destination/,"The Albufera, a freshwater lagoon near Valencia, Spain is the birthplace of paella Paul Allen/Andfotography.com Valencia on the east coast of Spain is the country's third largest city (after Madrid and Barcelona) and offers many of the same attractions of these two better known cities. If the birthplace of paella with its seven kilometers of sandy beaches and virtually year-round sunshine wasn't already on your radar, it might be now due to a major exhibition by Spain's best known impressionist artist Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida (born in Valencia in 1863) currently on until 7 July 2019 at London's National Gallery and then touring to the National Gallery of Ireland from 10 August 2019. The opening night of ""1989"" a new exhibition at the Institute of Modern Art in Valencia, Spain Paul Allen/Andfotography.com
1. Art collections that are among the best in Europe
The first stop for art enthusiasts should be IVAM , the Institute of Modern Art, where a major new exhibition celebrating 1989, the year the museum opened, was on when we visited. IVAM was Spain's first museum of Modern Art when it launched and today it is the country's second largest (after the Reina Sofia in Madrid). 1989: The End of the 20th Century also referenced the historic year that ended an era defined by the Cold War and focused on events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall, the AIDS crisis and the beginning of the end of Apartheid in South Africa. For that exhibition, as well as the current one with Fernand Leger (on until 15 September 2019), the museum drew on their own extensive collection of over 10,000 works valued at more than 100 million euros. Their 30th anniversary will feature major exhibitions throughout the year, with the final blockbuster show, Jean Dubuffet, a collaboration with Marseilles' Mucem , opening 8 October. Be sure to stop for a snack or lunch at Mascaraque , the museum's excellent cafe that serves expertly prepared mediterranean-style fish dishes with cod and trout, along with ratatouille and beef tacos. Bombas Gens, Valencia, a new contemporary gallery in a former hydraulic pump factory Paul Allen/Andfotography.com
Another essential cultural venue, that will appeal especially to photography fans, is Bombas Gens , a new art museum, in a former hydraulic pump factory that today houses over 1500 artworks. The art deco style space itself is incredible and clearly no expense was spared in the renovations. A current exhibition of Japanese photography runs until February 2020. Admission to Bombas Gens is free as are tours of its civil war bomb shelter and a massive 16th-century wine cellar discovered when digging the garden. There’s also a two Michelin-starred restaurant on site, Ricard Camarena , that we didn’t try but judging from the excellent reviews, would be worth booking. Biking on the former riverbed, now park, will take you past Santiago Calatrava's City of Arts and Sciences Paul Allen/Andfotography.com
2. Sightseeing that includes historical sites, award-winning modern architecture and nature We always start any city visit with a short tour on our first morning. In Valencia, we enjoyed a historic tour of the old town. Valencia Guías showed us the key sights like the medieval silk exchange and the gorgeous Central Market built in the 1920s and featuring art nouveau design housing one of the largest fruit and vegetable markets in Europe. But the real surprise of the tour was seeing the magnificent, ornate interiors and frescos in Saint Nicolas Church . It’s unlikely we would have found this ourselves as it’s down a small side street and is very nondescript from the outside. Highly recommended is hiring a bike for a morning or afternoon; there are loads of reasonably priced, friendly bike rental shops such as Valencia Bikes . Ride along the riverbed (the river was diverted) which is now a park of around five kilometers long. It will take you past the fantastic Santiago Calatrava designed Alameda bridge and to the City of Arts and Sciences designed by Calatrava and Felix Candela. The ""city,"" spread over more than 7 kilometers, comprises L'Oceanografic, the largest aquarium in Europe, which features a transparent tunnel that surrounds the visitor with fish and sharks, a Science Museum, an IMAX cinema and an opera house. A photographer's dream, even if you don't go inside any of these buildings, it's worth visiting Calatrava's masterpiece just to see the magnificent exteriors. Albufera Lagoon near Valencia Paul Allen/Andfotography.com
If time permits, do take a day trip to the beautiful Albufera Nature Park to discover where paella originated. Jaume Dasi , a charming and informative guide showed us the paddy fields in the lagoon where the paella rice is grown and the warehouses with the tall mounds of the bomba rice (the best for paella). The tour included a peaceful boat trip across the Albufera lagoon, stopping for lunch (paella of course) at Nou Racó restaurant. It was here that we had “authentic paella” something that never has chorizo in it or seafood, the addition of which has been to please tourists. Apparently the only ingredients in a traditional Valencian paella are chicken, rabbit, snails, and three types of beans (green beans, garrofon broad beans and white beans). Monkfish with sundried tomatoes at Michelin starred Riff restaurante in Valencia Paul Allen/Andfotography.com
3. Exceptional Cuisine from tapas to fine dining
No trip to Valencia would be complete without enjoying paella. If you don't have time to travel to Albufera for paella, an excellent alternative is the fantastic seafood paella at La Marítima , a chic and airy restaurant at the harbor that hosted America’s Cup. Tourist version or not, this seafood paella was one of the best things we ate in Valencia.
Wonderful paella aside, Valencia is a paradise for eating and drinking, from cool wine and tapas bars to Michelin-starred establishments. German Chef Bernd Knoller's Riff opened in 1993 and has had a well-deserved Michelin star since 2009. Chef Knoller personally takes all the guest’s orders which is a lovely touch in a room with only ten tables so the entire experience is intimate and relaxing. Knoller's inspired tasting menus change regularly as he likes to use seasonal and local ingredients and to keep things fresh and interesting. As he says ""if I see a new and/or excellent ingredient, I must include it in the menu because the tasting menus are key for us, this is where the essence of the RiFF can be found."" The tasting menu we enjoyed included butter lettuce with cockles, feathery light donuts stuffed with meat, langoustine with artichoke in a coffee sauce, paella rice with beer yeast, mushrooms and peanuts, monkfish with sundried tomatoes and pine nuts and for dessert, a whisky flavored milk ice cream with almond cream. Most Valencian restaurants, including the Michelin-starred Riff, have very reasonably priced tasting menus, especially at lunchtime (Riff's is 39 euros), making fine dining accessible to wider audiences. Begoña Rodrigo, chef and owner of La Salita restaurante, Valencia Paul Allen/Andfotography.com
A short cab ride from the city center is La Salita Restaurante , another fine dining restaurant, also highly recommended. Judging from the enthusiastic crowd, and buzzy atmosphere La Salita is clearly extremely popular with Valencians so be sure to make a reservation. The tasting menu by Begoña Rodrigo , winner of Spain's first Top Chef program in 2013, is all evening affair including genius dishes like sardine infused almond soup, lobster with jerusalem artichoke and caviar and oxtail ravioli. The three tasting menus are reasonably priced ranging from 50 - 90 euros. Bodega Casa Montana, established in 1836 Paul Allen/Andfotography.com
For a traditional meal in a congenial place, try Bodega Casa Montaña , a very popular spot not far from the seaside in the Canyamelar district. The restaurant has been making its own wine since it was founded in 1836 and you can see the large barrels in the back. The menu includes typical tapas like Padrón peppers and cod croquettes. Patatas Bravas at tapas/wine bar Colmado Lalola, Valencia Paul Allen/Andfotography.com
In the city center, a trio of eating and drinking establishments are owned by congenial Jesus Villanueva, who is often on site to chat with customers and offer friendly menu suggestions. The tapas menu at Colmado Lalola , is wide ranging and creative, with a surprising highlight, a delicious twist on the popular Spanish dish patatas bravas . Jesus also owns La Lola, a fancier restaurant nearby and Lolita, a chic cocktail bar around the corner. Lolita, with its gorgeous art deco interiors and pink and aqua blue velvet chairs and sofas, is the idea place for a nightcap.

4. Excellent bars and nightlife
In addition to lots of bars, if you like jazz, Barrio del Carmen in the old town is packed with vibrant bars, cafes and quirky music venues like Jimmy Glass , which features old-school vinyl and live music. The night we were there, Adriano Tortora was performing with his quartet, featuring saxophonist Jesus Santandreu , bassist Dario Piccioni and the talented Davide Lo Cascio on drums, currently studying at Berklee music school . And just east of Estacio del Nord, is the Ruzafa district, a neighbourhood where the locals hang out. The area is packed with small boutiques and a gem of a cocktail bar in an antique shop called La Bella de Cadiz , the ideal place for an a gua de valencia (cava and orange juice). In another part of town and worth checking out is the newly opened is Convent Carmen , a former convent built in 1609 that now houses art shows, live entertainment and street food in the large internal garden.
5. Unique Shops
Kubelik features Mitumi , a local jewellery brand created by Josu and Marieta. Their handmade, contemporary style earrings, broaches and necklaces are all limited editions and are made in their studio in Valencia. Further up the road I found Simple , a charming concept store with local products in lovely packaging, including spices, soaps, jewellery, all made in Spain.
Practicalities:
We stayed at a lovely new boutique hotel in the old town, Marques House Hotel , conveniently located beside the stunning ceramics museum, Palacio del Marqués de Dos Aguas and near the central market. This historic 4 star hotel contains 29 spacious rooms, many with pretty balconies. Double rooms start around 120 euros/night including breakfast, depending on the season.
Getting there and getting around:
There are daily flights on British Airways from London to Valencia, including a new flight from London’s Heathrow that started this spring. From North America, if you fly to Madrid it only takes 90 minutes by the high speed train to Valencia. A Valencia tourist card for 24, 48 or 72 hours is well worth purchasing as it offers free transportation on buses and subways and free access or discounts to most museums and attractions. A 24 hour card is 15 euros.

How Marvel Fuels Profits For Audi,www.forbes.com,Christian Sylt,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2019/05/26/how-marvel-fuels-profits-for-audi/,"Driving a return from product placement in movies isn’t as simple as it may sound. Exposure often tends to be so subtle that it is lost on the viewer or so obvious that it is considered a cash in. Close-ups of cell phone brands below the handset screens or logos of coffee shops on cups are the norm. Brands rarely rev up the personalities of characters in movies but over the past decade one has blazed a trail doing just that. It has been hard to avoid hearing about the Marvel Studios movie Avengers: Endgame this year. The superhero team-up is the latest in a series of 22 blockbusters and has even more punch than its predecessors.
Last month Endgame made history with a global debut of $1.2 billion making it the first film in history to surpass $1 billion in its opening weekend. After just 11 days it became the second highest-grossing movie of all time with takings of more than $2 billion. It hasn’t just cast a spell on Marvel.
In one of the movie’s most emotional scenes, Tony Stark, the billionaire tech genius played by Robert Downey Jr., races over to reconcile with his fellow Avengers and don his high-tech Iron Man armour once more. As the fate of the universe hangs in the balance Stark doesn’t fly himself over to his super friends or ride there on a rocket. Instead he gets behind the wheel of an all-electric Audi e-tron GT concept car.
It subliminally suggests that the car is synonymous with speed and reliability whilst also associating it with one of the most iconic characters in film. It’s no coincidence.
Audi’s connection to Stark stretches back to the dawn of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008. The first movie in the series was Iron Man and it was a game-changer as it seemed to be set in the real world. The technology didn’t seem too far-fetched and even the locations were familiar. Stark’s mansion sits on an actual cliff on the coast of Malibu and his first flight as Iron Man takes him over Santa Monica pier. What really made it believable were the details.
When Stark orders fast food it isn’t a fake brand, it’s Burger King. Likewise, when a business show is seen on television it’s a scene recorded by CNBC anchor Jim Cramer on the set of his Mad Money show. Then come the cars.
A billionaire tech genius would have the most sleek and sporty ride so rather than build one bespoke, Marvel turned to German luxury auto maker Audi. Its two-seater R8 Coupé was chosen and quickly shot to fame as Stark is seen on-screen driving it to glitzy parties and air force bases.
The connection with Audi accelerated in 2010’s Iron Man 2 as an R8 Spyder features in one of the most memorable scenes where Stark makes full use of its open top by driving down the Pacific Coast Highway with a massive life-saving structure sticking up from the passenger seat.
By the time that Iron Man 3 came around in 2013, the partnership was in top gear as auto aficionados began posting reports online about the scenes featuring Stark’s car collection which, this time, included the Audi R8 e-tron. The coverage drove traffic to the movie and Audi which is exactly what it intended.
“It is a win-win-situation,” says Kai Mensing, the supremo of Audi’s Product Placement International division. “For us the movies are a perfect possibility to present our brand values and models to a large global audience in an authentic, elegant and more decent way.”
Mensing is a highly-skilled operator with more than 20 years of experience at Audi. After a five-year career at tech titan Hewlett-Packard he joined Audi’s International Product Marketing department in 1998 and quickly rose through Sports Marketing and Videogame Integration before starting in his current role in 2010.
He has developed auto partnerships with a wide range of movies from the sci-fi epic Ender’s Game to Fifty Shades of Grey and even Spies in Disguise, the computer-animated adventure which will be released in summer and will feature a fictional Audi. The partnership with Marvel is one of its longest-running relationships in film and has stretched far beyond Iron Man.
The most dramatic chase scene in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War sees government officials race after the Avengers in a chase which twists through tunnels and features both cars and bikes. The heroes drive them, bounce off them and narrowly avoid them as they soar through the air.
Many of the vehicles in the fleet bear Audi’s famous four-ringed logo which showcases the capabilities of the cars in a breathtaking and memorable way. It also leaves viewers with a positive impression as the chase largely features Captain America driving the SQ7 SUV in order to outrun the villains and catch his friend Bucky Barnes.
The partnership ticks the boxes of promoting Audi’s cars in a real-world environment which is free of corporate brand clutter. “The most important thing is the credible, authentic and organic integration of the brand and its products into the movies’ storytelling,” says Mensing. “Of course we benefit, if a hero or a main character in the movie dynamically drives our car, as seen in Avengers: Endgame with Tony Stark arriving in his all-electric Audi e-tron GT at the Avengers complex.” The timing was crucial.
The e-tron GT was unveiled at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show in November and is set for release in 2020 so the movie was used to drive awareness of it. Downey Jr, even personally helped to boost the exposure of the new model by visiting Audi’s Head of Design Marc Lichte to get the low down on the e-tron GT in a video which went viral.

Getty Coming full circle, Downey Jr. arrived at last month’s Los Angeles premiere of Endgame in the e-tron GT. It followed his arrival at the 2017 premiere of Spider-Man: Homecoming in the Audi R8 Spyder V10 that appeared in the movie. Tom Holland, who plays the movie’s eponymous hero, arrived in an Audi A8 which was covered in a pattern of spider webs to camouflage its exact design. There was good reason for it.
This time the movie was used to launch the car as the premiere took place at the end of June and the A8 was formally unveiled the following month. Driving ability wasn’t the only attribute which was showcased on-screen. Moviegoers also got to see Audi’s new Traffic Jam Pilot Artificial Intelligence system in action when Stark’s chauffeur momentarily removes his hands from the wheel and the car continued to move autonomously.
Heading in the other direction, Marvel characters have appeared in Audi’s ‘Rocket’s Rescue Run’, a Virtual Reality game for car passengers which reacts the movement of the car that the player is sitting in.
Few other sponsorship properties, even sports, have the universal appeal of Marvel’s characters and Mensing says that this is one of the driving forces behind the success of the partnership. “Of course we evaluate every product placement after implementation and do an ROI [Return On Investment] analysis. An important factor is the very high reach – sometimes a blockbuster is watched by hundreds of million moviegoers (e.g. Avengers: Endgame grossed over 2.5 billion US dollars since its theatrical release).
“The longevity of product placement is another aspect and usually extends over decades, as the movie first debuts in cinemas, then in home entertainment and finally on TV with multiple re-runs. We would never reach such a large audience for such an extended period of time with regular advertising.” Nevertheless, Audi doesn’t leave anything to chance and even promotes the partnership with advertising. For a brand as innovative as Audi it is no surprise that it isn’t your average advertising.
In the run up to the launch of Endgame, Audi released an online commercial set squarely in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It stars Oscar winner Brie Larson playing Captain Marvel, hero of this spring’s blockbuster which took place in the 1980s.
The commercial sees Captain Marvel being acclimatised to modern life and told about the events that led up to Endgame. She is introduced to cell phones, social media and, at the crescendo, an all-electric Audi e-tron. Creating the commercial was far from an overnight job and Mensing says “the integration of cars in a movie and the related promotional campaign is about 1-2 years.” It is well worth it.
Oscar winner Brie Larson behind the wheel of an e-tron in Audi's hugely successful commercial
AUDI AG Mensing adds that the commercial has been viewed more than 100 million times which benefits both Marvel and Audi. It doesn’t stop there.
In 2017 it released a commercial featuring comedy actor JB Smoove as an instructor who teaches Spider-Man’s alter ego Peter Parker how to drive, in an Audi of course. The commercial was highly praised for its humour as Parker uses the high-tech features in the car in a bid to pass his driving test.
Indeed it was so well-liked that according to movie website (https://www.slashfilm.com/mcu-car-commercial/) Slashfilm Smoove will appear as a tour guide in this summer’s sequel Spider-Man: Far From Home. It blurs the boundaries between real life and the silver screen and, as Mensing told us, that really is the magic formula.
How and when did the partnership come about – did you approach the movie producers or vice versa?
Audi and Marvel Studios have collaborated since the beginning of Marvel Cinematic Universe more than ten years ago. Tony Stark aka Iron Man drove an Audi R8 Coupé (2008), followed by Iron Man 2 (2010) with an Audi R8 Spyder, Iron Man 3 (2013) with an Audi R8 e-tron, Avengers: Age of Ultron’(2015) with an Audi R8 Coupé, Captain America: Civil War (2016) with an Audi R8 Coupé; Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) with an Audi R8 Spyder V10 and for Avengers Endgame he traded his Audi R8 in for the all-electric Audi e-tron GT concept.
Furthermore various other Audi models appear in this range of Marvel Studios movies (e.g: Captain America: Civil War with R8, SQ7, A7 Sportback, A4 Sedan; Spider-Man: Homecoming with A8, R8 Spyder, TTS Roadster).
Drawing upon this longstanding relationship, Audi and Disney Games and Interactive Experiences together created Marvel’s Avengers: Rocket’s Rescue Run, to demonstrate how a back-seat passenger can enjoy their journey even more using the most innovative VR technology. The showcase was presented at CES 2019.
Why did you choose a partnership with a movie rather than another type of sponsorship?
Product placement overall is successful for Audi and especially the Marvel Studios blockbusters provide a perfect environment to present our premium brand to large audiences of fans, customers and potential clients. The movies attract very high awareness and our models become part of the storytelling. But naturally product placement is just one element in the marketing mix and therefore does not rule out other types of marketing communication activities at the same time.
Is it a global campaign and, if so, is it beneficial that the Marvel movies have global popularity unlike most sports?
We use global ‘digital first’ campaigns to promote our blockbuster product placements using e.g. short clips and images of the actors with our cars on social media. In addition we usually sponsor the world premiere of the films and have key talent arriving in Audi cars, e.g. Robert Downey Jr. arriving in the Audi e-tron GT concept at the world premiere of Avengers: Endgame. The large global reach of the Marvel Studios films helps to achieve our communication goals.

Getty Why is your brand a good fit with Marvel?
Audi and Marvel Studios are an ideal combination and each collaboration has brought creatively something new as both companies reach for the technological edge.
What are your objectives for the partnership?
It is a win-win-situation. For us the movies are a perfect possibility to present our brand values and models to a large global audience in an authentic, elegant and more decent way.
Have you used the Marvel movies to promote new models?
In 2017 before its official world premiere, the new Audi A8 appeared on the silver screen. Our brand´s flagship made a guest appearance in the Marvel Studios blockbuster Spider-Man: Homecoming, in theaters worldwide. Therefore, movie fans were the first to catch a glimpse at the luxurious sedan. And in Avengers: Endgame we integrated two concept cars to provide an outlook on our coming all-electric new model range.
What products have you provided for the latest Marvel movie?
The latest movie Avengers: Endgame features the all-electric Audi e-tron Sportback concept and the Audi e-tron GT concept.
What moment of the movie featured your products most prominently?
The most important thing is the credible, authentic and organic integration of the brand and its products into the movies´ storytelling. Of course we benefit, if a hero or a main character in the movie dynamically drives our car, as seen in Avengers: Endgame with Tony Stark arriving in his all-electric Audi e-tron GT at the Avengers complex.
How do you promote the partnership and what has been your most notable initiative?
Normally the lead time for the integration of cars in a movie and the related promotional campaign is about 1-2 years. Usually, the starting point is the movie script and its possibilities to integrate our brand and models. Following this, we start brainstorming with the studio about how we could build upon the product placement in a clever, global campaign.
An actual example: The Audi short video ‘The Debriefing’ is not a traditional TV ad, but it is an exclusive content piece for activation within in the scope of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This side-story clip was created in close cooperation with Marvel Studios and bridges the themes of Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel. On global social media channels the video has already more than 100 million views. The video follows Brie Larson as Captain Marvel and her re-introduction to society after years away from earth. The video also features the all-electric Audi e-tron. In the past one Audi clip became even part of the bonus material of the films DVD.
What are the top results you have had from the partnership and how do you measure them?
Of course we evaluate every product placement after implementation and do an ROI analysis. An important factor is the very high reach – sometimes a blockbuster is watched by hundreds of million moviegoers (e.g. Avengers: Endgame grossed over 2.5 billion US dollars since its theatrical release). The longevity of product placement is another aspect and usually extends over decades, as the movie first debuts in cinemas, then in home entertainment and finally on TV with multiple re-runs. We would never reach such a large audience for such an extended period of time with regular advertising.
Do you use the partnership to motivate and incentivize staff and, if so, how?
It is definitely a side benefit, as many of the employees are Marvel fans or they are proud to see an Audi model - which they even maybe have been closely involved with – in cinemas or on TV. We covered the product placement in Avengers: Endgame in our ‘Audi employee podcast’ and had articles in the Audi Intranet about the partnership including the latest movies. We also raffled movie tickets for special employee screenings at theatrical release.
What has been your proudest moment in the partnership?
With the all new Audi e-tron full-electric technology a new era starts for our company. So we are very proud that we managed to integrate our all-electric concept cars in the movie ‘Avengers: Endgame’, while at the same time launching the first all-electric Audi e-tron to global markets. And the strong, positive fan reaction to Tony Stark’s new supercar, the all-electric Audi e-tron GT concept, makes us proud as well."
Alibaba Strikes Cooperation Pact With China Home Furnishings Leader Red Star,www.forbes.com,Russell Flannery,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2019/05/26/alibaba-strikes-cooperation-pact-with-china-home-furnishings-leader-red-star/,"Red Star Macalline Group, the big China home improvement and furnishings mall operator led by billionaire Che Jianxing, has formed a “strategic cooperation” with Alibaba that will cover retail, e-commerce, payments, logistics and consumer finance. Red Star said in a statement on Sunday it had agreed to tap Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao, logistics network Cainiao, and financial services service Alipay. (Click here for the announcement.)
Red Star said it “can introduce advanced operating philosophies and bring in the technical support of Alibaba in the new-retailing areas to the company’s main business operations in home improvement and furnishing shopping malls. This will enhance the company’s operational efficiency and further encourage the integration of online and offline business of the industry.”
Red Star is China’s largest home improvement and furnishings shopping mall operator in terms of the number of malls and the geographic coverage, according to Frost & Sullivan. It operated 308 shopping malls in 199 cities in China that offered more than 24,000 brands as of the end of 2018. Red Star had a 15% market share in the chain home improvement and furnishings mall sector and a 6% market share in the whole home improvement and furnishings mall business in 2018, says Frost & Sullivan.
Red Star had sales of 3.5 billion yuan, or $507 million, in three months to March, compared with 2.9 billion yuan a year earlier, according to unaudited company figures. Net profit in the first three months of 2019 rose to 1.31 billion yuan from 1.18 billion yuan a year earlier.
The agreement with Red Star is part of a larger push into “new retail” by Alibaba. Among Alibaba’s other retail partnerships, Alibaba and Starbucks said last year they would link up for deliveries and payments, an agreement that covered more than 2,100 Starbucks stores in 35 cities in China as of April 2019. Alibaba also had 135 self-operated Freshippo grocery stores.

'Deep Fakes' Are Just An Updated War Of The Worlds For The Digital Era,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/26/deep-fakes-are-just-an-updated-war-of-the-worlds-for-the-digital-era/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. AI & Big Data I write about the broad intersection of data and society. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Orson Welles (with microphone) rehearsing one of his radio programs on CBS. (Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images) Getty Societies around the world are grappling with how to best respond to the rise of doctored videos. From this week's Pelosi video’s slowed playback to AI-produced “deep fakes,” the world of video is shedding the old motto that “seeing is believing.” This raises the question of whether these digital falsehoods, especially newer AI-created videos, represent something fundamentally new or whether they are merely a technological update of the age-old plague of false information. In particular, reflecting on Orson Welles’ infamous October 30, 1938 radio adaptation of The War of The Worlds reminds us that believable falsehoods have been with us since the early days of modern broadcast mass communication.
The 1938 radio adaptation of The War of The Worlds by Orson Welles was in many ways the radio era’s version of a “deep fake.” Mimicking almost exactly how a real military conflict might have been broadcast, with a scheduled evening interrupted at regular intervals by breaking updates, the show was a highly successful work of performance art. To a casual listener that had missed the opening caveats that it was a work of fiction, the broadcast might very well have appeared for all the world like a legitimate breaking story of an invasion.
Moreover, coming just 20 years after World War I’s global conflict and at a time of heightening conflict in Europe that seemed destined to lead once again to war, the broadcast reached an audience for which the idea of an attempted military invasion of the homeland was not nearly as far-fetched as it might seem to a contemporary audience today.
Welles’ broadcast very closely mimicked the timing, narrative storytelling and realism of an actual military invasion. Chaotic and conflicting details flooded in as the fast-moving invasion yielded a flood of information from many different sources. Government officials and military personnel reassured the public in the face of overwhelming odds, attempting to avoid general panic even as they recognized the impossibility of defeating the invaders. Reporters scrambled to establish contact with field units, officials, civilians and anyone else that could offer first-person updates on the massive destruction. Sources fell silent, including famously a reporter describing an active attack upon his location.
For audiences of the time still coping with the aftermath of World War I’s bloody legacy, the narrative might have seemed all too real.
In similar fashion, deep fakes have emerged at a time when citizen video, distributed anonymously over social media has become a major way in which we experience world events. Devoid of any context of authorship or any way to determine provenance or authenticate their contents, we nevertheless freely share and act upon these videos. In fact, as the public has become more suspicious of what they see online, video has emerged as the ultimate “proof” for a public that still clings to the idea of video manipulation being the stuff of Hollywood rather than the home computer.
In this regard, Welles’ broadcast arrived at the perfect moment of radio finding its place as a societal source of breaking news with the duality of a battle-experienced public. So too have deep fakes arrived at the perfect moment of a public accustomed to blindly accepting and sharing anonymous videos without authenticating them or asking any questions about their context or creation.
The actual impact of Welles’ broadcast is subject to considerable controversy. Media reporting at the time suggested widespread panic across the nation, though subsequent research raises questions about just how much of an impact the show really had.
The popular narrative we hold today of a nation in utter panic may be more a product of media fixation at the time on the realism of this new form of fakery than it is an accurate reflection of just how widespread public concern really was. News outlets struck by how real the story appeared and looking to cast radio as the new bogeyman found a natural story in reporting Welles’ broadcast as the vanguard of a future in which radio news could yield all sorts of fake stories that could panic a nation.
In many ways, Welles’ broadcast mirrors the reaction we see today around deep fakes. Despite a lack of examples of AI-created videos having thrown an election or incited mass hysteria, the media have lavished attention on the subject, portraying AI as today’s bogeyman that will corrupt the world of video to the point where we will no longer be able to trust anything we see.
Putting this all together, Welles’ broadcast 80 years ago arrived at a perfect moment, presenting a society accustomed to conflict a tailor-made story. In turn, media looking for the latest scapegoat blamed radio for creating a situation where we could never again trust the information we received. Today, deep fakes have arrived at a similarly perfect moment where society has become accustomed to rampant falsehoods poisoning the information commons and have come to trust anonymous video without question. In turn, just as their predecessors eight decades prior did, today’s media have fixated on deep fakes as the latest evil to corrupt the information commons, making it impossible for us to trust what we see anymore.
In the end, just Welles’ broadcast didn’t yield the end of radio and society somehow found a way to move on, so too will deep fakes have their moment and society will adapt once again.
Once again, every shiny new issue we think of as unique to the digital era is, upon further reflection , merely the latest incarnation of our age-old fears.

America Must Build More Natural Gas Storage Capacity,www.forbes.com,Jude Clemente,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2019/05/26/america-must-build-more-natural-gas-storage-capacity/,"Lack Of New Natural Gas Storage Capacity Natural gas of course is increasingly our go-to fuel to grow the economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, backup wind and solar, and be our essential energy source to export to a mostly poor and energy-deprived world.
This ongoing U.S. ""Dash to Gas"" ensures a known necessity for us: we need more geological sites to store natural gas to meet the ebb and flow of demand.
Since the shale revolution took flight in 2008, U.S. natural gas prices have remained low and stable (see Figure below).
While this is great for American families and businesses, it's made building new gas storage capacity less of a priority.
Literally, this reduced incentive for gas storage has been the only negative of the U.S. shale boom
But, not building new storage capacity has been a logical decision.
Storage facilities are a primary tool to mitigate price risks and used by pipelines to maintain operational flexibility and system balance.
The spikes in pricing, particularly in the cold winter months when demand spikes, have greatly subsided.
A flatter price trend makes it harder for storage operations to make money, a business that is about ""buying low and selling high when prices go up.""
As a result, almost all pending new storage projects and capacity expansions have been delayed or canceled.
U.S. natural gas prices have been low and stable in the shale boom era since 2008.
Photo Credit: EIA Meanwhile, U.S. natural gas production and use continue to surge to record heights every year (see Figure below).
The constant reality for the U.S. gas market and prices is record production colliding with record consumption.
Our domestic usage comes from more power and industrial demand mostly.
In the Shale-Era since 2008, U.S. gas production has increased 60%, demand is up nearly 35%: yet, gas storage capacity has grown just 14%.
Over the past decade, U.S. natural gas production and demand have surged but our capacity to store gas hasn't.
Data source: EIA; JTC Wind And Solar Are Intermittent
Perhaps our most fundamental energy fact is that natural gas will continue to play a central role in the U.S. electric power system.
That's because as we continue to seek ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the harsh reality for some is that wind and solar are intermittent sources of power, unavailable most of the time (capacity factors only around 30% even on good days).
It's something that cannot simply be wished away: the intermittency of renewable generation will require flexible, fast-ramping generation.
As such, the obvious requirement to backup these renewables was, is, and will continue to be very flexible, economical natural gas peaking plants.
"" Natural Gas Is The Flexibility Needed For More Wind And Solar. ""
Gas will be what provides electric grid reliability, namely via load and generation profile following, frequency regulation, backup power, and spinning reserves.
Obviously, battery storage is growing in importance, but these systems don't fully support the full range of flexibility needed, including for seasonal and daily variations.
Thus, batteries cannot displace gas-fired generation, which is uniquely suited to mitigate the intermittency of renewables.
It's no wonder then that EIA says gas will easily supply the most amount of incremental capacity in the coming decades, at 235,000 megawatts .
For perspective, this is a whopping 10 times more than what onshore wind will give us.
This all means that we are actually in the early stages of unprecedented growth in natural gas being produced and used in the U.S (see Figure below).
So, our power system itself could easily face severe supply constraints if no incremental infrastructure is specifically built for the electricity sector.
This clearly centers on building more sites to store natural gas.
For reference, depleted fields account for over 80% of working gas storage capacity.
U.S. natural gas production and demand are expected to continue to surge.
Data source: EIA; JTC Rising Gas Exports
Besides the shale revolution itself, our LNG export boom to the world is probably the most transformative change for the U.S. gas market in its history.
This is a new dynamic that really kicked off back in February 2016, and we will become the third largest seller this year and lead the market by 2024.
It will be U.S. suppliers along the Gulf Coast that will be called upon to support potential global supply disruptions.
This will surely extend utilization of the region’s storage facilities.
As our LNG suppliers are forced to react to international events (e.g., freezing cold winters in Asia that need gas for heating), the boom in exports will add a variability to the market that more U.S. gas storage will need to buffer.
In other words, there will be even greater portions of U.S. demand (and remember that exports are a baseload demand market) that cannot be regularly predicted.
This will make it harder on producers to plan ahead of time, making gas storage even more crucial to our market.
Without new gas storage capacity, our market could drastically (and needlessly) tighten
Moreover, exports will be seasonal, making new capacity that much more vital.
In total, LNG exports are the driving force behind what could be a ~25 Bcf/d increase in U.S. gas demand over the next six to eight years.
And we should be encouraging all of this: gas exports offer us massive economic, environmental, and security benefits for us.
U.S. natural gas exports are a moral imperative, helping an overwhelmingly poor world get access to modern energy while also reducing greenhouse emissions.
"" COP21 Means More Natural Gas and the U.S. Must Help. ""
In particular, as a newer major player in our gas market, Appalachia (WV. OH, PA), now producing nearly 40% of our gas, must see major new investments to not just build more pipelines but also to build the gas storage sites to meet the growing needs of Appalachia itself and the other states and even countries that are increasingly relying on it.
The good news?
The U.S. government is wisely prioritizing the gas storage issue: "" Secretary Perry Announces Appalachian Ethane Storage Hub Report. ""

Forget Luck. Become A Connector And Create Your Own.,www.forbes.com,Darrah Brustein,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrahbrustein/2019/05/26/forget-luck-become-a-connector-and-create-your-own/,"Consider this: When was the last time you achieved something and did it 100% independently? How did you get your last job, client, referral, or recommendation? It’s likely that most successes you’ve achieved occurred in tandem with someone else, or many others.
LinkedIn revealed that 85% of jobs come from one’s network . And, that statistic is even higher for those in executive-level positions.
It’s the people you know, and who know of you, who open the doors to the success you’re seeking.
What’s the best way to approach how you build and cultivate relationships? Become a connector.
How? To help us, I sat down with fellow superconnector Michelle Tillis Lederman, author of The Connector’s Advantage : 7 Mindsets to Grow Your Influence And Impact.
“A connector is simply someone who is relationship-focused in her/his approach to life, to people, and to business. He/she has a certain way of thinking and behaving. They act and get results with ease because they have a level of credibility and trust in and from their network. When they ask for something or make an introduction, it carries weight and people respond.”
Lederman mentions some eye-opening data in her book which shares that while we live in the ‘most connected’ era of all time, in a study of over 3.4 million people, it was found that “social isolation and loneliness had a greater impact on mortality than obesity. Lacking social connections carries a risk similar to smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day.”
The study also revealed that “people with greater social connections were associated with a 50% lower risk of early death.”
So how do you become a connector, thus improving your results and your health? Lederman shares her top tips with us:
Establish trust quickly.
“Trust is at the core of a connector: the ability to trust yourself, the inclination to trust others, and the potential to be trusted by others. Trust is not a short-term accomplishment. All the tiny actions we take on a daily basis contribute to building or breaking trust. I have identified four fundamental aspects of trust which I call the pillars of trust: authenticity, vulnerability, transparency, and consistency. Each of these pillars is an integral part of building and
maintaining trust with those around you, and none can be neglected. Bottom line: there is no connection without trust.”
Relationships are about the long game. But, here’s how to win the short game.
What do you do when you have a short-term goal or deadline, knowing all too well that it’s important to develop relationships with a long-term focus?
“Keep thinking bi-directionally. Even though you have an immediate need doesn’t preclude you from also adding value for someone else. Showing you are open and willing to help will show and make others more open to helping you now.”
Break the ice.
Any relationship starts with a first meeting. How do you break the ice? “Use the situation you are in, the happenings of the day or event, or simply say ‘hello’. Approach someone with openness and curiosity and see where it leads. A smile goes a long way to kicking off a conversation.”
Give serendipity a boost with these three proactive tips.
1. “Figure out who can help you further your objective.”
2. “Seek to understand what would make them want to help you.”
3. “Ask!”
Lederman elaborates, “If you don’t ask, the answer is ‘no’. When you ask, you immediately increase your odds of getting a ‘yes’. Ask in a way that doesn’t put the relationship at risk. Try a convenient, shrinking, or opt-out ask.”
Connect with mentors by showing appreciation.
Being a connector will give you access to potential mentors much more quickly.
“It’s likely that you have mentors in your life already...appreciate them. Formalize those connections that already exist. To add to your mentors, think about whom you admire and why. Then tell that person. Appreciation goes a long way. A mentor needs to understand why them. They want to know how they can add value. Let them know what you are seeking to learn, as well as how you would like to support what they are working on. Make it a two-way street.”
Develop relationships with your customers.
Customers are often overlooked when it comes to building relationships. This is a huge error, especially considering that the value of a current customer is higher than the potential of one you don’t currently have.
“Organizations like Netflix, LinkedIn, Spotify, and Amazon have valuations that are five to ten times that of their transactional counterparts because they’ve built relationships with their customers. We all have companies we won’t work with because of how we were treated. Relationships impact the loyalty and longevity of your customers.”
Be authentic, even if it’s scary.
We hear a lot of chatter about the importance and power of being ourselves. For some this can be scary.
“Fear is what holds us back from everything. The question: of what are you afraid? That is where it varies. It could be rejection, it could be how they will think of us, it could be anything. We are in our heads and it holds us back. We think there is a ‘right’ way when there are many right ways.”
Michelle Tillis Lederman
Photo courtesy of Lisa Rayman Goldfarb Have an abundant mindset.
“An abundant mindset doesn’t act out of fear, isn’t protective or defensive of what they have, and they know the value they bring. Therefore they don’t compare themselves in relation to other people. Don’t be stingy with the praise! I always say, ‘When you shine the light on someone else, it reflects back on you.’”
Start a ‘success file’.
Need a boost? Start a ‘success file’.
“We have bad memories and what we do remember tends to be the bad stuff. A success file will help you remember all the good you’ve accomplished, and all the people who said good things about you. It helps come promotion time (or just on a bad day)!”
You’re not too busy.
It might feel as if your schedule has no room in it to build relationships and be a connector. Lederman disagrees: “There is so much underutilized time in our day. Protect your downtime, but think about that dead time. The commuting time, where you can catch up on a call while driving or send a few emails from the train. The food coma time, where you can be re energized by a catch-up call rather than trying to slog through brain work at half energy. Think about the things you are already doing and invite someone to do them with you.”
‘Find your format.’
“We all thrive in different settings. Being social is more a matter of pinpointing what works for you. In today’s technology-reliant society, there are now more ways than ever to be social. That said, I challenge people not to get too comfortable and over-rely on one method of connecting. Stretch yourself and get comfortable being a little uncomfortable.”
Michelle Tillis Lederman's book, The Connector’s Advantage: 7 Mindsets to Grow Your Influence And Impact.
Michelle Tillis Lederman's book, The Connector’s Advantage: 7 Mindsets to Grow Your Influence And Impact. Be the convener.
Want a way to increase your impact and influence, while also integrating a bunch of goals into one? Then “...be the hub. Invite people to do things and then introduce them to the other people you invited. You stay present in people’s minds as they build new connections, since you are the common person. Be creative. You can convene people in person or virtually; though a group or through a game. Find your fit.”
Make great introductions.
When you think two people should meet, what’s the best way to go about doing it?
“Clearly. By that I mean before offering the introduction, consider what’s in it for both parties. There is a reason you thought to connect two people, share that reason.”
Follow up and follow through.
This is where I see many people falter. A relationship can’t grow unless you follow up and follow through.
“Make a plan on how you are going to do what you say you are going to do. Close the loop by keeping people informed of outcomes, even if it is that you missed the deadline and what you are doing about it. Don’t make people guess, keep them informed.”
Give, even if you think you have nothing to offer.
“There is always value to add. Be curious, ask good questions and uncover what’s important to the other person. That will give you ideas on whom they want to connect with and how you can help. If you can’t figure it out, just ask them. If they are a connector, they will tell you what they need.”
Have boundaries and say ‘no’.
“Saying ‘no’ is the same as saying ‘yes’ to something else. To be conscientious, you must be clear on what you are willing to do and give yourself guidelines when to say ‘no’. ‘Yes’ and ‘no’ are not one word answers. Create guidelines and boundaries to be generous with yourself too.”
Keep the momentum going.
“Stay in someone’s mind, but don’t get in their face. Leverage the initial conversation for follow-up. What did you talk about? Can you add value to that exchange? Look for light ways to reach out. If connecting first online, follow it up with a personal note and extend the conversation. Seek to move from online to offline communication. Set up a call.”
Connect with anyone you want (including influencers).
Is there someone whom you’d love to meet but don’t know how? Here’s where you start: “Do your research. Think about how you could be valuable to them. Start amplifying their content. Engage with them on social media. Attend a conference at which they are speaking. Get clear on why you want to connect with them. Share your reasons and see what happens.”
You don’t have to be a social butterfly or extrovert.
“To be social is simply to seek or enjoy companionship of others. It is not, by definition, being a social butterfly or the life of the party. Connectors do not need to be extroverts! Many introverts are amazing connectors with their own way to do it. They leverage their natural listening skills to make people feel heard. They are able to focus their attention on the person in front of them. All of these innately introverted qualities are advantages when it comes to connection.”"
We Need To Learn Important Lessons From Fake News,www.forbes.com,Jay McGregor,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2017/02/07/why-fake-news-is-actually-good-for-the-world/,"The fake news story quickly became the fake news problem, and now it’s the fake news meme, with the original phrase totally devoid of all meaning. But for tomorrow? Fake news will be a historical point of reference for a society that needed an important conversation about journalism, facts, social media and critical analysis.
I know, it seems like I’m being deliberately contentious to say fake news will ultimately be a good thing for society in the face of its devastating real life effects. But if we'e going to move on from this problem, we should recognise that there is a silver lining - two to be exact - to the revelation that the internet is awash with fiction in non-fiction’s clothing.
Saving journalism
The most obvious of the two is that society is now riveted by a fierce debate about how exactly millions of people can be duped by an obviously false story. This, in turn, has forced a number of news organisations to invest in fact-checking and to put it front and centre of its coverage.
The charge to double check, to comb-over one more time, has reinvigorated journalism. With all of the financing problems facing the industry, the new fact-checking model provides a potential solution.
Journalists are terrified of being called out for inaccuracies for fear of the fake news labels and taunts on Twitter (by the way, fake news isn’t the same as inaccurate news. One is a mistake, the other is malicious). Which means better quality work and rebuilding the public trust that’s slowly waned over the years.
The public, too, is terrified of being duped by a fake story. They’re fearful of being shown to be an idiot for believing that Hillary Clinton is a literal demon Now, rather than skimming headlines they seek out fact checkers, verified publishers and trusted sources. Millions of people now have awakened their latent critical analysis skills.
If journalism is going to survive, readers need to see the value in it. So much so that they pay for it, not just with a click but a small donation or subscription. Solid, trusted fact-checking is a great way to open that dialogue with readers.
I made viral fake news for $200 and it was stupidly easy. Find out how easy in the video below...
Facebook and Google have clearer defined roles
Despite its original protests, Facebook now accepts its role as an extremely powerful media organisation. It doesn’t create news, but it serves it to 1.86 billion of us every day, multiple times a day. The same goes for Google.
That’s an incredibly powerful position to be in, and with it comes….well, you know. So fake news made the world’s largest media company both define its role in our lives, but also do something about the quality of content it serves to us.
If fake news hadn’t happened, Facebook would’ve continued serving up fresh crap every day with little oversight or responsibility. Millions of people outside of my cushioned, lefty filter bubble would still be reading about how Angela Merkel is actually Hitler’s biological daughter.
Now, Facebook has developed tools to better curate content. The crap is de-funded, marked as crap and placed lower in feeds. Publishers with fact-checking credentials are given prominence and better quality content naturally rises to the top. More thought-provoking, accurate, content has to be good for the national psyche.
Society will be better off after it passes through this difficult period. We’ll have a better consensus what the role of journalism is in the modern age, people will value good quality accurate news and we’ll be more sceptical of what we’re told, which is a good rule to live by anyway.

In addition to simply bringing support for Traditional Chinese, Amazon has launched a portal for these readers featuring twenty-thousand titles, including works by Dan Brown, Liu Cixin, George R. R. Martin, Ni Kuang, Pai Hsien-Yung, and Qiong Yao.
Late last year, Amazon also invested in the Indian market , launching Kindle support for Hindi, Gujarati, Malayalam, Marathi, and Tamil . As the Asian market continues to grow, it's likely more readers will continue to gain access to Kindle's platforms.

One Suggestion To The Fed: Focus More On Gross Labor Income Than Inflation,www.forbes.com,Erik Sherman,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2019/05/26/one-suggestion-to-the-fed-focus-more-on-gross-labor-income-than-inflation/,"We assume that economists know what they're doing (or at least we hope they do, given trying to parse the complexities of what they say). Something the Federal Reserve assures us is that they need to track inflation to help keep the economy on track. If it rises too fast, prices can outstrip what regular people earn. Too slow and you have an economy that isn't growing—although the idea that the economy should keep growing at all times seems a bit strange, as that would seem to translate into constantly growing use of resources and even population. But that to the side for a moment and back to inflation. At this point, it seems clear that something has gone off the metric-monitoring rails. Unemployment keeps dropping (although that carries its own questions given how one of the driving factors is people continuing to leave the work roles without enough detail on whether it indicates retirements, deaths, or despair). Nevertheless, inflation remains low, which isn't supposed to happen.
Skanda Amarnath, a former New York Fed research analyst and economist at MKP Capital Management, and currently director of research and analysis at Employ America, a center-left think tank, has a suggestion: look at pay. In an article and a number of interviews, Amarnath's point is that considering gross labor income (GLI)—the total sum of what everyone gets paid—would be a better form of obsession.
He argues that following inflation has become problematic. The data is always delayed, making it as difficult to use as a navigation instrument as watching the rear-view mirror to see if you missed your exit on a road.
There are conflicting definitions of inflation, with different groups arguing for their specifics based on theories of what's really happening. For example, there is one I've seen whose proponents say we should consider how much the prices of smartphones and other electronics have dropped, even as education and housing have skyrocketed, burying people in hopelessness. A cheaper phone doesn't help much then, assuming people have the credit to get a mobile account with a carrier.
Plus, there's a more basic issue. If prices climb, how do you know if people can afford them, which would seem to be the logical reason to look in the first place?
(I would point out that the emphasis on inflation might come from a time when it kicked up to double-digits not that many decades ago and caused havoc. Maybe it's good to remember that just because things seem stable now doesn't mean they'll always be, and if you aren't looking for the potential hazards, you can run into them.)
Amarnath argues that watching GLI, which can be calculated from regular surveys compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is far quicker to determine, doesn't change with various definitions, and more current to business cycles, can help determine whether there are gains in employment and wages.
Amarnath would set a floor on GLI as a trigger, just as we currently use levels of inflation as guideposts. If GLI growth fell through the floor, it would be an additional indicator that action might be necessary.
I'd be more comfortable seeing something beyond a single number. Average growth is just that: average. Much higher growth at upper income levels could mask what happens at lower levels.
Absent more robust distribution, a combination of average and median figures could do a lot of good. If the average shoots up and median GLI hardly moved, it would indicate that those who make less might be in growing trouble as costs rose. Or perhaps show median levels across quartiles or deciles for greater insight.
But the idea of monitoring both pay and price data is intelligent. In his article, Amarnath wrote, ""Americans want a bigger paycheck, not a higher cost of living."" I'd argue that what Americans want is the ability to afford their lives. No single measure will tell, but the combination of the two could be powerful and useful."
Here's What A Blockchain Investor Thinks About Blockchain,www.forbes.com,Jennifer Kite-Powell,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2019/05/26/heres-what-a-blockchain-investor-thinks-about-blockchain/,"With the news on May 24, 2019, of the planned launch of Facebook's 'GlobalCoin' by 2020 , cryptocurrency is poised to move from avant-guarde crypto traders and bitcoin miners to broader adoption by both investors, the enterprise and consumers. ADVERTISEMENT In a blockchain report from Cisco in March 2019, the company reported that 10% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) will be tokenized assets by 2027. And, there will be more than $9 billion spent on blockchain projects by 2021.
But, despite the recent bullish crypto week which saw Bitcoin rival, Litecoin gain around 1 5% in a 24 hour trading period, mass adoption of blockchain is still on the horizon according to some experts.
Remington Ong is a partner at Fenbushi Capital in China. Fenbushi is a venture capital firm which only invests in blockchain-enabled companies. At Publicize Blockchain in New York on May 13, 2019, Ong said he expected to see mass adoption of blockchain within two decades.
Henry Liu , a former Facebook employee and now the managing partner of Austin-based YGC Capital, says he believes Facebook's crypto play will threaten Bitcoin dominance and drive mass adoption. But he adds that blockchain as an industry needs to solve real problems first before we see mass adoption.
""If the only argument is stateless money and permissionless store of value, then we should all be buying Bitcoin all the way,"" said Liu. ""But clearly there are several use cases that can be built with blockchain and many enterprises are starting to implement them.""
Liu says YGC believes that by solving some of the old enterprise problems with blockchain, they can bring more transaction volumes to the industry than all the consumer efforts have brought in the last several years.
ADVERTISEMENT ""For the Internet, mass adoption of social media and e-commerce came after corporations adopted the technology,"" said Liu. ""We believe blockchain will be similar and we'll let Zuck handle the consumer side since he already has two plus billion users,"" said Liu.
Liu emphasizes that YGC, an enterprise blockchain investment firm, is laser-focused on solving real-world enterprise problems with all the advantages that blockchain has to offer. ""We know that blockchain can cut cost, bring faster transactions, trust and accountability to legacy systems,"" added Liu.
When it comes to investment, Liu said that in 2018, YGC started to explore growth-stage blockchain startups they could bring to enterprises to solve real problems; and then they hit a roadblock.
""Most blockchain startups aren't focusing on enterprises and enterprises can’t work directly with public protocols,"" said Liu. ""So, we saw a need to invest in ventures that could bridge the decentralized public blockchains that desperately need transaction volumes and Fortune 50 enterprises [..] in need of emerging tech to keep them competitive in the market.""
""We’ve seen the industry grow since 2012 and one of our portfolio companies has landed contracts with Department of Homeland Security and Gates Foundation for healthcare data, so we want to take our learnings and scale it with others,"" added Liu. ""We believe the opportunity to invest in SaaS built on blockchain is larger than investing in other software businesses,"" said Liu.
ADVERTISEMENT When it comes to the public's trust of blockchain, Liu says there are a lot of behaviors in the industry that can’t be explained, and there isn't enough public data or transparency.
""The motivations for different parties are all [..] divided,"" said Liu. ""Protocols want transaction volume; many short-term investors want higher valuation and an increase in price; and, exchanges want volatility and publicity so they can drive traffic and make money when the market is up or down. All of the misaligned interest combined with a nascent industry that’s prone to manipulation lead to many institutional investors doubting that the industry is in fact of substance.""
""It’s also difficult for the industry because there haven't been large transaction volumes moving towards public blockchain to solve practical problems,"" adds Liu. ""YGC is changing that. We believe the trend is shifting as familiar names are implementing and exploring public blockchain’s, and we are excited to position YGC as a leader in the space to drive the movement for enterprise adoption of public blockchains. ""
So what's the most significant barrier right now outside of trust?
""We think it’s existing infrastructure not supporting the decentralized ecosystem,"" said Liu. ""There’s a lot of hesitation for using tokens due to regulatory concerns, not enough applications solving real problems with solid business models, and therefore not enough validations and credibility for the entire industry.""
YGC started raising capital for their first fund in 2018 and plans to distribute those funds in 2020, which they hope will fuel the growth of their current ventures focused on enterprise SaaS revenue."
Media Grossly Misinterprets New Home Sales Report - Two Firms Got It Right,www.forbes.com,John S. Tobey,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2019/05/26/media-grossly-misinterprets-new-home-sales-report-two-firms-got-it-right/,"New home sales, the latest indicator of housing market health, show revised upward growth. Year-to-date 2019 sales are 6.6% ahead of 2018. However, that good news appears in only a few media reports. All the rest misinterpret the data, concluding that the results were unexpectedly poor and, therefore, an ominous sign of weakness. Disclosure: Author holds homebuilder, PulteGroup
What the media missed and misunderstood
The flawed reports rely on a couple of numbers while ignoring the significant seasonal adjustment factor changes, the revised data and common sense reasoning. Such superficial analysis is the gateway to flawed conclusions and harmful advice.
Interpreting reports such as new home sales takes time and understanding. The four, primary issues are:
How the raw data is gathered (often by the use of partial surveys that can require revisions in later months as more data is collected) The seasonal adjustment of the raw data (because results can vary by the time of year) - the purpose is to allow comparisons among different periods The annualizing of the seasonally adjusted number - the purpose is to compare with past years and annual forecasts How the reported data fits with other relevant data - to make an investment decision, neither a single month nor one data set provides a reliable indicator The April sales report has complexity
There are two significant items clearly laid out in the May 23 Census Bureau/HUD report, "" Monthly New Residential Sales, April 2019 .""
Revisions to survey results: The actual 2019 monthly sales for January, February and March were all revised upwards, raising the raw data 4.1% for the first quarter from 171,000 (171K) to 178K. Add in April's sales, and the four-month total is 244K, 6.6% higher than 2018's 229K four-month amount. Recalculations of seasonal adjustment back to January 2014: For analysis based on the seasonally adjusted sales, these recalculations altered the seasonally adjusted sales data and growth rates throughout the entire 51-month period. How those changes created false negatives...
Many of the flawed reports relied on the percentage change from March to April. The report showed a decline of 6.9% (723K down to 673K). The explanation was that analysts had expected a drop of only 1.7%, so the ""clear"" conclusion was an negative, ominous surprise.
However...
First, analysts did not forecast a 1.7% drop from March to April. They forecast an April annualized sales rate of 680K. Yes, that was a 1.7% decline from the very good March number of 692K, but, as will be seen, that percentage decline would change because of changes in the numbers that had nothing to do with April's sales. Second, the lower April sales reported (673K), was adversely affected by the changed seasonal adjustment factor. The actual monthly sales of 66K, seasonally adjusted and annualized at the previous April factor, would have produced... wait for it... 685K - better than forecast and down only 1% from the original March sales report. Third, the March sales were significantly revised in the latest report - from 692K to 723K. It was that higher, better number that produced the 6.9% decline number. Fourth, in calculating the March sales of 723K, the new, reduced seasonal adjustment factor was used. If the previous one had been used instead (that is, the one that produced the 692K sales), the revised March sales would have been 733K. So, the seasonal factor change reduced growth by 10K (1.4%). The organizations that got it right
Econoday and Zillow each explained that the 2019 new home sales pattern showed good growth.
Econoday.com - "" New Home Sales ""
Low mortgage rates are having their predictable and very welcome effect on home sales - driving them significantly higher.
Much of the data in April's report are head fakes, indicating slowing following, however, significant strength in prior months. The housing sector, lifted now by the possibility of re-acceleration in prices, is shaping up to be a major positive of the 2019 economy and a possible offset to what perhaps is becoming a slowing year for consumer and business spending.
Zillow.com - “ April New Home Sales: Better Than They Seem .”
While the headline figures are disappointing, this decline in new home sales does not reflect the overall health of the housing market. The strong reading from March greatly exceeded expectations and was revised upward today; without that revision, April’s month-over-month decline would be just 2.7%–and the underlying trend in sales remains strong. Builders are finding ways to deliver homes despite expensive land and labor prices, a boon to buyers thirsty for more supply. Strong builder confidence was borne out by last week’s encouraging home starts figures, which suggest that the supply of new homes is poised for growth. This strength, combined with enduring low mortgage rates and a historically strong job market suggest that today’s reading is just a slight step back in the continued recovery of new home sales.
The bottom line
Author's note: Sorry for all the numbers. Unfortunately, this is one of those flawed analytical times when the misstatements are easy to support, and the accurate results are not.
The best solution is to focus on straightforward analysis. For example, using the 2019 four-month total sales (actual) of 244K, then calculating the 6.6% growth from 2018's 229K amount provides an excellent picture of where new sales stand this year - so far. No need to seasonally adjust similar periods or to inflate them to a pretend annual sales figure. Instead, we can take that information and go look for confirmation from other indicators of housing market health (see "" Housing Market Health? Look At These Five Indicators, Not Existing Home Sales "" for more explanation)."
Deleveraging In China Boosts Investment In Asia-Pacific Real Estate,www.forbes.com,Russell Flannery,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2019/05/26/deleveraging-in-china-boosts-investment-in-asia-pacific-real-estate/,"Real estate investment in the Asia-Pacific rose by 14% in the first quarter of 2019 to $45 billion, helped by deleveraging in China and flows of cross-border capital, according to a report by global real estate consultant JLL. China accounted for close to 40% of Asia-Pacific transaction volumes between January and March. At $17 billion, that was more than double the amount for the same period in 2018, JLL said on Thursday. The increase was helped by the $1.6 billion sale and leaseback agreement between China online retailer JD.com and Singapore sovereign fund GIC, as well as Swiss private equity firm Partners Group’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Beijing’s Dinghao Plaza from Sino Horizon Holdings. JD is led by billionaire Richard Liu; Sino Horizons is controlled by the family of Taiwan billionaire Jason Chang.
“The Chinese government’s focus on deleveraging has impacted the availability of credit for local borrowers and pushed some owners to divest assets in order to reduce debt,” said Stuart Crow, CEO of Asia Pacific Capital Markets at JLL, in a statement. Foreign investment into China accounted for nearly half of its transaction volumes, mostly from Singapore, the U.S. and global private equity firms, JLL said.
Foreign buyers invested $2.6 billion in Shanghai, making it the second largest recipient of cross border capital globally, JLL said. Shenzhen, which is ranked 10th, drew close to US$1 billion in foreign investment.
“We foresee that financial institutions will further accelerate demand and become a major driving force in Shanghai’s leasing market over the next six to 12 months,” Crow said. Shenzhen investors anticipate growth in connection with China’s Greater Bay Area development initiatives, he said.
In other major Asian markets, South Korea investment rose by 28%, JLL said. Singapore, meanwhile, gained 71%, driven by investment across a range of sectors including industrial, hotel and retail.
“Investor interest in Singapore remains high, bolstered by the upbeat outlook for its commercial leasing market,” Crow said. JLL believes transaction volumes this year should surpass last year’s, helped by potential multi-billion dollar deals such as Chevron House, DUO Tower and the US$6.6 billion expansion of Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands.
Elsewhere in the region, Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong experienced a decline in year-on-year investments. Despite the fall in overall volumes, Tokyo remained the most active city in the world in terms of transactions in the first quarter of 2019. Nearly 83% of real estate investments were driven by domestic groups, primarily corporates and J-REITs, JLL said.
Australia’s slowing domestic economy, declining residential prices and uncertainties surrounding the approaching federal elections, dampened investor confidence, leading to a downward trend across a number of industries, including retail, said JLL.
Given the U.S. Federal Reserve’s likely freeze on rate hikes this year, investor sentiment in Hong Kong has rebounded, with buyers purchasing retail assets located beyond traditional core districts, JLL said. A recent notable deal is PAG’s reported $1.5 billion acquisition of Mapletree Bay Point in Kwun Tong from Singapore’s Mapletree Investment, it noted.

GDPR Reminds Us The Best Privacy Laws Were Written Before The Social Media Era,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/26/gdpr-reminds-us-the-best-privacy-laws-were-written-before-the-social-media-era/,"Getty Images. Getty As GDPR turns one, its limitations have become increasingly visible . Permitting Facebook to deploy facial recognition across the EU, exempting most businesses around the world that harvest and mine EU citizens, a failure to take any meaningful action against violations, massive exemptions that cover almost any conceivable behavior: it seems GDPR has been more hype than reality. Indeed, even the European Commission, asked what it sees as the benefits of GDPR, could not come up with an answer. Instead, the few laws that have actually granted some degree of privacy all predate the social media era, reminding us of the futility of attempting to pass privacy legislation today.
The European Union touted GDPR as the ultimate protection against the modern surveillance state, lavishing every announcement about it with hyperbolic claims of total consumer protection.
The reality has been nearly the opposite, rolling back almost every privacy protection that existed prior. Most notably, after years of Europe’s previously tough privacy laws largely prohibiting facial recognition, GDPR granted Facebook the right to deploy the technology continent-wide.
In the US, a once-obscure 2008 Illinois law has rocketed to the forefront of the biometric battle. The Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) has emerged as critical privacy bulwark against social media platforms.
Notably it was passed more than a decade ago, at a time when few Web companies were deploying facial recognition at a global scale. In this regard, it did not face the onslaught of entrenched business interests deploying an army of lobbyists to carve out myriad exemptions for their activities.
Indeed, as Web companies have boarded the biometric bandwagon, Illinois’ law has come under intense pressure, with lawsuits attempting to strike it or carve exemptions and proposed legislation seeking to undermine it.
Today’s privacy laws face little chance of ever reestablishing the protections of their predecessors. The business of data harvesting, mining and manipulation has simply become too entrenched in the very fabric of the Web itself.
At the same time, governments are reluctant to harm the digital masters to which they are increasingly beholden. Even the European Union’s fiery rhetoric has softened of late, with endless calls for breaking up Facebook transformed into conciliatory congratulations and calls for collaboration.
Our digital lives have simply become too valuable for governments to risk trying to protect them from commercialization.
Protecting the privacy of an individual does little for the national economy. Opening the floodgates to allowing that individual to be harvested, mined and manipulated turns each citizen into a cash cow generating revenue that goes back into the economy.
Moreover, it provides governments a one stop shop for surveillance through lawful court orders, outsourcing their needs to private companies.
Our data is simply too valuable to protect anymore.
The few digital protections we will enjoy in the future will come from laws that have not yet been repealed. Though soon enough even laws like Illinois’ will fall.
GDPR reminds us that in the modern surveillance state we call the Web, there will never again be such a thing as “privacy.”
Look beneath the hype and hyperbole to the actual legal wording of any new privacy law and one will quickly see that it rolls back our protections rather than enhances or expands them.
GDPR did not represent a new era of privacy. It rolled back the privacy that existed, bringing American-style surveillance, harvesting and mining to the European continent that had to date managed to preserve its privacy ideals.
Indeed, GDPR so utterly devastated Europe’s privacy rules that almost any imaginable activity is now permitted.
Putting this all together, GDPR stands as a harsh lesson that our data is now too valuable to the global economy for governments to permit us to retain what little privacy we had. The few genuine protections we enjoy come from laws that predate the modern surveillance economy but they are being rapidly rolled back, replaced with new laws like GDPR that promise privacy but in fact revoke it.
In the end, the European Commission perhaps summarized it best. Asked earlier this week what benefit the Commission sees GDPR as actually having provided the citizens of the European Union compared with the privacy they enjoyed before, the Commission answered only with silence.

Kris Bryant Helps Ignite Cubs Offense With Run-Scoring Skill,www.forbes.com,Robert Kuenster,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertkuenster/2019/05/26/kris-bryant-helps-ignite-cubs-offense-with-run-scoring-skill/,"In talking with the great Rickey Henderson some years ago, he was asked among the offensive statistics that flood the MLB game, which stat provides the best reading as to a player’s true worth to his team. Although one might guess that Henderson would indicate stolen bases, since he is the all-time career and single-season record holder in steals with a lifetime total of 1,406 and holds the season mark of 130 in 1982, the Hall of Famer indicated runs scored without hesitation.
Henderson also scored more runs than any other player in the history of the game with 2,295, so he may be biased on what he views as the most valuable stat to measure a player’s worth. But to surpass Henderson’s run scoring mark, a player would have to average 115 runs per season for 20 years . . . that’s incredible.
“Runs scored,” said Henderson, “tells you about a player’s ability to get on base, whether it’s by hits, walks or hit by pitch, and his ability to run around the bases. A big part of my game was running the bases and stealing. Both are a lot harder than they look . . . but are essential in creating runs. A good base runner, once on base, knows how to take advantage and create an edge against the pitcher/catcher and the defense—whether it’s stealing a base, taking an extra base on a hit, going from first to third or scoring from second on a single or from first on a double.”
“I was able to disrupt a pitcher and the opposing defense with my base stealing and running and if you can do that you’re able to score a lot of runs.”
To be a good base runner, a player needs to be smart, aggressive, and have keen instincts on the bags.
Kris Bryant of the Cubs holds all elements that make a player a successive runner and run scorer. He has scored 420 runs in his first 609 major league games—that’s .690 runs per game. Henderson scored .745 runs per game during his 25-year career. Angels All-Star center fielder Mike Trout scored 828 runs in his first 1,113 games for a .744 reading.
“KB is an outstanding baserunner,” said Cubs manager Joe Maddon. “He’s faster than he looks and he hustles on every ball he hits and whenever he’s on the bases. He goes from first to third as well as any player in the game and a lot of his success on the bases is due to his instincts, which are phenomenal.”
Bryant has scored 42 runs in his first 50 games this season which ranks him tied for fourth in the majors behind Cody Bellinger (49) of the Dodgers, Trevor Story (44) of the Rockies, Chirstian Yelich (43) of the Brewers and tied with Mookie Betts of the Red Sox and Nolan Arenado of the Rockies.
In his first four big-league seasons, Bryant scored 87 runs in 151 games in 2015, a league-leading 121 in 155 contests in 2016, a team high 111 in 151 games in 2017 and only 59 runs in 102 games during his injury plagued 2018 campaign.
This season, he is on pace to score more than 130 runs, with a 0.840 runs per game mark through his first 50. The last three Cubs players to cross the plate more than 130 times in a season were Augie Galan (133) in 1935, Billy Williams (137) in 1970, and Sammy Sosa (134) in 1998 and (146) in 2001.
But, the baseball season is a long grind, and scoring 130-plus runs can wreak havoc on a player’s body with the constant quick sprint action and sliding involved in circling the bases. With consistent longball power from Bryant and several teammates, it enables the All-Star third baseman to occasionally trot around the bases.
Bryant is among the league leaders in run scored because he not only uses his power, or benefits from a teammate’s longballs, but he uses his ability to get on base, use his deceptive leg speed and outstanding baserunning instincts.
For his career, Bryant owns a .387 on-base percentage and his 2019 reading is at .405 through May 26. “He gets on base a lot,” Maddon said, “and teams are aware of his speed and his ability to take extra bases, so that can disrupt a pitcher and a defense. Good baserunning is so important to winning ball games and I think we are one of the better teams in the league when it comes to moving our guys around the bases.”
So, if a player owns an almost run-per-game average at season’s end, it will merely be reaffirming their place among the best all-around players in the game today. The players with the highest runs-per-game averages (with a minimum of 40 games played) through May 26 are Anthony Rendon, Nationals (1.025), Cody Bellinger, Dodgers (.942), Christian Yelich, Brewers (.896), George Springer, Astros (.854), Trevor Story, Rockies (.846), Bryant, Cubs (.840), Joey Gallo, Rangers (.826), and Nolan Arenado, Rockies (.824).
If you look over the offensive statistics for all 30 teams in the majors, invariably the most valuable non-pitcher on each team is the one who has scored the most runs.
For Kris Bryant, his value to the Cubs keeps rising.

"Forget iPhone 11, Apple's Next Radical iPhones Revealed",www.forbes.com,Gordon Kelly,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/05/26/apple-new-iphone-11-release-upgrade-iphone-xs-max-xr/,"Worried about Apple’s objectively ugly new iPhone 11 and iPhone XR2 ? You now have a very good reason to skip them.
Left to right: iPhone XR2, iPhone 11 Max, iPhone 11 - renders based on extensive leaks
EverythingApplePro Having attained a leaked report from financial giant Barclays, the ever-excellent MacRumors reveals Apple will bring back Touch ID for its 2020 iPhone. And, in typical Apple-style, it will be late to the in-display reader trend seen this year but deliver a technological leap beyond anything we have experienced so far.
Barclays states that the big differentiator is Apple has developed a method to make the Touch ID sensor fill the whole screen. This means you will be able to unlock this new iPhone by placing your registered fingerprint anywhere on the display. This is a major step forward because in-display readers, unlike their physical predecessors, have no edges to guide your fingertips and their small detection areas make them less intuitive to use.
Furthermore, we shouldn’t be surprised at this breakthrough. Since December, Apple has filed no less than five ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) in-display Touch ID patents, including breakdowns with photography and information that reveals the tech will not just scan your fingerprint but 3D model it .
2020 iPhone concept based on in-display Touch ID leaks
EverythingApplePro Why would Apple reintroduce Touch ID when Face ID is popular? Because the two will work together. Not only does this give users more flexibility, but it will also enable the use of simultaneous dual biometric security which is incredibly hard to crack. A move which aligns perfectly with Apple’s wider vision of iPhones replacing your passport .
In addition to this, Barclays states that Apple’s 2020 iPhones will come with 5G (2019 iPhones miss out) and a potentially game-changing new 3D sensing rear camera system which was expected in the iPhone 11 but missed the cut. Barclays adds a final cherry on top, explaining that all 2020 iPhones will have OLED displays whereas the 2019 iPhone XR2 will be stuck with the low-resolution LCD of its predecessor.
Compare all this news to what Barclays reiterated about Apple’s 2019 iPhone plans: ugly camera hump , a potential 1GB RAM increase for the iPhone XR2 (taking it to 4GB) and the removal of 3D Touch ( one year late ) and there’s little to get excited about.
iPhone XR2 render based on OnLeak's leaked designs
EverythingApplePro Barclays didn’t mention the wider 2020 redesign iPhones are expected to have but, at this point, even Apple’s recent confirmation of its 2019 models shouldn’t set pulses racing. So, unless you’re desperately in need of an upgrade, 2019 iPhones are the year to skip.

Hemmerstoffer was similarly downbeat when asked if the Galaxy Note 10 design was “an improvement or a step back from the S10+?”. He revealed : “It looks bad compared to #GalaxyNote9 rear camera design... IMO at least.”
While the value of a smartphone is obviously more than what’s on the outside, if both Weinbach and Hemmerstoffer are correct (and they usually are), this would be a badly timed error from Samsung. Why? Because Apple’s new iPhones will have an objectively awful camera design and this was Samsung’s chance to capitalise on Apple’s design monstrosity .
Galaxy Note 10 quad cameras concept - reality will look ""much much worse""
ConceptCreator Of course, if you look deeper, the Galaxy Note 10 is still a powerhouse internally with next-gen storage , upgraded RAM and the fastest charging Samsung has ever put into a smartphone. There are also some display changes buyers should appreciate.
Looking for some good news? If the Galaxy Note 10 turns out to be a missed opportunity just wait because it appears Samsung will have a significantly more ‘creative’ smartphone launching soon afterwards.

3 Payment Innovation Trends Will Evolve E-Commerce,www.forbes.com,Jia Wertz,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2019/05/26/3-payment-innovation-trends-that-will-evolve-e-commerce/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Close up hands holding credit card and using mobile smart phone with icon Online shopping, E-Commerce. Getty E-commerce is growing rapidly, with worldwide sales anticipated to be $4 trillion in 2020 . The evolution in e-commerce can be partially credited to the developments within financial technology (fintech), such as e-wallets, new payment options, in-app purchasing, and peer-to-peer lending and payments (like Venmo and even Facebook cash). As consumers have grown increasingly comfortable with online methods of shopping and online payment systems, fintech and payment innovations are making these online transactions much easier and frictionless. Payment systems are growing increasingly secure and efficient, making them attractive for consumers and businesses alike. And, as fintech and other payment innovations evolve, the e-commerce market will continue to evolve with it. Let’s look at three Fintech trends that will continue to evolve the e-commerce industry. 1. Increasing Global Possibilities One of the primary benefits of new payment innovations is that payments can be seamlessly made across borders. PayPal was the first big company that made it possible for the e-commerce to cater to new customer bases by providing the possibilities for global transactions, ushering in all sorts of other payment providers like Transferwise , Transfergo and even Western Union getting into the digital money-transfer game. Thanks to these advancements in payment systems and globalization as a whole, e-commerce companies no longer need to rely solely on their local market to increase sales. And there’s another benefit to the global trend in payment innovations. Fintech benefits emerging markets by offering a secure space to store money for populations who cannot easily access banks. M-Pesa , a company based in Kenya, has a large and expanding user base. It allows individuals to deposit money and to make everyday purchases easily. People who were previously excluded by the formal financial system have found access through the app. 2. Growth Of M-Commerce While payments via mobile apps are nothing new, widespread acceptance of it is. Visa sales through mobile devices have grown 53% faster than sales made on a desktop computer. This opens up the possibility for e-commerce businesses to go mobile. With innovations such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, users can make a purchase easily, safely, and efficiently. As mobile payments get easier, the likelihood of customer “cart abandonment” decreases and e-commerce shops can make more sales. The way payment is made is an important component to customer experience, and fintech has paved the way for an experience rooted in confidence and convenience. 3. Frictionless Experience Through Increased Cost Saving, Efficiency And Accessibility Moore’s Law, the principle that the speed and capability of computers can be expected to double every two years, is not dead. And fintech is a direct example. Thanks to the continued advances in software and chip technology (getting more efficient, smaller, and cost effective), paired with the spike in competition, emerging businesses can now buy financial software packages containing services that otherwise could have cost far more. If payments are easier to make, consumers are more likely to make them. "" Frictionless payments and banking mean faster growth for businesses and better experiences for consumers,” says Kalle Radage, Chief Product Officer at Payfirma , a company that provides all the hardware and software needed to accept payments online and in store. Additionally, fintech is helping e-commerce companies to evolve by increased efficiency and accessibility. “Clients prefer to get everything from one source,” adds Kostas Noreika, Founder of Paysera , a mobile wallet system providing payment services for businesses and individual consumers. Paysera offers its users payment services, affordable currency conversion, and streamlined checkout services for e-commerce companies. This removes many of the barriers towards success for e-commerce businesses. Fintech is changing the way consumers store and spend their money, shaping the future of e-commerce and online financial transactions. Payment innovations make it effortless for consumers to increase spending while also allowing for security, accessibility, convenience, and efficiency. Consumers initially may have been uncomfortable with the prospect of digitally forfeiting their financial information, making e-commerce a less attractive prospect; however, advanced and increasingly secure payment systems have allowed e-commerce businesses to thrive like never before. As fintech innovates further, e-commerce will continue to evolve as well. Jia Wertz Contributor I am the CEO of Studio 15, a socially responsible fashion brand.

"Why Author Marissa Orr Leaned Out Instead Of In, And How You Can, Too",www.forbes.com,Estelle Erasmus,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/estelleerasmus/2019/05/26/why-author-marissa-orr-leaned-out-instead-of-in-and-how-you-can-too/,"Marissa Orr began her Google career over 15 years ago as a founding member of Google’s Sales Operations & Strategy team, after which she worked as Vertical Marketing Manager at Facebook, where she worked for a micromanaging boss who diminished and demeaned her. During that time and since then, she has conducted talks and workshops for thousands of people across the globe. She is author of the new book Lean Out: The Truth About Women, Power, and the Workplace (HarperCollins Leadership, available for preorder ).
Lean Out debunks the philosophy of Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In , that everyone has to be the same in order to be equal. Orr is not alone in her sentiment. In fact, at a promotional stop for her memoir “Becoming,” former First Lady Michelle Obama said, “It’s not always enough to lean in because that s*** doesn’t work.""
In Lean Out , Orr uncovers the truth about women, power and the workplace, and exposes corporate dysfunction as the source of the nation's gender gap, which still hovers at 80%, half a century since the equal pay act.
I asked Orr to break down the messages in her book and provide some insight on what women need to move forward.
EE : After your bad experience with a bad boss at Facebook, what did you decide to do?
MO : I made the decision to take my power back. I asked myself what do I want? Am I in a bad dynamic with this person or am I missing something deeper in my life that is not being fulfilled by these institutions. Leaving (aka being fired) was the biggest gift cause it forced me to do what I wanted to do. I started writing the book and felt empowered and at peace because I was putting the control back into my own hands.”
EE: What will change the culture of the workplace?
MO : Existing power structures are hard to change, because it involves powerful people giving up some of that power and going into the unknown. That's why I think the future of women at work will come from the trend of female entrepreneurs, as they leave the corporate world in larger numbers and create their own enterprises. On Facebook, for example, there are so many groups of women entrepreneurs helping each other.
I think the reason Lean In Circles didn’t work is because most women don’t aspire to occupy the C-or corporate executive level. Research shows that only 18% of women aspire to that. I believe one of the reasons women don’t want those jobs is because raising kids and managing a household squeezes their time, so we lose patience and tolerance for the petty power games and office politics. It becomes more important for work to be meaningful. Empowering women to take ownership and focus on what they can control puts pressure on the system and it has to lead to change. But that won’t happen until we stop mistaking empathy for weakness and realize that female success shouldn’t hinge on us being more like men. ”
EE : What do you mean that success for women hinges on us being more like men?
MO : We need to accept that our institutions in the corporate world were designed by men with their world view, and lots of incentives, rewards and structures cater to that world view. Fewer women at the top is a clear signal that the system is dysfunctional, and it not only results in a lack of diversity, but also crushes creativity and makes organizations slow or unable to adapt. So women need to define success on their own terms. My recommendation is to orient the idea of success around well-being. I want to be a catalyst to empower women in a way that harnesses the power they already have.”
EE : How is your family handling your book coming out?
MO: I’m a single mom with three kids, one who is 10, and the twins are 8. When we had the first early release shipment (the book comes out on June 11) my twins asked if they could bring it to show and tell (I said yes).
In my book, I tried to destroy arguments instead of people. Am I scared of retaliation from Google, FB, Sheryl or the Facebook executive I mention in my book? Well, I told the truth. So, I can sleep well at night.""
I asked Marissa to offer some tips for women who can’t Lean In (because as she says, it doesn’t work), who want to Lean Out instead.
6 Ways Women Can 'Lean Out'
Define success around well-being instead of winning. Well-being can be thought of as the sense that your life is under your own control, that you’re choosing our goals consciously, and that those goals reflect your authentic self. Write your own story. Ask yourself whether you’ve been choosing the direction of your career or following a script of ‘how it’s supposed to be.’ Understand your main character. The greater your s elf-awareness, the greater your ability to know what you need and want from your career. Learn the limitations of your current organization. Accept that many institutions are not equipped to meet your deepest needs. Figure out how to fulfill them on your own. That’s real empowerment. Imagine yourself at 80. The person you are imagining represents your well-being. Talk to your 80 year old self to get perspective about what’s really important. I imagine myself as a person named Doris, wearing a mummu and drinking a glass of scotch. When I imagine her, so much about what I'm worried or stressed about seems so silly from her viewpoint. Choose which stories to believe . Lean Out doesn’t mean quit your job, reduce your ambition, or lower your standards. It means leaning out of anyone else’s story of who you should be, what your career looks like, or how you measure success. Leaning out means rejecting dogma and rhetoric, and defining success on your own terms. For more information on Marissa Orr and Lean Ou t, visit:

"'Billions' Season 4, Episode 10: It's All Work And No Play On 'New Year's Day'",www.forbes.com,Dana Feldman,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2019/05/26/billions-season-4-episode-10-its-all-work-and-no-play-on-new-years-day/,"In the world of Billions, it may be “New Year’s Day” but vacations are cut short and everyone is back at work. As they say, there's no rest for the wicked. Especially when there are intricate plots, secretive cases and dubious defenses to be dealt with. ADVERTISEMENT Wendy (Maggie Siff) is preparing to face off with the medical board in a faux interrogation with Axe (Damian Lewis) and the gang. In order to save her license, she must convince the board that her work with those at Axe Cap isn’t part of her medical practice. Her sessions, she must convey, are performance coaching sessions and Taylor was not a patient, but rather a client. In this scenario, doctor-patient confidentiality isn’t an issue.

Wendy Is Backed Into A Corner:
As Wendy preps for her inquiry with the medical board at Axe Cap, Taylor (Asia Kate Dillon) is also having a meeting of the minds at Mason Capital. In an effort to slay Wendy, Taylor is warned that going up against her former performance coach isn’t risk free. Things can be said and written down about them. Confidential information, once it’s out there, is well, no longer private. Though hellbent on stripping Wendy's license, this could also potentially be a problem for them.
Wendy is in a serious bind: If Taylor was a patient, whatever was discussed is protected, but if Taylor was a client, Wendy is free and clear. To save herself, Wendy must be able to prove Taylor was a client, which also means all other Axe Cappers were also clients and therefore, not protected. This means Wendy could be subpoenaed and forced to testify against Axe if any of the information she’s heard over the years were to ever get out. Realizing this, she tells Axe his best bet would be to fire her. He will not even consider this option. The only way Wendy can win is if Taylor doesn’t show up for the hearing.
As Chuck (Paul Giamatti) advises Wendy to take a deal, Axe is determined to help her win at all costs. Wendy is more interested in Axe’s way of handling things than her husband’s. She won’t publicly admit guilt, give up or give Taylor what they want. “I’m offering you a solution, you’ll only accept a miracle,” Chuck replies in his defense. Let’s not forget that Chuck did, in fact, have a way to get Wendy and Senior (Jeffrey DeMunn) out of their respective messes and he chose vengeance over doing so.

In the midst of all this, Axe gets a very unwanted delivery. When a Picasso painting is delivered on New Year's Day to the office, Axe is aware of the huge tax nightmare to follow. When he's then told 17 more paintings are on the way, he calculates the total cost to be $75 million in sales and usage taxes.
He needs a workaround. He finds the answer: A Freeport; a storage facility at a private airport where valuables purchased overseas can be stored and deemed perpetually in transit so customs duties and sales tax can be avoided.
As it so happens, Danny Margolis (Daniel Cosgrove) bought into one and for a fee, he can house Axe’s paintings on a permanent tax-free basis. Axe really does have friends in some pretty high (and interesting ) places. Danny even suggests storing replicas so Axe can hang the originals.
Taylor Is In A Powerful Position:
In their mock hearing with the Mason Capital gang, Taylor practices convincing the board that Wendy was, in fact, their doctor and everything discussed was expected to be in the strictest of confidence. They've also been quite busy gaining the upper hand in Rebecca (Nina Arianda) and Axe's new company, Saler's.
ADVERTISEMENT Taylor bought up a chunk of an appliance manufacturer that just so happens to be a major supplier of Saler's. This could potentially end up costing them hundreds of millions of dollars.
Dollar Bill (Kelly AuCoin) explains that sales of the appliances from this company account for 63% of Saler’s revenue, which could gut Axe and Rebecca and crush their business. They need a new appliance supplier asap.
Things are also looking up personally for Taylor. However, when it comes to office romances, as much as anyone tries to keep them a secret, it’s usually not a well-kept one. As for Taylor and Lauren (Jade Eshete) thinking their relationship is a secret, Sara (Samantha Mathis) is onto them and lets Taylor know after Mafee (Dan Soder) asks if it’s ok for him to ask Lauren out by company rules. Poor Mafee doesn't stand a chance. He needs to break his pattern of falling for unavailable women in the workplace.
Wags Gets In Touch With His Sensitive Side:
While on holiday in South Beach, Wags (David Costabile) met a young woman and thought she was special. She had an old soul, he tells Wendy. He took her back to his hotel room and she proceeded to rob him of the watch his father left him. He’s left heartbroken for two reasons: He liked her and the watch was of great sentimental value to him.
He was too embarrassed and sad to call the police and the whole experience put a real dent in his faith in humanity. Wendy has the solution and makes a call. When her gift to Wags arrives, a professional cuddler, it’s exactly what he needs. He releases what appears to be a lifetime of tears on her shoulder and the entire office overhears.

Also, hard at work, are Connerty (Toby Leonard Moore) and Sacker (Condola Rashad). The first day of the new year is the perfect time to step up surveillance. In addition to Chuck and Senior’s phones, Connerty needs the judge to sign off on additional wiretaps. Though the judge denies surveillance of Chuck’s office, he does give them access to their residences with a strict stipulation: They cannot bug their bedrooms, just home offices and common living spaces. Oh, and if a lawyer is present, the recording stops, attorney-client privilege and all. Anything non-case-related is off limits. And, they can only pass on what they’re allowed to hear, or as the judge says, their case is on the road to nowhere.
After running into every possible obstacle, Connerty finds a solution in a session with Dr. Gus (Marc Kudisch). The doctor teaches him a life-changing lesson. “Nothing makes you feel the purest version of yourself more than going Kamikaze.” He wants him to make an all-out attack on success and Connerty is ready to do just that.
Connerty seeks out his older brother, who is drunk at a bar and getting into a fight. His brother, we come to learn, is an expert in breaking into safes. After Chuck and Senior lock up important documents that Connerty needs for his case, he asks his brother to help him. Connerty, it seems, is done playing by the rules.

Some bonds simply cannot be broken. When Axe comes back from his vacation to help Wendy prepare her defense for the medical board, she’s beyond thankful. This level of support is more than she’s getting from her own husband. Axe tells her he needs her to win that hearing because he needs her more than anyone else at Axe Cap.
He tells her exactly when he knew she’d be his partner in all this. It was the one time in his life he couldn’t fight for himself and she fought for him. It was right after 9/11 when he said he’d take care of all the survivors and the families of those who didn’t.
He had to find a way to pay for every funeral, put every kid through school and also pay out all the bonuses for the following three years. It was an impossible task and every business advisor told him to shut down his company.
ADVERTISEMENT Wendy recalls the time and remembers that he’d been awake for three weeks straight. Though the time period was such a blur, a few moments stuck out to Axe. At one of the funerals, something happened that he remembers to this day.
At the time, Wendy was on loan to Axe Cap from a sports psyche place she was working at. She was helping Axe through it all and at one of the funerals he was confronted by a group of families who told him he wasn’t getting them all paid fast enough. They attacked his integrity and called him a thief when all he was doing was arguing and scheming just to keep the firm going so that he could give them their money.
Under normal circumstances, he would’ve fought back but in that particular moment, it had all just become too much. Wendy remembers and she understood then as she does now how the grief and the survivor’s guilt and the impossibility of the task had become too much for him to tackle alone.
He remembers just taking it all in when Wendy stepped in between them and Axe and defended him. Now she remembers the entire situation clearly. He recounts every single word she said in that moment to defend him. She made it clear that Axe was their only hope of getting enough money to pay for the rest of their lives. She made them see what he was trying to do for each and every one of them.
ADVERTISEMENT The real moment she proved herself loyal to him was after the funeral as they went to the car. She said, “Bobby, you better f**king deliver for those people, or I won’t just make you quit, I’ll kill you myself.”
It was right then and there that he knew she was his partner in this whole thing for life because she was loyal to him in the face of the world but in private, she held him to account and was loyal to the bigger cause.
Now, he’s here for her and tells her to say whatever it is that she needs to in that hearing to win and he’ll back her to the ends of the Earth. If that doesn’t work, he says she’ll have to go to Taylor, talk to them and ask for their forgiveness.
Wendy Confronts Taylor:
Wendy takes Axe’s advice and pays Taylor a visit. “I am truly sorry…some kind of desire for revenge, or competitiveness, or bloodlust got hold of me and let me go too far. No, I let myself go too far,” she says.
ADVERTISEMENT She then tells Taylor that this is where vengeance leads. “It’s ugly, it’s sickening, and I don’t recommend it to my worst enemy.” Taylor questions Wendy’s apology and says she has to actually ask them not to show up as a personal favor. Wendy breaks and does what she has to do to save herself.
Taylor sees that Wendy is torn up inside and says this hearing is Wendy’s way of reclaiming herself, that she knows right from wrong. “I am not setting you up for defeat. I am giving you a chance to save yourself,” Taylor tells her. Taylor agrees not to attend the hearing. “If you think you should keep your license so you can continue to treat people, tell them why and I won’t be there to tell them any different.”
After saving her career, Wendy tries to save her marriage. She asks Chuck to recall the exact moment he knew he needed to marry her. To her dismay, he doesn't remember. This is just another nail in the coffin of their marriage. Can Chuck redeem himself? Axe certainly did.

FCA And Renault To Announce Global Alliance,www.forbes.com,msn.com,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkiley5/2019/05/26/fca-and-renault-to-announce-global-alliance/,"French automaker Renault is considering a merger proposed by FCA–the parent company of Fiat, Jeep, Chrysler–that would make the combined company the third largest automaker in the world. Under Fiat’s proposal, shareholders of both companies would receive 50 percent of the new company. The combination would have a total value on the stock market of $39 billion. Both companies were in talks for a strategic alliance over the weekend, but those talks evolved to a merger proposal.
FCA said in a statement that it was motivated by “the need to take bold decisions to capture at scale the opportunities created by the transformation of the auto industry in areas like connectivity, electrification and autonomous driving.”
The Renault Grand Scenic
Renault Renault said in a statement that its board will consider FCA's ""friendly offer."" Renault has an alliance with Nissan that is under severe strain at the moment. Renault owns 44% of Nissan and Nissan owns 15% of Renault. But the CEO who architected the alliance, Carlos Ghosn, is in a Japanese jail awaiting trial for alleged financial crimes, and Nissan is bristling under the terms of the alliance while Renault has been digging in on trying to preserve it and maintain control.
A merger of Renault and FCA with the many brands involved would make for the most complex alliance in the history of the auto industry, and will have analysts, experts and veterans of failed mergers chin wagging about whether it will work for months if not years.
There are plenty of reasons on paper to forge a merger. FCA needs a partner to share costs of electric vehicle and autonomous, or (self-driving) vehicles, and would realize huge efficiencies in the building of small cars in Europe and South America. FCA would give Renault a broader and friendlier merger partner than it has right now in Nissan.
Analysts will spend weeks weighing the relative benefits for each company. “Joining the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi in some way makes some sense for the Alliance, but it’s not clear what Renault has that FCA wants other than scale,” says Kristin Dziczek, Vice President of Industry, Labor & Economics at the Center for Automotive Research . Both FCA and Renault have a lot of redundancy in small cars in the European Union and South America with little strength in China, added Dziczek.
Rebecca Lindland of Rebeccadrives.com says FCA and Renault should find ways to achieve economies of scale in a hurry because of the similarities of their product lines in small sedans, hatchbacks, crossovers and small commercial vehicles. “The brands and markets are diverse, many of the customer mindsets are similar: a desire for reliable, durable, value- oriented transportation,” says Lindland. “Working towards a common customer can create economies of scale faster, especially on behind the scene parts like wire harnesses, mechanicals, seat frames, etc. - parts the buyer won't see or can be cosmetically customized…there's a lot of potential upside should this deal materialize.”
The 2020 Jeep Gladiator
FCA The timing of the talks and likely deal coincide with talks Renault is engaged in with Nissan to redefine the terms of the two-decade old alliance between those companies in the wake of the arrest and pending criminal charges against the Alliance CEO Carlos Ghosn.
Ghosn is under arrest in Japan, and faces multiple counts of criminal financial crimes in a forthcoming trial. Ghosn was the architect of the Renault-Nissan alliance deal that began in 1999. And while many point to that alliance as a model, it has been fraught with cultural clashes and enormous difficulty in getting the two companies to agree on platform sharing, which in turns creates enormous savings on R&D and purchasing.
Small cars are not terribly profitable, but necessary in the EU, Latin America and Asia, so FCA and Renault could, in addition to forging a common future around electrification, consolidate expenses and investment in that area. Such efficiencies will result in job losses, but also make the allied companies more competitive with Volkswagen and Japanese and Korean automakers in those markets. Nissan and Mitsubishi have pioneered EV tech with Renault that should be available to FCA under preferred license agreements, and that is worth a great deal because FCA has not been aggressive in developing its own.
How Renault's existing alliance with Nissan would be impacted is not yet clear. Since Ghosn was arrested and subsequently dismissed by both companies, the companies have been negotiating for a new deal that rebalances the influence in Nissan’s favor. By striking a deal with FCA, Renault will have more leverage in those talks. Nissan probably doesn’t want to be without a global alliance partner. On the other hand, if an FCA merger deal causes Renault and Nissan to divorce, then Nissan could seek a new alliance partner. General Motors perhaps?
FCA and Renault purport to save in excess of $3 billion a year in savings. Their target is to hit $10 billion a year in the next decade. FCA's statement says the proposed merger would eventually save $5.6 billion per year, Fiat said. At the same time, Fiat said, the deal would not result in any plant closings. The merger “would create new opportunities for employees of both companies and for other key stakeholders,” Fiat said.
The French government holds a stake in Renault, but thus far favors the deal.
“We must of course see in what conditions it will happen,” French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said Monday. “They must be favorable to the economic and industrial development of Renault and its employees,"" she added. “A merger would also create a needed European giant at a time of fierce competition in the global auto industry,” she said. “Giants have been built outside Europe. We need giants in Europe.”
In the absence of a powerful force of personality like Ghosn, the other X-factor in making this alliance of these companies deliver gains and efficiencies is who will be the tie breaker to settle differences between companies trying to collaborate on vehicles and technology when the teams disagree. Renault and Nissan ran into this problem on several vehicle sharing programs.
For the part of FCA that is the old Chrysler Corp., this deal is yet another chapter of mergers. Jeep, the most valuable brand in the FCA portfolio, was at one time part of American Motors Corp. Back in the 1970s, AMC had a tie-up with Renault that resulted in AMC dealers selling Renault branded vehicles in the U.S. Chrysler then acquired AMC. In the 1990s, Chrysler was acquired by German automaker Daimler Benz, but that merger was unsuccessful, fraught with cultural differences and the inability of Daimler's luxury-focused management to manage Chrysler's mass-market portfolio. Fiat acquired the Chrysler Corp business from venture capitalist Cerberus in 2009 amidst the global financial crisis with help from the U.S. government and United Auto Workers Union.
Automotive mergers and acquisitions have a terrible history of infighting, unrealized dreams, culture clashes and broken careers.
Under Fiat’s proposal, shareholders of Fiat Chrysler would share a dividend of 2.5 billion euros, or $2.8 billion, that reflects the company’s higher value on the stock market. FCA shares are down 25% since February as the company has seen sales in the U.S. drop, and Wall Street has been bearish on the company's outlook in Europe and in the developing EV space.
It is a national holiday in the U.S. U.S., and markets are closed. But Renault shares soared almost 14 percent in Paris trading while Fiat Chrysler shares rose more than 10 percent in Milan.

Besides, isn’t movie theater popcorn $3,000 a pop anyway?

Seventy billion dollars was spent on private planes last year and $60 billion spent on private yachts. If you have every toy in the world, this is the one thing you don’t have—and you can’t get it anywhere else.”

That includes Godzilla: King of the Monsters , The Long Shot , Shazam! , John Wick: Chapter 3-Parabellum , Hellboy , the Elton John biopic Rocketman , and more.

I asked studios, ‘If I could put together a luxury premium service, would you be open to it?’ They were. I’ve always believed there was a luxury product for the movies.”

Getty Here’s how Red Carpet Home Cinema works:
The premium content service is only for individuals (not hotels, resorts, etc.) who satisfy a stringent application process. If approved, they’re required to have an HDMI connection, a static IP address and they must purchase a $15,000, proprietary in-home media server (a.k.a. “the box”) which kicks streaming and buffering to the curb.
Home theaters give the wealthy hassle-free entertainment.
Brandon Arant “Content today is like a five-year old in a toy store—I want what I want, when I want it,” says Rosen.
This isn’t Blockbuster or Netflix. Movies are downloaded directly and securely onto the homeowner’s box for viewing fees ranging from $1,500 to $3,000. Each rental allows members two showings in a 36-hour window.

Getty “If you’re high profile, you can watch a movie with privacy,” says Rosen. “If you work hard on the road all the time, you can conveniently watch when you get home—you probably don’t want to go out to a movie. This can also bring families together because you can watch a movie at home with the kids.”
White glove integrators install the tamper-proof boxes which are automatically shut down if moved. To protect these multibillion and multimillion-dollar film franchises, rules are severely enforced. Members can’t film or duplicate movies, nor charge guests ticket fees.
Many high-profile celebrities prefer the privacy of home theaters.
Jim Bartsch And yes, Red Carpet Home Cinema can tell who’s violating protocols. That means Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Tom Brady, Tom Hiddleston, and Tommy Hilfiger can all watch movies from the privacy of their homes, but there will be no tomfoolery.

Getty “This is a serious business,” says Rosen. “Studios are giving you a $100 million movie to view. The box has a heartbeat. You can’t move it, you can’t hook up any device up to it. If somebody films it, you have liability for the entire movie because it’s digitally watermarked. We would know who’s house did it and we’d shut them off.”
Rosen is a semi-retired, serial entrepreneur. He serves on boards, collaborates on projects, and watches a lot of movies. His movie passion got the best of him in the best possible way—with anticipated profits. His new job spun off from his hobby.

Getty On this day, “Indiana Rosen” chases cups of coffee at The St. Regis Hotel (an appropriate luxurious New York venue). He’s publicizing Red Carpet Home Cinema like actors promote movies. Except he actually means what he says.
His energy, charisma and enthusiasm for movies isn’t caffeine-fueled at all. It’s genuine. Brunch and all types of movies are on the table— Avengers: Endgame (and its sold out theaters), To Kill A Mockingbird (film and Broadway) and Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch , which Rosen considers the best western (if not movie) ever made.

But they’re just two successful veterans who respect the traditional business model of relationships—where a handshake is your word. The game hasn't passed them by.

Our members also love movies. They’re creating a cinema experience in the privacy of their own homes.”"
How Cities Around The World Are Fighting Overtourism,www.forbes.com,Leslie Wu,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliewu/2019/05/26/how-cities-around-the-world-are-fighting-overtourism/,"Years ago, I saw Venice in the still days of January, on a lamentably short stopover returning from the Vicenza gold fair. The air was cold enough to ensure I piled on almost every piece of the ludicrously inadequate business wear I had brought, most of the restaurants were shuttered for the season, and the closest I came to a gondola ride was my water taxi into the city. It was glorious.
I wandered through empty and rapidly darkening streets (aided when I got irrevocably lost by a kindly, and probably much amused, elderly woman returning home). I had whole rooms of St. Mark’s Basilica to contemplate — again, completely alone — for a good 20 minutes at a time.
ADVERTISEMENT Although necessity (and a fair amount of privilege, not to mention circumstance) rather than planning had made these conditions ideal, these days, the Venice experience is very different. An article in the Guardian reports that 2.5 million visitors walk Venice’s storied pathways each year (an illuminating accompanying photo shows a “traffic jam” of wall-to-wall gondolas in a scene that looks more Vegas than Venice.)
Venice city officials have taken strict countermeasures against the overcrowding: restricting cruise ships and visitor numbers in recent years to prevent strain on infrastructure. Now, the city has taken one step further and laid out separate areas for locals and tourists , who will be redirected towards popular attractions and away from Venice’s residential areas (which I innocently wandered through in my lost meanderings). The restrictions were put into place as a new tourism management experiment running only from April 28 to May 1, according to Venice mayor Luigi Brugnaro, but there is the potential that these types of restrictions could become the norm in major tourist sites across Europe and around the globe.
In 2009, when this press photo was taken, The General Confederation of Italian Industry (or Confindustria) was looking for ways to increase declining tourism in Venice. How things have changed. Photo by Giuseppe Aresu/BLOOMBERG NEWS
BLOOMBERG NEWS The idea of “collecting” experiences at major tourist attractions is far from a recent phenomenon. A common concept among the monied elite of the 17th and 18th century, the grand tour (no, not the show with the jovial British jokesters ) allowed travellers to follow a well proscribed path through Europe to ostensibly gain enlightenment and experiences — a practice well parodied by late author Terry Pratchett as “ The Grand Sneer ”. Today’s grand tour is more likely to be undertaken by the phone-wielding photo fiend rather than a flaneur, however, and tourism officials from certain hotspots are responding with a polite “no thanks.”
At a time where more of world stands open and accessible to visitors from around the globe than before, there’s an increasing examination of the responsibility of those tourists to their destinations — and the damage that they can cause. Amsterdam saw 18 million visitors waft through in 2018 (a number that represents more than 50 times the city’s current population, according to CNN .) Netherland officials have formally announced a plan to shift from destination promotion to management, hoping to attract “quality tourists” who add value and aren’t “a nuisance”, as well as directing those travellers to areas other than Amsterdam.
Even New York’s Statue of Liberty is feeling a little crowded, and The National Park Service is restricting commercial private tours (about four per cent, or 250,000 visitors annually, to the iconic site, according to The New York Times). ""Commercial guided tours add to the congestion in these identified areas and prevent the free flow of visitor movement and impact public programs and the visitor experience,"" a representative for the Statue of Liberty Park, a national monument managed by the National Parks System, told CNN Travel .
ADVERTISEMENT Although these restrictions may seem to be a bit of a damper on the idea of global tourism, it actually represents an opportunity — and not just on the part of the traveller looking beyond tourist traps and tropes.
Tourism organizations, smartly recognizing that visitors are often chasing the ephemeral idea of authentic experience within a city, can seize on these chances to create growth for local businesses and fund existing assets. New Zealand’s new International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy, set to start this year , will help address the effects of overtourism (and overzealous hobbit seekers, no doubt).""The authenticity of both natural and cultural experiences in New Zealand, which are the primary reason people come to this country, can be damaged by over-tourism,” said Regina Scheyvens of Massey University to Newshub . “New Zealand as a whole trades on this idea that it’s 100 percent pure, yet some of our beautiful natural places are being spoilt by lack of management."""
AMD Reveals 7nm Radeon RX 5700 Series 'Navi' GPU: RTX 2070 Competitor To Offer PCI-E 4.0,www.forbes.com,Antony Leather,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/05/26/amd-reveals-7nm-radeon-rx-5700-series-navi-gpu-rtx-2070-competitor-to-offer-pci-e-4-0/,"AMD has announced its Navi Radeon GPU range, starting with the RX 5700 and an all-new RDNA 7nm architecture. The new GPU will use an improved compute design that it claims will offer better efficiency and IPC with a multi-level cache hierarchy resulting in reduced latency, higher bandwidth and lower power consumption.
AMD's 7nm Navi-based Radeon RX 5700 will feature faster clock speeds and better efficiency
AMD ADVERTISEMENT Compared with RX Vega, AMD claims Navi offers 25% better performance per clock and 1.5x performance per watt. The GPU will also be the first PCI-E 4.0-enabled gaming GPU, which ties in with the company's new 3rd Gen Ryzen CPUs and X570 motherboards.
Unlike its 3rd Gen Ryzen announcement, AMD has been slightly more tight-lipped here, with no pricing, or other details available for the Navi range just yet. However, availability has been penciled in for July.
AMD's Lisa Su announces the RX 5700 Navi GPU at Computex
AMD In terms of performance, AMD has said it will be comparing the RX 5700 with Nvidia's RTX 2070 and a live-streamed demo during the keynote today claimed a 10% performance advantage for AMD against the RTX card, which matches some rumors that AMD will be aiming to topple Nvidia's second cheapest RTX Turing card, rather than gunning for the RTX 2080 or RTx 2080 Ti.
I'll be reporting from E3 in June where we expect to hear more from AMD on Navi so make sure you follow me using the links below for more news and reviews."
"AMD Reveals 3rd Gen Ryzen 9 3900X: $499, 12-Cores, 4.6GHz With Ryzen 7 And Ryzen 5 Models Too",www.forbes.com,Antony Leather,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/05/26/amd-reveals-3rd-gen-ryzen-9-3900x-499-12-cores-4-6ghz-with-ryzen-7-and-ryzen-5-models-too/,"The wait is over - AMD has shown its cards, revealing the monster 12-core Ryzen 9 3900X, which will cost just $499, plus two eight-core models - the Ryzen 7 3800X and 3700X. From what it claims in terms of performance, the results are that we could be looking at a seismic shift in desktop performance and an end to Intel's reign at the top despite last night's launch of its Core i9-9900KS .
AMD has announced five new 3rd Gen Ryzen CPUs, including the 12-core Ryzen 9 3900X
AMD AMD president and chief executive officer Lisa Su took the stage this morning at Taipei's Computex technology show and revealed three 3rd Gen Ryzen Zen 2 7nm CPUs, which use AMD's 7nm chiplet design. Starting with the Ryzen 9 3900X - this has 12 cores and is so far the flagship of the range, so despite rumors pointing at a 16-core part, it appears that 12 and not 16 cores are the limit for now. It offers 24 threads, uses two Core Chiplet Die's (CCD) to get to 12 cores, sports a massive 70MB cache and can boost up to 4.6GHz. Perhaps the most remarkable feature, though, is that its TDP is only 105W.
Model Cores/Threads TDP (Watts) Boost/Base Freq Total Cache SEP (USD) Availability Ryzen 9 3900X 12/24 105W 4.6/3.8GHz 70MB $499 July 7, 2019 Ryzen 7 3800X 8/16 105W 4.5/3.9 GHz 36 MB $399 July 7, 2019 Ryzen 7 3700X 8/16 65W 4.4/3.6 GHz 36 MB $329 July 7, 2019 Ryzen 5 3600X 6/12 95W 4.4/3.8 GHz 35 MB $249 July 7, 2019 Ryzen 5 3600 6/12 65W 4.2/3.6 GHz 35 MB $199 July 7, 2019
In the benchmarks revealed during the announcement, AMD has made sizeable gains in both multi-threaded and single-threaded performance. The latter has usually been an area that Intel has dominated, but now, AMD is claiming that it matches or betters Intel here.
AMD claims to offer better single and multi-threaded performance compared to equivalent AMD CPUs
AMD The 12-core part is the fastest too, with a boost frequency of 4.6GHz being higher than the next model - the 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7 3800X, which also has half the cache at 36MB. Interestingly, this is something the rumors got right - that the 12-core part would be the one to go for if you want maximum performance in games and thankfully, AMD hasn't seen fit to charge a fortune here either - $499 is the same price as the original Ryzen 7 1800X and clearly a heck of a lot cheaper than the Core i9-9920X.
AMD is claiming a 15% uplift in IPC as well as twice the cache size and floating point performance
Antony Leather The Ryzen 7 models both sport 8 cores and 16 threads a piece, sitting at slightly slower frequencies and 105W and 65W TDPs and retail for $399 and $329 respectively. As expected, there are six-core Ryzen 5 parts too, both with 12 threads and slower frequencies than the flagship Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 9 parts, again with 65W and 95W TDPs. The Ryzen 5 3600 could well prove to be the sweet spot, though, with it set to retail for around $199.
AMD's 12-core Ryzen 9 3900X uses a chiplet design with two 7nm Core Chiplet Dies and one I/O Die
Antony Leather AMD also confirmed support for PCI-E 4.0, which ties in with its new Navi GPU, and I've been told that while motherboard manufacturers are claiming that some X470 motherboards can enable this, AMD isn't recommending it on anything other than X570 motherboards.
Overall it's a hugely impressive lineup for AMD and looking at the numbers, it could well be on course to grab the mainstream desktop CPU crown for the rest of 2019. The fact that there's no 16-core part is a little disappointing, but the evidence for this was of course purely based on rumors. However, it's a long time between now and availability and more announcements are expected in June at E3 so it's still possible that CPU is being finalized and could make an appearance. Even if it doesn't, though, AMD has done what we'd hoped and all signs are that 3rd Gen Ryzen will live up to the hype. I'll be back with more news and eventually reviews of the new CPUs when they land so make sure you follow me at the links below."
Yoenis Cespedes' New Injury Proves The Mets Have Terrible Luck With $100M Contracts--Or Have They?,www.forbes.com,Jerry Beach,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybeach/2019/05/26/yoenis-cespedes-new-injury-proves-the-mets-have-terrible-luck-with-100m-contracts-or-have-they/,"The most pivotal four-game series sweep the Mets have ever enjoyed before Memorial Day was bookended by two versions of the same news dump. Last Monday afternoon, with a roomful of reporters gathered to find out whether or not manager Mickey Callaway was going to be fired after a disastrous weekend sweep at the hands of the torn-apart Marlins, general manager Brodie Van Wagenen prefaced his vote of confidence for Callaway by announcing outfielder Yoenis Cespedes suffered multiple fractures in his right ankle following what Van Wagenen described as a “violent fall” while Cespedes partook in a “non-baseball-related activity.”
The inverse news dump — these almost never happen at the start of a press conference, or even during one — Monday, coupled with the vague wording of Van Wagenen’s announcement, put a forgotten player back into the news cycle, at least temporarily. The Mets were already planning to be without Cespedes for at least the first half of the season due to dual surgeries on his heels.
He’s not in the news cycle or at the front of anyone’s mind anymore, though.
The one-sentence, 27-word release — for those of you keeping track at home, it was “Yoenis Cespedes underwent surgery today at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and is expected to be out for the remainder of the 2019 season.” — issued 23 minutes after the Mets’ third straight late-inning comeback win over the Nationals on Thursday afternoon underscored what was already obvious: Even though his four-year, $110 million contract takes him through the 2020 season, the Mets are done counting on Cespedes, who will turn 34 in October, has dealt with multiple lower body injuries over the last four seasons and will be 20 months removed from his most recent major league game by Opening Day next season. There’s a much better chance he’s played his final game than there is of him contributing to the Mets.
Unfortunately for the Mets, the Thursday portion of this week’s news dump served as a reminder of just how much experience they have with in this department.
A search of one’s Inbox reveals at least nine announcements, none of them good, from the Mets regarding the health of David Wright dating back to 2014. Wright, who signed an eight-year extension worth $138 million following the 2012 season, underwent neck, back and shoulder surgeries and didn’t play in the majors between May 28, 2016 and Sept. 28, 2018, when he made the first of two cameo appearances before negotiating a settlement on the final two years of his deal in January.
And before that, ace left-hander Johan Santana, who signed a six-year extension worth $137.5 million upon being acquired by the Mets in early 2008, missed the 2011 season due to major shoulder surgery. He went under the knife again in the spring of 2013 and never pitched in the majors again.
That’s three players combining for $385.5 million in salary and what, Wright’s late-season goodbye aside, amounts to at least seven missed full seasons due to injury — more than one-third of the length of their contracts. That percentage will rise to almost 50 percent if Cespedes never makes it back.
If you’re sitting there and thinking this sounds like a very Mets thing for the Mets to endure, you’re right. Per Cot’s Baseball Contracts, baseball teams have doled out 85 contracts worth at least $100 million, and only eight other nine-figure players have missed a full season or more due to injury or ineffectiveness. Only the Rockies had multiple such players, and they got out from under the contracts of Troy Tulowitzki and Mike Hampton before those players suffered their serious injuries.
In addition, only two of the other eight players sat out at least one season with the team that signed him to the lucrative contract. Cliff Lee missed the 2015 season with the Phillies due to an elbow injury and subsequently retired. Yankees outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury is signed through 2020 but hasn’t played since 2017 due to various injuries.
In addition to Tulowitzki and Hampton, Prince Fielder and Josh Hamilton each missed at least a season — and eventually had to retire — due to injuries suffered after they were traded by the teams that awarded them a $100 million contract. Carl Crawford and Vernon Wells were signed to their nine-figure deals by the Red Sox and Blue Jays, respectively, but spent the final seasons of those contracts in unofficial retirement after being released by the Dodgers and Yankees.
So the Mets, once again, are in a league of their own. But while the Mets make it easy to throw some scorn and snark their way, the truth is they got much more from their three injured $100 million men than almost anyone else got from players in a similar position. Only Lee, who produced a 2.80 ERA while averaging 222 innings per season in the first three years of his deal, exceeded what the Mets got from Santana, who had a 2.85 ERA from 2008 through 2010 and threw the cathartic first no-hitter in franchise history June 1, 2012.
Wright, who has the highest WAR of any position player in Mets history, was on a Hall of Fame track when he signed his extension and posted an OPS+ of 156 over 112 games in 2013 before the injuries began piling up. He probably wouldn’t have played in a World Series if the Mets didn’t acquire Cespedes at the trade deadline in 2015, when Cespedes blasted 17 homers and produced a .942 OPS in 57 games. Cespedes signed what amounted to a one-year deal following the season and finished in the top 10 in the NL MVP voting in 2016, when he recorded an .884 OPS. Even in limited duty the last two seasons, Cespedes batted .282 with 26 homers and 71 RBIs in 119 games.
Of course, no team wants to spend more than $100 million for flashes of productivity and plaintive ponderings of what might have been, never mind actually do it three times. And there’s little doubt the Mets’ experiences with nine-figure deals probably resulted in delays and additional tensions when it came to negotiating the six-year, $137.5 million deal Jacob deGrom signed in March. Perhaps the fourth time will be the charm, and as it expires, maybe deGrom’s contract will be marked by notable durability instead of news dumps."
Are We Retreating From Algorithms Or Recreating Community?,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/26/are-we-retreating-from-algorithms-or-recreating-community/,"Much has been made about Facebook’s recent embrace of “Groups” and the broader balkanization of our global echo chambers into smaller and more tightly knit communities. Many have argued this shift, to the degree it is genuine, represents a radical redefinition of the online space and what it means to interact with others in the digital sphere. Perhaps a retreat from the algorithmic manipulation and gamification of the informational fire hoses that define general purpose shared spaces. Stepping back, this retreat from the global commons to local community can be seen as a return to the interest-based and geographically-defined community roots upon which societies rested prior to social media’s attempts to rip individuals from their community context and redefine them merely as faceless members of a global whole. Social media’s early days were defined by a desire to globalize society. It was believed that by forcibly ripping people out of the comfort of their local communities with strong ties, geographic proximity and shared interests and dropping them into a raging global fire hose of conversation and discourse, society would instantly come together in shared harmony. Cultural differences, beliefs, narratives and lived experiences would no longer play any role in a world in which everyone was placed into the same virtual room to mingle about and meet others.
Unsurprisingly, this utopian vision collided existentially with the reality that across the world we are not all alike. Most importantly, those differences that define our cultures and lived experiences are not problems to be overcome but rather the societal fabric that defines who we are. Not everyone around the world wishes to dress, act, speak and believe as those in Silicon Valley. Our cultures and beliefs are sacred and defining aspects of who we are.
In place of the globalizing effect of social media, we are seeing a retrenchment back to the community structures that preceded social media. Rather than scream through a megaphone to the planet, we are increasingly turning to platforms that enable us to engage in thoughtful dialog with our friends, neighbors and peers.
Smaller like-minded communities are proliferating even as the shared broadcast spaces that once defined social media are fading .
Many emerging platforms focus specifically on the concept of restoring geographic and professional community, linking neighbors and work colleagues together. Neighborhood communities, which have long bonded us together, have enjoyed a virtual renaissance as a new generation of norms and even entire platforms have arisen to connect local communities.
This migration towards the reestablishment of community reflects the physical world’s dominant influence over the virtual. Much as physical governments have reestablished their control over the virtual world that was supposed to transcend them, so too is the rise of digital community reminding us that society shapes technology even as it is being shaped by it.
We often speak of social media platforms as all-powerful entities capable of redefining the very fabric of human behavior, turning us all into helpless puppets dancing along to the code of Silicon Valley. The reality is that technology, like any tool, evolves in a complex interrelationship with the society that uses it, repurposed and co-opted into new behaviors its designers never anticipated. While social media platforms may encourage certain behaviors, in the end society will harness them to novel ends.
In the context of community, it is not social media platforms nudging us towards community. It is those platforms embracing a trend that has already been underway. In the physical era we moved geographically to locate ourselves in communities we were comfortable in. In the digital era, the shift towards community is restoring the geographic self-identification that has long mediated group construction.
Why does this matter?
It matters because of its impact on trust and the flow of digital falsehoods.
Trust, in short supply in today’s Web, flows from community. We trust our friends, neighbors and work colleagues because we know them, we interact with them and we share ties that raise the cost for them to knowingly share false information with us. In contrast, the anonymity of the open Web’s anarchy means we see only unknown usernames at a distance, lacking any semblance of context, motivations or familiarity through which to evaluate the veracity of the information we receive.
The shift towards community will help restore this inherent trust, providing us context to our information channels and recreating the traditional incentives and disincentives that have historically governed how we filter and verify the veracity of the information before us. Community acts as a form of collective gatekeeper that may help restore the crowd-sourced verification that once acted as a bulwark against the spread of consequential falsehoods.
Of course, community can also enhance the spread of false information, creating insular groups that lack the external knowledge, experience or incredulousness to question the barrage of falsehoods arriving at its borders.
Perhaps the answer then is local community enriched by global informational access. Much as the friendly reference librarian at the public library once served as a gateway to the world of knowledge beyond the local community, so too can technology help contextualize communities in the digital age.
Rather than use technology to forcibly depreciate the role of community, the future of social media might lie in local communities that are supported by algorithms and tools that can help them better understand the context of new information arriving at their doorstep, from its provenance and the motivations of its author to a summary of global perspectives and interpretations of it.
In this way, local community is preserved, while globalization comes in the form of expanded opportunities for voluntary rather than forced connection.
Putting this all together, social media began as a great push to globalize the world but as it has matured over the past decade and a half it is returning to the local community structure that preceded it.
Once again, we see that for every technological advance seeking to forcibly remake the world in its image, it is technology that is reshaped to society’s needs."
All Major U.S. Airlines Commit To UN Climate Plan,www.forbes.com,Jeff McMahon,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2019/05/27/all-major-u-s-airlines-commit-to-un-climate-plan/,"All major United States airlines and most smaller air carriers have voluntarily committed to a climate-mitigation plan that's independent of the Paris Agreement, the Federal Aviation Administration reported last week. ""It’s a lot,"" said Dan Williams, the environmental protection specialist tasked with implementing the program for the FAA. ""It’s more than 97 percent of the total for the international fuel use for operators, and therefore emissions.""
FAA uses international fuel use as the metric for participation, rather than number of airlines, because the program comes from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the UN group that establishes global rules and standards for air travel. Because of ICAO's global influence, said Nancy Young, vice president of environmental affairs for the trade group Airlines for America, most countries also meet its standards for domestic flights.
""They have jurisdiction over flights between countries in terms of those rules, although oftentimes their rules also get picked up on a domestic basis,"" Young said in a webinar hosted by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. ""The application here applies to pretty much every significant aircraft operator whether they're a business jet or a commercial airline.""
The participating U.S. air carriers (listed here ) have all volunteered to participate, Williams said.
""Of the remaining 2-point-something percent that hasn’t volunteered, you’re talking sort of really small charter operators, sort of businesses that have private jets that they fly around, and some of them we assume probably aren’t aware that the program exists.""
While voluntary now, the program is designed to become mandatory after 2027. Very small operators and very small planes are exempted from the scope, as are flights for medical emergencies, disaster responses, and other humanitarian purposes.
The program, called the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), caps emissions at 2020 levels even as air traffic is expected to triple by 2050. Airlines approaching the cap can gain headroom by using sustainable fuels or purchasing offsets through a carbon market.
Since Jan. 1 airlines have been monitoring and reporting their emissions. They will continue to do so in 2020, and ICAO will use that data to set the baseline cap.
A 2020 cap may prove insufficient for a world that needs to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 . But it could buy the airlines time to adopt more fuel-efficient aircraft and await carbon-neutral fuels. The benefits are good enough to get the Environmental Defense Fund on board.
""We're big fans of CORSIA,"" said Kelley Kizzier of EDF. ""If successful it can limit emissions in this fast-growing sector and spur greater ambition in the aviation sector.""
The plan could also catalyze a global carbon market, Kizzier said, which could provide enforcement for emission limits and move money from polluters to innovators. ""As an environmental organization that's why we are interested in markets,"" EDF's Nat Keohane said at the Paris Climate Conference in 2015 , ""because we think they're critical to driving long-run ambition.""
Because ICAO operates outside of the parameters of the Paris Agreement, the CORSIA program is unaffected by President Trump's planned withdrawal (While Trump has announced a withdrawal, the U.S. can't officially withdraw until November 2020, soon after the next election). Trump would find it even more difficult to remove the U.S. from ICAO.
ICAO sets uniform aviation standards that allow airlines to operate in 191 member countries without having to conform to 191 different sets of regulations. For this reason, the airlines themselves favor ICAO and CORSIA, Young said.
""Our position with the administration has been that we’re very pleased that they have authorized going forward with this program,"" Young said. ""Our position has been this is an important thing for operating internationally.""

This Health Insurance Company Tracks Customers' Exercise And Eating Habits Using Big Data And IoT,www.forbes.com,Bernard Marr,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/05/27/this-health-insurance-company-tracks-customers-exercise-and-eating-habits-using-big-data-and-iot/,"If you had the chance to lower your health insurance premiums or to receive incentives for behaving healthily, would you do it? Vitality Health is counting on your answer being “yes.” The company believes the way to revolutionize healthcare is to pay for wellness rather than pay for sickness as traditional insurance companies do. They use technology and data to track—and reward—healthy behavior.
This Health Insurance Company Tracks Customers' Exercise And Eating Habits Using Big Data And IoT
Adobe Stock Owned by Discovery Holdings , a global insurance provider with 4.4 million clients, Vitality Health is the first insurance company to reward people for healthy living. The company offers health and life insurance. The goal of this shared-value system is to improve the health of the insured by providing health insights from data, give rewards for good behavior, and keep premiums and costs low.
Technology and Data-Driven Approach to Promote Healthier Behavior
Technology and data are essential to Vitality’s approach. First, a member’s baseline health is assessed by taking into consideration lifestyle behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and eating habits along with biometric measures including height, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. From this data, the member's Vitality Age is determined; in the United States, 79% of people surveyed have a higher Vitality Age than their biological age .
Next, Vitality creates a Personal Pathway plan for each member to improve their Vitality Age by using the data collected in the assessment and determining a personalized plan to making healthier choices. The company provides tools, resources, and partners that offer discounted services to Vitality members to support their health journey.
By using integrated data feeds from its partners including its network gyms, biometric screening service providers plus more than 100 wearable technologies including the Apple Watch, Vitality can check a member’s progress toward the established health goals in real time. For example, Apple Health from the Apple Watch can connect to the Vitality Member app , that allows members to set up video consultations with a GP, schedule appointments, get referrals to specialists and find trusted health information. By doing so, members can earn Vitality Points for how many steps they take and the heart rate information from workouts their Apple Watch tracks.
The Vitality Points reward system for healthy behavior is an essential element in Vitality Health's service. It's designed to keep members engaged, and at this point, it's completely voluntary to participate. These points can be redeemed for gift certificates and other perks through Vitality’s partners . Not only do these partners provide service and products that support a healthier lifestyle, but Vitality Health members can also save money when they use these providers. For example, Vitality Health partner Ocado offers participants of particular Vitality Health healthcare plans a 25% discount and free delivery on healthy food. The healthier your lifestyle, the bigger rewards you receive as a member of Vitality Health.
Does Vitality Health’s System Work?
Since Vitality Health is a pioneer with this type of health insurance model, you might wonder, does this actually work? According to a study conducted by RAND Europe , it does. The study found that incentivizing physical activity such as Vitality Health does can lead to better activity levels. The Vitality Activity Rewards system, used by 5 million people globally, is grounded in behavioral science that includes micro goals and rewards as motivation to help change and maintain positive behavior.
The company asserts that its incentive-based solution can lead to significant reductions in hospital admission costs and costs per patient as well as shorter hospital stays. McKesson, one of Vitality Health’s customers , had these results:
 $4.7 million in medical cost savings 23% increase in verified workouts 92% increase in engaged participation levels The data Vitality Health collects also allows it to better price out policies and premium adjustments based on a member’s engagement with the program.
Next Steps for Data Analytics to Promote Healthy Lifestyles
As other insurance providers determine ways to use data and technology to help them provide incentives for healthy behavior, Vitality Health will face increased competition. Vitality Health and others in the space will look to expand health monitoring technology and grapple with other concerns such as privacy, how to deal with biological differences that make some members predisposed to being healthier or experience better outcomes than others for similar activity, and more."
Want To Increase Engagement At Work? Here's An Accessible & Effective Way,www.forbes.com,Carley Sime,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carleysime/2019/05/27/want-to-increase-engagement-at-work-heres-an-accessible-effective-way/,"The importance of employee engagement is no secret. Research consistently shows that engaged employees produce better business outcomes. A study by Gallup showed that businesses/business units with highly engaged employees have:
41% reduction in absenteeism 17% increase in productivity 10% increase in customer ratings 20% increase in sales 21% greater profitability In high turnover* organizations they have 24% less employee turnover in highly engaged business units.
In low turnover** organizations with highly engaged business units, this number increases to 59% less employee turnover.
Employee engagement is also important not only in terms of business outcomes but also for the wellbeing of the employees themselves. When employees are highly engaged they are more likely to form strong bonds with their workmates, be intrinsically motivated and experience meaning in their work. A result of this is increased levels of subjective wellbeing —how people experience the quality of their lives .
Even if we take all of these figures with a grain of salt they are still highly appealing. However, 51% of the U.S workforce isn’t engaged according to Gallup’s report exploring the State of the American Workplace . They categorized this 51% of employees as neither liking or disliking their jobs. So how can we increase engagement?
The overarching principles revolve around:
Having clarity of expectations within organizations Creating a culture of engagement from the top down meaning leaders prioritize engagement and are themselves engaged Investing in employee and managerial development and training Clear, open and consistent channels of communication How an organization does this is part of a far, far bigger conversation that can’t be covered here. If you want an accessible and easily actionable way to start increasing engagement through, you can start with strengths. There is a really strong connection between employees who know of and are able to apply their personal strengths in the workplace and their levels of engagement. When there is insufficient or non-existent strength based conversations or development it hinders performance and engagement. Ultimately this also negatively affects the organization too.
By identifying your own strengths or supporting your employees to identify their own strengths you are in a better position to start working with them. When we work with our strengths or when our managers weave in character strength exercises and learning our engagement, productivity and happiness often increase . You can use the VIA character strengths survey to identify strengths, it’s a free and highly regarded measure that anyone can use. You can then open up a dialogue around strengths, explore where they are and aren’t being used and find ways to better utilize significant strengths. You can also support your employees or look for ways you yourself can develop weaker strengths too as a way to engage in and support personal development.
*High turnover organizations are those with more than 40%annualized turnover
**Low turnover organizations are those with less than 40%annualized turnover"
"Huawei's CEO Talks Trump, Apple And Whether His Company Can Still Survive",www.forbes.com,Zak Doffman,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/05/27/huaweis-ceo-talks-trump-apple-and-whether-his-company-can-still-survive/,"At the end of a hellish week for Huawei, founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei was part defiant and part humble in an interview with Bloomberg that was released on Sunday. Ren went further than before in admitting that U.S. sanctions against his company have bitten hard, with core parts of his company's supply chain withdrawing support for new products and devices. President Donald Trump has singled out Huawei as the 'poster child' in its ongoing trade battle with China, a conflict that has become a heady mix of national security fears and accusations of IP theft and Xinjiang human rights abuses. For a year, the U.S. has cajoled and threatened countries around the world as it has sought to reverse Huawei's dominant position.
Unsurprisingly, Ren did not hold back on his views of the U.S. President, describing Trump's tweets as ""laughable"" and ""self-contradictory,"" and saying ""there is no need for negotiation, I will ignore Trump and if he calls me I may not answer.""
On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal published a detailed article on ""Huawei's yearslong rise [being] littered with accusations of theft and dubious ethics... suggest[ing] Huawei had a corporate culture that blurred the boundary between competitive achievement and ethically dubious methods of pursuing it.""
Ren dismissed the accusations of IP theft, claiming ""it is more likely [the U.S.] will steal our technology given we are ahead. If we were behind, Trump would not need to make so many efforts to attack us… He attacks us because we are now more advanced.""
As regards the U.S. sanctions that have seen Google, Qualcomm, Microsoft and ARM, as well as industry bodies, suspending ties, Ren said ""the U.S. is not the international police, they can’t manage the whole world,"" adding that ""the U.S. has never bought products from us… even if the U.S. wants to buy products from us in the future, I may not sell to them.""
Ren used a broken plane analogy to describe the impact the supply chain restrictions are having on Huawei. ""If some companies don’t want to work us, it's like a hole in the airplane. We are working to fix the hole but the airplane is still able to fly... We might have contingency plans for the core of the airplane… but we might not for the wings. We need to review the situation and fix those problems."" Asked if this could mean Huawei's self-claimed two to three year lead on 5G could be eroded, he said: ""Definitely.""
The most headline-grabbing news of the last week has been the impact that sanctions targeting Huawei's 5G networking business could have on the fast-growth consumer business. Smartphone sales were the primary driver of Huawei's growth last year and it has now overtaken Apple to take the world's number two spot after Samsung.
Here, Ren said the company ""might miss our expected growth target, but we’re still growing. Being able to grow in the toughest battle environment, that just reflects how great we are.""
It is clear that China will need to respond to protect its flagship telecoms brand. Asked what his view would if this included reciprocal action against Apple, Ren said he would protest such a move, lauding Apple as the industry's innovator. ""Apple is the world's leading company… Apple is my teacher, it is advancing in front of us,"" he said.
In this interview, Ren was markedly less bullish that he had been a week ago, when he claimed the U.S. ban would not impact his company's plans, with rivals ""at least two to three years behind.""
A week of headlines later, Ren softened the rhetoric, ""we can become bigger or smaller,"" he said. ""We are not a public company. We are not only pursuing growth and profit. It's good enough for us to just survive... You can come back to interview us in two or three years and see if we still exist. If we’re gone in two or three years, please remember to bring a flower and put it on our grave."""
"Scientists Discover The Loneliest, Most Isolated Galaxy In The Entire Universe",www.forbes.com,Ethan Siegel,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/05/27/scientists-discover-the-loneliest-most-isolated-galaxy-in-the-entire-universe/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Science The Universe is out there, waiting for you to discover it. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin The galaxy shown at the center of the image here, MCG+01-02-015, is a barred spiral galaxy located inside a great cosmic void. It is so isolated that if humanity were located in this galaxy instead of our own and developed astronomy at the same rate, we wouldn't have detected the first galaxy beyond our own until the 1960s. ESA/Hubble & NASA and N. Gorin (STScI); Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt Our corner of the Universe was gifted with a plethora of bright, nearby galaxies to light our way through the cosmos. The Large (top right) and Small (lower left) Magellanic Clouds are visible in the southern skies, and helped guide Magellan on his famous voyage some 500 years ago. In reality, the LMC is located some 160-165,000 light-years away, with the SMC slightly farther away at 198,000 light-years distant. Along with Triangulum and Andromeda, these four galaxies beyond our own are visible to the naked human eye. ESO/S. Brunier
The spirals and ellipticals in our backyard showed us, a century ago, that the Milky Way wasn't alone. This sketch from the mid-1840s is the first ever one to reveal the spiral structure of any nebula in the night sky. Now known to be a spiral galaxy, Messier 51, the Whirlpool Galaxy, is one of the most well-studied galaxies beyond our Milky Way. WILLIAM PARSONS, 3RD EARL OF ROSSE (LORD ROSSE)
Even earlier astronomers still had copious bright galaxies they could observe with their telescopes. A selection of approximately 2% of the galaxies in the Virgo cluster. There are approximately 1,000 large galaxies in the Virgo cluster, a large fraction of which were discovered way back in the 18th century. The Virgo cluster is located some 50-60 million light-years away from our Milky Way, and is the largest concentration of galaxies in the extremely nearby Universe. John Bowles of flickr
By measuring the speeds and distances of these galaxies, we discovered the expanding Universe. The 'raisin bread' model of the expanding Universe, where relative distances increase as the space (dough) expands. The farther away any two raisin are from one another, the greater the observed redshift will be by time the light is received. The redshift-distance relation predicted by the expanding Universe is borne out in observations, and has been consistent with what's been known all the way back since the 1920s. NASA / WMAP Science Team
Without them, we might never have understood our cosmic origins: the hot Big Bang. A visual history of the expanding Universe includes the hot, dense state known as the Big Bang and the growth and formation of structure subsequently. The full suite of data, including the observations of the light elements and the cosmic microwave background, leaves only the Big Bang as a valid explanation for all we see. As the Universe expands, it also cools, enabling ions, neutral atoms, and eventually molecules, gas clouds, stars, and finally galaxies to form. NASA / CXC / M. Weiss
Unfortunately, not every observer in the Universe gets so lucky. Streams of dark matter drive the clustering of galaxies and the formation of large-scale structure, as shown in this KIPAC/Stanford simulation. While the locations where stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies emerge are most notable, the enormous cosmic voids separating the matter-rich structures are just as important to understanding our Universe. O. Hahn and T. Abel (simulation); Ralf Kaehler (visualization)
Most galaxies clump together in groups, clusters, or along filaments, but some reside in underdense regions. This figure shows the relative attractive and repulsive effects of overdense and underdense regions on the Milky Way. Note that, despite the large number of galaxies clumped and clustered nearby, there are also large regions that have extremely few galaxies: cosmic voids. While we have a few substantial ones nearby, there are even larger and lower-density voids found in the distant Universe. Yehuda Hoffman, Daniel Pomarède, R. Brent Tully, and Hélène Courtois, Nature Astronomy 1, 0036 (2017)
The Universe's large-scale structure contains great cosmic voids as well as overdense clumps. A region of space devoid of matter in our galaxy reveals the Universe beyond, where every point is a distant galaxy. The cluster/void structure can be seen very clearly. If we were to live in an extremely underdense/void region, we might not have discovered a single galaxy beyond our own until our astronomical tools advanced to near-modern standards. ESA/Herschel/SPIRE/HerMES
In these extremely underdense regions, however, galaxies still occasionally form. Although it's relatively nearby at just 293 million light-years away, the galaxy MCG+01-02-015 has no other galaxies surrounding it for approximately 100 million light-years in all directions. To the best of our knowledge, it's the loneliest galaxy in the Universe. ESA/Hubble & NASA and N. Gorin (STScI); Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt Although a long-exposure, deep image of MCG+01-02-015 appears to show many other galaxies in its vicinity, most are far more distant (and a few are closer), but none are within 100 million light-years of the major galaxy itself. ESA/Hubble & NASA and N. Gorin (STScI); Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt
In all directions, we find no other galaxies within 100 million light-years of it. In between the great clusters and filaments of the Universe are great cosmic voids, some of which can span hundreds of millions of light-years in diameter. While some voids are larger in extent than others, the void that houses MCG+01-02-015 is special because it is so low in density that, rather than having only a few galaxies, it only contains this one known galaxy at all. It is possible, however, that small, low surface brightness galaxies exist in this region after all. Andrew Z. Colvin (cropped by Zeryphex) / Wikimedia Commons
If we had grown up there, our telescopes would not have observed other galaxies until the 1960s. Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei's promising work on infrared astronomy culminated in the discovery of galaxies — like Maffei 1 and 2, shown here — in the plane of the Milky Way itself. Maffei 1, the giant elliptical galaxy at the lower left, is the closest giant elliptical to the Milky Way, yet went undiscovered until 1967. Technology would have needed to advance to approximately these levels to detect a single galaxy beyond MCG+01-02-15. WISE mission; NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA
Perhaps we are truly fortunate: our serendipitous position in the Universe allowed us to understand it. The various galaxies of the Virgo Supercluster, grouped and clustered together. On the largest scales, the Universe is uniform, but as you look to galaxy or cluster scales, overdense and underdense regions dominate. The full extent of this illustration, which maps out the nearby galaxies to the Milky Way (with us at the center), would have exactly one galaxy in it, MCG+01-02-015, if it were centered on the loneliest galaxy known in the Universe today.

EU Elections: Key Takeaways from Central Europe,www.forbes.com,Frantisek Markovic,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/frantisekmarkovic/2019/05/27/eu-elections-key-takeaways-from-central-europe/,"Europe of Nation States in Fragmented European Parliament If you are a bit less like me (a political enthusiast of sorts) and a bit more like Brenda from Bristol (whose artless exasperation with elections captured the mood of the British nation in 2017), the chances are you woke up this morning having failed to take much notice of the European elections. If so, then do not despair. You are not alone. In fact, only about half of those entitled to vote chose to cast a ballot.
Indeed, the turnout is estimated to reach a little over 50% across the EU, which is much higher than previously anticipated and higher than five years ago when the participation was only 42%. But it is hardly a cause for celebration. Some countries, despite improvements, still continue to significantly lag in turnout behind the rest of Europe, undermining the legitimacy of the Parliament itself.
While it is still too early to be jumping into sweeping conclusions, there are a number of points that can already be drawn. Here is a rundown of some takeaways from the European elections from the Visegrád countries of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.
Poland: a symbolic political battlefield over the future of Europe
On the whole, no big surprises were pulled in Central Europe but perhaps the most consequential result for the rest of Europe comes from Poland:
Poland has long become a symbolic political battlefield over the future of Europe but the EU election campaign was largely dominated by domestic issues such as social spending and healthcare. The victory of the conservative ruling PiS party (which secured 43% of the vote) is a blow to the European Coalition (with 38%), which was led by the pro-EU Civic Platform. The battle of two Europes–the one of nation states and the one of further integration–knows its victor. The high turnout of 43% did not help the European Coalition despite the initial predictions to the contrary. The EU elections were perceived as a referendum on the current government and the failure to win the election will put further strain on the European Coalition in the upcoming presidential and national parliamentary elections. It also remains to be seen whether the Council President Donald Tusk will attempt for a (much discussed) domestic political comeback in light of these results. Czech Republic: a contest of national interests
The political campaign in the Czech Republic was largely uninspiring and without much of substance. The few issues that were discussed had a common denominator: who is going to best defend the country’s national interests in Brussels?
The Czech Republic is traditionally a Eurorealist country and the Czechs have never been as pro-EU as their Polish and Slovak neighbors. The recent Euro and migrant crises have further solidified the careful and measured stance towards the EU. Most of the topics discussed during the campaign were perceived from the purely national perspective. One such issue concerned the double standards of food quality – an issue that greatly resonates in the Czech Republic and one that the EU has recently tried to rectify (albeit with notable limitations). The EU election results have confirmed that the governing party of the self-styled Prime Minister and billionaire, Andrej Babiš is here to stay. Currently investigated by the EU auditors for conflict of interest with regards to EU funds, and with the possibility of a similar investigation being undertaken back home, Babiš will continue to put ALDE–of which his party is, for now, still a member–in an awkward position. Slovakia: change is a double-edged sword
Slovakia is traditionally a more pro-EU country, but it systematically shows the lowest turnout levels across the EU. While up by 9% from 2014, 22% is still the lowest of the entire EU bloc. Nevertheless, the campaign in Slovakia was visibly charged with and reflective of the recent political events that followed the murder of a journalist and his fiancé last year.
In Slovakia the pro-EU coalition topped the polls while the governing Socialists came in second and for the first time since 2002 did not win a major national election. Following the murder of the journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancé in early 2018, the country has seen a major shift away from the mainstream parties towards both progressive and pro-EU as well as anti-system, extremist parties. The desire for change and the resentment towards the existing system, therefore, manifests itself through two opposing poles of the political spectrum, which both, interestingly enough show high support among the young voters. Hungary: Orbán’s crusade reinforced by the EU election results
When it comes to Hungary, any comparison to other EU state, even to Poland, which is often mentioned in the same breath by EU officials, is doomed to failure. Hungary is unique in many regards and the hold of Viktor Orbán on politics in his country is unparalleled.
To put it simply, not much has changed in Hungary after these EU elections. The dominant position of Fidesz has been solidified by the party’s performance with a whopping 56% of the votes. This will give ample opportunities for its leader, Viktor Orbán to continue to punch above his weight in Brussels. Much of Orbán’s position at the EU level will depend, however, on his ability to leverage his success. Given that the EPP is currently in no position to be undermining its significantly weakened strength by excluding the 13 Fidesz MEPs–despite having recently symbolically suspended their membership–there is a chance Orbán will continue to hold the EPP hostage for a while longer. Fragmented Parliament as an opportunity
The European Parliament Hemicycle in Strasbourg
Diliff Wikipedia With the two main center-right and center-left factions losing their majority, for the first time in 40 years, the European Parliament is potentially entering a new period of paralysis of indecision. This comes at the time when it will be under growing pressure to take a stance on numerous issues including the next EU budget, Brexit as well as the general future direction of the EU.
While fragmentation allows smaller states and factions to make more of a difference–as they can play kingmakers–this will also require a more mature form of democracy dependant on the ability to negotiate across the political spectrum. Those delegations and parties that will come prepared with a positive agenda will be better placed to get things done. The fundamental question, however, is, whether new MEPs will even wish for things to be done in the first place. Or whether their agenda is purely to block things. Only time will tell how pro-active and functioning the next Parliament will be. And time will also tell what role the Visegrád MEPs will play in shaping the next five years of EU politics."
Can Cricket World Cup Hosts England Handle The Favoritism Tag And Break Their Hoodoo?,www.forbes.com,Tristan Lavalette,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlavalette/2019/05/27/can-cricket-world-cup-hosts-england-handle-the-favoritism-tag-and-break-their-hoodoo/,"Jubilant Bangladeshi players were sprawled on the pristine Adelaide Oval turf. Players piled on top of each other. The picturesque ground – rated the prettiest in Australia – had become an echo chamber of hollering from the team celebrating a famous World Cup victory. Heads bowed, staring blankly, England’s humiliated players looked on as if they had collectively seen a ghost. Their 2015 World Cup campaign had ended at the Group Stage in familiar embarrassment. Their enthusiastic supporters – including a dedicated group called ‘The Barmy Army’ – couldn’t quite believe they had traveled so far only to endure this pitiful ending.
England had once again suffered on cricket’s biggest stage.
But this bitter defeat proved a defining moment for England’s One-Day International (ODI) team. Heads soon rolled . Trevor Bayliss, a straight-shooting Australian, was then hired as coach with a key objective to lift England’s dire ODI record.

Getty England cricket chiefs were determined for the team to be a genuine contender by the next World Cup on home soil. For the first time, there was far greater urgency over their ODI fortunes and it even appeared that the format had priority over the sanctity of Test cricket – so treasured in the U.K.
It was time for England to be taken seriously in 50-over cricket. The powerbrokers had tired of them being brandied as a World Cup loser and a never ending punch line. They were sick of England’s lethargy in ODIs – when they played as if stuck in a bygone era.
They always seemed a decade behind the trends. The team was flat and uninspiring. Or simply just plain boring.
Things can change in four years. Ahead of the World Cup starting on May 30, world No.1 England are the hot favorites. No one could have envisioned this four years ago after that debacle in Adelaide. Through Bayliss’ aggressive blueprint, England have developed a nastier version of Australia’s high-octane batting order that propelled them to the 2015 World Cup title.
England have become trendsetters through a deep reservoir of firepower which essentially does not waver throughout an entirety of an innings. It’s like they have cracked a cheat code in a video game, toying with their rudderless opponents at will. They have a slew of players who can turn a match in minutes. Odds are at least one of them will.
In Jos Buttler, England have the most audacious batsman in the world who plays trick shots with ridiculous ease. Such his ability to smash an endless array of boundaries that seemingly defy physics, he has unnerved bowlers who feel absolutely clueless where to bowl. It’s a bit like Stephen Curry hypnotizing defenders due to his unparalleled shooting range.

Getty England, however, are far from being a one-man batting machine. Rounding out their riches, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy and Ben Stokes can almost match Buttler’s power while Joe Root and captain Eoin Morgan provide composure but are no slouches either.
There has never been such a mind-bending batting lineup like this. No score – and chase - seems beyond them. They make grounds seem minuscule such the regularity of balls being smashed into the terraces.
Much of their success is based on this unparalleled hitting, but England have enough quality bowlers to ensure opponents are kept on a tight enough leash. And the confidence instilled from the batsmen allows bowlers – particularly leg-spinner Adil Rashid – with more leeway to be adventurous.
Still, it’s hard to forget the ghosts of the past when you knew an England meltdown was coming.
England’s lack of success in sports has been well mocked over the years. But it’s in cricket’s biggest tournament where they have truly underachieved – ironically since cricket is considered the quintessential British sport.
Unlike in the soccer and rugby union counterparts, England have never won the World Cup (although they have won cricket’s T20 World Cup). It is a wretched history. Three runners-up finishes is honorable, but the last was in 1992.
Since then, England have not made it to the semi-finals and embarrassingly exited at the group stage three times with the nadir being in 2015 with a dull team that was on life support from the get go.
This is new terrain. Anything other than victory would feel like a disappointment. The pressure on them to finally break their hoodoo will be suffocating. The normally gloomy and pessimistic England fans genuinely believe something special is ahead. And with good reason.
England cricket fans have genuine reason to be optimistic ahead of the World Cup. (Photo by Jason O'Brien/PA Images via Getty Images)
Getty This is supposed to be cricket’s summer in the UK. Cricket, unlike in Australia, does not own the British sports summer. Every couple of years a major soccer tournament hogs the attention. Wimbledon, of course, dominates in late June-July and there is always something else going on.
If England win the World Cup – and double up in the subsequent Ashes series – then cricket will almost certainly have truly captured the public’s imagination for the first time since 2005 when England broke their Ashes drought in a series for the ages .
If Morgan holds the trophy aloft on July 14, a success-starved nation will celebrate. England’s players will be national heroes and feted forever. It will also double as a timely distraction from the seemingly never ending political turmoil engulfing the U.K.
An entire country can almost taste the euphoria.
Almost."
We Flew United Premium Plus to Japan: Here's What Happened,www.forbes.com,Jeanne Croteau,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannecroteau/2019/05/27/we-flew-united-premium-plus-to-japan-heres-what-happened/,"Getty When my daughter and I booked our trip to Osaka, Japan back in November, United Premium Plus wasn’t an option. In fact, despite being a regular United flier, I didn’t even know it existed. Surprised to learn about this new seating option on the airline, I made sure to document the unexpected experience so I could share my insight.
How We Ended Up in Premium Plus
There’s a lot to this story, but for simplicity’s sake I’ll start with the weather-related delay that impacted our flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to San Francisco (SFO). Despite asking to be rebooked every time our flight was delayed (three times), we were denied and told not to worry because there were more than ten passengers and that the connecting flight would probably hold the plane for us.
When we finally landed in SFO for our flight to Osaka, we all hit the ground running. We made it to the gate and the plane was still there, but despite the fact that eleven of us had seats, they had closed the gate after waiting only a few minutes. With very little offered in the way of support, we were told to go to a different gate for help. At that time, we all received emails and text messages on our phones reminding us to board our flight to Hong Kong!
Exhausted, confused and frustrated, we meandered around from gate to gate asking for help until we found a flight that was leaving for Tokyo (NRT). Seeing this group of eleven stranded passengers, all of whom had been rebooked for Hong Kong without consultation, they held the plane and left 44 minutes late in order to accommodate us. We had been an angry, emotional mob when we got to the counter, but we all boarded gratefully.
Knowing we would at least make it to Japan, I apologized for my frustration as my daughter and I were given our boarding passes. We weren’t going to our original destination (we’d have to fly to Tokyo, then fly to Itami before catching a bus and a train!), but at least we weren’t going to Hong Kong! As we settled into our seat at the very back of economy, one very kind desk agent got on the flight and moved us to Premium Plus. After a very rough start to our trip, this gesture meant a lot.
The Seats
You’ll have more space in Premium Plus than in economy, for sure! The seats are wider and offer more leg room. In fact, they recline more than an Economy seat and have foot and leg rests for added comfort. Both very happy with this aspect of the flight, my daughter decided to get some much-needed rest while I purchased in-flight Wi-Fi to try to contact family and let them know what was happening.
Jeanne Croteau One major issue with my seat, though, was where it was situated on the plane. It seemed that my location, which was right in front of a bathroom (one shared by coach and Premium Plus, a definite drawback), stuck out more than most and was hit by just about everything (cart, people, luggage) constantly.
Even when I tried to nap, I couldn’t because something was always jostling me or people were leaning against my seat as they waited for the bathroom to become vacant. While I was willing to ignore this annoyance because I was grateful to be on the flight at all, my seat position created another problem that lingered for days.
When the flight attendants were rolling out the drink cart towards the end of the flight, they once again hit my chair. This time, it was hard enough that it knocked the coffee carafe off of the cart and onto my hand! Fortunately, the hot coffee didn’t spill much, but the full weight of the container hit my knuckles and wrist and it immediately started bruising and swelling. After being given ice, I was offered a small credit for the inconvenience, though!
Food and Drink Options
We were provided a menu when we were seated and it detailed all of the items we’d be offered during the long-haul flight. We also had access to unlimited snacks and beverages (including alcohol). We loved the fact that the food reflected our destination and when I saw pork katsu on the menu, I was excited! Sadly, by the time they got to my seat, that option was no longer available (we got the ravioli instead — it was good!).
Jeanne Croteau Everything was served hot and on real plates, so we had zero complaints. In fact, I was rather impressed by the food service on our flight. This was definitely one of the perks of flying Premium Plus!
The Extras
We were provided with slippers which we put on immediately; having been running around airports all day, it felt good to let our feet rest for a while. Inside our armrests, we found a sealed toiletry kit in a zippered pouch which included lip balm, hand cream, socks, earplugs and an eye mask. The bedding was from Saks Fifth Avenue, and while I didn’t use the blanket, the pillows were very comfortable.
Jeanne Croteau Our tray table stored inside the armrest and could be used at its full width or folded over for a smaller surface/drink tray. There was also a great panel that could be used to prop up a device or small book.
For in-flight entertainment, each seat had a television which could be controlled by touchscreen or with a remote control. Despite being provided with very nice headphones, we were so tired that we didn’t really watch anything. We just tried to get some rest.
Overall Impression
United Premium Plus is definitely better than being in Economy during a long-haul flight, for the most part — and it includes two free checked bags. You’ll have better food, more room and a much more comfortable seat.
To be completely honest, though, I sat in a regular Economy window seat on my way home and slept much better because I wasn’t getting bumped or touched every 20 minutes. If you’re planning on booking Premium Plus, be sure to examine the seat map and choose something far away from the lavatory.
If you’re a regular United flier and tend to book your flights using points, be sure to compare United Premium Plus with United Polaris business class to make sure you're getting the best value. For more specific details, you can also read this fantastic overview of United Premium Plus.
If you’re going to pay for an upgrade, but can’t afford to go all the way to the front of the plane, United Premium Plus is a great way to travel. With a distinct difference in the level of service offered between this and the Economy options (you aren’t just paying for more legroom), you can get a taste of the good life without completely breaking the bank."
Trump's Gamble. How Hardball Negotiation Tactics Can Win the US-China Trade War,www.forbes.com,Jack Nasher,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacknasher/2019/05/27/trumps-gamble-how-hardball-negotiation-tactics-can-win-the-us-china-trade-war/,"US President Donald Trump’s negotiation style has been consistent throughout his real estate career and his presidency: anything goes. He never rules out a total failure of the deal, routinely receiving generous concessions. His emotional outbursts are frequent and the “Trump walkout” is proverbial. Accordingly, on May 5, 2019, Trump furiously complained that the Chinese were trying to renegotiate verbal agreements and he walked out from a deal.
Such a risky negotiation tactic can work well in business, but does it make sense in deals such as complex and weighty as trade negotiations? This isn’t just a mere transaction, the current trade war the US and China are facing is no less than a textbook example of a complex negotiation involving billions of dollars and millions of jobs.
Let’s take a closer look at these negotiations: how the negotiations went so far, what the parties positions and interests are and what a possible deal could look like.
What happened? A brief timeline of events
The vast trade deficit of $419.2 billion was an important, but not the only, factor that led to the current trade war.
Getty The trade war begins in 2016 when Trump is campaigning for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination: “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country and that’s what they’re doing. It’s the greatest theft in the history of the world.” Not a very subtle way to announce changes in the US-China trade relations.
Actions start in February 2018, when Trump slaps tariffs on Chinese solar panels. Mid-level representatives meet here and there without a deal. On September 17, 2018, Trump announces tariffs on Chinese goods worth US$200 with an initial rate of 10 percent to be increased to 25 percent by January 1, 2019. Retaliation follows one day later, when China announces new tariffs on US goods worth US$60 billion and cancels trade talks with the US.
The two giants meet at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in late November. At a working dinner, US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping decide a temporary truce to work on a solution, refraining to impose new tariffs for 90 days, until March 1, 2019.
Haggling season is opened – but both sides play it cool. It isn’t until January when the two parties negotiate, first in Beijing and a few weeks later in Washington D.C.. The US negotiation team is led by Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, the Chinese team is headed by Chinese Vice premier Liu He. Trump makes an appearance and announces a meeting with Xi. A week later, Trump changes his mind: he doesn’t want to meet Xi. Then, In February, negotiations take place in Beijing and then in Washington D.C., where Trump meets with Liu He , demonstrating confidence in reaching a deal. The deadline is extended, and Trump expresses hope that Xi would visit him at Mar-a-Lago to finalize the deal. A deal is at reach.
Suddenly, on May 5, 2019 things go sour: Trump complains that the Chinese are trying to renegotiate points that were already agreed upon and he announces that the US would go through with the increased tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese products from 10 to 25 percent, effective Friday, May 10. Moreover, Trump announces new tariffs on almost all other Chinese products. On May 13, 2019, China retaliates, announcing that it would increase tariffs on US$60 billion worth of US goods, effective June 1, 2019.
So far, the US has set tariffs on Chinese products worth US$250 billion and has threatened tariffs on US$325 billion more. China has slapped tariffs on US goods totaling US$110 billion.
The two leaders will meet at the G20 summit in June to resume negotiations.
The negotiation process so far reveals a noteworthy dynamic, or – to be more precise – a lack of dynamic: Both parties were very slow to make a move, very careful to not show too much interest. Trump constantly tried to shift the perceived power in his favor: by cancelling a meeting with Xi and by then inviting him to come to see him. But who really holds the stronger hand?
Trump’s hand

© 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP In 2018, the US trade deficit with China amounted to $419.2bn . But there is more the US does not like: On the one hand, the Chinese government does too much, on the other it does too little. China heavily subsidizes particular industries, such as aviation and information technology, and it forces foreign investors to transfer their technology if they want to do business in China. On the other hand, China still does too little to protect foreign partners, particularly IP, presumably going so far as to tolerate or even support cyberattacks on American companies.
When the Chinese backed away from tackling these problems with clear and transparent measures, Trump used tariffs as a tool to exert power, claiming “We’re taking in tens of billions of dollars [in tariffs], I think it’s working out very well.” Indeed, the new tariffs increase America’s annual revenue by about $42 billion.
But this is the tariff-trick , resembling an optical illusion: jobs that are created are visible but everyone else pays the bill due to less competition and increased prices. When Trump increased tariffs on washing machines in January, it created around 1800 jobs. However, it also led to the rise of prices for washing machines and dryers of over $1.5 billion , so each job costs the taxpayer around $815,000. In the case of US farmers who are suffering from the trade war with China, the taxpayer’s costs are even more apparent: Trump created a $12 billion aid program to compensate farmers for their trade-related losses. Indeed, the current tariffs have cost each American around $11 per month .
Xi’s hand

ASSOCIATED PRESS China’s hand isn’t all that great: The country is facing its slowest economic growth in almost 30 years , due to a shrinking manufacturing sector and an aging society. China is heavily dependent on foreign consumption, with the US as its main export market, having exported goods worth almost $540 bn to the USA in 2018, making up over 19 % of China’s overall exports. Right now, China simply cannot afford to lose access to US consumers, especially as Xi is getting ready to serve as the president of China for a third term.
Accordingly, Xi ‘s chief negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, asked for three points : he wants the duties to be completely revoked. He wants the amount of additional goods the China has to buy from the US to balance the trade deficit to be realistic. And lastly, he wants the deal to be “balanced”, meaning that China must not lose face.
So China would be fine if everything remained more or less as before.
The most effective way for China to gain leverage in these and all following trade negotiations would be to focus on domestic trade . However, even though China has enough resources and people to build an advanced economy on its own, the people simply don’t have enough money to spend. Also, China is currently becoming an even more authoritarian state with a president for life and about to roll out an Orwellian social credit point system . Totalitarian structures prefer workers, not empowered citizens.
China could react in several ways : it could continue to impose higher tariffs on US goods. But then, Chinese companies would still have to buy unique US products such as semiconductors or Boeing jets or be left with a single competitor like Airbus who would exploit Chinese dependencies. This in turn would make Chinese companies less competitive.
China has used boycotts as a tactic in disputes with South Korea and Japan. But nationalism could open Pandora’s box and make deals with the US very difficult for the future.
Or China could block US supply chains that are heavily dependent on Chinese components. This, however, would severely damage China’s reputation as a reliable supplier to the world – something China can currently not afford.
And lastly, China could devalue its currency to make exports cheaper. But doing so would make all imports, such as oil, more expensive and could prompt wealthy Chinese t0 move their money abroad.
What now?
Will there be harmony?
Getty Trump is getting support from unlikely sources, such as from Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) who tweeted: “Hang tough on China, @realDonaldTrump. Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.”
And yet, Trump will be in serious trouble if the tariffs on US products continue. Even though the $11 per citizen wont motivate anyone to march on the streets, the effect of the higher tariffs Trump announced would hit US economic growth by half a percentage point in 2020 and cost around 300 000 jobs, prompting Republican Paul Ryan to oppose Trump’s tariffs . This could jeopardize Trump's 2020 reelection.
Hence, tariffs are not a permanent option but only a bargaining chip. Warren Buffet is right when he says that a trade war would be bad, but “There are times in negotiations when you talk tough.” And referring to Trump’s negotiation approach, he says: “With some people in negotiations, the best technique is to act half crazy.”
Half, but not full crazy. Despite Trump trying to display negotiation power ( ""I love the position we're in"" ), China knows that Trump cannot afford to continue with the high tariffs and has thus signaled little interest in resuming negotiations with the US. Zhou Xiaoming, a former commerce ministry official and diplomat said : ""China’s stance has become more hard-line and it’s in no rush for a deal.”
Showing little interest and no time pressure is a textbook example of displaying negotiation power. But, as Max Baucus, former US ambassador to China, rightly said : ""Those who think the US has leverage do not fully understand China. China thinks long-term.” China is a one-party dictatorship after all and the ruling party can do as they please for quite some time.
Thus, Trump needs to shift away from higher tariffs and look for other ways to increase his negotiation leverage.

ASSOCIATED PRESS The Huawei incident is no coincidence. Trump built it up to serve him as a bargaining chip. So it wasn’t surprising when Trump just said : ""If we made a deal, I can imagine Huawei being included in some form of, some part of a trade deal."" This was Trump’s most effective move to strengthen his hand. But it comes at a high cost, weakening America’s relationship with China.
A better way would be to reach out to the world, as many of America’s closest allies – such as the EU and Japan – have similar concerns with China’s exports. Those partners are closely watching the progress of the talks and will likely claim the new rules to be extended to their tradings with China under the World Trade Organization, particularly the changes concerning market access and IP protection. China became a member of the WTO in 2001 and is still listed as a nonmarket economy , which allows trading partners to impose antidumping and countervailing tariffs.
These duties are about twice as high as the tariffs Trump has imposed in the current dispute, with only the antidumping tariffs averaging 151.5 percent. A new deal could affect all tariffs. China disputed its nonmarket status against the USA and the EU, and has already lost the case against the EU .
So, the US has allies at its doorstep, but Trump fails to include them in the negotiation. Instead, he alienated them by introducing tariffs on steel and aluminum from the EU, Canada, Mexico and Turkey, which led to a number of trade disputes with America’s closest partners.
Certainly, the US is still a low tariff country but the new tariffs would rise the annual tariff rate from 1.4 to about 3.2 % . This could prompt China and the rest of the world to sign more free trade agreements, particularly as the world could shift its focus to the East , isolating the USA even more. Trump has made the US more protectionist, using tariffs as more than a mere bargaining chip. But America needs partners more than ever to create negotiation leverage, especially when facing China – be it in the trade war or in the dispute in the South China Sea . Meeting Japanese President Abe in Tokyo today, announcing a trade deal with Japan was exactly the right thing to do at the right time.
Yes, the best deals are win-win deals. But you can’t reach a win-win solution if you are in a zero sum-game. So when everything you gain is lost by the other party and vice versa. Such is the case in the US-China trade dispute. Trump’s “anything goes” approach has opened doors to thorough changes. But one ace isn’t enough: time is playing against him and Trump needs more leverage, the strongest one being a team."
Time To Change Perceptions: Why Care Work Can Boost Countries' Economies,www.forbes.com,Ana Garcia Valdivia,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anagarciavaldivia/2019/05/27/time-to-change-perceptions-why-care-work-can-boost-countries-economies/,"For centuries care work have sustained the well-being of individuals and communities. Childcare, healthcare, and domestic work are indispensable and yet, they remain invisible and unrecognized tasks, generally carried out by women with no remuneration in exchange. As the International Labour Organization (ILO) has highlighted in its 2018 report "" Care work and care jobs ,"" the traditional separation between economic and non-economic work assumed over time has not only lead to the “marginalization, undervaluation and privatization of non-market work,” but has also made us forget about the contribution that care work makes to countries’ economies. Currently, there are around 647 million full-time unpaid carers worldwide, of which 606 million are women. It has been decades since women are part of the labor market but these kinds of non-economic activities, associated with motherhood and care, often prevents them from having a job. For example, in the report, the main reason given by women of working age for being outside the labor force was “ unpaid care work, ” while in the case of men it was “being in education, sick or disabled.”
By placing care work out of the productive sphere, the world is missing an opportunity to create employment, improve women access to the labor market, respond to the western demand for healthcare that is approaching with the aging of the population and, ultimately, to boost the global economy. According to ILO estimates, unpaid care work would amount to 9% of global GDP if a monetary value was given to the hours devoted to doing it. So, what can countries do about it?
A few Member States in the EU have already taken action to made formal employment of domestic workers more attractive to households. This is the case of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden, which are using income tax deductions and tax credits along with a strong regulatory framework to increase the levels of formal employment in domestic work.
Spain, on the contrary, remains one of the European countries where women do more hours of unpaid daily care, they dedicate on average 4 hours and 23 minutes a day compared to 2 hours and 6 minutes dedicated by men. At the current rate, the gender gap in caring tasks will last until 2054, having fatal consequences in fighting against gender inequality at work.
According to ILO, one in four Spanish women of working age cannot access the labor market because of their “family responsibilities or domestic chores.” In France only 10% of women do not find a job because of this reason and in Portugal, its other neighboring country, the percentage is 13%. This is a very worrying fact, especially since Spain is the fifth economic power in the EU and may become soon the fourth after Brexit. But is not just a gender issue, if care work was paid in line with the minimum wage, it would represent 14.9% of the Spanish GDP, so, if Spanish women lose out, the whole country does as well.
In recent years, organizations such as the United Nations have been raising awareness about the need to address the care economy as a decent and productive activity worldwide. For that, the presence of young children in households has been identified as a turning point of women’s lives that must be urgently approached in order to avoid the so-called “motherhood employment penalty.” In that sense, the best recipes are embracing policies to provide childcare facilities, including early childhood care, and focus on paternal leave.
On the other hand, long-term care services such as health care and social work will become key in future societies. With rising life expectancy, the aging of the population in the western world is about to become one of the biggest challenges for the next generations. As time goes by, more people will reach an age where they will become dependent on another person, so promoting paid healthcare services will not only become indispensable but also a window to create employment.
Even if for centuries care work has been a key factor of women’s economic disempowerment, it is possible to turn things around by changing the current perception towards a modern vision. For that, care work must be recognized as an economic activity with an extraordinary added value, the general welfare."
Will PSA Group Accept Defeat And Leave FCA To Merge With Renault?,www.forbes.com,Neil Winton,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2019/05/27/will-psa-group-accept-defeat-and-leave-fca-to-merge-with-renault/,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) share price zoomed ahead more than 12% to 12.90 euros following the news of a proposed merger with Renault of France—and, possibly, as investors anticipated a tastier proposal from PSA Group. After FCA CEO Mike Manley said earlier this year that the company would be open to deals which enhanced its prospects, investors had been expecting merger or takeover action. The favorite candidate had been PSA Group, also from France, which successfully bought General Motors' chronic loss-making European subsidiaries Opel and Vauxhall and pointed them on the road to profitability.
FCA proposed a merger with Renault Monday which would be 50% owned by FCA and 50% Renault. Renault said it would consider the proposal at a board meeting today. The French state owns about 15% of Renault.
Combining Renault and FCA would produce a company with an annual output of about 9 million vehicles, and rank third behind Volkswagen and Toyota. Including Renault alliance partners Nissan and Mitsubishi the combined output would reach close to 15 million and into number one spot.
The Renault alliance with Nissan is a potential complicating factor because it has been under pressure recently, not least because Japanese authorities arrested former CEO Carlos Ghosn on corruption charges, which he denies. The alliance was already creaking because the Japanese felt they had less influence than their contribution demanded. Nissan was close to bankruptcy when Renault stepped in to save it, but has since become much more profitable than the French company.
Investment bank Nord-LB of Hanover, Germany had expected any deal involving FCA to involve PSA, and wondered if the alliance with Nissan might be a complication too far.
“The merger proposal from FCA already sounds very concrete, and it is hardly conceivable that the management of Renault was not involved in advance. However, Renault currently has its hands full with its alliance partner Nissan, and it is unthinkable that this partnership would be abandoned,” Nord-LB analyst Frank Schwope said.
Citi Research analyst Raghav Gupta-Chaudhary reckoned the FCA Renault deal would work and didn’t see any complicating factors from the Nissan alliance.
“Adding FCA to the global Alliance - Renault + Nissan + Mitsubishi - would add considerable scale, and if it can be achieved without complicated cross-shareholding stakes, a point of frustration for both Renault and Nissan shareholders, we'd expect this to be earnings accretive,” Gupta-Chaudhary said.
Investment researcher Jefferies liked the look of the deal too, and wondered if PSA might step in.
“FCA fits as well with Renault as it does with PSA; governance control, management structure are key considerations,” Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said.
Houchois said if Nissan and Renault fail to agree agreeable terms and the alliance fails, FCA would be an effective substitute.
Nord-LB’s Schwope said not only did the merger make very good sense, the reaction from investors meant that it was a good time to cash in Renault shares.
“In view of the high investment costs for future technologies such as autonomous driving and electromobility, a merger or close cooperation between FCA and Renault makes perfect sense. As a result of the merger euphoria, Renault shares rose by around 13% to 56.63 euros this morning. We recommend that you use this price increase to exit the Renault share and sell it,” Schwope said.
If PSA fails to acquire FCA, it might well turn to buying ailing British-based and Tata Motors of India owned-Jaguar Land Rover.
There had been rumors that a Chinese automaker might be interested in FCA. Some analysts wondered why Renault would want to merge with FCA because it was losing money in Europe currently, U.S. margins are falling, and huge investments are required to meet tough environmental regulations in Europe. Last month FCA said it will pay Tesla close to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) for credits to help it make its EU emissions targets in 2020."
European Elections: Where Voter Turnout Was Highest And Lowest [Infographic],www.forbes.com,Niall McCarthy,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/05/27/european-elections-where-voter-turnout-was-highest-and-lowest-infographic/,"The results have been flowing in and the 2019 European Elections have seen the main centre-right and centre-left parties lose their combined majority in the European Parliament. Their 40-year grip was ended as voters opted for alternatives such as the greens, liberals and the far right. Even though the populist Eurosceptic tidal wave failed to materialize, they will still take more seats in the European Parliament than ever before. Populists were victorious in Italy, the UK and France where Marine LePen's National Rally are celebrating a narrow but symbolic win over Emmanuel Macron's En Marche. One of the most notable aspects of the 2019 European Election was the level of voter turnout which soared to a 20-year high. Provisional voter turnout across the EU28 was 50.95% at 11:00 CET according to the European Parliament and that's the highest level since 1994. It also marks a reversal on four decades of decline. Voter turnout had been dropping steadily since 1979, falling from 62% that year to just 42.6% in 2014. Many analysts are attributing the rise in voter enthusiasm to increasing levels of support for populist parties, a high desire to show support for the European project and increasing awareness about climate change. The latter issue has seen support soar for European green parties and they were particularly successful in Germany, France and Ireland.
According to the European Parliament's website , Belgium had the highest levels of provisional voter turnout at 89%, ahead of neighboring Luxembourg's 84%. In the United Kingdom which is still locked in a bitter divorce battle with the EU, turnout was far lower at 37%. Slovakia had the lowest levels of voters hitting the ballot box of any EU country at just 22.7%. Senior EU officials welcomed the increase in voter turnout, hailing it as a boost for the legitimacy of EU lawmaking.

LNG Confronts Its Demons,www.forbes.com,Simon Flowers,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/woodmackenzie/2019/05/27/lng-confronts-its-demons/,"Can the industry deliver projects on time and on budget? The world needs more liquefied natural gas ( LNG ). Gas is a low carbon-intensive fuel and LNG can help to meet rising demand for energy in markets detached from the resource. But LNG has also been synonymous with poor project management. Several giant LNG developments earlier this decade suffered from runaway costs and delivery slippage. Investors still bear the scars, visible today in diluted returns.
ADVERTISEMENT The problem projects typically shared similar characteristics – complexity in design and scope, and developed in high-cost, often remote, locations. These challenges were magnified in places like Australia, where limited labor availability, and multiple projects, led to spiraling inflation. Environmental requirements and government bureaucracy stalled the process and further added to costs.
The industry is gearing up again, literally, for another giant investment phase. This new cycle will see U.S.$215 billion spent between 2019 and 2025 on greenfield and brownfield projects, backfill and finishing construction on those already underway. In total, these projects will bring another 182 million tonnes per annum (mmtpa) to market, adding 50% to global supply. Annual capital spend could touch U.S.$70 billion in the early 2020s, up from the current low of under U.S.$30 billion and only just shy of the 2013 peak.
Has the industry learned its lessons?
Firing up: the LNG sector is poised to add another 50% to global gas supply.
Getty The signs from the wave of projects now nearing completion are not entirely reassuring. Cameron, a US Gulf Coast project, produced first LNG last week, entering the commissioning phase a year behind schedule and with costs US$1.5 billion, or 23%, over budget. Freeport, also located on the US Gulf Coast, is over budget, too. Investors are shielded to a degree: the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors signed lump sum turnkey contracts and will shoulder the overrun. McDermott’s stock market value has fallen 60% in the last six months as the problems came to light. Other listed EPC shares have followed them down.
But there’s an argument that contractors bid far too low to win the business in a very lean market, and these examples shed little light on what comes next. Giles Farrer, Director, Global LNG, reckons there are four reasons why things will be better for LNG project delivery this time around.
1. Capital discipline is tempering the risk of cost inflation
Operators have kept investment across upstream on a tight rein, barely up on the 2016 lows. There are geographical hot spots, such as the Permian basin, and thematic ones – a surge in final investment decisions could push up development drilling costs for offshore projects, including deep water and LNG. But, generally, there’s no sense of a repeat of the upstream cost inflation that engulfed LNG projects a decade ago.
ADVERTISEMENT 2. There’s much less concentration of projects in tight labor markets
Geographical diversity abounds, with big projects under development or planned in Canada, Mauritania/Senegal, Indonesia, Malaysia and Russia among other locations. The two giant projects, Qatar (32 mmtpa) and Mozambique (28 mmtpa), will rely on imported labor but still harbor some risks of local inflation – the latter also has remoteness to contend with. Inflation, too, could creep into the US Gulf should multiple projects in the ‘second wave’ kick off simultaneously.
3. Developers are trying to de-risk execution by modularizing projects
What does that mean in practice? More project components constructed offsite and shipped on completion. By taking advantage of cheap labor at the fabrication yard rather than project site, costs can be controlled and savings delivered. Calcasieu Pass will build trains in Italy before shipping them to the US Gulf Coast; LNG Canada will use cheaper labor in Asia. But it doesn’t always work out. Ichthys (Australia), Snovhit (Norway) and Elba Island (US) are projects where modularized developments have run into challenges.
4. Lower raw material costs
The global economic slowdown underway should help subdue steel and other raw materials prices. These make up 5% to 10% of total project costs, but every little bit helps.
So, the LNG industry is set to confront the demons of the last cycle. One prize for success in delivering projects on time and on budget will be better and more resilient returns. Another will be confidence restored among stakeholders for investing in an oil and gas theme that is set for long-term growth.

A Surprise To The Men's Club In Finance: Ellevest Is Starting To Succeed,www.forbes.com,Elizabeth MacBride,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethmacbride/2019/05/27/in-search-of-11-trillion-the-hidden-women-of-finance-step-out/,"Sallie Krawcheck’s online investment advisor aimed at women, Ellevest, is growing at a rate of about 10% a month, according to an interview with her and the company's regulatory filings. The company has drawn lots of media coverage for its approach -- but the first evidence is now emerging of its success at drawing women investors.
If New York City-based Ellevest, which has about 75 employees and $280 million of assets under management, succeeds in the long run, it will be a big deal. Women control $11 trillion worth of investable assets in the United States. Krawcheck, the former CEO of Citi's and Bank of America Merrill Lynch's wealth management units, is the first entrepreneur to show signs of being able to tap the market online and at scale.
Women are increasingly wealthy, but they tend to invest later and less money than men. That’s a lost opportunity for the finance companies, and for women, who are more likely to end up poor in their old age. So this is significant, because other companies will likely follow three-year-old Ellevest's lead, if Krawcheck really has figured out how to motivate women to invest online, and because making it easies for women to invest will help everyone.
You might figure someone would have taken a run at this market before now — and in fact, many have. When I interviewed Mohamed El-Erian a few years ago, he flagged Wall Street’s inability to serve women well as one of the biggest market failures around.
""I think that, like a lot of industries, (finance) grew up very heavily influenced by the majority element,"" said El0Erian. The majority element, of course, is men -- in finance, it's white men.
But companies that tried to solve the problem have tended to jump to easy solutions -- like having business cards made out in pink, or merely switching their advertising so that it includes women running on the beach. Doesn't hard, but, well ... why would I fall for that kind of shallow appeal for something as important as managing my money?
So what’s changed between those earlier failed attempts, and now? There are a couple of factors at work here. The MeToo movement is still resonating, even as a backlash builds against women’s rights. Krawcheck has built a marketing message around the idea that if you can’t always win at the ballot box, you can stick it to the banks with your money.
But what seems more significant is that a growing number of women, probably as a result of the MeToo movement and the election of Donald Trump, have moved into the feminist camp. Is there a new old girls' club rising in finance?
They’re more actively supporting women entrepreneurs and women’s empowerment. Some have put money into Ellevest as venture capitalists, including Melinda Gates. A number probably are also investing as clients, with Krawcheck's new product for wealthy investors.
Of course, Krawcheck herself is one of a kind; one of the grittiest entrepreneurs around. Fired twice from CEO jobs at Citigroup and Bank of America wealth management units, she came back three years ago to found Ellevest.
But there have been other plenty tough women working in finance all along. (As a side note, the Citigroup CEO who fired her, Vikram Pandit, has taken a safer and easier second act, as an investor .)
What there hasn’t been before is as strong a movement to invest in women entrepreneurs. Women have risen in other spheres, and they are speaking out and opening their wallets in one of the areas that it seems to make a difference: entrepreneurship. (Women still haven’t made much headway in the corporate world -- the number of Fortune 500 women CEOs has been stuck at 5-7%).
Some of Krawcheck’s key supporters are women, from Melinda Gates to Valerie Jarret, Venus Williams and Melody Hobson of Ariel Investments. Morningstar, Khosa Ventures and Mohamed El-Erian also invested.
Some traditional investment advisors have figured out how to market to women, but they usually do so based on old-fashioned relationship building, often by adding women financial advisors, said Marina Shtyrkov, research analyst, wealth management with Boston-based Cerulli Associates.
""Women make up 51% of the U.S. population but less than 15% are financial advisors. They are drastically underrepresented in the financial advice industry and that makes it difficult for financial advice firms to meaningfully connect with this market,"" she said. ""Often, women investors are treated as a niche market despite being a large demographic group with a range of perspectives, experiences, and interests.""
""Firms that are successful in working with women investors don’t necessarily avoid addressing gender-based commonalities, but they are also more likely to treat clients holistically – as individuals, avoid pejorative messaging, and have diverse advisor forces.""
What makes Ellevest interesting -- and maybe a company that represents a significant shift, is that it does seem to have found a commonality that works to appeal to a fairly wide swathe of women: Empowerment, tinged with anger. I think she's probably tapped into the engaged, fairly wealthy and professional women who are already aware of the ways the world is stacked against them in fields other than finance.
Krawcheck told me that figuring out the Ellevest approach that would appeal to women was a challenge. ""I don't want to give away the secret sauce,"" she said.
""What women tell you in one focus group is one thing. What you learn in the 19th is different,"" she said.
But part of the way the company engages women has to do with creating a sense of community -- for instance, one of the advice segments is filmed from inside the food closet at the company.
Many times, what is damaging to women in the workplace or as consumers isn’t outright harassment, though there’s plenty of that. It’s the feeling that you don’t belong, that you’re somehow doing everything wrong, from how you behave at work, to what you value, to how you invest your money (which, by the way, evidence shows women are better at to a small degree, probably 1-2% returns’ worth on average).
Krawcheck says she was fired at Citi because she advocated to return some money to clients. She wrote about this in her book.
“I don’t mean I was fired because I had different body parts,” Krawcheck wrote. “I was fired for calling out the risk, prioritizing the long term, and for putting client relationships ahead of the short-term bottom line.”
Money is a perfect example: The reason that it’s so crucial for women to start financial firms is that they see money fundamentally differently than men — not very differently, but fundamentally differently. (Obviously, that’s a sweeping generalization).
To women, money seems not to be a game that one can win or a box to check off. It’s more likely a tool to maintain one’s life and relationships, and a mostly boring and intimidating tool, at that. My guess is that Krawcheck is activating the emotions of anger and empowerment to get women over the hurdle of actually investing.
Could a male entrepreneur have understood that at an intuitive level, like Krawcheck seems to be beginning to? Maybe, but no one had yet.
One thing worries me about the new girls’ network that is helping Krawcheck and others. For years, I’ve reported, often with a sense of dismay, on the old boys club that works to elevate and protect men. Now I see a girls’ club rising in finance with some of the same problems — it works mainly for white, educated, wealthy and Ivy League women.
What will make it different is if those women in positions of privilege use it to help women who aren’t. Maybe, just maybe, what we’re seeing is a start."
This Investment Fund Actually Allows Female Entrepreneurs To Be Themselves,www.forbes.com,Bianca Barratt,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancabarratt/2019/05/27/this-investment-fund-actually-allows-female-entrepreneurs-to-be-themselves/,"Vicki Saunders has done a lot in her career. Since the mid nineties, she has spearheaded seven different initiatives aimed at improving the world and empowering business leaders. She has mentored young entrepreneurs, co-founded online platforms for Fortune 500 companies in Silicon Valley and in 2001 was selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum. Her most recent venture, SheEO - an initiative that funds, supports and mentors female-led philanthropic startups - was launched in 2013 and has since funded 53 ventures and generated $4M in loans. Having started in Canada, the model has also launched in the US, Australia and New Zealand and, this year, finally makes its way to the UK.
Given that a Treasury report earlier this year found that female entrepreneurs receive 157 times less funding than male entrepreneurs, this venture couldn’t have come at a better time. Rather than find a way to help women fit into the current investment system, Vicki Saunders is intent on creating a new one - one that actually benefits the women it’s serving and seeks to draw upon the strengths that women working together can muster.
Given that proceedings start from a place of generosity - each of the investors (otherwise known as Activators) donates $1,100 to the funding pot - a positive tone is set from the off. The roles of investor and investee have been shaken up, too. Instead of each entrepreneur (known as Ventures) being put under pressure to deliver by a passive investor, they are offered the support, network and mentorship of the Activators, ensuring that each business is given the right set of circumstances in order to do well. What’s more, SheEO debunks the myth that capitalism and saving the world are mutually exclusive - each venture enrolled into the program proves that it’s possible to do both.
I had the opportunity to speak to SheEO’s founder, Vicki Saunders, about the ways in which the initiative is breaking the mould and opening up new opportunities for female entrepreneurs - opportunities that actually allow them to thrive in a way that comes naturally, as opposed to subscribing to way of working that has really only ever served men.
What led you to set up SheEO?
My journey to launching SheEO was 25 years in the making. As a lifelong entrepreneur who has always focused on doing good while making money, it took me a while to deconstruct the utter brokenness and absurdity of our economic model which treats nature as an externality. That was one part. Also, being a woman in this world.
Living as an aware woman is a challenge. When I realized that only 2% of capital goes to women’s innovations, less than 3% of global CEOs are women, less than 10% of film directors are women, and on and on, it was clear that the entire system we live in was not designed for us to thrive . It’s time for a radical redesign of our world so it can be inclusive and supportive of all. We have enough for everyone to thrive.
I have a really different way of thinking and have always thought there was a better way to organize our resources on this planet to create a better world. It took me a long time and lots of experiments to find a design that could have a big impact, that was organized around a different set of values and that was organized in a distributed, networked manner to ensure global reach to shift our systems. And, honestly, it took me a long time to do anything ‘women-only’ because I was so brainwashed by our culture that discounts anything that is focused only on women and I wanted to be accepted and successful, according to the existing rules.
Where did the idea for the SheEO model come from?
It feel like i’ve been putting together a puzzle over the past 30 years with little clues and aha’s been dropped in my path as I’ve tested work environments, experimented with different cultures, designed programs, built companies and talked with hundreds of wise elders. I’m a synthesizer. And SheEO, in its current instantiation is where we are now. The story is not over. In many ways I think it’s just getting started. We are learning. Our community is now co-creating this together. We try things. We iterate. We experiment. We fail, take the learning and then iterate again. It’s a result of deep collaboration and relationship building amongst a community of people who want to create a better world.
Your approach - activators rather than investors, female-led, discussion and collaboration-led - is very feminine. Masculine energy has long been the most recognised and impactful way of getting things done in the world of business - what are the unique feminine qualities you find are most helpful to entrepreneurs and how do you tap into them?
Well first off, the people who made up the rules of our current system decided what matters most. That’s clearly not worked out very well for us has it? We are in a wildly out of balance world right now and need to find our way back to centre. Moving from fear to radical generosity, from control to trust, from competition to collaboration are all elements of our model. We need a gigantic dose of empathy to understand that we are all in this together. And women have a huge competitive advantage to redesign our broken systems and structures because we are relationship based; we nurture our families and our communities and we chose to work on The World’s To Do List versus designing [things] that only isolate us further.
Some have given up on humanity already, a number of the billionaires who have more than enough capital to tackle all the challenges we are facing are spending all their money trying to figure out how to get to Mars. Well, I’m in this to transform this planet, not just extract all the value we can and move on to the next. Women are the caretakers of our communities, we invest in our families, we don’t pick one child to win, we lift all of our children up.
SheEO is here to support and fund those who are putting their energy and leadership into solving critical issues we see around us. We have no time to waste. The world is on fire.
What criteria do you look for in Activators?
We share our model, our vision and our message and see who it resonates with it. The main call is for radically generous women. If that term resonates with you, you step into a very special community. Activators to date are all ages (14-94) and all stages (early career, budding entrepreneurs, stay-at-home moms, grandmothers, corporate execs, leaders of all kinds). All women and those who identify as women are welcome. We are here with our sleeves rolled up ready to help one another.
What sort of experiences have your Activators usually had themselves that lead them to this act of ‘radical generosity?’
Our community is very, very diverse in experience. I think there is really a choice to be made; do you want to be in a community of radically generous women? Can you imagine how that might change things for you? Are you open to receiving that kind of support? Many people aren’t ready to give that kind of love to themselves. Many of us are in fear, or don’t believe we are worthy, we aren’t ready yet, we don’t matter enough, what could we possibly give to a network of women, and so on. We all make up stories in our heads. Becoming an Activator is an act of self-love from my perspective. You step into your amazing-ness and decide to share yourself with the community. And, wow, when that happens, we all start to become more than we ever thought we could be. Its transformational. My life has changed dramatically since I became an Activator. I’m so much happier, kinder, more giving and I’m finally receiving help from others which I wasn’t open to for most of my life.
Do you find the experiences of the entrepreneurs are different depending on the country they’re based in? If so, what is the UK’s own set of unique challenges?
We are just getting started in the UK so I haven’t really experienced any significant differences. From the stories I hear, it’s the same pretty much everywhere. We are all under-funded, under-supported, under-celebrated and underestimated.
What has been the biggest surprise/ learning curve for you since setting up SheEO?
One thing is how hard it has been to get women to activate. Our community of 4,000 Activators have spoken to tens of thousands of women, most of whom have been deeply inspired by the model and follow us on social and are excited by the impact. And, the majority of these women are on the sidelines waiting to give themselves permission to join. One day (soon, I hope) there will be a mad rush to our site to sign up as people realize the impact of their small contribution. In the meantime, we patiently continue and wait. We are gathering, getting into community with one another, fed up with the structures and systems that lock us out. We are coming with everything we’ve got; our money, our networks, our advice, our expertise, all the resources we have at our disposal to create a better world. The world needs women to be at the table and we are going to design to work for everyone.
And what have been the biggest challenges?
Every single day, witnessing our Ventures, who are working on The World’s To Do List - the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals - struggle with the weight of the challenges they are working on, from removing plastics from our oceans to re-designing the walker/wheelchair to keep people active.
What do you feel are the challenges your entrepreneurs are facing in the world of business?
Most of our Ventures didn’t start out to create a business. They started to solve a challenge they saw in the world such as lack of inclusion , lack of 21st century skills like empathy and food security . All of the Ventures we fund are working on critical challenges of our time and their impact is as much social as it is financial. We don’t currently have agreed upon metrics to help us track that impact in our existing models. We need more flexible forms of capital and support to get these Ventures scaled. Our obsession with only focusing on a financial return and winning the market (winner takes all) has created massive inequality and social challenges. We need to rethink how we use our capital to what ends, immediately, if we want to ensure humanity’s survival. Our Ventures are on the cutting edge of transforming our economy and our society and it’s deep, deep system changes that will work and that is not for the weak hearted. In our community we are on speed-dial with each Venture every day, cheering them on. They are the modern day heroes of our time.
You give the power of dividing the loans to the Ventures, rather than the Activators - what made you decide to do this and how does it benefit everyone involved?
After the Ventures are selected they come together for a weekend retreat with their SheEO development guides and they get to know one another, share their hopes and dreams, their concerns, their challenges and their current needs. Then we teach them to negotiate so they can understand how each person will react. Lastly, we turn it over to them to divide up the money in a way that has the highest and best impact with a goal of 100% payback of the loans. They only have two rules; you can’t give it all to one Venture and you can’t divide it up evenly.
What advice would you offer to female entrepreneurs just starting out?
If you are just starting out, please do anything you can to get into community with other entrepreneurs who have your back, who lift you up, who understand what you are going through. It can be a very lonely existence if you aren’t careful about surrounding yourself with supporters. And, obviously, I encourage you to join SheEO as an Activator. The best way to grow youR business is to be in a network of radically generous woman who want you to succeed, who have your back and who are here with their sleeves rolled up ready to help.

Shopping For Memorial Day Bargains? Try These 3 Mall REITs,www.forbes.com,Brad Thomas,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradthomas/2019/05/27/shopping-for-memorial-day-bargains-try-these-3-mall-reits/,"It’s Memorial Day, and while many people will use this time to head to the beach and soak up the first bit of summer-esque sun, it’s also a time when many will go to the mall or an outlet center shopping for swimsuits and other summer gear. In fact, for a lot of people right here in my hometown (in South Carolina), the mall is a Memorial Day destination when it’s so hot outside - approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit - that people will do anything or go anywhere just to be indoors with some A/C.
Mall owners will certainly hope to see a surge of shoppers over the holiday weekend. At least they can offer an escape from the heat, when it’s too miserable to be outdoors.
Now, if you’ve been watching the publicly traded mall space like I have, you’d know these companies have been beaten down much thanks to the overblown idea that’s been circulated in the media that retail is dying.
There are reports out there showing traffic to malls has dropped off over the years. And that’s likely true for many malls across the country - especially the ones that their owners aren’t investing capital into to spruce up and keep them relevant, as more shopping moves online.
With this in mind, shares of CBL Associates (CBL) are down more than 75% from a year ago. And shares of Washington Prime Group (WPG) have dropped more than 35%.
We’ve seen some of the more resilient operators in the space, however, weather these times a little better. These are the companies that have been on the forefront of getting better food, entertainment and non-apparel retailers into their malls.
With retailers recently reporting earnings for the first quarter of the year, we saw just how troubled the department store sector continues to be, as companies like J.C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl’s underwhelmed. Then Dressbarn said it’s going out of business, closing more than 600 stores. Payless ShoeSource, Gymboree and Charlotte Russe all filed for bankruptcy this year.
While no one mall operator is going to be entirely immune from these headwinds, I would argue now is actually a great time to get into the space, if you’re investing in the right retail REITs. A few of these companies can be great bargains for investors today. I’ve got three for you, and I’ll tell you why.
3 Mall REIT Bargains to Buy
Within the mall REIT sector our favorite picks are Simon Property (SPG), Taubman Centers (TCO) Centers, and the riskier Pennsylvania REIT (PEI). We like these three REITs because we believe they are the best capitalized to continue to mitigate the retail cycle.
Simon has a fortress balance sheet that consist of over $7.5 billion of liquidity (enough to pay for its entire development backlog and shadow backlog all on its own) and is one of the few REITs that's totally self-funding its growth.
While the company’s dividend yield is generous (4.8%), the payout ratio (72% based on AFFO) provides evidence that the dividend is very safe, especially considering that A credit rating and fortress balance sheet.
Taubman is another top-shelf pick and I’m especially fixated on the REIT’s best-in-class sales per square foot of $845 (the highest sales per square foot in the mall sector).
The company is a landlord to many of the highest quality retailers that includes high-end brands such as Dolce & Gabbana, Diesel, Restoration Hardware, Forever 21, J.Lindeberg, and Ben Sherman.
Increasing growth indicates either rent per square foot, occupancy, or both are increasing. 'A malls' are expected to remain the beneficiaries of incremental demand for space and have higher rent negotiating power.
Pennsylvania REIT is a higher risk play, as evidenced by the 12.2% dividend yield. However, I credit the management team for taking bold steps in the early innings, by pruning the portfolio and having the lowest exposure to Sears of all of the mal REIT peers.
With core mall sales per square foot of $510 per square foot and core mall leased space at 96.9%, the company said on the latest earnings call that it has ""transitioned to an A-mall company,"" suggesting that it has leased up all of its vacant department stores. PREIT’s CEO, Joe Coradino, explained:
“We don't anticipate any J.C. Penney closings. We have among the lowest Sears exposure in the sector. We also have two of Macy's in the top 50 growth stores which is no small feat for a portfolio of our size. We have changed the definition of the mall and we're agile enough to stay at the forefront of this evolving landscape.”
I happen to own all three of these mall REITs and while I can't guarantee you they will generate outsized returns, they all appear to be well-positioned to grow earnings as the retail cycle continues to evolve. To protect the downside, we recommend maintaining adequate diversification and possibly hedging the retail exposure with technology-based sectors such as data centers and cell towers. Have a great Memorial Day and happy SWAN (stands for sleep well at night) investing!

'Elder Scrolls Online' Elsweyr Chapter Adds Dragons And Necromancers For PC Early Access,www.forbes.com,David Jagneaux,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjagneaux/2019/05/27/elder-scrolls-online-elsweyr-chapter-adds-dragons-and-necromancers-for-pc-early-access/,"While the Elsweyr chapter of Elder Scrolls Online is still a couple of weeks away from full launch on PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Xbox One (XB1) on June 4, 2019, it's currently available in Early Access on PC and Mac. This marks the third full chapter expansion to Elder Scrolls Online in as many years from Bethesda and Zenimax Online. ADVERTISEMENT With the Elsweyr chapter, Zenimax is adding not only a brand new character class with the Necromancer, but also an entire new zone, new world events focused on battling dragons and an assortment of new dungeons and delves to try. Whereas last year's Summerset took players to the lush, green landscapes of the Altmer home island, Elsweyr swaps picturesque coastlines for sandy deserts and deep canyons.
Arguably the biggest draw of the new Elsweyr chapter is the addition of dragons. These enormous scaled beasts are finally making their debut in Elder Scrolls Online with this new chapter and they pose a significant challenge as boss monsters and open world group battles across the Khajiiti homeland. The fire-breathing foe at the end of the new 12-player Trial, Sunspire, is particularly fearsome but also of course offers new exclusive gear and collectibles.
Beyond that a brand new players class is a big deal in Elder Scrolls Online . In the five years since launch this is only the second new class introduced to the game bringing the total up to six. And just like all other classes, Necromancers can fulfill any of the three core roles in a group: healer, damage dealer or tank. However, players are encouraged to pick a role and stick to it in order to be effective. Necromancers rely on raising corpses, commanding minions and draining the life out of enemies to fuel their magic and heal allies.
The Elsweyr chapter is out now in Early Access on PC and Mac, but releases on June 4, 2019 for PS4 and XB1. If you pre-purchase the new chapter now you'll immediately be rewarded with a glowing Rahd-m'Athra mount, as well as the full base game and both Morrowind and Summerset chapters if you didn't already own those.

"Visconti's Da Vinci Machina Rose Gold Fountain Pen Nears $14,000",www.forbes.com,Nancy Olson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nancyolson/2019/05/27/viscontis-da-vinci-machina-rose-gold-fountain-pen-nears-14000/,"This month marks the 500 th anniversary of the passing of Leonardo da Vinci, who is considered the original Renaissance man thanks to his exhaustive list of talents and interests. In addition to his fascination with architecture, science, music, math, history, writing and cartography, among others, he is widely considered one of the greatest artists the world has ever known. The Italian pen brand Visconti is rightfully celebrating da Vinci’s life and works with a new pen collection, the Leonardo da Vinci Machina . With so much to choose from, it must have been no easy feat to identify the exact elements from da Vinci’s oeuvre to embellish the small canvas of a pen. But Visconti smartly chose to highlight his engineering talent for the design of the collection, and thus the cap and barrel are decorated with details of the technical drawings of some of da Vinci’s revolutionary machines collected from the Codex Atlanticus.
The Codes Atlanticus is a twelve-volume set of drawings and writings by da Vinci, comprising 1,119 pages dating from 1478 to 1519, the year of his death. The contents cover a variety of topics that interested him, from math to musical instruments, botany to weaponry. The codex was assembled by Pompeo Leoni (in the late 16 th century), who took apart some of da Vinci’s notebooks to create it. The pages include studies and sketches for paintings, as well as philosophical meditations and fables—and much in between. The bound set is in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan.
The Visconti Leonardo da Vinci limited edition collection with rose gold trim. The oversized fountain pen is priced at $13,950.
Visconti The scrimshaw technique and a colored pigment used on the ivory-colored parts of the pen cap and barrel are a tribute to da Vinci’s red chalk drawings, and they are also a tribute to the expertise of Visconti’s craftsmen who faithfully recreated their spirit on the pens. The resin writing instruments are available as a fountain pen or a rollerball pen with silver, vermeil or rose gold trim.There are 288 pieces each in silver and vermeil, while there are just 38 pens available with rose gold trim. The fountain pen is fitted with Visconti’s highly efficient power filler system, and the nib is an oversized 23-karat palladium Dreamtouch , available in extra fine, fine, medium, broad and stub configurations.
Each pen is housed in a beautifully crafted icosahedron-shaped gift box with a hinged lid, which opens to feature a gear shape that holds the writing instrument safely in place. The icosahedron was one of da Vinci’s famed geometric sketches, and by definition it is a polyhedron with 20 faces.
Not so incidentally, Visconti was founded in Florence, the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, and the company has created other pen collections that pay homage to Italy’s esteemed place in art history, such as the Divina Proporzione and Brunelleschi collections. Visconti’s Wild West collection , introduced in 2016, was the first pen that featured its scrimshaw technique.
The Machina collection will be formally introduced next month ."
The Acura RDX has the Right Looks and the Right Feels,www.forbes.com,Christopher Teague,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christeague/2019/05/27/the-acura-rdx-has-the-right-looks-and-the-right-feels/,"The Acura RDX isn’t always at the top of premium buyers’ shopping lists, but the newly-redesigned 2019 model is worth a look. The RDX slots into the Acura lineup below the larger MDX (think more Honda CR-V size than Pilot), but still manages to offer up a comfortable space for a family of four without much to complain about. The A-Spec Package we tested is on the sportier end of the RDX spectrum and certainly brings a more aggressive look with interesting options, but the powertrain is identical to other trim levels. The RDX made our list of the best luxury SUVs under $50,000, and for good reason. Here’s our review of the 2019 Acura RDX A-Spec.
Design
Acura RDX A-Spec
Acura
Acura moved away from the polarizing ""shield"" grille design on its other models in recent years, and for 2019 the RDX has finally gotten its turn. Our A-Spec package tester featured gray 20-inch wheels, blacked-out exterior trim pieces, and an aggressive new front-end design. Acura’s signature “Diamond Eye” LED headlights flank the new grille, which also features a dinner plate-sized Acura logo and interesting distorted honeycomb pattern. The look up front is completed by LED fog lights mounted low into air vents on either side of the front fascia.
Around back, large LED tail lights flank another prominent Acura logo. As an interesting Easter egg, the lights are shaped as a sideways Acura “A”. The A-Spec also comes with large (see: canon-sized) exhaust finishers.
The sporty, modern feel continues inside, where red leather and black (literally) everything else accent a clean and functional interior, and the panoramic sunroof opens up what would otherwise be a very dark place. Front seat passengers are treated to great outward visibility and clever small item storage spaces. The RDX’s center stack features a split design that places audio and climate controls on a “floating” piece that allows for a large, open storage space underneath.
Performance
Acura RDX A-Spec
Acura Acura’s engineers worked hard to make the RDX’s driving experience lively and engaging, and the effort has paid off – mostly. The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and 10-speed automatic transmission work well together to power the little crossover off the line with authority, but even with 272 horsepower it’s a stretch to call the RDX fast. It makes all the right sounds and has the right feels for the title, but here it’s more about the perception of speed and agility more than outright muscle. That’s not a bad thing, especially for the price.
The RDX comes standard with front-wheel drive, but ours was equipped with the Acura’s Super Handling All-wheel Drive (SH-AWD). It’s cleverly tuned to send most of the drive power (70%) to the rear wheels, which allows the RDX to feel like a sports sedan in some situations and like a corner-grabbing rally car in others. It’s the RDX’s ace in the hole, making the Acura a compelling choice against competitors like the truly sporty BMW X3 or Mercedes-Benz GLC. That, and the Acura has a more attainable starting price than its German rivals.
Tech
Acura RDX A-Spec
Acura Any discussion of the RDX’s tech should start by getting the touchpad topic out of the way. Yes, the RDX has one. No, it’s not as hard to use as a Lexus “mouse” or other touchpads. It’s nearly as good as some of the non-touchscreen systems that BMW and Mazda use, which incorporate a scroll wheel to navigate. Acura’s implementation of a track pad here is thoughtfully done, with “touch points” that dictate where on the screen your cursor lands. Touch the top left of the pad, that’s where the cursor goes, and sliding a finger moves the screen accordingly. There’s a secondary touch area to the right that controls a smaller “side” screen with time, music, or other information. It’s one of the best touchpad setups yet, but still requires too much attention and effort to use while driving.
Elsewhere, the Acura is packed with useful tech. Apple CarPlay is standard, as is a Wi-Fi hotspot. Our A-spec came with the Acura/ELS Studio 3D sound system, which brought 16 speakers and a 710-watt amplifier to the party. Sound quality and volume are robust and do more than an adequate job at jamming the kids’ Disney soundtracks at full tilt.
Comfort
Acura RDX A-Spec
Acura Acura calls the new RDX’s cabin “intimate”, which is marketing speak for “good luck with those car seats”, but after living with it for a week and using it as the exclusive morning school run vehicle, the story’s not all that bad.
Up front, Acura has managed to strike a balance between body-hugging seats and luxury-car comfort, and the high level of steering column and seat adjustments make a comfortable driving position for nearly anyone. Because controls and armrests are easily within reach, there’s never a time when the driver or front passenger will feel stretched to find what they need.
The rear seats will accommodate two car seats without issue, but many buyers will find that larger child seats cut down on their ability to adjust the front seats to a comfortable position. At six feet tall, I have to install full-size car seats on the passenger’s side to allow for a comfortable driver’s seat adjustment. Loading and unloading kids in the second row is hampered slightly by a low roofline, especially for taller full-size seats. With very few rear seat movement options, adult passengers may find leg room lacking, and the RDX’s sloping roof cuts into head room for many people (even more with the panoramic roof installed)."

Amazon - Redefining The 80:20 Rule,www.forbes.com,Cally Russell,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/callyrussell/2019/05/27/amazon-redefining-the-8020-rule/,"The 80:20 rule is oft bandied around in the retail world and Amazon, not content with disrupting numerous retail industries and the very way we shop have even taken an established business saying and turned it on its head. Amazon uses the 80:20 rule to demonstrate their approach to product decision making - they base selections 80% on data and 20% on experience and gut feel, whereas traditionally decisions in retail are entirely the other way around, with 20% being based on data and 80% on gut feel.
No-one can argue that the 80:20 model isn’t working well for Amazon as the company announced a near doubling of their profits for the first quarter of 2019 as it continues its expansion into new categories by using the data they generate from selling 3d party products.
Amazon treats product selection in all categories - from electricals, fashion, garden equipment to pet supplies in the same way that it treats all decision making - focusing more on data over the human elements.
In new categories, the company utilizes its marketplace offering to understand what works well and what doesn’t before analyzing the data and then utilizing their own inventory or creating their own products. Powered by Prime this approach can quickly mean that what was once a lucrative market for an Amazon marketplace seller can vanish overnight.
Amazon are experts at data collection, analysis and the implementation of data led decisions which impact every aspect of their business from product ranges, to cross-selling, up-selling and personalized marketing.
So, how do other retailers utilize the 80:20 rule in this manner to unlock growth and performance? Is it possible? Or is this Amazon innovation untouchable by others?
Some of the biggest (and most successful) names in fashion retail at present; think Zara, Boohoo and PLT have created their own data led models to determine what to stock and in what quantities. Their approach is based on stocking small initial volumes of product and using the data this generates to optimize future buys. This approach works when you’re able to position your supply chain to support it but for many, this is a task that is out of their reach.
One of the main shifts is that for traditional fashion retailers, data used is historical data which is heavily skewed by merchandising and marketing positioning - for example, showing as a false positive if an item has been heavily marketed or discounted as a loss leader - both actions drive spikes in sales which mask the true appeal of the product.
Whereas Amazon and fast fashion innovators Zara and Boohoo use real-time, non manipulated, customer-centric data to inform their stock decision.
These businesses were built with a focus on data but how can a more traditional fashion retailer emulate these new entrants successes and move from a 20:80 approach to an 80:20 data model?
For many retailers now there is a gold rush to utilize data in a similar way and create their own approach to the 80:20 rule.
The first decision companies need to make is to decide if they’re focusing on their own data sources or bringing others into the mix?
Owned data sources enable companies to look at the data they already have within their organizations currently and use this insight to help them make informed decisions. The challenge is knowing how to extract the most meaningful data from legacy systems and then having the time and resources to analyze and embed it in decision making. In many of my conversations with retailers, they often focus on the data they’ve got, but are so often unable to really harness it.
Companies from IBM to Tableau are now providing solutions to help companies turn this data into insights across many sectors. In hospitality hotel chains such as Marriott have combined weather and local event data to forecast demand and determine a value for every individual hotel room - allowing them to optimize its setting of prices and improve profitability.
That’s why so many retailers are now working with external providers to either generate data for them or unlock the data they have internally to create actionable insights of their
An example of this is Manchester based PEAK who has created a powerful AI platform that helps retailers understand performance based on their own data insights and work with a range of leading names.
With moving to an 80:20 strategy many companies have to change their people strategy as well, turning traditional buyers and merchandisers into hybrid data scientists. Marks and Spencer’s announced last year that it was setting up a data academy to train 1000 staff members on data science courses to enable just this change.
Amazon has changed the game with their approach to utilizing data in the product decision-making process, many new retail success stories are now built on a version of their core principles and many traditional retailers are now rushing to catch up."
"SpaceX's Starlink Could Change The Night Sky Forever, And Astronomers Are Not Happy",www.forbes.com,Jonathan O'Callaghan,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2019/05/27/spacexs-starlink-could-change-the-night-sky-forever-and-astronomers-are-not-happy/,"Each Starlink satellite is equipped with a large solar panel. SpaceX On Thursday, May 23, Elon Musk’s SpaceX successfully launched its first 60 Starlink satellites, a planned mega constellation of satellites designed to beam internet from space to the world. But since footage emerged of the train of satellites in the night sky, astronomers have been up in arms at the impact Starlink could have on our views of the cosmos.
Starlink is designed to eventually consist of 12,000 satellites, orbiting at altitudes of about 550 kilometers and 1,200 kilometers. SpaceX is one of nine companies known to be working on global space internet, and already concerns have been raised about space junk . Now astronomers too are worried about what the future may hold.
“The potential tragedy of a mega-constellation like Starlink is that for the rest of humanity it changes how the night sky looks,” says Ronald Drimmel from the Turin Astrophysical Observatory in Italy. “Starlink, and other mega constellations, would ruin the sky for everyone on the planet.”
Following the Starlink launch, several observers – including amateur astronomer Marco Langbroek – captured footage of the satellites in orbit. All 60 were deployed in a train, one behind the other, but astronomers were surprised that the satellites shone brighter than many had expected them to.
“What I had not anticipated was how bright the objects were and how spectacular a view it would be,” says Langbroek. “It really was an incredible and bizarre view to see that whole train of objects in a line moving across the sky.” Observers were able to see the Starlink train moving through the night sky. Margo Langbroek
SpaceX had kept the logistics of each satellite under wraps prior to the launch, but following the launch it was revealed that each satellite had a relatively large solar panel, perfect for not only gathering but reflecting sunlight back to Earth. This means anyone looking up at the stars, from any location on Earth, would always have the final Starlink constellation in view, for better or worse.
“It turns out that these satellites are easy to see with our own eyes, much brighter than we were expecting,” says astrophysicist Darren Baskill from the University of Sussex in the U.K. “If we can see them with our eyes, that means they are extremely bright for the latest generation of large, sensitive ground-based telescopes.”
Such telescopes include the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), currently under construction and designed to take wide sweeping views of the night sky to study a variety of bodies such as asteroids and comets.
While the true impact of Starlink isn’t known yet, it’s thought the LSST may have to deal with one Starlink satellite every few images, notes astrophysicist Bruce Macintosh from Stanford University in the U.S., resulting in a streak through the image. Such issues are not new to astronomers, but the sheer number of Starlink satellites is cause for concern.
“Part of the knee-jerk reaction across the astronomy community after the launch of the Starlink satellites was purely caused by a lack of information,” says astrophysicist Jessie Christiansen from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the U.S. “A significant amount of the outcry could have been avoided if there had been an impact study done in advance.”
During the dead of night the satellites are unlikely to be visible, as they will be in darkness with no sunlight to reflect. But it’s in the hours after sunset and before sunrise that people are most worried, when the thousands of satellites will be reflecting light from orbit and, it appears, clearly visible to anyone looking up. This was the first of many future Starlink launches. SpaceX
Another concern is not just for visual astronomy, but radio astronomy too. Each satellite will emit radio signals in order to communicate with Earth, and for astronomers that rely on radio waves to study the universe – such as the first image of a black hole revealed last month – Starlink may bring with it new complications.
“Radio astronomers are even more concerned as the satellites are transmitting in the 10.7-12.7 GHz band, which includes the spectral lines of water among other things,” says space archaeologist Alice Gorman from Flinders University in Australia. “Radio astronomers fight daily to protect critical observation bands, and this is only going to get worse.”
Musk, to his credit, has responded to some of the concerns on Twitter. After initially seeming to misunderstand how and why the International Space Station (ISS) is visible in the night sky, he noted that SpaceX was looking into how to mitigate the effects of Starlink satellites on astronomy.
“Sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction,” he said. “We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits and arrays are tracking to sun.”
He also implied that the ultimate goal of Starlink – bringing internet to the 3.3 billion people in the world who are offline, and using that money to fund SpaceX’s missions to Mars and beyond, albeit with an unclear market on how many of those can afford space internet or want to be online in the first place – was a “greater good” than any impact on astronomy.
“Potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good,” he said. “That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.”
It’s clear, however, that much work will still need to be done to allay the concerns of the astronomy community. While some may point to the benefits services like Starlink could bring, others will be quick to point out the irrevocable impact this could have on human culture.
“I’m not so worried about astronomy per se,” says Drimmel. “I’m worried that what inspired me to become an astronomer is at risk.”
While those initial images of the train of satellites were impressive, the possibility of having so many satellites constantly visible is somewhat alarming. Astronomers may well be able to mitigate the impact of Starlink and other satellites (several teams are already working on models to see how that might be done), but the night sky itself may change forever as a result.
“With Starlink, we are expecting at least 100 satellites to be visible at any one time [at any location on Earth],” says Baskill. “Soon, even those fortunate to experience a truly dark site will find it filled with a haze of metal, slowly swarming across the night sky.” Jonathan O'Callaghan Contributor Jonathan is a space and science journalist that specializes in commercial spaceflight, space exploration, and space science.

PODCAST || Deirdre McCloskey: The Freedom To Have A Go Leads To Prosperous Societies,www.forbes.com,Steve Forbes,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2019/05/27/podcast--deirdre-mccloskey-the-freedom-to-have-a-go-leads-to-prosperous-societies/,"Our conversation today deals with what the extraordinary historian and economist Deirdre McCloskey calls ""The Great Enrichment""—the unprecedented rise in personal incomes that began two centuries ago. ADVERTISEMENT How did it happen? The answer has particular relevance today as pessimism permeates many people’s outlook on the future. Two hundred years ago, nine out of ten people in the world lived in dire poverty. From time immemorial real individual incomes rarely rose above $3 a day, occasionally reaching $6 and then dropping back. Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, an astonishing transformation took place: incomes soared upward and never looked back. Per capita income in the developed world is now over $100 a day and rising impressively elsewhere. In the past 20 years, one billion people have moved out of dire poverty. That’s 137,000 people a day.
Economists and historians usually cite material factors—capital accumulation, exploitation of natural resources, trade, imperialism, a sudden spurt of new inventions, geography and even the weather. McCloskey points to something more stirring and profound: The genesis of ""The Great Enrichment"" was ideological. That is, it was a change in ideas about the inherent dignity of the individual and the rise of individual liberty.
Deirdre McCloskey
Taylor Glascock 2016 The chance for more and more people, who would have previously been stuck in a rigid hierarchy “to have a go” enabled the creation and development of countless products and services that raised living standards to levels absolutely inconceivable in previous times. You’ll find McCloskey’s insights absorbing and even inspiring. You’ll never the see the world the same way again."
Stanley Cup Final Appearance A Product Of Doug Armstrong's Patience,www.forbes.com,Matt Kalman,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattkalman/2019/05/27/stanley-cup-final-appearance-a-product-of-doug-armstrongs-patience/,"St. Louis Blues general manager Doug Armstrong spent money last summer as though he was adding the final pieces to a championship-caliber team. Three years and $15 million to unrestricted free agent center Tyler Bozak here; four years and $16 million to David Perron there. It was a somewhat risky move, bringing in two players in their low 30s for long term and big money, but Armstrong wanted to supplement a core that was led by forwards Vladimir Tarasenko, Jaden Schwartz, defensemen Alex Pietrangelo and Colton Parayko, and newly acquired center Ryan O’Reilly.
As the Blues get ready to take on the Boston Bruins in the 2019 Stanley Cup Final starting with Game 1 on Monday at TD Garden, it’s easy to look back now and give all of Armstrong’s moves a seal of approval.
But in the first three or four months of the regular season, the Blues were mediocre at best and there had to be a temptation for Armstrong to make trades that would clear some of his higher-priced veterans – even the newly acquired Bozak and Perron – off the roster and initiate a rebuild, or at least a reload.
Armstrong, though, remained patient because he could see positive signs through the losing (the Blues were famously last in the NHL overall standings on Jan. 2) that might eventually carry the Blues to the postseason.
“I thought we had played some really good hockey in October and November. But the reality was we were finding ways to lose games and not win games,” he said at media day at TD Garden on Sunday. “Twelve of our first 15 we were tied or leading in the third period and coming out with no points. So it wasn't like awful hockey, it just wasn't winning hockey. And you know, trades don't happen in December in the NHL very often.
“But we got to January and we had some meetings that we believe in this group, we think it can get it done. But it has to, it has to happen or else you get to February and you have to make hard decisions that you don't want to make. Thankfully we never got to that part in February.
“I do remember going to the under-18 [Five Nations Tournament] in Russia. We had made a trade with Buffalo and we had [given] them a first round pick [in a summer trade] and it was top-10 protected. So I wasn't really sure where we were at that time going to watch that tournament. But I told the guys that when we come back I'm going to know where we're at. And when we were over there to me the turning point was that Florida game, I was able to watch on television over there, coming back in the third period, winning, then going into Tampa and winning 1-0. And then I think we beat Nashville back-to-back and we were no longer sellers after that.”
Those Blues wins were part of an 11-game winning streak that put the Blues back in the race. Not only did Armstrong and the front office get their faith rewarded, the players’ expectations for what they could do were realized.
“I mean obviously you want to be winning, you want everything to go well all year. But it doesn’t mean it’s going to go well in the end or the playoffs either,” Perron said. “I think it built our team, it created some adversity that we had to go through. But for us … we believed in ourselves even at that point. We had five, six games in hand on certain teams at the time, if we won our games we’d be right back in the mix. And that’s what we did. We were believing we would win our games, and we had to obviously just to get back.
“I just felt like before Christmas when Craig [Berube] took over [as interim coach], the Western swing, we started outshooting teams every single night without getting results. And eventually it started to turn more and more and we were getting results every night, and that was a key turning point for us.”
Berube took over Nov. 19. By late January, Jordan Binnington took over as the No. 1 goaltender and went on to lead the NHL in goals-against average (1.89). The Blues managed to not only conquer a seemingly insurmountable deficit in the standings, but they blocked out all the trade rumors that had everyone from Tarasenko and Pietrangelo on being whispered about in press boxes and talked about on sports radio.
“You just deal with it,” Blues forward Brayden Schenn said. “There’s never rumors around winning teams. But you win some hockey games, you come together as a team and it’s an amazing experience when you do.”
The Blues, who spent nearly to the NHL’s salary-cap ceiling, made just one minor move at the NHL trade deadline. They acquired depth defenseman Michael Del Zotto but kept their core and their supporting cast together.
After three rounds of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, they’re still standing and Armstrong’s patience paid off."
Facebook's Upcoming 'Cryptocurrency' Has Nothing To Do With Bitcoin,www.forbes.com,Kyle Torpey,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2019/05/27/facebooks-upcoming-cryptocurrency-has-nothing-to-do-with-bitcoin/,"Rumors that Facebook will eventually issue their own cryptocurrency have been swirling for awhile now, but it’s likely that this product will be a “cryptocurrency” in name only and not have anything to do with the utility offered by bitcoin. ADVERTISEMENT Cryptocurrency and blockchain are two words that get thrown around with little meaning behind them these days. For example, Ripple’s XRP token is likely too centralized to be considered a true cryptocurrency , as are the various stablecoins currently available on the market .
It appears that Facebook’s so-called “GlobalCoin” with fall into this same category of centralized, faux cryptocurrencies.
What’s the Point of a Cryptocurrency?
When considering whether a particular project should be classified as a cryptocurrency, it’s important to look at the specific characteristics of decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that set them apart from traditional digital currency offerings.
In the case of bitcoin, the key innovation was the use of proof-of-work to allow those responsible for the ordering of transactions to be dynamic and potentially anonymous. This setup allows for a level of censorship resistance that was not possible in the past. It allows for bitcoin to act as an apolitical version of digital money.
The desire for this functionality is why bitcoin users didn’t care about the recent announcement of a new app that allows consumers to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when paying at major retailers like Whole Foods and Starbucks. Spedn, the app that enables these cryptocurrency payments, is a custodial wallet, so it is a much more controllable, censorable iteration of bitcoin payments.
Facebook Will Be More PayPal Than Bitcoin
All of the public information about Facebook’s “cryptocurrency” offering indicates that it won’t be much different from PayPal, Cash App, or any other traditional digital wallet. The only difference with Facebook’s offering is that it will have the “blockchain” buzzword attached to it.
ADVERTISEMENT For example, it has been reported that Facebook is working with banks and other traditional financial institutions during the development of their coin offering, as it is expected to be a stablecoin. It has also been reported that Facebook hired two former members of Coinbase’s compliance team. This is a direct contrast with bitcoin, where the point is to not be compliant with laws and regulations.
Governments will never allow these sorts of centralized, controlled offerings to be used for illegal activity. Because of this reality, it should be obvious that stablecoins are effectively ticking time bombs in terms of when the regulatory hammer will come crashing down. And if the regulatory crackdown does not occur, then it likely means the stablecoin isn’t actually offering any efficiency gains over something like PayPal in the first place.
As noted blockchain skeptic David Gerard recently pointed out on his blog, no one has even bothered to explain why Facebook’s latest move into the digital payments space needs to be developed as a cryptocurrency.
A large part of bitcoin’s value proposition comes from the fact that governments wouldn’t allow a centralized, fiat-backed digital currency to exist in an anonymous, uncontrollable manner. Of course, if governments did allow such a system to exist, it would likely be the toughest competition bitcoin has faced in its ten years of existence ."
How These Two Entrepreneurs Promote Artisans In Italy,www.forbes.com,Livia Hengel,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/liviahengel/2019/05/27/how-these-two-entrepreneurs-promote-artisans-in-italy/,"Italy is a country renowned for excellence and the ""Made In Italy"" trademark indicates mastery in the fields of design, fashion, food and manufacturing. Italian craftsmen, in fact, have long produced some of the world’s most coveted items - such as leather jackets and handbags, suede moccasins, silk scarves and more - combining carefully honed skills and a keen sense of taste with a timeless design that renders Italian products distinctive, elegant and highly sought-after. Traditionally, Italy's locally-crafted items haven't always found their way from the small-town workshops to the international market but thanks to MILANER, things are changing.
GianRos are master shoemakers from Le Marche, Italy who design pebble grain, suede and lamé moccasins.
Milaner MILANER , a brand and e-commerce platform that promises to provide “luxury on a first-name basis”, was born from an idea to connect Italian artisans with a wider public. It is a business created by Elisa Rossi and her childhood friend Serena Spinucci, two women who began to recognize the appeal and singularity of Italy’s artisanal heritage after they left the country to move abroad.
Born and raised in the Marche region, Ms. Rossi and Ms. Spinucci grew up in Porto Sant'Elpidio, one of the country’s most dynamic manufacturing districts. This small coastal town may not boast major tourist attractions but it is renowned for its highly-skilled artisans: luxury shoemaker Tod’s originated here and brands like Prada and Chanel have long sourced their products from the local craftsmen.
Elisa Rossi and Serena Spinucci
Milaner “When we were growing up, we always bought quality boots, leather handbags and hats from the local artisans. Everything was tailor-made and customized,” says Rossi. “Historically, artisans have always specialized in one product and we realized that this the ultimate luxury experience: the opportunity to purchase a beautiful product directly from the person who makes it.""
Ms. Rossi’s career took her to Silicon Valley, where she worked as a software engineer and then product market for companies like Apple, Square, Eventbrite and others. It was a very different world from where she grew up, but one that would spark her future business venture.
At the time, Square was just a start-up that allowed businesses to accept credit card anywhere, online and by phone. “Square revolutionized everything with its credit card processing system: it allowed all kinds of businesses, big or small, to accept payment by credit card anywhere, and it built a number of other software tools to help merchants grow their business. And that work experience opened my eyes because I thought, if a small piece of hardware could transform a small business, couldn’t it also be applied to the world of luxury artisanship? ”
MILANER, a brand and e-commerce platform that promises to provide “luxury on a first-name basis”, was born from an idea to connect Italian artisans with a wider public.
Milaner Ms. Rossi began to dream up a new project that would bring her back to her roots and help her raise the profile of Italian artisans from her hometown. “For me, creating MILANER was the perfect way to combine my experience in Silicon Valley with my appreciation of Italian craftsmanship.”
The brand sells a curated selection of clothing and accessories produced by the same artisans that make products for luxury names such as Dolce & Gabbana, Bottega Veneta and Hermes. Items include buttery-soft suede moccasins with hand-stitched details; light and breathable cashmere-linen scarves; handwoven straw hats with silk accents; beaded jewelry; and MILANER ’s popular Vachetta leather woven handbags.
The Satchels are made by Le Panier Team: Sicilian handbag architects who pour their passion into shaping every piece.
Milaner “What distinguishes our brand is this philosophy of human-to-human luxury: we shine a light on the stories and the traditions that are behind each product,” explains Ms. Rossi. The artisans are an integral part of MILANER 's branding and are featured prominently on the website, with images and videos that introduce them to their customers. “In the past, they were behind-the-scenes but now they can speak directly with the public.”
As you explore the website, you’ll meet the Spernanzoni family who makes shoes in Le Marche, Il Borgo Team who crafts knitwear in Tuscany, Le Panier Team who stitches handbags in Sicily and Veronica Marucci, a master millinery who creates hats in Paris (and lent her name to the brand). By seeing their faces and learning about their history, shopping becomes less about consumerism and more about human connection.

Milaner “When you buy a product from an artisan who has been honing his craft for 50 years - this memory stays with you forever and ties you to the item. It is what ultimately distinguishes MILANER' s goods from others,” says Ms. Rossi. “People don’t just like a product because it is beautiful, but because it has sentimental value and you feel connected to it.”
MILANER is committed to excellence and works with limited edition pieces that are ordered on demand. Customization is encouraged as well, and shipping and returns are free. The brand also plans to expand outside of Italy and add more craftsmen across Europe, in countries like France, Spain and Portugal.
Rossano Pergolesi are a husband and wife team priding themselves on maintaining a commitment to ""Made in Italy"" craftsmanship.
Milaner “We always ask our artisans, “What do you love to make?” We want to create a sustainable business model where our artisans are encouraged to put their whole heart into every piece. And this passion is reflected in the quality of each product. When you look at our collection, everything you see is one of their “ cavalli di battaglia ”, a signature piece that represents them and makes them proud,"" Ms. Rossi explains.
“ MILANER may still be a small business but it shows that there is a different way of doing things, a more sustainable way of selling that helps craftspeople preserve their family business,” says Ms. Rossi. “And if our brand continues to grow well, it won’t just be a win for us, but a win for all artisans and producers.”

What Playing for a National Championship-Winning Basketball Team Taught This CEO About Leadership,www.forbes.com,Rob Dube,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Entrepreneurs I write about leadership, business, and meditation. Tweet This Share to twitter Share to linkedin March Madness always ends, but the lessons every player learns on the court—from incredible victories to bitter defeats—will stay far beyond their college basketball careers.
Just envision the camaraderie, commitment to excellence and sheer determination these men experience as young athletes. These skills culminate into a perfect recipe for a future business leader—and for Mat Ishbia, the CEO and President of United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), it was. Mat Ishbia Mat Ishbia
Long before taking the executive reins at UWM—and growing his award-winning, top-ranked mortgage lending company from twelve employees to today’s 3,300—Mat played college basketball on the elite Michigan State University team under acclaimed coach, Tom Izzo.
During his time with MSU, the Spartans went to three Final Fours and won the 2000 National Championships . Though Mat’s game day role was as a supportive, third-string player, his four years competing alongside greatness would shape Mat’s life far beyond the basketball court and into the business world.
Teamwork Over Stardom As an undeniably talented high school player, Mat had options on where to begin his college basketball career. He was recruited by several smaller Division I universities as they tried to sell him on a college career in the spotlight and a full scholarship—not an easy offer to pass up for a teenager.
However, Mat dreamt of more than being the best. He wanted to play with and compete against the best, even if that meant taking a supporting role to stronger, NBA-caliber players. So, when Michigan State—one of the top programs in the country—reached out to him, Mat knew his destiny was to be a Spartan.
At MSU, Mat was offered a preferred walk-on spot. That meant there was no guarantee he’d even make the roster. Even if he did, Mat certainly wouldn’t be a star player. But, “I knew I could compete at any level,” remembers Mat. “I knew if I outworked people, I’d get that opportunity...and if there was a spot, I was going to have that spot.”
Armed with determination, Mat arrived as a walk-on freshman at Michigan State and earned a place on the team. It’s also when Mat met the person he calls his biggest influence—Tom Izzo. Under Izzo’s leadership, Mat evolved far past growing his ball handling and free throw skills.
“The culture at Michigan State basketball is about inclusion and family,” says Mat. “Everyone treated people with respect. But at the same time, you had to earn that respect every day.”
At every practice, Mat grinded alongside the team’s top players like Mateen Cleeves, Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell consistently proving he belonged in their ranks. In return, Mat experienced incredible camaraderie, appreciation and equality. It didn’t matter if you scored thirty points a game or zero—every player on the team was family.
Looking back, Mat attributes his successful four years at MSU to going out of his comfort zone and putting teamwork above fame. “It [would have been] comfortable to go play at a small Division I school,” says Mat. “It would be comfortable to go be a star. It'd be comfortable to keep doing that instead of pushing outside of my comfort level and trying to be the best version of myself I could be.
“And that's what I did. And that worked.”
Finding Success Off the Court
“If you're not learning and you're not getting better, someone's going to pass you by.”
After he graduated from Michigan State in 2003, Mat coached for a year alongside Izzo and envisioned becoming a professional basketball coach. Then, Mat’s father suggested he experiment with a different career path at his mortgage business.
On paper, the mortgage industry sounded like a complete switch from athletics. However, his father expressed how running great businesses are similar to running great teams. “He said I [could] take some of the things I learned in basketball,” says Mat, “and apply them to business and maybe even do something even bigger than being a coach.”
Mat was hesitant at first. But always one to leap outside his comfort zone, he gave the business world a chance. Almost instantly, he fell in love.
“The competitiveness. The drive to be great. It translated,” remembers Mat. “Now I can channel [that basketball] energy into business...I've loved it ever since I've been here.”
However, just because his father ran the business didn’t mean Mat started with a leg up. His first job was picking up faxes and bringing them to the underwriter. But forever hooked on the nonstop energy gained after four years at MSU, Mat had a fire to become the best at his newest passion—business.
Without a background in the business world, Mat knew he had to learn from the ground up and took the challenge head-on. He quickly moved up into a role as an underwriter, then into secondary marketing and eventually sales.
It was in sales that Mat finally interacted directly clients and grasped the importance of those human relationships. His higher status within the company also gave him invaluable insight into what it took to rise up—and eventually lead—a strong organization.
When looking back, Mat says, “There are so many great people at levels that you wouldn't know. I don't care if this person had a college degree or not. This person cared and this person was working hard.
“And I learned it wasn't about your background. It's not about what you did in the past. It's about what you're doing now and what you can do in the future.”
It’s been less than twenty years since leaving college basketball behind, but between tireless work and a people-first mentality, Mat has risen alongside UWM to become the CEO at one of the fastest growing companies in the country.
By taking cues from his Michigan State days, Mat leads with a basketball coach mentality. He also expects his employees to work together as loyal team players.
“I try to be the ultimate teammate,” he says “You've got to find your role. [At UWM], I'm the CEO. I’ve got to be the best CEO compared to other CEOs. I don't have to be the best marketing person or best salesperson. [Like at MSU], I had to be the best third-string point guard in the country.”
He also integrates lessons learned under Tom Izzo and applies them to his own team. As a leader, Mat knows it’s his role to not only bring the best people into UWM—but to keep them there. To do that, employees have to love coming into work and feel like they’re being treated right—like a part of the family.
But family isn’t always easy. Mat expects his team members to put in hard, high-quality work during the day. When his team’s on the clock, Mat expects everyone to give UWM everything they’ve got. Every moment should be filled with collaboration, dedication and a drive to be the best for yourself—and for the entire organization.
Again, he points back to how Izzo found balance as a coach. A great leader can’t be too soft. “They all think you're a great guy, but you don't win any games,” says Mat. “Then [a coach] can be a real jerk and yell all the time. You might win some games, but no one wants to be around you.
“[For Tom Izzo], it’s in the middle. He'll hold you highly accountable, but he treats you like family and cares about you. And that middle ground is what we focus on here.”
In return, however, Mat and his leadership team foster a culture with a strong work-life balance . For example, their Pontiac, Michigan headquarters was designed to make those daily, time-consuming errands a little easier. From a grocery store to a doctor’s office to, of course—a basketball court—employees can tackle the little things without wasting precious time outside of the office.
He also rewards this team with regular gestures of genuine appreciation and gratitude. This not only builds better intrapersonal relationships, but Mat also knows that no company succeeds without passionate, driven people working extraordinarily hard.
Even if they’re in a small, supporting role, every employee not only offers value to a company, but they deserve to know it’s being recognized. Just like his star-studded team at MSU showed gratitude to Mat, a few seconds of positivity from a company's leadership can leave a lasting impact.
“[Appreciation] is something I'm passionate about,” says Mat, “because I didn't get to where I'm at without a lot of help—and I'm not going to get to where we want to get without more help from a lot of people. “
“And I hope that I'm helping other people get to where they want to be too.”

The First NASCAR Esports League Kicked Off This Weekend At The Charlotte Motor Speedway - plugilo.blog,www.forbes.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2019/05/27/the-first-nascar-esports-league-kicked-off-this-weekend-at-the-charlotte-motor-speedway/,"This past weekend at the Charlotte Motor Speedway the first ever NASCAR esports league got underway, with the action taking place alongside the Coca-Cola 600 race. Players on both Xbox One and PlayStation 4 competed at the event, with Slade Gravitt of Wood Brothers Racing taking the win on PS4 and Brian Tedeschi of Team Penske taking the win on Xbox One.
This race was the opening of the eNASCAR Heat Pro League, a major esports league that features 30 drivers from 15 race teams, which are owned by prominent NASCAR race teams. The league will feature 16 races across a variety of tracks, with the league concluding at the 2019 NASCAR playoffs later this year. It was streamed on the NASCAR Facebook page, along with the 704Games Twitch livestream.
""Charlotte Motor Speedway was the perfect venue and environment to drop the green flag on the eNASCAR Heat Pro League season,” said Ed Martin, managing director of esports at 704Games. “Our drivers fed off the energy of the crowd and the thrill of competing on the busiest day in Motorsports, delivering incredible action to fans in attendance and watching around the world through our livestreams. It was exciting to see the best players from across the country capture the NASCAR drama and excitement through the NASCAR Heat 3 game before transitioning to Coca-Cola 600 action. When 704Games, the Race Team Alliance and NASCAR set out to create the first-ever eNASCAR league on consoles, this is what we had envisioned.”
Gravitt, who won the PS4 competition, is just 16 years old, and decided to try and compete in the league after playing with friends who wanted to see how well they could do in the qualifiers. He quickly noticed he was pretty good, and went on to earn a spot in the competition before going on to win it.
After the opening race in the competition Team Penske Esports are at the top of the team standings with 78 points. Just below them is Wood Brothers Gaming with 73 points and then JR Motorsports and Petty Esports are tied for third with 70 points. Nine of the remaining teams are within 10 points of third place, meaning the standings could easily change very quickly.
The next race in the eNASCAR Heat Pro League takes place on Wednesday, May 29, with the action being broadcast on the NASCAR Facebook page and the 704Games Twitch livestream."
530 multinationals from 35 countries innovating in Israel,www.forbes.com,Amir Mizroch,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/startupnationcentral/2019/05/27/530-multinationals-from-35-countries-innovating-in-israel/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Amir is the Director of Communications at Start-Up Nation Central. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Israel is emerging as a leading innovation destination for a growing number of multinational corporations looking to the country’s 6,000 plus startups for new ideas, quick prototyping ability, and infectious entrepreneurial culture, a new report shows.
The PwC report, commissioned by tech NGO Start-Up Nation Central , maps for the first time the activities of some 539 multinational companies (MNCs) representing 35 countries, who are currently active in Israel. It tracks the evolution of their innovation activity, showing that companies tend to increase and diversify their innovation activity with time in market, for example, going from tech-led R&D centers to operating startup accelerators and engaging in joint ventures. Download the full report here . Mitsubishi Corporation is the latest multinational corporation to open an innovation center in Tel Aviv. © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP
An unexpected benefit: many of the MNC’s themselves say they’re starting to take on some of the characteristics of the startups they’re working with, including regular pivots to new technology focus areas, faster execution of projects, and a higher tolerance for failure. “The Israeli way of approaching risk and failure, and the importance of giving startups independence and space to innovate – these core characteristics of the Israeli ecosystem allow MNCs to step outside of their comfort zone, re-think their approach to innovation and effectively tap into Israeli innovation,” the report states.
It is no longer just technology companies expanding innovation footprint but MNCs from a wider blend of industries. Deutsche Telekom, for example, regularly host management teams in Israel to absorb startup thinking. Pfizer, Genpact, Flex and Johnson Controls all have senior executives located in Israel who manage their companies’ global scope of technology scouting, product development, or open collaboration activities. Siemens’ Dynamo and Innogy’s Innovation Hub are unique innovation vehicles, not replicated anywhere in those groups’ global innovation portfolios. In Israel, Multinationals like drugmaker Pfizer exhibit “Startup-Like” behavior. © 2018 Bloomberg Finance LP
Significantly, the report notes a shift, starting in 2014, from a traditionally R&D-led focus on engineering talent or IP assets, to more investment-led and partnership-led open innovation operating models. This shift has been accelerating, as more MNCs with operations in Israel choose to engage in diverse ways with more stakeholders, making innovation costs variable and on-demand. These models lead to early wins, which then tend to secure longer-term mandates to explore, with HQ commitment horizons of 1-2 years or more.
Despite the belief that returns on innovation are often necessarily indirect, intangible and long-term, the self-reported value to the multinationals surveyed is overwhelmingly positive: 80% of MNCs cite incremental innovation on existing products and services as a key benefit of their Israeli activities. Merck, the 350-year-old German pharmaceutical and chemicals firm, says almost half of its healthcare revenue is based on innovation stemming from Israel. Merck, the 350-year-old German pharmaceutical and chemicals firm, says almost half of its healthcare revenue is based on innovation stemming from Israel. © 2016 Bloomberg Finance LP
The way MNCs measure the effectiveness of their innovation activity is also becoming more sophisticated, with over half saying they now measure the number of collaborations their teams embark on as an indicator of success. Other measures of effectiveness: innovation conversion rates (the percentage of proof of concept projects that lead to scaled commercialization), portfolio value and financial returns, service agreements, and new lines of business created.
Still, intangible benefits are valued in their own right, with innovation executives describing what ""good innovation looks like"" as the “mindset shift” engendered through broadening imaginations about potential group applications of emerging technologies. Another intangible measure of successful innovation performance cited is “the return on knowledge”—the level of visibility enabled by local operations to global leading practice around innovation–both in development and experimentation. Some of this also happens in “co-opetition” where competitors exchange insights and best practices due to the density of the ecosystem. One Chinese manufacturer innovating locally explained that only in Israel could their CEO-lead delegation meet with their Chinese competitors' CEO for lunch.
MNCs interviewed for the report also cited the distinctive execution pace of Israeli startups and the growth in commercialization programs as a reason they’re diversifying their innovation activity. Mercedes Benz is working with local Israeli enablers. © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP
Interestingly, growing multinational innovation activity in Israel has spurred growth in the number of third-party innovation facilitators, often within an industry focus. The Shelf, for example, operates in the retail sector, and The Dock in the shipping and logistics sector. Coca Cola, Turner, Walmart, and Mercedes Benz work with The Bridge Builders to source and develop commercialized partnerships. These groups and others like them leverage industry contacts to host MNC delegations, scout for bespoke profiles, and coach startups in navigating MNC collaborations.

I’m aiming to do just that through “Shaking the Table.” With this series, I’ll invite other women and girls in my community to the Forbes table to amplify their voices and share their stories. And instead of just asking, “why don’t more people sitting at the table pull up a chair for others?” I’m taking action by making room for others and scooting over to make more space for more women and girls. I know that if I truly want to create a more united state of women, I must continue to embrace and recognize that there’s enough room for all of us to work together.
This Memorial Day kicks off the first in the “Shaking the Table” series with Venita Thomas. Here, Venita shares her experience and thoughts on navigating the world as an African American, disabled veteran.
Forever shaking tables,
Desiré Bennett, Ambassador, USOW Cincinnati
Happy Memorial Day! It’s a time to honor and remember those who have sacrificed their lives to serve others. It’s also a time for reflection and gratitude. As a motivational speaker, I am often asked to share about my life. I’m grateful that my response always begins the same: I’m proud to be a veteran. It is chiseled on my heart and soul. I am honored to have served my country, and although I was injured in the line of duty, I would do it all over again. It was a personal obligation for me. My forefathers and mothers plowed this country, so I felt I should protect it. Not everyone appreciates this, but it’s my truth. Every good soldier is taught to stand by his/her own convictions and truth; and as all soldiers know, I am the Charge of Quarters of my S oul, P ride, I ntuition, R ights, I nstinct, and T eachings, my spirit.

Spirit holds double meaning for me, as I am also a woman of strong faith. My faith often leads me to scripture to help me make sense of the world. One of my favorite scriptures states, “No greater love than those who sacrifice their lives for a friend.” Women who serve in any capacity must be celebrated because love is the foundation of sacrifice. Celebration means to recognize and support another’s contribution. Sadly, celebration is not always the outcome.
My status as a veteran has not always been celebrated or honored, my contributions not deemed worthy. I’ve been belittled by other veterans because I am an African American, I’ve been underestimated by other veterans because I am a woman―my idea of friendly fire. Although hurtful and painful, these acts of belittlement prompted me to study the effects of dealing with hatred, all the isms (i.e. sexism, racism, etc.), and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). I used this negativity as fuel and channeled it into positive energy as I work to secure my PhD in Higher Education & Women and Gender Studies.
I know I will continue to achieve my educational goals because I have pushed through other challenges. In becoming a soldier, I had to master physical training, grass-drills, snow-drills, basic training gas chambers, road marches, calling cadence, the General’s Run, carrying Alice Packs, and qualification series at the range. I had to ensure my gig line was perfect and withstand being in the field for weeks to complete Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training. If I can survive all these things–I can resurrect the soldier in me and survive the challenges of my current situations. I won’t be hindered. And there is no option to my plan but success; I am veteran strong and I adore being a Black, female veteran.
I’m grateful to share lessons about my training as a soldier and how I bootstrapped myself through some very rough times. Had I not learned military maneuvers to climb over walls or identify foe vs. friend; I would be scared to take the risk of faith necessary to become an educator, public speaker, earn my doctorate degree, or depart from an abusive marriage. Like many women, I am a survivor.
One nugget of wisdom I’ve often heard from many of my elders is: “Become the change you desire, need, and want; not just for yourself, but for others.” It takes courage to follow your dreams, visions, and follow your instinct for your future. It is because of the courage women muster everyday to march ahead–despite the unique battles we face–that we as women will always be soldiers, regardless if we enlisted or not. I'm no longer active duty personnel, but I am forever a soldier.
As we face our daily battles, I encourage all my fellow women to remember success must be managed and opportunity created. If there is not a window for you to enter into the lifestyle that you want, create the window or the door–and go combat–and kick it in or down. Fight the good fight of faith for what you want, and please keep in mind nothing beats a failure, but a try (aka attempt).
And to all my fellow veterans, especially those who are women and minorities, use the training that was embedded during our formative years as soldiers. Hone in on the skills that allowed you never to give up, never lay down your morals or weapon, and never let the enemy see you sweat. Rock of the Marne!

‘Fable 4’ May Have Been Leaked Thanks To Mixer On Xbox One,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/05/27/fable-4-may-have-been-leaked-thanks-to-mixer-on-xbox-one/,"Fable 3 Microsoft Update : The Mixer database references Player.me , which is why Fable 4 is listed both here and on Twitch when searched. This doesn't happen often with unreleased/unannounced titles, but this is not an actual leak, despite the fact that Fable 4 is likely to be revealed soon regardless. The original article follows below.
-
I keep forgetting that we’re operating under the reality that Fable 4 has actually not been officially announced yet by Microsoft, despite it being something of an open secret. But thanks to a new listing on Mixer, the Microsoft-owned streaming service, we may have our first look at confirmation.
When you search for games to say you’re streaming on Mixer, Fable IV is actually listed as an option. If that was a fan-made listing, it would not be suggested in search, so this seems to be an error on MS’s part.
The fact that this isn’t all that surprising is because it’s been pretty clear that Forza Horizon developer Playground Games has been tasked with making a new Fable game for Xbox, though Microsoft has dance around officially announcing it for whatever reason, possibly because it may end up being a next-generation title, which seems likely as that new era is fast approaching at this point.
Microsoft is making a big push next generation to not be left behind by PS4 and Nintendo when it comes to exclusives, and by buying a bunch of studios and tasking current ones with new projects like this, they’re hoping to solve that issue.
Once upon a time, Fable was probably the third most valuable Microsoft IP besides Halo and Gears of War, but after Fable 3, the IP went stagnant, reduced to an on-rails Kinect game and the failed hero/MOBA type game, Fable Legends, which was ultimately cancelled. But now it seems as if Microsoft wants to build a “true” Fable game again, and what form that takes exactly under Playground Games is unclear. It’s been so long since Fable 3, even if this does turn out to be Fable 4, it’s likely to be nothing short of a total reboot for the series.
Fable, at least the first two games and the first half of the third, remain some of my favorite MS exclusives from generations past, and I’ve always felt it was a mistake to leave that IP behind. Though clearly MS had some larger growing pains when it came to exclusives that were not just Fable-specific. I think making a great, single-player focused RPG, perhaps one a little more advanced and involved than the first three, is a great idea and precisely the kind of thing I’d love to see a new console launch within a year or two.
My guess is we will hear something about Fable 4 officially at E3, a show Microsoft practically has to itself at this point with Sony bowing out, but we’ll see if they feel like finally talking about it yet.

"From The Shocking To The Sublime, Boutique Azorean Music Festival 'Tremor' Wins With Experiences",www.forbes.com,Oisin Lunny,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/oisinlunny/2019/05/27/from-the-shocking-to-the-sublime-boutique-azorean-music-festival-tremor-wins-with-experiences/,"Day one. On arrival, we are gathered into a bus which takes us to an undisclosed destination. As we drive through the island’s heart, the density of the fog increases until visibility is close to zero, and we are soon immersed in a dense grey mist. We disembark at a tiny coastal fishing village and are asked not to take photos of the next part of our journey, which takes place on foot. Every participant is handed a miniature MP3 player with headphones and told to commence listening. We follow a wild path in the rain, along the deserted coastline. The sounds emanating from our MP3 players are impressionistic electronic soundscapes. To begin with, we hear a calming robotic birdsong, then strange washes of machine textures, now becoming increasingly discordant synthesized noises as we progress. Our sense of dislocation mounts as we follow the path along hill and cliffside, the audio subtly changing our perception through the fine haze of raindrops. Tree roots burst through the ground, looking like mammoth cockroaches in the mist, shreds of blood-red ribbons guide us towards our unknown destination. The audio reaches a dark crescendo, now a distant incantation, or a warning. We arrive at our destination, a small barn set on a windy peninsula jutting into the Atlantic Ocean, and are greeted by the sight of two women wrapped in a single full-sized body-cocoon. The audio from our earbuds subsides, and the ladies emerge from their scarlet wrap and perform a discordant electronic noise composition entitled “Hell’s Garden”. The music is at times operatic, surreal, challenging, and terrifying. If this experience were a film, it might be a remake of The Wicker Man directed by Nicolas Roeg at his most disconcerting. From this introduction, it might appear that Azorean music festival Tremor is the music tourism equivalent of white-water rafting or an island-sized escape room, but the curators of the festival are maverick in their choices for a reason. The boutique festival, which mostly takes place on the volcanic island of Sao Miguel in the Portuguese Azores, limits the available tickets to 1,500. The cap on attendees provides a uniquely manageable environment for some ingeniously curated alternative music experiences, and also helps to protect the natural environment of the island itself. Tremor commissions artists such as Natalie Sharp ’s Earthly Delights, described above, to compose works which use the landscape of the island as part of its creative program. Sharp’s performance certainly gave attendees an unexpected and unforgettable experience.

Day two. We are again ferried by coach to a mystery destination in the middle of the island, but the rain has stopped, and we are afforded some glimpses of the island’s natural beauty. We pull up next to an unassuming set of buildings in the parish of Rabo de Peixe, and disembark into a tiny makeshift art gallery to view an exhibition by Rubén Monfort Meseguer. His photographs chronicle the local tradition of Despensas, in which teams of all-male choirs sing to invoke the Holy Ghost to bring good luck for the coming harvest. The photos show the men going about their daily lives, practicing in their homes, and later in their distinctive colorful uniforms and hats, singing during the festival, their faces lost in holy ascension. We exit into the adjacent village hall which is serving local drinks and food, and has an incongruous centerpiece of a drumkit, amps, keyboard and a glittering analog synthesizer. We are still none the wiser as to the afternoon’s agenda when we hear the beginnings of a procession outside, and rush to the street as acoustic guitars, accordions and male voices strike up a tune. In a magical moment of realization, the men from the exhibition are here, in full Despensas garb, singing as they commence their march along the street. Their songs build and their voices soar as they move into the village hall itself, and soon enough everyone is singing and clapping along. The songs are charming, uplifting and infectious, and the music is utterly life-affirming. After 20 minutes two of the singers - who it later transpires are Catalan duo Za! - take to the drumkit and keyboards. The local folk music is now joined by powerful electronic style beats, veering from Krautrock to Drum & Bass. The effect is electrifying as the energy builds and builds, and the music is like nothing you have heard before. If today’s proceedings had a director it would be Michel Gondry at his most unexpected and whimsical.
This vignette highlights the importance of the involvement of the local community and the unique experiences which the festival organizers curate throughout the five-day event. In addition to bringing close to €2 million in media exposure to the islands, an investment of €180,000 generates a return of around €800,000 with direct impact for the local community. The backers of Tremor include the Government of the Azores region and DGARTES , a national institute that supports the arts in Portugal. The organizers of Tremor see the involvement of the local community as a central element of the festival, not as an add on, and many hundreds of local residents are involved in running the event every year. They want visitors to experience the island through its people.
Haley Heynderickx performs at Tremor
Photo by Vera Marmelo Day three. Another mystery is in store, this time courtesy of Polish performance art collective Instytut B61 , founded by astronomer Jan Świerkowski. Once again, we gather to be taken to a secret location, and following a deadpan mission briefing worthy of a cosmonaut, we are spirited through the streets of Ponta Delgada in a coach with blacked out windows and “in-flight” astronomy lessons from the staff. The collective has commandeered the island's now seldom utilized sugar factory, and a series of immersive performances guide us through “ The Evolution of the Stars ”. From a riotous wedding - complete with live party band and an impromptu “blind date” with the bride to be - to the march of human civilization represented by a man in a dressing gown singing “Psycho Killer” in Polish. Followed by an exploding chicken, and a lecture involving cotton candy. The highlight is when we are required to don white protective jumpsuits and are packed into a small room filled with mounds of paper clippings. A shaven-headed man in neon body paint explodes from the largest stack of papers and yells his way through a song called “ Asshole ”, and strobe lights illuminate a room full of adults now laughing hysterically and throwing fistfuls of shredded paper at each other. The experience is euphoric and mind-bending, with a touch of Clockwork Orange. The finale is a deeply poignant song from a dying star, who sounds like a heartbroken Polish Johnny Cash. If this evening had a director, it would, of course, be Stanley Kubrick.
Jacco Gardner performs at Tremor
Photo by yourdanceinsane Creative juxtaposition is key to much of the charm of Tremor. The festival website only contains photographs from local nature, instead of the usual headshots of performers. American saxophonist and multireedist Colin Stetson - a regular collaborator with artists such as The National , Arcade Fire and Bon Iver - was represented by a small bird. Ethiopian maestro Hailu Mergia was depicted as a dappled wild pony. Eschewing many festival conventions entirely, at Tremor the local environment is the biggest star. The island itself and its many historic buildings become a stage. The songs of American singer-songwriter Haley Heynderickx cascaded through the spectacular surroundings of Igreja do Colégio dos Jesuítas, while the intimate Fado performance of Luna Pena took on a sublime quality in the acoustics of the former Franciscan convent building of Museu Vivo do Franciscanismo. The Sunflowers raised merry psych-punk hell in the local business society hall at Ponta Delgada, while Jacco Gardner performed in the upper foyer of the Teatro Micaelense, leaving the main stage empty.
In today’s archly competitive “experience economy” an increasing number of travellers consider music to be their main reason for traveling, rather than just a passive soundtrack when they reach a destination. The chance to take part in unique experiences like Despensas, and encounter unexpected juxtapositions around every corner, is a key differentiator for musically-minded tourists when choosing where to spend their precious time. Tremor is gathering a global fanbase by being very different, and being great at it.

"In Rural Pennsylvania, A Runaway Coal Fire Spawns High(way) Art",www.forbes.com,Eric Adams,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericadams/2019/05/27/road-trippy-in-rural-pennsylvania-a-runaway-coal-fire-spawns-highway-art/,"Deep in Pennsylvania, in the heart of coal country, sits the remnants a town destroyed by fire—though not a single structure ever saw a flicker of flame. Centralia, once a quintessential slice of rural America, with a main street, hundreds of buildings, and a population of nearly 2,000, has baked quietly for nearly 60 years, victim of an underground coal fire that spewed toxic gasses and opened up ghastly fissures in the ground. The blaze began in 1962—57 years ago today, to be precise—when a controlled burn at a landfill above a labyrinth of abandoned coal mine tunnels leached into the underground network. This sparked a subterranean blaze that couldn't be extinguished despite multiple expensive efforts over several decades. Eventually, the town was abandoned. All that remains today are the roads, a few empty structures, and two or three homes that remain occupied. Scientists estimate that the fire can persist for another 250 years, though at the moment it's hard to tell anything is truly amiss. No odor, no actively smoking scars.
But from these figurative—if not literal—ashes has also emerged something startlingly gorgeous: Graffiti Highway. This nearly mile-long stretch of Pennsylvania Route 61 was closed after fissures opened up in the pavement, and left to rot as a new section of highway arced around it to the south. The empty highway drew the curious, as such things tend to do, as well as the mischievous. When they weren't racing their dirt bikes and quads up and down the sloping, elongated ""S"" or cracking brews open on Saturday night, they were spray-painting graffiti on the pavement. At first, of course, it was ugly—eyesores splattered haphazardly on an even greater eyesore.
Graffiti Highway
@ericadams321 Over time, however, the graffiti became so thorough that it covered every available inch of pavement. Names and telephone numbers, declarations of love or hate, obscure and obvious cultural references—including a nicely executed MTV logo—and, of course, predictable depictions of the obscene or profane, were all rendered in bright colors like signatures on a cast. As with a cast, the signatures and drawings stack up on each other, gradually overlapping until the effect is a singular whole, not a bunch of individual elements. Indeed, if you work too hard to discern the individual tags, it becomes a chaotic, inscrutable mess. It's best to absorb it as a whole, and let the components reveal themselves to you—if they ever do—as you walk.
Fissure on Graffiti Highway, filled with foliage and burnt, rusted metal.
@ericadams321 That, in short, the beauty of Graffiti Highway. Thanks to the persistence of these scofflaws and hooligans, the lonely strip of abandoned highway is now, essentially, a perfect work of spontaneous art. What was once indeed an abject eyesore underscoring an environmental disaster as well as a personal tragedy for thousands of residents is now a surprisingly—and I'm sure arguably—beautiful cultural quilt stretched across the landscape. It has gone over the hump of sparse and ugly to become something that's, frankly, kind of transcendent, thanks to the thoroughness of the execution. Props to Columbia County for letting human nature run its course in Centralia.
Graffiti Highway
@ericadams321 This past Friday evening, the highway saw a steady buzz of activity, with families strolling up and down the road and groups of friends snagging selfies above their favorite tags. Meanwhile, quads and ATVs snaked around them, racing across their colorful drag strip.
Graffiti Highway
@ericadams321 It's rare these days to see something like this emerge so spontaneously and completely, absent any oversight or control and without any formal endorsement. Walking over the berms constructed to block vehicular traffic, I half expected to be charged admission and sold souvenirs. But that didn't happen, and we joined the curious—and mischievous—for our own exploration of this unique and special place.

How Work Placements Can Help Boost Social Mobility,www.forbes.com,Adi Gaskell,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2019/05/27/how-work-placements-can-help-boost-social-mobility/,"Despite a number of attempts to bolster social mobility around the world, the evidence suggests a limited amount of improvement has been achieved. Sadly, for all the rhetoric around the ""American dream,"" the United States doesn't really do any better than other nations around the world. Recent research from New York University suggests that the American dream may be more of a mirage, and the occupational status of American workers reflects that of their parents far more than believed.
“A lot of Americans think the U.S. has more social mobility than other western industrialized countries,” the researchers explain. “This makes it abundantly clear that we have less.”
The data shows the the sons and daughters of high-status parents have many more advantages in the labor market than previous work believed. For instance, roughly 50% of children of workers in top tier occupations now work in occupations of a similar stature. Alternatively, half of the children of parents in bottom tier work also work in occupations of a similar stature.
Overcoming the barriers
The challenge is compounded by the impact the inequality that so often results from poor social mobility has on poorer people. A recent study from Boston College highlights how rising economic inequality makes social mobility even harder. The study reveals that rising economic inequality makes upward mobility feel practically impossible for disadvantaged youths, which in turn results in lower motivation and less productive behaviors.
So what can help? One study advocates education as an obvious first step, with the research revealing a direct connection between expenditure on public education and returns on that investment ranging from lower drop-out rates, higher taxes and general increases in upward mobility.
Education on its own is not enough however, and a recent study explored the impact work experience, and in particular year-long placements, can have on social mobility. The research found that such placements can be hugely influential, especially in securing entry into high-level professional services firms, where social mobility has been most resistant to change in recent years.
Level playing field
Data suggests that students from middle class backgrounds are more likely to take internships, both because they can tap into family social connections and also have greater financial resources to support themselves with during the internship. The researchers wanted to see whether including work placement as part of a degree program helped to level that playing field and give valuable access to students from poorer backgrounds.
Interestingly, the students in such programs were largely judged on their academic potential, with the work placements going to those with most potential rather than those from any particular socio-economic background. What's more, the fact that such placements typically come with a wage attached goes a long way toward helping those from poorer backgrounds from being financially shut out from work experience that often revolves around unpaid internships.
The data is doubly significant because the students were gaining their work experience in the accountancy profession, which has notorious issues with social mobility. What's more, the habit of unpaid internships in the sector merely exacerbates the problem, with interns too often children of either senior partners or key clients. This unfair foot in the door creates a wedge that is difficult for those from poorer backgrounds to clamber over.
The path to success
The students tracked in the research all attended the same university, allowing the researchers to try and draw conclusions that can be used to aid social mobility more widely. Suffice to say, the first step is to lower the barriers that prevent poorer people from attending elite universities in the first place. Equally, it's vital that once they pass that first hurdle, that the students strive to achieve the best grades they can, as this remains a significant factor in securing the best jobs upon graduation.
Aside from this standard advice however, the authors believe their work reinforces the crucial role work placements can play, and that students should give significant time and attention to ensure that they select the right placement for them, and work on their interview skills to ensure they secure the placement.
Universities can play a role in this process by offering suitable support to help students polish their resume and fine tune their interview skills. It should be noted however that a ""build it and they shall come"" approach may not be sufficient, and efforts should be made to ensure all students can participate, even if they do not necessarily feel it's for them.
It perhaps goes without saying that improving access to work placements isn't going to fix social mobility on it's own, but it's perhaps indicative that innovative new education providers, such as Minerva, make placements a central part of their provision. Most of the time, these placements are positioned as a way to ease the transition into work, but as this study reminds us, they might also help us to make improvements in social mobility, which is something we can all get behind."
Pilotless Electric Flying Taxis Are Coming To Singapore,www.forbes.com,Suzanne Rowan Kelleher,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2019/05/27/pilotless-electric-flying-taxis-are-coming-to-singapore/,"Forget Orbit City. George Jetson would be perhaps more at home in Singapore, where air taxis could be a reality by the end of this year. The idea of futuristic flying cabs that carry passengers short distances over urban areas is definitely picking up steam. Dozens of companies — including Boeing, Airbus and Uber — are working on eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) prototypes as a way to alleviate traffic and pollution in congested cities. But it looks like the first company to achieve liftoff with a commercial eVTOL service may be German air-taxi startup Volocopter.
All-electric, zero-emission eVTOLs can hover, take off and land vertically like helicopters, but they are based on drone technology and are much quieter and environmentally friendlier. Volocopter says its pilotless, two-seater aircraft will be capable of traveling just under 19 miles on each charge and, flying at altitudes of 330 feet, will be virtually silent to people at ground level.
Getting the green light from regulators will happen sooner rather than later, says Volocopter co-founder Alex Zosel. “Receiving the commercial license for air taxi aircraft is a question of time not possibility,” says Zosel. “Once regulation comes through on the aviation and city level — and this will be sooner than most think — we will be ready to take off.”
Volocopter has already scheduled inner urban flight tests in Singapore in the second half of 2019 that are supported by the Ministry of Transport (MOT), Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), and Economic Development Board (EDB). These flight tests will be followed by public demo flights.
Once regulators grant approval, there is very little to stop Volocopter from launching a commercial business. The only physical infrastructure required is a network of vertiports, or landing pads for eVTOLs. Last week, Volocopter announced that it is teaming up with UK-based global vertiport operator Skyports to build its first Volo-Port, a flying-taxi station with landing pads, in Singapore.
A Volo-Port is a taxi station with landing pads for Volocopter's eVTOL flying taxis.
Volocopter “Each individual Volo-Port is designed so that it can stand alone or connect to other ports in numerous formations, enabling rapid deployment and scalability. We have analyzed the available spaces and movement dynamics in city centers across the world and recognize that infrastructure is a key enabler for the emerging UAM [urban air mobility] market,” says Duncan Walker, Managing Director of Skyports.
Other companies around the world are also jockeying to enter the flying-taxi airspace. Last October, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg indicated that the aviation company would also have an eVTOL prototype in the air in 2019 and predicted that pilotless rotorcraft will transport people across clogged urban areas within five years. “Think about a future in which you will have three-dimensional highways to relieve traffic congestion,” Muilenburg told Bloomberg TV .
European multinational aerospace corporation Airbus, whose CityAirbus — a four-passenger eVTOL prototype — made its first flight May 3 in Donauwörth, Germany. While the company did not make a formal announcement, Airbus Helicopter's CEO Bruno Even marked the milestone with a congratulatory tweet and a photo of the engineering teams in front of the aircraft.
Meanwhile, Uber’s Elevate team is working on an urban aviation ridesharing product called Uber Air , which it says will begin demo flights next year. Uber plans to launch a commercial service in 2023 where customers can use its app to get a flight on-demand in Dallas and Los Angeles, plus a still-undetermined international market.

‘Fortnite’ Fortbyte #50 Location: Accessible At Night Time Inside Mountain Top Castle Ruins,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/05/27/fortnite-fortbyte-50-location-accessible-at-night-time-inside-mountain-top-castle-ruins/,"A new Fortnite Fortbyte has arrived , and this time, #50 is telling you that it’s accessible at night time inside mountaintop castle ruins. That’s rather specific, and the day/night stipulation might make this harder than most since you need to do it inside a live game rather than just waiting around in Playground, but at the very least, it helps if you know where to wait. Even though Polar Peak is collapsing slowly after being hit by the volcano eruption, that castle is not yet a “ruin,” so that is not where we’re going here. Rather, the castle being referred to is the old spooky castle at Haunted Hills, which was added a few seasons back, but has since crumbled into well, a ruin. And that’s where you’re going to find Fortbyte #50.
This is the castle part on the hill, not in graveyard part below as the clue suggests.
Fortnite
Epic You want to go into the main part of the ruined castle and face the throne with the deer head above it.
Fortnite
Epic The area you are looking for is actually directly opposite from this throne, inside a tiny little hallway in the opposite wall. This is what that looks like.
Fortnite
Epic Then you need to either arrive there at night time, or wait there until night time, and then that’s why Fortbyte #50 will appear. Day/night cycles take maybe….10/15 minutes or so to switch, so if you get there right at daybreak, you may be waiting there a while, and depending on what the storm does, you may be out of luck for a particular game trying to get this piece. Or you could get lucky and get it right away. But don’t stress if it takes you a few tries.
Wait enough time and you will see the piece appear before you like so:
Fortnite
Epic Here’s where this exact location is on the map, but it’s such a precise spot, I’m not sure how much this will actually help. I would use the deer throne as reference, as that’s probably easiest.
Fortnite
Epic Hopefully you can get lucky and snag it right away. Use one of the vampire skins for extra bonus points as they visit their ruined playground. Just kidding this will not actually help you in any way. See you out there in the spooky zone. Please don’t kill me if you see me waiting for the sun to set.

In anticipation for season 5 of the show, Netflix is releasing a Black Mirror mini-series on its Latin America YouTube channel. With episodes dropping on May 26th, June 2nd, and June 6th, the mini-series will feature the inspired takes on Black Mirror from the YouTube community’s own Rudy Mancuso who will direct, score, and star in the episodes. This arrangement may help bridge the worlds of traditional and social media. Advancement in the world of YouTube and advancement in the world of traditional media tend to run on parallel tracks. There are traditional media stars that have built strong followings on YouTube, like Will Smith . There are YouTubers who transition to traditional media, like Lilly Singh . However, for every success story, there are dozens of failed attempts to bridge the gap between these two worlds. The different nature of the two fields makes it difficult to move between them, frustrating YouTubers seeking to break into the industry and studios seeking to popularize their content through social media.
 Little Black Mirror is the result of a synthesis between YouTubers and studios in a way that is beneficial to and maximizes the strengths of both parties. Netflix now has a creator who’s amassed millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram because of his creative social media work managing their latest creative social media campaign. Mancuso is now attached to one of the most popular shows on television (both regular television and streaming services): a major mainstream resume builder. An arrangement like that of Little Black Mirror may provide an alternative for YouTubers struggling to balance their goal of mainstream prominence with the commitment to the online community they have spent years interacting with. YouTubers may be able to become mainstream famous because of social media, not in spite of it, which is what seems to be the case so far.
More than Mancuso, Little Black Mirror is a big win for the company that manages him Shots Studios. The creative studio and talent management firm that has focused on signing popular online content creators represent many of the others involved in Little Black Mirror . In addition to Mancuso, the mini-series will also star Shot Studios’ Lele Pons, Hannah Stocking, Jeff Wittek, Delaney Glazer, Alesso, Anwar Jibawi, and Juanpa Zurita. Little Black Mirror is not the only involvement that Shots Studio has had with Netflix. The company’s CEO and co-founder John Shahidi produced a Netflix original unscripted series about Brazilian pop star Anitta (also managed by Shots Studio) in 2018. Nevertheless, Little Black Mirror will be the first mainstream opportunity for the company’s talent, and the weight of a deal with Netflix may make Shots Studio the destination for social media talent who aspire to mainstream stardom.
Still, Little Black Mirror will be as much a challenge for Mancuso and his social media-based co-stars as an opportunity. Creators like Mancuso, Pons, and Jibawi are former Vine stars who migrated over to YouTube when Vine was ended in 2017 and started to produce the same comedy videos now a bit longer than Vine’s six seconds. Given this history , being in charge of a Black Mirror mini-series, a show known for being long, complex, and dark, might be out of the comfortable creative range of Mancuso and friends. But if it works, Little Black Mirror may be just the middle path needed as online content creators seek to move into the mainstream and traditional media tries to reach social media audiences. Unfortunately, many will not be able to see Little Black Mirror as it will only be available in Latin American countries… but that’s why there’s VPN."
