The Writers Guild of America late Friday told its 15,000-strong membership of television and movie writers to fire their agents after it was unable to convince the majority of Hollywood’s talent agencies to halt practices the union alleges are unethical and illegal.
Taking center stage in the disagreement are the lucrative fees that agents receive from striking side deals with Hollywood studios. However, writers also want agencies to cease their recent efforts to produce their own content. The WGA says both practices are rife with conflicts of interest.
The fees in question are for so-called packaging, which is when an agency bundles various clients such as writers, directors and actors and sells it as a whole to a studio. Typically, when an agency packages talent for a show or a movie, it waives the 10% commission it would otherwise charge its clients. The WGA contends the sometimes high packaging fees collected by agents are to the detriment of writers.
The two sides extended talks about a week ago, giving the industry hope that writers and agents would reach a compromise."

So it invited citizens from across the continent to a frigid North Sea island for what it called the political version of a music festival—a mix of impassioned speeches with comic-book readings, comedy shows and a nail-hammering contest.
With temperatures hovering near freezing, many attendees were fired up mostly about the festival’s outdoor fireplaces. “We’re all a little cold here,” said European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager,..."

Mr. Erdogan’s AKP party conceded defeat in the country’s capital Ankara and a string of other cities after local elections on March 31, a stunning setback for the conservative and pro-Islam powerhouse, which has dominated Turkish politics for the past 17 years.

How will Central America react to a U.S. bully telling the region how it should manage its economic affairs? The left and the media..."

He was upset about the official results for Paris-Roubaix 2018. They listed him as “Did Not Finish.”
He might have been dead last, over an hour behind the winner. He might have been so late that he was technically disqualified. And he might have had to sneak into the velodrome here to cross the line before officials locked it up. But he did finish. That was important to him.
