Let the love of our land's sacred rights

Let friendship and honour unite

No brightness that gloom can e'er clear

Except for 6 and 25 this was very doable for me and I enjoyed it. For EPT I picked the song Shout to the Lord as somewhat of an Easter theme. It was performed by American Idol contestants in 2008
( I think ). Even if one is not religious, you may enjoy this. Many/most have probably already heard it. The video is blurry...sorry. I don't know why. Excuse and maybe indulge me a bit in my choice. I find the song inspirational. My partner used to be a professional singer and guitar player many years ago. He limits his playing now for Sunday church. He does this song better than anyone I have ever heard sing it...of course I'm bias. Lucky me to get a private concert each Sunday morning when he practices for the songs he will be playing and singing in church. Wish I had a link for him singing it, but that is not to be. Hope nobody is offended and some may be inspired, if not by the words, maybe just by how beautiful the music is.
My mom died 10 years ago today, so I am enjoying thinking about her a bit today. I am not a person to do anniversaries of when people die, and often the date passes without me remembering. Maybe a protective mechanism, but this year I am allowing myself to think of her and how lucky I was to have such a remarkable person in my life.

To counteract all the overarching climate and political terrors; I decided to spend the better part of the day in the garden. Such a beautiful, warm, quiet, spring Friday. I weeded the flower beds, cut the grassy bit, and had a good old time carefully cleaning out the pond. This year we have lots of frog tadpoles, and even some newts have come to breed; and the dragonfly larvae are there in great abundance. They are pretty scary. A dog-sized one of those would be terrifying. Our resident robin, who we call Gibb, always comes down and waits for worms then I am weeding and digging. He has lost part of his tail this year, probably in a scrap. He is a territorial little bugger, and I can’t help feeling that he would have voted leave given half a chance; but we like him nonetheless. It was lovely.
The Nipper’s Easter Bonnet parade at nursery went off without a hitch. He looked bemused, but resigned, in the photos. His ma then told me that he deconstructed the hat she had so lovingly created, and gave small bits of decoration to his mates, and the nursery staff; he then bequeathed the bonnet itself to another boy who had taken a shine to it.

The Coalition in fact appear incapable of taking the moral or ethical high road on any issue from border control to climate change unless forced to do so because of circumstances beyond their control.
Shorten has been accused of being a union thug, a sycophant who puts his shoes under billionaires' tables ...and much else.. yet he has maintained his dignity and has lead a cohesive and sold Labor team for six years, while his Coalition opponents have resorted to gutter tactics, lies and smear, while not only losing one prime minister after another, but their most senior front bench Ministers who decided they'd had enough and were getting out while they could still retire on a higher pension than if they remained ...in Opposition."

Who is he? For instance we do know he is an extremely devoted practising Evangelical Pentecostal Christian where the principles of the Prosperity Gospel is at the top of his list of values, hence his constant phrase “ for those who have a go, will get a go”. he fails to acknowledge that for many thousands of Australians who are having a go, is off the back of funding by the taxpayer, for instance many of the Not for Profit Institutions, including the hundreds of evangelical worship centres that keep popping up all around Australia, it is the fasting growing Christian Movement in Australia and America. We know very little about his previous employment history before he became the member for Cook and entered the Parliament. We do know albeit it very sketchy details of his employment with the New Zealand Government as CEO of New Zealand Tourism and Sport where Scott Morrison had his contract terminated about midway into his term by the NZ Government, some of the issues was about inappropriate spend of hundreds of thousands of dollars, not following due process. The Australian Public have a right to know why was he sacked. The next posting Morrison under took was in Australia as CEO of Tourism Australia, again his contract was terminated mid term by the Howard Government. Morrison walked with a huge taxpayer funded payout of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Is Morrison incompetent? or is he using of form of strategy to get fired as a means of creating wealth without actually having to work for it. Remember his big game is the values of The Prosperity Gospel. The Australian Public have a pretty good insight into Bill Shorten work ethics, the moment the Liberals won Government in 2013 they commissioned a Royal Commission into the Union Movement in the hope they could end Bill Shortens political career, that tactic failed. Show Pony SCMO personal integrity needs to have a light shone on it as to his suitability to be the Prime Minister of Australia."

This didn't happen when penalty rates were first introduced in Australia in 1947.
In fact the post war years were historically the biggest in Australian GDP growth, which means, GDP being the amount spent on shit, because of penalty rates and other union won worker entitlements, workers had more money to spend on shit increasing economic activity.
